  "text": "Hi there! I went to a great summer school program this past year (it was online this year sadly) and I really would like to add it to my CV. It is highly relevant to my field, from a well-known program at a great university. \n\nWhere do I add this to my CV? Or do I not add it at all? I was thinking of adding it to a section called \"Academic Activities\" where I also list the journals for which I act as a reviewer. \n\nA little info about me, I am a US-based soon to graduate STEM / qual methods crossover person applying to post-docs and faculty positions in STEM. Thank you for any guidance.",
