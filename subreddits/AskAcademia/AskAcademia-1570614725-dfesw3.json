  "text": "Hi!\n\nI'm a computer engineer, working on a government funded project in a lab and also doing my master's at the same time. However, my advisor just put me on the project as a PhD candidate. When I asked him why, he told me that everything stays the same, it's just for funding. \n\nNow, what do you guys think about it? It sounded strange to me, honestly. Do you think I'd have any implications?\n\nThanks!",

Grants are generally stronger when they can name the student who will do the PhD work; so, yes, it increases the chances of funding. But, if you're already there and will likely do a PhD, it is certainly most appropriate to list you as the one who will be that student. It also is a vote of confidence from your advisor that they trust your work/future well enough to name you in their proposal as the student who will participate.",

But, it's impossible to write a proposal, have it awarded many months later, and then get the money and have everything play out the way you anticipated. So there always is some wiggle room to adjust how the money awarded is used to reach the goals of the proposal. Additionally, in my experience, program officers have no problem with student money being moved between different types of students. If the PI tried to move money from student pay to faculty pay, however, that would raise eye brows and likely not be allowed. \n\nOP should ask questions, but from what they've said I don't see anything that makes be suspicious yet.",

There's nothing in this post that actually suggests anything is outright wrong, instead it seems likely the student is slightly misunderstanding the nature of the grant.\n\nFrom other comments, it seems like this student is *planning on* getting a Ph.D. and their advisor is submitting a grant that would fund that plan. **That's entirely normal**. \n\nNow, if the advisor is listing them as a *current Ph.D. candidate* in order to *qualify* for the grant, then that is wrong; but, there's nothing said here that suggests that is the case (yet).",
