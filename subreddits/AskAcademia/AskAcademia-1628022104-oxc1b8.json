  "text": "I'm considering applying for a Smithsonian postdoc fellowship which will start next year. I've already found mentors. But the fellowships last only 1 year, though there is an option to put in an application for a second year. My question is, has anyone segued into a more permanent job there? Any tips/recommendations on how to swing that? How much are research scientists there paid? And is it a good option, as in are there any things I should be concerned about? Would like to know thoughts.",

      "text": "There's a pretty wide range of postdocs at the Smithsonian, so without knowing the exact opportunity, it's hard to answer.  In my field, the PDs are usually about 50-60k with 3-5k in research stipend. Everyone I've known who has held a Smithsonian PD in my field has gone on to permanent positions elsewhere. In that sense, it's a lot like most other PD fellowships in that you usually don't go PD -> permanent at the same institution.\n\nSo really, I would ask the scientist you're planning on working with. The Smithsonian can be difficult to plan long-term at because of the restrictions on federal grant applications, meaning that a PI choosing to extend someone's contract can be complicated. But they are generally extremely good fellowships as the research environment is typically fertile. Might depend a bit on field, but some of the best researchers I've worked with did a stint at the Smithsonian.",

          "text": "So those people you know who went on to permanent positions - were they in academia or government/other? Just curious. Smithsonian is exclusively research-intensive, which is different from other PDs elsewhere, where some teaching/mentoring experience is thrown in which academia also looks at.",

              "text": "A mix, mostly academic, but some permanent federal positions or industry data science jobs.\n\nIn my field, it\u2019s not uncommon for there to be teaching in a postdoc, but it\u2019s not super common either. So there isn\u2019t an expectation in my field for an extensive teaching portfolio when applying for professorships. But I also know a fair number of people who did supervise either undergraduate researchers at Smithsonian or supervised visiting grad students from other universities. So if you\u2019re really interested in that kind of experience, discuss it with the supervisor before you apply.",
