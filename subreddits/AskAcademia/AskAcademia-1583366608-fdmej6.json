I need to make the final submission of a paper for a big conference in the US this summer (2000+ attendees). Thinking about withdrawing it instead.

      "text": "heading to a small, mostly domestic conference (that happens to be only 40 minutes drive from my home) on Monday. Haven't seen any email updates about it from the organization, so we will see I guess.  I've got a student who has worked so hard on her first ever oral presentation, and this is the perfect conference for her to get her feet wet, and she is going to kick serious ass, so I hope it happens! \n\nI'm crossing my fingers that a small-ish but international (and highly specialized) conference that is happening in Honolulu in late June is going to actually happen.  We were planning an extra week on the island, so serious fingers crossed!",

A smaller, local conference could be fine because the costs will be much lower and you could potentially avoid them entirely (assuming they gave refunds for the registration fee) if they cancelled before you left.\n\nBut even small events are being cancelled. Our weekly open night in the department has been cancelled, and that only sees ~200 people. People are just afraid that the illness has already taken hold in communities and we just haven't done the tests for it yet, and that by travelling or gathering in large groups, it'll kick off a massive cluster.\n\nWhether that fear is unfounded or not... I don't know. Most young people will be fine even if they do get infected, but our communities have a lot of old dudes in them. Feels like half the department is >50 years old. And universities with on-campus housing are very insular and disease spreads fast, like in daycares and primary schools.",

Chances are that the situation is much better then (especially when flu season ends) and the conference will happen normally. If they cancel the conference they most likely will also reimburse you, while cancelling might result in a fee for you. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with traveling that is of course also fair, but again I would suggest waiting how the situation evolves.  \nMost travel bans or recommendations I heard of currently end in April (Easter holidays), so the current plan would be to allow travel in summer.",
