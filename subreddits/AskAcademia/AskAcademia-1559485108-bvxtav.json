  "text": "Would anyone be interested in being research \"penpals\"? I'm working on finishing up my undergrad thesis before I move for my PhD program next month. I think it would be helpful to have a sort of \"penpal\" to help keep me accountable, and of course I would do the same in return. We could just chat once a week or so and update each other on what we've accomplished this week. I wouldn't mind looking at your writing to give my opinion either, and do some light editing. My field is clinical psych, but I think it would be cool to hear about research from another area too!",
