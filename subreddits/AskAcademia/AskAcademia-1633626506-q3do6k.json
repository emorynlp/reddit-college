      "text": "So a lot of the answers here are \"competition\" but the situations in which I have seen toxicity are generally not about people stabbing each other in the back or being resentful over the jobs or opportunities of others. The truly toxic people are usually those who don't have any direct competition, can get away with behavior that would get them in trouble in a different environment, and often have long-set grievances that may have nothing to do with the academic environment directly (e.g., their now-deceased parents didn't respect them enough) but somehow get expressed well in it.\n\nMy own experience is that among professors there is a fair percentage of unchecked narcissists. I don't know if the absolute percentage of narcissists is higher than baseline (I could imagine why the academic selection system would favor narcissists, but this is just a pet theory), but I do think that they are more unchecked than you'd get at a lot of places. Even without tenure there is a high tolerance of awful behavior towards colleagues if your research is good, and certainly tenure can insulate people. I suspect you also get knock-off effects by what gets normalized at the \"top\" of fields and institutions; it is clear that some disciplines consider being nasty and aggressive to be a sign of \"brilliance\" and it is rewarded rather than shunned. \n\nI don't particularly think it is about there being too much competition or too little resources. My sense is that academia could be pretty toxic even before those kinds of conditions existed. The most toxic places I have seen have been those that are very close to the \"top,\" where resources are relatively abundant and nobody is competing in a serious way anymore.\n\nTo put it another way, in my experience, competition does lead to anxiety and that obviously can lead to some minor bad behavior and resentment. Certainly people who are actively on the job market and stressed about it can be ungenerous and difficult to be around, especially if they see their immediate peers doing well. I certainly was; I tried to just isolate myself from others when I felt particularly gloomy, because I had seen how some good colleagues who had a few months in which they temporarily unbearable when they were in that situation, but then they came out of it when they got a better sense of what their future might look like, even if it was just temporary (it's the uncertainty that is the anxiety-producer, that lack of control). But that kind of anxiety is not what I associate with \"toxicity\" \u2014 the toxic people are the people who have the solid jobs already, in my experience, but are bitter about the institution (for reasons justified or not), their colleagues (ditto), or their unattained goals (which may or may not be reasonable). More importantly, they are enabled to act on this bitterness, because their behavior is essentially unchecked.\n\nI would just note that this is one of those \"be the change you want in the world\" sorts of situations as well. I try to do a lot to be non-toxic, to be the very opposite of it. In some departments, the toxicity is just the defining aspect of it, and it self-perpetuates in terms of who they hire and how they act, but in some the toxicity can be isolated and minimized. Cultures can change, though. I have been sometimes impressed by the power of small attempts to improve things \u2014 even with regards to the toxic people themselves, who are used to their toxicity being reflected back at them in some way, and are sometimes quite disarmed by unexpected kindness as a result (your mileage may vary).",

It\u2019s sad that a change isn\u2019t encouraged and the academic world continues to support this behavior.

          "text": "I think this is spot on. \nI will say in disciplines like mine (immunology) I can see a clear difference between older PIs (more narcissistic tendencies, work all students and postdocs to the bone) and new PIs (focused on getting specific things done then going home, looking for collaborations with other researchers, focus on efficiency of time spent in lab rather than how long you sit at you bench).\n\nI think part of that is older PIs came up in an environment where techniques weren\u2019t so specialized. Most of the work you published, even in top-tier journals could be done by one person in one lab. Now there is a lot more use of core facilities or collaborations for much more complicated techniques. This requires playing well with others that some of the toxic PIs don\u2019t do. I witnessed this first hand when my first post-doc PI was so hard to work with that other people refused to work with them and they had no fruitful collaborations that lasted. I move to a new PI\u2019s lab at another university who had been much more successful. They were open to all new collaborations but told me to come talk to them before reaching out because they had a strict \u201cno asshole\u201d policy for collaborations. \n\nTLDR: I think the current environment that requires collaboration for impactful science is slowly weeding out toxic PIs in the new generation.",

The older doctors learned and practiced in a toxic culture of power trips, little respect for non-physicians, and low patient autonomy. They assume that it has to be that way to practice effective medicine. You can definitely see how that\u2019s affected some older physicians who think it\u2019s perfectly normal to curse out nurses in the middle of a nurses station or have temper tantrums in an OR. And God forbid you try to talk to them one-on-one about a patient if you\u2019re not another doctor. But I\u2019ve noticed that the newer doctors are much more collaborative with staff and don\u2019t hold on so tight to hierarchical relationship. I think it makes for a much better experience for both the patients and the staff. And whadayaknow, apparently you can practice medicine without all of that toxicity and machismo just fine.",

In most top universities you won't get too far being at the front of class- it comes down to your research. \n\nIn research to succeed you need papers (as first author, and then later in your career last author), and grant income as principle investigator.These are highly competitive. You're competing not just with other groups for grants and to get in top journals, but also your own colleagues for the positions as authors and to lead on grants. You have to work incredibly hard and get told no (rejected) a lot, especially early on. There's no room for sentiment. Sharing does you no favours- it's all about you . Hardly surprising this favours the driven,  selfish, tenacious and sometimes downright vicious. Universities then promote those with the best of these characteristics.",

MDs can do postdocs, but it's not very useful for them unless they are MD-PHDs that want to have their own pre-clinical labs. And even then.\n\nA clinical fellowship is for a doctor who has graduated their residency, has their board certification, can see patients independently, but there are no jobs for them. The fellow gets paid a fifth of what they are worth, doing everything a real doctor does, with minimal to no supervision.\n\nUsually there is a pretense that a special technique is being taught to justify the abuse, but people who get hired right out of residency learn this on the job by themselves without having to go through a fellowship, so it's a very thin veneer.\n\nIn the case of the postdoc, the postdoc's salary is paid by the grant of the PI. Without that grant, the postdoc could not sustain their own funding. The clinical fellow's salary is generated by the patients they see and treat, which generates \\~5x as much funding as they cost the hosting institution.\n\nClinical fellowships are common in every market in which there is an over-supply of medical graduates with nowhere to go. They would rather get into a holding pattern and wait for a job to open up than give up medicine after 10 years of post-secondary school and with no transferrable skills.\n\nSo, fellowships are very much like postdocs, but not the same, even if \"fellowship\" is in the title of the postdoc. For one, you call someone in a clinical fellowship a \"fellow\" - that's their title, vs you call people in postdocs, well, \"postdocs\".",

It might be for some, and I see further down that it was the case for someone you know well, but I have a lot of physician friends and nobody I know is in this situation. \n\nThose of us who are doing fellowships are doing them because we want to, in order to train in additional skills. While some do it because they \u201chave to\u201d in order to get the job they want, everyone I know who has/is doing fellowship learned skills that they never would have acquired from residency. Many fellowships confer sub specialty board certification which is appropriately required in order to get a job in that field - you wouldn\u2019t be qualified to do it without the additional training. \n\nSo while yes, I could have gone straight in to practice and seen general urology patients, I\u2019m much more interested in cancer surgery so I chose to take extra time to train in that specifically, and yes at a significant pay cut but for me and my future patients it\u2019s well worth it. Other examples from close friends include several additional years of training to run an ICU (general medicine does not get you even close to ready to do that independently), training in cardiology (again, general medicine doesn\u2019t get you close), several different surgical sub specialties, etc. \n\nMy 2 cents as someone living through this right now.

It's all about that power structure and the way they perceive it. They don't really treat you like a person if you don't have a fancy degree attached to your name. I've been told to my face that my job is \"not that hard\" on several occasions. It was only after I left the job and talked to some other people in similar situations that I realized that I was doing the job of at least 2 people (on top of research), and that I was being milked for what I can do. I can confirm this because after I left that lab, my PI hired 2 managers to replace one of me.  \nAs a grad student now, I think it highly depends on what lab you join and the environment your lab cultivates. So far, I've been pretty lucky. Not that there's no pressure, there definitely is. But I can definitely appreciate my lab for how it's run and people's attitudes. It's far better. People are honest. I think having a good PI sets the standard.",

These issues are not unique to academia, but I think are more widespread than generally acknowledged.",

We have a tiny percentage of winners, selected by funding agencies, who become PIs and hire people whose work is effectively credited to the PIs, who are the only people with a chance of getting more and more and more of the scarce funding. That kind of feudalism isn't a \\*necessary\\* state of affairs at all in my broad line of research - we could have ten times the number of independent researchers \\*free\\* to collaborate, rather than the academic oligarchy. And who gets to be a winner is based on the funders' perceptions and politicking - they can't know who's a good scientist based on a proposal that we all know is written by other people and a shiny presentation that's one big halo effect fallacy.\n\nEverywhere has some kind of hierarchy and corruption, sure, but academia has that \\*very\\* weird system and there's almost no corrective mechanism, since there's definitely no real competition once the new ruling class members have been selected (since how can anyone else compete?). It's tailor-made to create bad research, bullying and intimidation, and overwork as people are forced to join a rat-race - even if it's highly questionable it'll do them any good. The idealism of a lot of people who love science and will put up with far too much sacrifice for far too long feeds that machine with cannon fodder losers who don't know better.\n\nI think it's very good people are looking elsewhere, for them but it also seems to be driving some change.

      "text": "Academia is toxic, but it is 100 fold worse in the USA. I've worked in many labs for many different PI's. Some of them did their PhD's or post docs in the US (I live in Canada) and the common opinion was \"I will never return there in my life ever, or at least not for an academic career\".\n\nThis is primarily due to competition. You have hundreds of PhD/postdocs waiting to apply for that one non TT opening in the middle of bum fuck nowhere and they will do anything possible to get it. My PI's have seen people purposely hide other people's stuff, destroy samples, delete files, etc. just to set back their peers by a few days and possibly graduate before them and have one less person to worry about when they apply.\n\nAnd this is just at the \"entry to an academic career\" phase. The toxicity continues once you do land an academic job as everyone at the end of the day is fighting to win the lottery of getting the last few near extinction TT or tenure professor jobs.",

      "text": "People on the autistic spectrum are more likely to enrol in STEM, and I've read that at the graduate level it can be more than half the student body in some places (source on that last part: my dodgy memory.  I can't find the article atm so take it with a block of salt).  Don't take that as a critique of people on the spectrum, because frankly most of the people I know in that situation are really cool and frankly seem to have better social lives than I do.  But it does mean a larger pool of individuals in general who just might not do well with empathy or social interaction overall.\n\nI'm not in STEM, so not facing the same degree of toxicity that I read about in this sub.  But what I do encounter from time to time are cartoonish snobs of the nose-snort-laugh variety who've never really been off the high school-> undergrad -> grad conveyer belt.  They're nerds who were bullied growing up, and as is too often the case became bullies themselves.  Once they got to university it was a consistent state of being rewarded, and they never really had to hit the \"serious self reflection\" point.  Others are just children of privilege, insecure people who handle it poorly, or yes, narcissists (though I've largely been spared them).\n\nI was actually pretty surprised when I originally got to graduate school that it seemed to be a step *back* in maturity compared to what I was used to.  More sniping, gossip, moral panics after someone said \\[oblivious thing\\], it felt like high school al over again. Fortunately most of those people seemed to get weeded out after masters.",
