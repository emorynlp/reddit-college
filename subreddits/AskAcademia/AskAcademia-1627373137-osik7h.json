  "text": "I did my Master's thesis with my PI at my home  university and just graduated. The work was almost completed and I'm  staying back for a few months to finish it.\n\nMy PI wrote a grant based on my work with him and got it and offered  me a PhD position. I declined due to ethical issues of where the money  comes from. \n\nHe eventually found another student but offered me a position for the  summer to finish up our work together. As I had already got decent  results, our next task was to write up the paper.\n\nHowever, the summer was not at all what I expected. Since the new PhD  student (let's call them Anri) joined, my PI goes out of his way to  diminish my contributions during meetings: \n\n1. He tells Anri that he will submit Anri's work (my work with the PI)  to a top conference so that can be their first paper ( while I am in a meeting with both of them)\n\n2. He asks Anri to overwrite the methods section I conceptualized whenever we have a disagreement during a meeting.\n\n2. He attempts to suggest Anri as co- first-author. Anri's main contribution is helping me write the paper in the last 2 months.\n\n3. He has now asked Anri to copy code off my repository and upload  it to the lab's repository. Anri hasn't written a single line of code.  And now Anri is the code maintainer while I am a contributer to  something I have written all the code for.\n\nWhile I have no qualms about Anri learning about and furthering our  project later in the future, I think my advisor goes out of his way to  use Anri as a scapegoat and pit us against each other. If he hears of us  collaborating, he gets weird during the meetings.\n\nI am leaving soon, yet don't know how to deal with this. So far I  have sucked it up and tried to be the bigger person, but now I fear he  will not write me a good LoR either.",

      "text": "I'm really sorry to hear this. It's no consolation but you can only be responsible for your behaviour and there's little you can do about someone who is deliberately behaving badly. You could try and talk to them, raise it as \"I've noticed you've raised a number of concerns about my ideas in team meeting, I was wondering if we could discuss them to ensure we're on the same page\". I suspect your PI is too petty to have a constructive conversation but they might. You may also need to ask them if they're still happy to write you a LoR - again frame it openly and not as an accusation. Lastly, is there another person from your department/course who could provide a LoR? You might want to sound them out. Good luck.",

      "text": "You're leaving soon and you want first authorship and a good LOR.\n\nSo, be pleasant and non-controversial with your PI. Keep a record of what you have done in the lab just in case your PI decides to take you off the paper. When the paper comes out, insist on first authorship.\n\nThe LOR is trickier if your PI is angry (and took it personally) that you turned down the PhD position because of ethical issues.  Also, if you have problems with authorship of the paper it can be a problem for the LOR. When it's time for a LOR, contact the PI, chat him up a bit, and then ask if he will write you a strong letter. If you get a very good feeling about the LOR being very positive, progress with the LOR; if not, then I'd suggest you don't progress with the letter. I think it's more important to have a strong letter from other professors than one from your PI that is weak, or worse, negative.",
