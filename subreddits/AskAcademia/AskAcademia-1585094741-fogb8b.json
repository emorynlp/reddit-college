  "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy anxiety know no bounds these days and I am worrying about everything. Recently my department chair sent out a Covid-19 email briefing (they happen every few days and cover a wide range of relevant topics). It was mentioned how Covid-19 is costing my school a lot of money ( of course) and that different plans and ideas were being created to offset this. I started to think about my stipend and if it could possibly be affected. I know many people who thought they had secure jobs, and they were recently let go. I started wondering if my job was as safe as I once thought.\n\nI'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student who was told I have 6 years of a university fellowship that gets paid as a monthly stipend. As of right now, we have been told that our stipend won't be affected by Covid-19, but I can't help but worry.\n\nIs there any precedent where universities let Ph.D. students go during financial hardships? Has anyone in a similar situation been told any information regarding their stipends? What do you guys think?",

For example, my school is building a new school of business and the corona virus won\u2019t stop construction because the money has already been allocated for the project. I might be worried in a few months when the new fiscal year starts, but even then I\u2019d be shocked if they cut those corners by taking the little money they give to PhD students away. I feel you though, scary times, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much, at least as much as you can help.",

It ends up way cheaper for the university.",

On top of costing less on a grant, they come with complementary skill sets to share with the lab and almost always get up to speed on new skills/tasks faster than predoctoral students. That's not a slight on predocs; after all, they have other things going on (e.g., classes).",

I doubt that they would save by cutting from RA/TA stipends. What is likely is that they are looking at the situation 2-3, even 5 years from now and how future research budgets may get affected. And that is a valid concern. They may instruct PIs to use their funds as conservatively as possible, which means limited number of students/post-doc intake in near future.",
