Use it to help you understand how your colleagues in other fields do things.\n\nBasically, STEM people, please stop being so goddamned self-centered / self-involved. At least *try* to acknowledge the variation across academia outside of your little worlds.\n\n**Minor edit:** Yes, I pitched this at STEM folks. I have rarely seen posts from folks here generalizing practices from the humanities or social sciences across all of academia. It seems to be a STEM thing, at least in this sub.

Similarly in discussion I take PI/advisor/supervisor to be slightly different jargon for the same thing.

              "text": "It's truly different. Humanities fields I've tracked or am in have three basic categories of postdoc: truly prestigious, good stopgap, and glorified adjunct.\n\nThe first is what it sounds like. If you are accepted into the Harvard Society of Fellows or another top-tier postdoc (which is essentially well-supported research time with minimal or no teaching), you might well delay starting a TT position you've also been offered.\n\nThe second is kind of mixed, and more like how I think physical/biomedical/empirical social science postdocs work (from watching my partner's peers; she's in neuroscience). At its best, it's a clear stepping stone that helps you broaden or deepen your research profile while also teaching a couple courses directly in your area of expertise. At its worst, it's a stopgap with no clear next step ahead of it, just more market cycling.\n\nThe third is a category that seems more like how bad empirical science postdocs function, except for \"slaving away on somebody else's project with no first-author pubs to show for it\" substitute \"teaching an unreasonably high course load, which is for some reason being called a fellowship but actually is a mechanism for ensuring coverage on that department's part.\"\n\nThe last of the three seems like it sucks. I see them advertised sometimes, and always wonder who ends up doing them and what happens next for those people. Maybe it's less exploitative than it looks from where I'm standing?\n\nThe second strikes me as basically reasonable, and a good get for anyone who's able to convert the reduced teaching load and moderately supportive atmosphere into pubs. I think there's something demoralizing about it, though, since I've known a few people who cycled between these and VAPs without ever quite breaking out.\n\nThe first, obviously, is terrific: comparable with a postdoc at an absolutely first-rate lab, but with more time for your own work and pay rivaling or exceeding assistant professors at many institutions (so my impression has been from friends fortunate enough to have these).\n\nAll that said, though, the overwhelming majority of humanities people I knew in and around grad school all either got TT jobs straight out of the PhD or else didn't get TT jobs at all (and that's ranging widely in institution type, from prestigious R1s to parochial colleges you might not have heard of). That's in a few different disciplines.",

      "text": "As many other people have said, this is more an issue that arises because often posters don't give enough details in their original posts for other redditors to know if their personal experiences apply to the OP (and pushing the use of flair or more standard formatting of post titles could easily address this), but they do want to help so they pass on the only experience they have, which is their own.\n\nFor a simple (and less heated, here at least) example, we occasionally get people here talking about getting a pet and asking for advice on making that fit in with their workload/schedule. Now I might want to give some advice, and so I will tell them my experiences having a dog. But if it turns out they are actually getting a macaw, well my advice is essentially meaningless, not to mention I know nothing about keeping birds. Had they mentioned their macaw in their OP, I'd have either refrained from commenting, or at least included many caveats in my response. But it would be very harsh for someone to have a go at me for doing my best to help someone based on the knowledge and experience I have just because it doesn't exactly fit a very specific situation.\n\nYour perception of how frequently this is done by STEM redditors I would wager is due to 1) There being a slight STEM majority (at least in terms of post frequency) here and 2) a sensitivity, as a humanities academic, each time you see it done by a STEM academic, as I doubt it rankles you quite as much as when an arts/humanities poster does the same thing. Similarly, I could complain that so many people address issues here from a very US-centric viewpoint. Or I could accept that the majority of redditors here are from the US, and that they are doing their best to be helpful. I personally choose the latter. Otherwise I might disagree with you that advisor is a good general term, since that is the more common North American spelling, as opposed to adviser. But life is short and such things don't actually matter, so I just take them in my stride.\n\nAs for using this sub to learn about how other disciplines do things; I'm not saying I'm not interested in how other fields work, but given the diversity between fields/countries/agencies etc. there is no way one would be able to know everything about how everyone's disciplines worked. Nor should we be really be expected to. It also doesn't seem like a great use of time and/or brain power.\n\n\nAnd finally, I have to say, your tone here is very rude. It may be borne from frustration, but one of the great things about writing a text post is that it gives you the time to read through what you write before you post, and consider if you are making sweeping condemnations based on (IMHO) somewhat petty grievances. \nFor the most part I consider this quite a supportive subreddit (obvious exceptions being when undergrads ask for help getting out of trouble for deliberate academic dishonesty and similar) and most people posting asking for help/advice get it. Instead of getting your knickers in a twist about people sometimes giving advice that only applies to their specific field community, you could try appreciating the fact that the community here is so ready to help one another out.

We all have intellectually demanding jobs and from my perspective at the very least I'd rather save room in my brain for new physics than filling it with details of how field work grant applications work in the biological sciences (for example).\n\nThirdly, given the broad scope of practices between different fields/institutions/countries, trying to get a decent overview of everything seems like a fools errand. I'm always interested in the differences that do exist, but I'm not going to dedicate time to learning the details of all of them (and we're hardly going to get a terribly coherent study guide just from people's posts here). Instead I'll just consider whether I have anything experience/common sense based to ass to such posts and then comment/move along accordingly.\n\nAnd finally, to address your issue with different words signifying different things. Again, I raise the point that there are so many differences between fields/institutions/countries that intensive study here is by no means guaranteed to aid cohesion at one's own institution. And as for misunderstandings here- well, in my experience at least, it isn't that difficult to use context clues to figure out what people mean if they use a slightly different term to apply to their supervisor/PI/advisor, or if they use a region specific term. The worst misunderstanding I've had here is someone using the term RA to describe a grad-student level research assistant, whilst in the UK RA is often used to refer to postdoctoral research assistants, which is also used interchangeably with postdoctoral research associates.

While you are of course free to refuse to use the sub as a space of learning, that is a pointlessly unethical decision.\n\nThough phrased in a needlessly combative way, OP's basic, appropriate point was that engaging in this sub simply *works better* when people do so with an ear for learning about disciplinary differences, rather than simply universalizing their experiences.

My suspicion is that reddit is particularly toxic because people come here to complain in a way they wouldn't in real life.\n\n- It also seems particularly crummy of you to tell someone not to use the word PI when a PI literally isn't always someone's advisor, and I specifically remember many posts lamenting the tensions because of this.\n\n- Asking a question doesn't make you self involved, it makes you an asshole for telling people to go away.

I wanted to ask something like how an advisor can make sure to not pressure their research students too much (nor too little), because my advisor is worried about that (torn between wanting to treat us well and wanting us to work hard), but now I am not sure if even that is an appropriate post for this or any subreddit. \n\nBTW when I write advisor some people, e.g. in the UK, get confused because for them that's supervisor, so advisor also isn't a completely general term. \n\nAnyway, it seems a rule to state the field and country in the question details would solve this, but it would also chase away people who want to stay completely anonymous and unrecognizable. Oh, and to make things even more complicated, some fields, such as your (archaeology), are STEM in some places (such as at my institution) but very much not so in the others.",

And if not they could omit whatever information they feel necessary and explain in their post their desire for anonymity hence the lack of information. In which case of course they would then expect to perhaps get a mix of relevant/irrelevant advice, and have to make their peace with it.\n\nOf course I'd have thought it would make sense for all of us to just in general expect a mix of advice and make peace with that, but here we are...",
