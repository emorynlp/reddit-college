  "title:": "How/When should I disclose my disability?",
  "text": "*Throwaway for reasons that are about to be pretty obvious*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you have schizophrenia or another highly-stigmatised condition, how do you manage to keep it private/secret while also getting accommodations that are actually useful for you in the workplace?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was diagnosed with schizophrenia back in early 2014 and in a few months, I'll be starting my PhD (in a non-lab STEM field), supported by the Gates-Cambridge scholarship. I honestly never planned to get this far, and now I'm lost when it comes to navigating the whole disability thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did disclose my condition in my university application where they asked about disabilities, and I've submitted all of my paperwork to the disability office, but I'm not sure just how that information moves around. I know the department and college are informed (in case they need to offer e.g. access accommodations), but I don't know if they see the word \"schizophrenia\" or not. I don't know if my supervisor knows. I also have no idea if Gates knows about my condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can operate pretty normally 95+% of the time, it's just the occasional thing I need some flexibility on. Sharing an office with over 10 people won't be a good idea, for example. The intensive 4-day hiking and kayaking trip that the new Gates scholars have to do isn't going to be feasible either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't know how much people already know, or if I should disclose it, or who I should disclose it to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked my medical team but they just told me to ask the disability services at my current university. I asked disability services but they told me to ask my medical team. Basically, people with schizophrenia just drop out of university, so no one has any advice on how to manage this well. The disability accommodations you can get tend to be very limited and are really focussed on undergrad stuff like exams and note-taking, which I don't need or want. If I mention my condition, they just kinda look dumbfounded and then shove note-taking services in my face.",

(If you're expecting American-style student wellness infrastructure, you'll be sorely disappointed.) \n\nI would consult with your medical team again. (\"My university wasn't very helpful. I'd really appreciate some best practices if you have any.\") Maybe they could draw up a simple list of things they'd recommend (\"Quiet study space\") on doctor office letterhead and you can provide that to supervisors or whoever.\n\nAnd reach out to the disabilities office and ask them what specifically they will be able to offer you insofar as remedial assistance. Although I assume their help is pretty much restricted to extra exam time, note-taking assistance, and the like.\n\nThe people you'll be interacting with most will mean well. Cambridge is full of lovely people. But the infrastructure isn't always where you'd expect or hope it would be in terms of support. The concept of self-study sort of permeates everything: you're smart enough to get in, and they expect you to be smart enough to solve most your problems yourself (which obviously isn't feasible or realistic in every context).\n\nP.s. Which college? They each have varying levels of facilities -- with more or less space in the libraries depending on which you've landed in.",

          "text": ">If you're expecting American-style student wellness infrastructure, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nNot American, but from what I've read, the systems at Cambridge are actually better than the ones I'm used to. But my supervisor is from the US and is very open about supporting students like myself, so I'm not too concerned that they'd react awfully. I definitely won't be leading any conversations with the schizo bombshell, though. I know to let people form their opinion of me first and *then* disclose the condition, and I waited 3 years to tell my undergrad supervisor. But I'm worried that there's no good guidance on how to disclose stuff beyond the ADHD/depression level, even from disability services or my mental health team. I'm just trying to figure it out for myself and hope I don't make a massive blunder along the way.\n\n>I would consult with your medical team again.\n\nI have asked them repeatedly, but it eventually got to the stage where they said that they had no idea how to manage it, and that they thought I should drop out and move into a group home. The stigma is exceptional for schizophrenia, and for some good reasons. They've never had a patient who's lived wholly independently. And I had to do quite a lot of shopping around before I settled on the team I have.\n\n>And reach out to the disabilities office and ask them what specifically they will be able to offer you insofar as remedial assistance.\n\nI'm not really sure how to go about this one, if you don't mind. I already contacted them and they already provided me with the list of possible accommodations, but none are appropriate. Basically, I just need the space to decompress and be alone for a few hours a day, but I'm not sure how that could be worded into a concrete accommodation. They can maybe give me something for an office (still unofficially), but that won't apply to these lengthy trips the Gates scholars take. \n\n>The concept of self-study sort of permeates everything: you're smart enough to get in, and they expect you to be smart enough to solve most your problems yourself\n\nOh, I'm fine for the learning aspect of things. I completed my degree in the normal timeframe and handed every assignment in on-time. I don't \"lead\" with my condition because I've honestly never needed to explain away any gaps or poor performances, and aside from the disclosure, I don't mention any kind of disability in any applications for anything. I figure things out for myself mostly, but I doubt I've ever met another person in my situation. There's loads of resources on how to manage depression and higher education, but really nothing for schizophrenia, and disability support workers will suggest things to people with depression, but they generally have no idea what to do for me. It'd be useful to know what accommodations have helped people with similar conditions. ",

I've also worked inpatient and seen plenty on the more serious side of things, but there definitely are folks with a schizophrenia diagnosis that can live independently, have jobs, and all the rest. \n\nIs it possible for you to find an additional talk therapist to speak with about coping skills and stress management? This is what I did for a few patients (clients, technically) who had these histories, and a weekly meeting can make a world of difference, even just to have another safety net if things start to be overwhelming. If you shop around and you can probably find someone who has experience working with bipolar, schizophrenia, or other dx's that require solid med management on top of talk therapy.\n\nI'm in the US and don't know as much about the UK and their services, but there must be a talk therapist (psychologist, psychotherapist, not sure their terms) out there that would be a good match.",

That was probably their first interaction with someone with schizophrenia, so I can understand why they might be apprehensive about anyone with the condition. If I disclose my condition openly, my name becomes attached to that other person and what they did. \n\nPeople who aren't properly in-touch with reality scare others. Even if we're not violent (which most aren't, even when threatened), it's an unknown that few people are trained to deal with. Most academics have absolutely no idea how they should behave if a student seems to be hallucinating. Any university website has *heaps* of resources explaining depression and anxiety and how to manage both, but disorders with psychosis rarely get more than a couple of sentences. And it's partly because a lot of people with those conditions do drop out and so the universities have never had to work around it. \n\nI think a lot of stigma is based on fear. I don't hate people for being afraid of me any more than I'd hate a dog that nips when it's cornered. ",

I never had problems handing work in on time or keeping up with the lectures, so most of the available accommodations were just worthless.

I manage it fine on my own, it just helps me to manage things if I have e.g. a quiet work environment.

I really need lots of sleep and sometimes it's hard to get to sleep early enough, so I try to keep my morning schedule clear. I do *insanely* better if I start at 10am instead of 9. But I never had much of a problem with that because I've never had a class with mandatory attendance, so I just didn't go to the few 8am lectures I had. \n\nSitting exams in a separate room helped too, I think, but I did that from my first semester, so I have nothing to compare it to. \n\n>High functioning schizophrenics I infer are not often open about such things.\n\nWell, my diagnosis isn't public, so I imagine others are private with things too. Not even my parents know, because I was just over 18 when officially diagnosed. They just think that I used to have depression but that I'm over it now.\n\n>why is the 4-day hike an issue?\n\nIt's 4 days in a country I've never been to before, far away from any space I might call my own, with 100 people I've never met, spending all of our waking and sleeping hours together, doing challenging and somewhat confronting tasks. \n\nI'll be socially fatigued within an hour and I'll be desperate to leave by the 4th hour. If I'm fatigued and stressed and anxious, I'll get ill. This isn't a problem for things like conferences because I can just take a few minutes alone to chill, but there's nowhere to retreat to when you're climbing up a cliff face. Otherwise I need to be constantly plied with coffee to keep my energy up, which isn't good in general, and also isn't possible on a cliff face. \n\n>The busy office?\n\n10 people tend to make a lot of noise even when they're working quietly. It's hard enough to focus as it is. I can manage the occasional disruption, but when you share an office with 10 people, it's constant and I can't do any work.",

I worked under the disability services coordinator at my college and have schizoaffective bipolar I.\n\nSome colleges will want to see an IEP, if you have one from your high school days. You will need documentation of your condition also.\n\nAs for what to ask for- in a college setting, I\u2019ve known that adjusted attendance expectations was an accommodation that we could offer, so that a person could take mental health days or whatever they needed. If you\u2019re an American, you would be covered by the ADA and you may be able to request a certain block of time off on a weekday to accommodate therapy and doctor\u2019s appointments. Of course, \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d is the buzzword and you\u2019ll probably have to do some tap dancing to get to a compromise.\n\nHonestly, you may benefit from meeting with a psychologist and discussing what supports they have recommended to patients in the past with your disability.\n\nI hope that helps!",

Could you start by having someone on your medical team, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist write a list of accommodations that you may require, such as extra testing time in a quite testing area, 1-2 days extra for out of class assignments, preferential seating -meaning your seated close to the front to avoid distraction and optimize hearing the lecture, use of a tape recorder vs. taking notes.   Often these accommodations are ones that most students have when they transition from high school; however, if you are newly diagnosed it would not be out of the blue to request them from whoever diagnosed you so that you can be successful in academia.  Best of luck to you!",

Also ask about the accommodations you think you will need.  \n\nFor new teachers, I would let them know the first day of class.  If you may need accommodations they will be informed from the school, so it is best to just give them a fast heads up on what is going on with you and what you may need.\n\nYou will get stuck doing a lot informing on schizophrenia, and the differences between treated and untreated schizophrenia, so few people realize that it can be controlled reasonably well with medication.  \n\nFor what it is worth I did this for my issues, bipolar disorder with chronic fatigue and it worked out very well.  Everyone was very accommodating despite the fact I did not have full documentation.

      "text": "OK, maybe something I know about, although not at Cambridge and not schizo. I am not sure what the UK version of the ADA is, but it might be worth reading up on the limitations and rights assured by whatever that is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what you need (quiet time and space), and with a good conversational partner who understands the academic setting you'll be in, I think you can figure out who needs to know what and what kinds of \"official accommodations\" you may want to ask for. For me, because my disability office is great, this meant that I set up a face to face appt when I arrived on campus, told them what kinds of accomodations I was looking for (extended time on exams, someone to vouch for me if I have an episode and need an extension, etc.) and they told me how they could make that work. Now, I rarely take a class with exams anymore, so I now ignore the accomodations letter email every semester. For you, that might look like talking through your class schedule, any required long periods in class/group work, asking what happens if you need an extension, and figuring out things like trips, lab meetings, office settings, etc. Figure out from someone what problems will likely arise, make plans for those things, and then lay the groundwork to have institutional support if you need unexpected help. Your disability office should not be disclosing anything (nor is admissions except maybe to your adviser, but even that I doubt) without your consent. A face to face meeting should hopefully make your options and plans clearer--and you should run the show. Demand access to your education. If it's like the ADA, they're required to provide it if they can. They may also be able to help you get tech like noise canceling headphones, for example. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother office to look for (and maybe to have this conversation with, if your disability services office sucks) is the ombuds office. They're confidential and trained in conflict management and are also very looped into all the kinds of services available on a campus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that you are having issues with all the accommodations being about coursework. Does a PhD in Cambridge really have no classes? No qualifying exams? Weird place. Anyway, just because the system is set up more for undergrads, and they have more formulaic ways of doing it, doesn't mean those are the only accomodations available. I've gotten a whiteboard instead of a blackboard due to chronic pain. I have a friend who was allowed to listen to music while prepping for an oral exam. I got an extension on a final project when it caused me distress. If you know what is helpful to you in the scenarios you're likely to find, you should have legal standing to push for the things that you need as long as they are reasonable. You seem to know what you need, and that is the hardest part for most people.\n\n&#x200B;",
