      "text": "John Hodgman is fond of saying, \"Specificity is the soul of narrative.\" This could not possibly be more true for letters of recommendation. When I read recommendation letters, I want specific examples of what makes someone an excellent student, great collaborator, strong researcher, etc.\n\nI also want to see that the narrative in the letter generally lines up with the personal statement or cover letter written by the application. It can be a red flag if letter writer and the candidate end up contradicting each other about things like career goals.",

It is not uncommon to get a letter with the wrong candidate's name in it which is clearly just copy-pasted, even though the letter says things in it that are made to sound specific.
