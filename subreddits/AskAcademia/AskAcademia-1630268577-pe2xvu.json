  "title:": "What is the value of a PhD in Public Admin/Policy?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am an MPA student at a high-ranked program (according to US News, if that means anything) and I had some questions about pursuing a PhD. Prior to beginning my program, I worked for two years as a committee staffer in my state legislature. I have realized that I love school, both undergraduate and graduate, and would like to pursue a PhD in Public Policy/Administration.\n\nI have a good graduate school GPA (4.00) and a good undergraduate GPA (3.9), along with relevant work experience. My GRE scores are alright (around 320, along with 5.5 AWA). My area of interest for a PhD would be public finance or public economics, focusing on inter-governmental economic cooperation, social insurance policy, economic development and fiscal policy. For reference, I'm considering programs at Ohio State, SUNY Albany, Indiana University, NYU, George Mason and Pittsburgh.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How likely am I to get into a decent PhD program given my GRE, GPA and work experience?\n2. Are there significant opportunities for PhD graduates outside of academia? I like the idea of doing research, such as for the Federal government, think-tanks or non-profits. I also am pretty handy with statistics, so public-sector data science/analytics wouldn't be out of the question.\n3. Are there any other programs to consider?\n4. Would it pay to get 1-2 more years of work experience after my MPA before applying?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Enjoying school is a poor reason to do a PhD simply because a PhD is nothing like Bachelors/Masters. Specifically, there is no more coursework, rarely is anyone but you setting short-term deadlines, even the best research project can get miserable when bogged down,  there's no certainty that any project will succeed which can leave you high and dry mid-degree, and your experience is largely determined by just your lab mates and your supervisor.\n\nInstead, identify what you want to do, and if it requires a PhD, it *might* be a good idea to pursue one.",

      "text": "What specific goals does a PhD help you achieve? Can you achieve those goals without a PhD? \n\nDo the schools you listed have several active faculty currently doing research in your areas of interest? For a PhD, you need to look at potential advisors (several) in each school, not rankings or reputation. \n\nAlso you might find r/gradadmissions helpful.",

      "text": "Your approach seems to be \"I wonder what careers are available to someone with the PhD I want to get.\"\n\nA different approach (which I recommend) would be to decide on the *career* first, and only then figure out the educational or other path to get there.\n\nI happen to know someone with a stellar resume and top PhD who is having a hard time getting a job in policy. I think that his ethnicity is not working in his favor. Figure out the job you want, and look really critically at who has those jobs. If you don't look like them, there's reason to think you'll be at a disadvantage when you apply.",

      "text": "I think it depends on what you want to do. I spent 28 years in government and had an MPA and wanted to teach others to provide good government, or good organization administration. You can work in think tanks and on policy issues, but one of my mentors told me that unless I wanted to teach and do research that advances the field, then I should not do a PHD.  \n\nIf you get accepted depends on what your goals are and  if you would make a good fit in the program you apply to. You will be teaching and contributing to the program with research and service not just be a student. Like the other response says above, a PA PHD is not just an Uber MPA. \n\nThe PA phd field is also a small field relative to other disciplines, so your reputation as a scholar and potential colleague will be on high display. \n\nShould you start now, or get more experience\u2026depends on your circumstances and how much work you put into your PhD program and do you want to do it now or later. I\u2019ve seen very successful PhD candidates with years of work experience, and then also candidates straight out of MPA programs with no work experience who were rock stars. \n\nProbably the best place to get advise are your current MPA professors. \n\nGood luck on your decision.",

      "text": "I do political science, not PA or policy, but we talk with them.\n\nGood reason 1 to get a phd in PA/policy:  you want to do that kind of research.\n\nGood reason 2, which doesn't apply to you:  you've been working as an administrator for years and years, the state you work for will pay you more if you get a phd, --and-- the amount of that raise is enough to be worth the time and effort.\n\nAn easy test for whether or not you want to do research is to look at the current issues of JPART and PAR.  Maybe at policy journals like PSJ or JPAM, and political economy journals like JPE, Public Choice, etc.  Do you want to be writing articles like that, knowing that each one probably represents 750--1000 person-hours of work?  Not \"Do you like research?\" in some generic sense -- do you want to be doing that kind and style of research specifically?\n\n\"I love school\" is a terrible reason to get a phd because the minute you're on the other side of the desk it stops being school and becomes a job.  You're going to spend a lot of your time in committee meetings that are at least as much of soul-destroying horrors as any meeting in the corporate world.  Likewise, you're going to spend lots of time navigating petty office politics, just like you would in Cubicle Hell.  It's still a good gig in many respects, but it's not remotely like being in school.\n\nA social-science phd is indeed a decent path towards data-oriented work like market research or financial analytics for banks.  --BUT-- you should look at those as reasonable off-ramps for people who discovered, most of the way through their program, that they didn't want to work in the field after all, or who couldn't land a workable faculty job in the field.  Going in with a plan of hitting industry is silly -- just get an MA/MS in stats or data science.",
