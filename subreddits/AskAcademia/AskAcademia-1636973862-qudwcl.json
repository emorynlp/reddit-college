  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ll be applying for marketing PhD programs in about a year or so, and want to be as prepared as possible. I\u2019ve been advised that proficiency in a programming language such as R or Python is highly advantageous to one\u2019s PhD application.\n\nFor those in the marketing field (either CB or quant), what programming language would you recommend I develop proficiency as a matter of priority? R, Python, or something else?\n\nNote that I am already proficient in SPSS, NVivo, and Sawtooth software (not programming languages, I know).",

If you\u2019ll be doing more econ-focused stuff, R may be better because many of the newer econometric methods have an R package (though STATA still seems to reign supreme in econ) but I see less on the Python side.\n\nDon\u2019t stress too much about it though.  If you have a general familiarity with one or the other, you\u2019ll pick up the other one if there\u2019s a need.",
