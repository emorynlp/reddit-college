  "title:": "Have you been getting these emails from your ever-supportive senior administrators?",
  "text": "Dear loyal workers of Flailing University,\n\nFirst off, let me start by making a distracting comment about how odd the situation feels and sharing what I think are some uncanny observations about \u201cthese times.\u201d\n\nNext, I want to write something that sounds very empathic here. I want to put a lot of emphasis on saying how much I understand all your stresses now, ALL of them, every single one. I understand.\n\nOf course, I need to place some blanket praise here about how much we appreciate all that hard work and perseverance everyone has shown. Because this email is going to every single person employed at the school, these statements will feel as personal and uplifting as a sign stating: \"Thank You for Not Smoking.\"\n\nNow, I will start to discuss the *hard truths*. I will discuss how enormous our budget shortfall is and how all the previous efforts, which I enumerate in detail, have not been enough to come even close to closing the gap.\n\nAs a result, surely now you will see that we have no other option than to do the following:\n\n(1) Terminate all contract workers, non-tenure track faculty, and 65% of lower-level administrative staff. Fortunately, you will all qualify now for a special Coronavirus inspired extra unemployment bonus that, surely, will make this feel more like a glorious paid vacation if not winning the lottery. You can thank us later.\n\n(2) As for fortunate few staff allowed to remain (I bet you'd like to know if you're in this category, but let's keep the mystery), their [paid] hours will be reduced to a minimum. However, we all know their actually working hours will remain the same, maybe increase because now that they are working at home every waking hour is a potential working hour - and someone has to do the work of the 65% we\u2019re letting go.\n\n(3) Thanks to all the tenure track faculty who are part of the Flailing University family. That\u2019s why I know they will be more than glad to take on all the extra teaching needed (since we have purged all the teaching faculty, adjuncts, university-funded postdocs, researchers, assistants, and technicians) all while revising their curriculums to be entirely online, including lab sciences. A 25% pay cut will no doubt serve as a terrific incentive to work harder and maybe be able to get back to the barely living wage we were paying before. We all know it really doesn\u2019t work like that, but you\u2019ll try, won\u2019t you!\n\n(4) All senior administration will be taking a 4.387% pay-cut.\n\nI want to close here but talking about how incredibly stressful, painful, even traumatizing it was for us - the senior administration - to make these decisions. We have screamed, we have cried, we rent our garments, we have gone up to as much as three times a week with our $300/hour shrinks. You see us being on a high perch here, but we're the ones suffering the most - always ready to take one on the chin for FU.\n\nI wish you all the best in this difficult time for everybody! We are all in this together!\n\nSincerely,\n\nSenior Administrator",
