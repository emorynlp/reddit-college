  "title:": "What's the \"soundtrack\" of your PhD?",
  "text": "Inspired by a post in a different forum for shaving where people described the scent of their aftershave as music, I'm curious: how would your PhD sound if it were a song?\n\nIn my case it'd be probably along the lines of [Swans - The Seer](https://open.spotify.com/track/5DkfUFzDkY32ia5ncApGUL?si=ZM84yDnVRAOvMvHAguPXww). A 30min progressive rock song, super long, quite confusing and chaotic to listen to. Sounds like something you'd hear in a cult. Some people like this type of music, including me depending on my mood. But if I'd show this to my friends and family, I'd get a lot of weird stares. Alternative choice would be a horribly improvised jazz piece by a bunch of people who never played jazz before. (research is in information systems btw)",

Let me repeat that: for six weeks only one song on repeat. \n\nI was obsessed with the line, \"That path is for your steps alone\" in the song and would get chills up my spine each time I heard it in the thousands of times I listened. \n\n\nFast forward to the day I graduate. \n\nWe all go to the pub to celebrate. \n\nI walk into the door and what song is playing the second I walk in? \n\nRipple. \n\nWhat part? \n\n\"That path is for your steps alone\". \n\nYou can't make this shit up. \n\nThe universe winked at me and said, \"See what I did there?\" ;)",
