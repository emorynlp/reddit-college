  "text": "I'm applying for an NSF Postdoc in math. I have a strong teaching letter of recommendation from my department's teaching coordinator, and three strong research letters. My application includes plans for mentoring undergraduate research in addition to outreach. The program requirements say I should include 3-4 letters of recommendation . Should I include the teaching letter in my application since it might be relevant for the broader impacts? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe application instructions state \"One letter must be from your doctoral advisor while the other reference writers should be scientists who know you or your research well.\" This teaching letter wouldn't be able to speak about my research, but the writer knows me well.",

      "text": "Haven't worked in the US for several years now but so I'm a bit out of touch with NSF/NIH funding but in general I'd say that letter isn't ideal. They're giving you a clear steer on what the letter needs to be and the grant isn't to pay for teaching it's for research. \n\nI've dealt with many funding bodies in several countries over the years and US federal funding remains the most bureaucratic and intransigent of them all in my mind, and the most conservative. I'd find a different letter.",
