  "title:": "Why are some published work not followed up by more publications by authors?",
  "text": "Hello. I will try to clarify my question, as I could not find a way to describe it properly within a title's length.\n\nI am starting a PhD in the fall and am currently doing a literature review of my topic, looking for where to start with my own research. I came across a handful of journal articles which presented interesting work, with lots of potential for future work, however they were not followed by any subsequent publications (that I could find by tracking papers citing the aforementioned work).\n\nSo I was wondering, since there could be many reason for a researcher to stop working on a project, how does one know if the idea was a dead end or if the project was aborted for a different reason?\n\nI hope my question is clear and relevant, I am still discovering how academic research works and am not aware of how everything works in this world.",

      "text": "If you work with biological systems, sometimes reproducibility of interesting phenotypical traits can be a bitch. That's why it's becoming increasingly harder to publish evidence of mechanisms without their proper elucidation. Authors usually neglect this option, as publishing follow-up studies allows them to yield more scientific outputs from the same set of experiments. But sometimes it backfires.",

The former case would only be a dead end if it didn't get picked up for whatever reason, but it wasn't that the first papers of the sequence were better than the sole \"welp this is it\" paper.",
