  "title:": "[PhD dropout] I'm much happier after leaving my program, but feel sad that I won't be a professor.",
  "text": "I entered a PhD program immediately out of undergrad and dropped out after a year because I found myself unable to adjust to the lifestyle of academia. I found it difficult to complete my work in an unstructured environment and felt fairly isolated with so few people to talk to. Ultimately, I never overcame these personal challenges and felt super depressed, and so made the decision to drop out and accept a new job at a great company. I have since been doing really well at work. I went from being a very mediocre student to a superstar at the office. Still, I feel called to be a professor, as dumb as that sounds. The fact that you get paid to do research that you find interesting and discover truths about the world is literally the coolest thing I could imagine. I've considered going to therapy to address the issues that prevented me from being a successful PhD student and maybe reapplying for a program some years down the line. But I also feel like I should maybe just accept that the academic lifestyle will never be a fit for me and fulfill my calling in other ways. Has anyone had a similar experience?",

Look ahead, consider your other options and see how you can move forward. You might find that you really enjoy what you end up doing. Or maybe not, and that's also ok! Coming back to school after some time away can be really beneficial, and it is not uncommon for grad students.\n\nAnd no matter what happens, or which way things go, professional therapy is a good idea. They can help a lot as you navigate this part of your life.",

      "text": "I started a PhD program one year out of undergrad, got really anxious and isolated, and mastered out after three years. Many years later, I am working in a field I love with lots of other ABDs. Something has been nagging at me, some big questions I don\u2019t have the time or resources or skills to answer while working full time so...back to school I go! I\u2019ll be starting a PhD in a different (but allied) field at a different university next fall.\n\nYes, you can leave academia and come back. And yes, therapy helps a lot. I started talk therapy in grad school, then got really into meditation. My sitting practice helps me identify those automatic negative thoughts and habits that held me captive during grad school #1. I feel much more resourced and capable of handling stress now that I\u2019ve been out in the world a bit. I hope that whole journey will be an asset during my next phase, and I\u2019m sure it would be for you, too.",

      "text": "I think this sentiment has already been covered in a couple other comments, but it's probably worth saying that there's nothing wrong with taking time to regroup outside of academia and then re-evaluating your career goals in a couple years. Many academics that I've talked to said they really valued taking the time to work before going into a PhD program. And those that hadn't said they wished they had. \n\nWorking before graduate school really allowed me to see what life was like, but I found that I really missed the academic environment after a couple years. Additionally, the type of career I was setting myself up for just wouldn't have been fulfilling or challenging a few years out. You might find that you feel the same after taking time for yourself. Making money is nice, but it can't replace the feeling of finishing challenging problems or learning something new. Entering a graduate program in your mid/late 20s isn't bad.\n\nAnd if you get down the road, and decide not to re-enter? Try to make sure your career allows for a lot of mental and personal growth, and find ways to be challenged in whatever you do.",

Maturity and the ability to work independently  are as important as intellectual prowess for doing doctoral-level work. If you're still interested in becoming a professor (and you also have a realistic view of how dire the academic job market is), you might do well to apply again in a couple of years and in the meantime work in a research capacity or other jobs related to your interests. \n\nEdit to add: I started my PhD in my 30s and had several colleagues in the program who were in their 30s and 40s.

          "text": "I'm not sure this is the most helpful of comments. When someone says, \"I found being in academia really unpleasant, but I do sometimes wish I was a professor,\" a response of, \"keep that dream alive, buddy!\" may not be the right one. In most fields it is NOT easy to become a professor under _any_ conditions (which is to say, there's a _lot_ stopping one from becoming a professor \u2014 it's a long road to becoming one even under ideal conditions), and it is not especially common for people to become professors later in life. Starting a PhD at 35 is a recipe for financial ruin. \n\n(Let's imagine you finish in a brisk 5 years... now you're 40, and on the TT job market. Let's imagine you somehow nail it and get a TT job on your first year of interviews. Now you're not going up for tenure until you're 46 or 47. Do you really want to be getting true financial stability for the first time when you're pushing 50? It's a crazy thing to do \u2014 even crazier when you consider how unlikely it is that all of the above would happen on such a smooth timetable, and even more unlikely when you consider how alive and well ageism is in the academy. Again, some people have tried it. But that doesn't make it a good idea. There are reasons to potentially pursue a PhD in mid-life, but the dream of becoming a TT professor is pretty unlikely at that point \u2014 and frankly at any point \u2014 and shouldn't be the motivating one.)\n\nI think a better approach, personally, is figuring out how to achieve what one wants given the limitations that life or one's self may present. If the desire to be a professor is based on some idea of status \u2014 one should realize that a professor is just one kind of job, and status is always relative. If the desire is based on a desire to do research \u2014 there are ways one can harness that interest outside of the structures of the academy. If the desire is to teach \u2014 many opportunities there. There are ways, in other words, to get much of the \"job\" of the professor out of other careers, as long as one is not hung up on the title alone.",

That's exactly my point. \n\nYes, OP will likely have more industry options in a given geographic area. But OP need not expect that financial stability won't come until tenure. Financial stability comes with a full-time job that pays a living wage or better. Tenure-track jobs pay a living wage, as do many industry jobs. Tenure-track jobs also typically come with a minimum contract (3 or 4 years) until the tenure review. Most industry jobs don't have minimum employment contracts. ",

The starting pay for TT faculty \u2014 even at good institutions \u2014 is generally not great, esp. compared to comparable levels of experience at an industry job. It's a big pay cut, to say nothing of the opportunity costs accrued during grad school (which are going to be huge in the case of something leaving an industry career in their 30s).\n\n(And we have, for the sake of argument, left out the average 3-5 years of postdocs, plus the prospect of adjuncting, plus the likelihood that there isn't a TT job for someone that age at that rank anyway.)",

      "text": "Perhaps you are one of those people who thrive in a more structured work environment like deadlines and having external accountability would help? Have you heard of the four tendencies by Gretchen Rubin? She divides people into four groups depending on how they react to internal and external expectations. Some people do well without external expectations (which can take the forms of coworkers, deadlines) while others don't. I suspect that maybe having deadlines and coworkers will make you more productive. If that's the case, all you need to do is to create external accountability for yourself and you can achieve what you want to. Perhaps give this a try and maybe you just need to have a different working style than others in the program. \n\n[https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/](https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/)\n\n&#x200B;",
