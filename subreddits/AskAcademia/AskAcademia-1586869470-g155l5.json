  "title:": "How bad is it to be a \"Jack of all trades\" in academia?",
  "text": "Hey!\n\nWhile I think I'm doing relatively OK in terms of the sheer number of publications, something that's been bugging me lately is the fact that my publication are far from being concentrated around one topic (or even area within the discipline).\n\nDue to the fact that my country has a somewhat messy academic system, I found myself working on project A (one area within my discipline) and project B (another area within my discipline) for financial reasons, while trying to conduct my own PhD-thesis related research (let's call this \"project C\" - again, another area within my discipline). The situation becomes even more complicated because of additional random collaborations and because I also work on some extra stuff with my academic advisor (this stuff is a bit closer to my PhD-thesis than other projects).\n\nSo ... How bad is it to be a \"Jack of all trades\" in academia? Does it look a bit better if you are only the first author of publications that are close to your area of interest (and a middle author on other publications)? Can it even be advantageous to be a \"generalist\"? What would you suggest?",

I had to work as RA during my PhD, and although that study was only tangentially related to my main topic, I'm now trying to connect these themes. Current institution cares about quality but also stresses quantity, so this is a good balance for now. This would be a risky strategy in a country/at an institution that values focus, though.

              "text": "Since you and the other person seem to have gone off on a downward spiral, I\u2019ll attempt to engage this discussion at the question you asked.\n\nThis concept is what my PI in grad school used to explain how I needed advance my own research toward a publication.\n\nAssume the path from 0-10 gets you from start to publication.  I was really good at going from 0-1, and occasionally from 1-2.  However, once I got much higher, stuff wouldn\u2019t work initially and I\u2019d go back down to 0 and try new 0-1 pathways.\n\nIn order to get a publication, it doesn\u2019t matter how many 0-1\u2019s I did or 1-2 or 2-3\u2019s I did.  If I didn\u2019t get to 6, I couldn\u2019t publish anywhere, if I didn\u2019t get to 8, I couldn\u2019t publish in JACS, and if I didn\u2019t get to 10, I couldn\u2019t publish in Science.\n\nSomething like that.\n\nNow apply this same ladder-climbing concept to your career.  In order to truly push the bounds of your field, you need to be able to build up to something truly field changing.\n\nIs it possible you get there in 1 shot?  From 0-10 without going back to the start or having problems getting through some of the intermediate steps?  Sure, but it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nPushing the bounds of your field, for most of us, requires a concerted effort to push one (class of) topic(s) forward by a significant amount.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing lots of different fields of research, it\u2019s possible you go 0-10 with little need to push on any individual sticking point along the way.  However, it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nIf you\u2019re spread thin working on lots of different areas simultaneously, you\u2019ve got that much less thought/human/drive power to push an idea to the forefront of your field and beyond.\n\nThere are certainly people that can do it.  They\u2019re exceptional.  But they\u2019re rare.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to do it and you can\u2019t routinely surprise your colleagues with some \u201creally cool shit,\u201d it\u2019s often best to focus on one primary area of research in order to push that research as far as possible to demonstrate your ability to push research as far as possible.\n\nIf you can tie multiple projects together, you\u2019re using advances in one field to help push the advances in the other fields forward.  This is where there is some amazing overlap between, for example, artificial intelligence and many other fields at the moment (and for the past several years).\n\nJust a thought.  Could be wrong.",

When I was at a lower tier R1, it really seemed you just needed to stay in a theme, once again, making deviations due to grants or collaborative opportunities.  At my regional university, it is nice if you have some overall conceptual framework, but research can really swing due to funding, collaborations, or just trying to come up with something that can be done with limited resources.  And when I was at a SLAC, any publication seemed to be fine, related or not.  \n\nGranted, my experiences may not generalize since I really only have n=1 examples of each type of school.",

As was mentioned, some institutions like to hire generalists who can teach a wide range of coures, because their faculty size is small and they lack the critical mass to specialize, but research focused institutions typically prefer people with a strong record in one area, so that they are competitive for grants, and they have the potential to become leaders in a field.  \n\n\nIt's perhaps a bit different if these different skills allow you to pursue a compelling interdisciplinary research direction, but as was mentioned, one needs to be able to tell a compelling story that ties the various threads together. Also, while many research institutions wish to pursue interdisplinary research directions, keep in mind that hiring is still primarily done at the departmental level, so unless there is a targeted interdisciplinary search, because it is a a field that is very well funded, getting hired as a interdisciplinary researcher can be challenging as well.\n\nEven if your diverse research directions are all in a single broad field, support for your hiring tends to be based on experts in your subfield, and if you lack depth, then it's difficult to find a core group of people who would support your candidacy.",
