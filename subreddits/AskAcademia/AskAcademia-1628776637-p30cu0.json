  "text": "This is more of what are the neat tricks for the reference managers. I'm trying to find out a centralized version of having notes about a paper + easily generate a bib of it for citing. But Mendeley and Notion (my current setup for notes) has been disjoint since Notion doesn't seem to have an integration for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for alternatives, workaround, suggestions, thoughts.",

Cite by tag out of that and Bibtex generated the bibliography and inline citations according to the journal's style.\n\nGood and common for STEM areas, less so, I think, for others.",

          "text": "I use the BetterBibTex plugin for Zotero to insert citation (BibTex \u201ccite keys\u201d, which identify the reference in my Zotero library) in a Markdown file. This helps me to easily cite the paper when I\u2019m writing (by just typing the cite key like so `@NomadMimi2021`), which will be formatted into a proper citation and generate a bibliography when I convert the document into a docx. Same would apply for LaTex, of course. \n\nBut to actually remember what every citation \u201cis about\u201d I use the /r/Zettelkasten method! It\u2019s a bit cumbersome but it helps me massively to take and make notes and evolve my knowledge on a subject.",
