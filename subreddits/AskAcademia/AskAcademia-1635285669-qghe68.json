  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am lucky enough to be a full time research fellow in a university here in Australia. I love the project I am on and my supervisor is wonderful but I find myself missing structured learning. I have been looking at grad cert courses in different fields (I am in criminology). Please tell me I am not the only one who goes through this kind of post-PhD mania/boredom?",

My PI was completely hands off during my PhD which I found challenging, so I requested weekly meetings - purely to give myself regular deadlines by which to produce data. That made me structure my learning overall.\n\nYou can sign up for courses like you mentioned, attend conferences and give yourself learning and/or networking goals... Whatever works best for you!",
