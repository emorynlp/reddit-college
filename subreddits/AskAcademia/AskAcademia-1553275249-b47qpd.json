  "title:": "PhD students: How do you manage to do your daily chores with such long hours? How does your daily routine look like?",
  "text": "Non-native English speaker here. \n\nI keep on reading here that PhD students work for 11-13 hour workdays. \n\nMy question is, give the high work hours how do you manage to do other daily chores that are a requirement of life. For example how do you manage to: \n\n* Cook\n\n* Shopping for groceries. \n\n* Clean home, laundry\n\n* Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes\n\n* Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation. \n\n* Maintaining a pet: if you have one. \n\n* Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc. \n\n* Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc. \n\n* Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance. \n\n* Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on. \n\n* Other chores that are skipping me at the moment. \n\nPS: I am asking because I am out of home from 8am to 9:30pm. I can't even brush my teeth or shampoo properly given the time even though I have my food, lunches prepared and home and other chores maintained. It sounds impossible that other people are doing so much with a more constrained time than me. I want to do a PhD and I don't know if it will even be possible to do the chores listed above if I can't do them now. So I am looking for inspiration for time management. ",

      "text": "PhD Student in Civil and Environmental Engineering here and your experience will very greatly based on your field/ funding/ country/ PI. \n\nIn short: I don't work 11-13 hours consistently. I can't. My mental health is worth more than that. \n\nI work 8-9 hours/ day and occasionally (once /month or so ) go til 12 hours. This gives you time. Remember while you are getting degree you are also living your life. I also don't have a pet and slack on cleaning more than I should but this doesn't seem to be a function of free time. I call my parents/friends on my walk to/from work which is about 10-15 min. My PhD program is flexible and I make my own hours so leaving for appointments isn't really an issue as long as I'm still productive. \n\nI am also sensitive to when I am and am not being productive and work to maximize those hours. For example 8am - 1pm I am good at writing and can focus where as in the afternoon is better for monotonous lab work. I mainly meal prep so cook 1-2 times a week and put it tupperware but when my SO lived nearby we cooked a lot. \n\nAlso. This is 4-5 years of my life. If I can't make time to myself as a non married no kids  PhD student, how will I in the future as hopefully a new faculty / parent. Its all about time management and making lists and not wasting time. Sure it ebs and flows but I generally don't go above 50 hours a week including course work. \n\nIn my lab, with my PI, we are pretty independent and have group meetings but are otherwise not micromanaged at all which lets me/ my labmates work when/where we are most productive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

When I was a new student struggling to figure out this balance, a senior PhD student took me out for coffee, sat me down, and gave me some of the best advice I've ever gotten. She and I both lived alone, so her advice really hit home to me: \"NOBODY is taking care of your life outside the lab except for you. Nobody is doing your laundry for you, groceries for you, nobody knows what you need to unwind but you. You cannot apologize for the things you're responsible for maintaining outside of your work life.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

              "text": "I think this needs to be told to more people. When I was starting grad school, I had a lot of people asking me why I wasn\u2019t hanging out with them anymore, why I didn\u2019t have time for certain things, and why I wasn\u2019t faster in getting things (chores, favours to friends, etc.) done. It was hard to explain to people just how demanding grad school is, and how different it was compared to Bachelor\u2019s in terms of workload (among other things). I don\u2019t think people really understand until they do it/ or have done it. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve taken away from my experience, it\u2019s that you\u2019re the only one who knows what you need (to unwind), and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s looking out for you. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t apologize for that either. Above all you\u2019re the only one who can put you first, and figure out your life, and in that regard you need to do what you need to do to make it work with school. So I think that\u2019s really valuable advice you were told, and I wish someone had done that for me when I started. ",

I have no problem at all with eating the same thing every day, so my meals look like this:\n\nBreakfast: 1 packet instant oatmeal + 1 tbsp peanut butter\n\nLunch: Sandwich and tomatoes\n\nSnack: Small tupperware of nuts, crackers, etc\n\nDinner: Varies week to week\n\nBreakfast doesn't take any fridge space and only takes about 3 minutes to prepare (plus another 2-3 minutes to eat). Lunch doesn't take up too much space -- five 2-cup tupperware containers. Dinner varies, but generally a medium-large pot of something (chili and rice, spaghetti and meatballs, etc) is adequate for the whole week. Altogether, including uncooked stuff, I take up about 2/3 of one shelf in the fridge. Plus door space (condiments) and a bit of freezer space (I always have a frozen pizza on hand in case I'm feeling too lazy to cook), but all told I probably use the least cold space of the three of us. I've never had any issues with spoilage, except if I end up receiving unexpectedly large amounts of free food during the week from events.\n\nIn terms of prep time: on Saturday or Sunday I just make a large portion of whatever I'm planning to have for dinner. For example, I'll make a large pot of chili instead of a small one - since I was going to be cooking it anyway, I'm only spending a small amount of extra time compared to making the smaller portion. The big portion usually lasts about 6 days total, and I can usually find free food on campus for the 7th dinner. Lunches take about 15 minutes to prep a week of sandwiches, and for snacks I refill my container shortly after I get home each day. ",

You could get home vacuum sealer and bags from Costco and online. Basically they make fresh food more shelf-stable, so you can have them in the fridge or pantry much longer.\n\nThe more environmentally friendly option would be to invest in borosilicate glass containers (like Pyrex). They\u2019re much more durable and food-safe than plasyic tupperwares. They freeze well and rehear well. I usually cook up a huge batch of curry or fried rice each week, and freeze half in glass containers. Then I defrost the food I cooked last week. That way I end up with two types of food each week.",

I find cooking for 30 minutes - 1 hour much more manageable than cooking for 2-3 hours and for multiple days at a time. For example sweet potatoes and roasted veggies are great.

If you just eat a bowl of cereal or something for breakfast you don\u2019t have to prep that ahead of time and it won\u2019t take up space in the fridge (except for the milk obviously). Or if what you make for breakfast will be smaller/lighter than the other meals (I have no idea what your eating habits are like, I\u2019m just basing off of mine and the fact that I can\u2019t eat a big meal in the morning) you can take that into account with a smaller tupperware size.

      "text": "Tl;dr: If you're working every day, 12 hours a day in a PhD program, you're doing it wrong or you're in a toxic lab.\n\nI'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.\n\nI don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.\n\nA weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):\n\n* 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal\n* 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc\n* 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday\n* 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes)\n* 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep\n* 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV\n* 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc\n* 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time\n* 10-11 PM: sleep\n\nThere is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.\n\nHonestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:\n\n* The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate.\n* If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before\n* When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done.\n* Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do.\n* No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things.\n* For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work.\n\n",

However, it is a pretty much a fact that if you want to get a PhD in organic chemistry in the US or Japan (as you pointed out), almost all of the labs will require you to work like that. Not everyone can move to a different country, and having people on the internet tell you to just work less isn't helpful, in my opinion. There just isn't any other option.

Work a normal 7-8 hours doing wet bench stuff, then head to the bar and binge drink through happy hour or a little later grazing on free bar snacks when possible. Go home, have a couple of more rounds and go to bed. We had laundry in the unit, so I'd throw that in when necessary. I also kept a lot of easy eats around~ Fruit, yogurt, cereal, peanut butter, cheese, always a loaf of bread, eggs, canned shit like baked beans, and did a lot of cheap take out as well that I could eat off of for a couple days (had a great Cambodian place nearby, as well as a small grocery store). My place was generally pretty disgusting, so cleaning wasn't such a big issue...\n\nOne nice thing we did is I got involved with a Sunday dinner club, where a rotating group of people would host and everyone would bring something. It ensured at least one big meal with wine, etc., every week and a sense of community. Highly recommended.

Learn to set boundaries, 11-13 hour workdays are excessive and you're not realistically getting 50% extra work done compared to 8 hour work days. Like any job, there will be weeks where you have downtime and weeks where you need to kick into overdrive for crunchtime. You have to actively reach out to people if you want to stay in touch, but realistically my friends and family know that maybe we'll only really talk biweekly, or mostly chat online or something. Repairs and whatnot are generally not a constant drain on time.\n\nI shop once a week, do laundry once a week or every other week, clean every other week or so, and do dishes daily. An hour and a half for exercise every day is *a ton,* at that point you could safely raise the intensity and decrease the duration for a more effective workout. And people do rotations for a reason.\n\nAs a PhD student, your hours are very flexible- you need to put in work, a lot of people like to keep a schedule i.e. I try to be in lab from 9:30 to 6, not counting class times. But you can also much more easily dip out to go to the bank in the middle of the day if needed. Some people have biology experiments/protocols that require 4 hours in between steps, so it's not like you can't knock out other stuff during that time. I don't have a pet. I have to care for sick family members, but in my situation that's mostly a commitment I can stick to on weekends- other people may not have that luxury.",

Of course, there are always times you'll have to work long hours, but consistently working that much will lead to a very real burnout. \nRealistically I work 8-10 hour days regularly. Balancing life and grad school is always a challenge, but it is absolutely possible. I changed my schedule around a lot until I found a system that worked for me, for example, I get up early and go to the gym. This way I get my workout in (which is also key for managing my mental health!) and then I'm far more productive when I get to lab since I've been up for hours. Because of that, I can usually finish all my wet lab work and most computer work at a reasonable time.\nGet home, make dinner, relax. Taking this time to unwind from the day is just as important as working; it will increase your productivity and keep you from burning out. \nAs far as errands and what not go, take them in chunks. Car maintenance can often be done on the weekend, so set aside a Saturday morning and go get it done. I'm fairly lucky that I work in a lab that's independent and laid-back, so if I have to run to the bank in the middle of the day, no one cares. If you cannot do this, go during lunch. \nAs for grocery shopping, we take advantage of the online ordering and pickup services, like from Walmart, where pickup is free. Not only do we save money from not perusing every aisle and buying on a whim, but we also only spend 30 minutes running to pick up our groceries vs hours otherwise. \n\nBut honestly, take a moment to re-evaluate working 11-13 hour days. This is excessive, regardless of the reason. Making time to do other things in life is essential, and there's no reason to be working so much (unless, as others have stated it's a toxic environment).",

However, the fact that it gets to the point that there is constant crunchtime where people will have to work 10-12 hour days for a week or two every couple of months, and then go back to STILL working 40-45 hours a week after crunchtime, is the more common problem (along with the fact that this is seen as normal/\"deal with it\")",

      "text": "I'm not a PhD student, but I'm a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run. \n\nThere is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case. \n\nThe most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information. \n\nKeep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry. \n\n",

      "text": "The answer to this varies based on where you fall in the PhD sequence, and on how rigorous your program is. It is not static. Why? Because the constraints, demands, and obligations that you deal with throughout the process are not static. I get the sense that most people responding here are either in programs with little coursework requirements or are later on in their sequences-- that is, responding from the stage at which they've already done qualifying exams and are not being forced to take a full courseload along with doing research. Post-quals/post advancement to candidacy = a generally more flexible stage that allows you to get marginally closer to a semi-normal home life. (Emphasis on \"marginally.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we're talking about the first third or half of the PhD, my answer (coming from a very rigorous R1 program) is the following: you manage only a couple of things you've listed above, only barely, and if you're lucky. Many of them might happen only sporadically. If you have a partner living with you to help you, you might be better off. You will have very little time for these mundane things. The first few years of the PhD are like a time warp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're in your first few years and have a full set of graduate courses (e.g. 4 per semester, in my case) you simply don't have time. I spent my first year under such a heavy reading and workload that I was living on about 4-5 hours of sleep for the whole year; I wasn't going out, was constantly turning down hangouts with friends, had to tell people that I didn't have time to date. At all. And even then, I still wasn't getting all of the reading done. Sometimes I'd get all of my reading done but had gotten so little sleep that I couldn't always remember details immediately when being questioned on the spot...which got me accusations from my advisor of not doing the readings (yeah, I was angry. Asshole). I was pretty burnt out by the end of that year, unsurprisingly. It felt like academic hazing. And truthfully, I think it kind of was. It wasn't healthy, wasn't sustainable, wasn't reasonable or right. I could barely take care of basics like laundry (and even now, I still go a while without it sometimes, as life is still a whirlwind and I have qualifying exams in two weeks and feel way underprepared-- really hard to justify more time wasted).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing that I realized by the end of that year is that there is truly **never** enough time, and every choice is a sacrifice. Whatever I choose to read, I'm choosing over another thing that I'm supposed to read. Whatever I choose to do is further sacrificing getting things done, no matter what. So you have to prioritize things that you'll get into tangible trouble for if you don't complete them. One example: do I wash my sheets and make my bed properly for the first time in months, or do I read and finish a paper that I need to present on in two hours? Every day, ad infinitum, because the obligations like this are just repeated every week. I realized that I had to choose explicitly to *not* complete some of my work in order to do things like go out for dinner or have any semblance of a social life, maintain basic friendships, etc. I had to cut out all extra work that I could possibly get away with not doing, and it still adds up to a lot. I'm slightly more balanced now but still find it hard to complete a lot of the things you've listed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPro tips I've learned personally or from others over time:\n\n* If you have the money, automated delivery services for groceries, toiletries, or ready-made meals really help.\n* Get used to being able to spare only 15 minutes for a quick run in the morning, at best. Often you might not be able to do so at all.\n* Living with or dating a normie/non-academic with an average work-life balance will make \"life maintenance\" logistics easier at home.\n* But at the same time, non-academics often find it hard to deal with our schedules and might become frustrated or resentful-- I'm not sure whether I'd be able to relate as well to a partner outside of academia at this point. My current partner is also an academic (with an equally terrible schedule) and I am virtually certain that this is the only reason I'm able to maintain it.",

      "text": "PhD student in Public Health here. The short answer: get up early, make efficient use of 15 minute gaps in schedule, rely on my partner too much, be comfortable with prioritizing and letting things slide, be comfortable with feeling a little guilty, and double dip whenever possible.\n\nLong answer:\n\nWhen I wake up early (5 or 6am) I can do so much more. It doesn\u2019t always happen but when it does it\u2019s a ducking productive day\n\nMake efficient use of 15 min gaps. Know how to meal prep in that amount of time. Cook foods that can easily be eaten for dinner then thrown into different arrangements for easy lunches in the week. For example, bell pepper, onion, and steak/chicken/shrimp fajitas can be cooked on a sheet pan in oven (while studying) and leftovers can be thrown over a handful of greens with leftover sauce or half a lemon as salad dressing for several lunch meals in the week. Get familiar with staples that allow for this: fish, steak, and chicken dinners thrown over boxed greens for lunches. 15 mins is also enough time to sort and start a load of laundry or fold a load of clothes. Also enough time to get through half a sink of dishes. Don\u2019t discount small pockets of time. Know what you can do in small gaps you\u2019ll find here and there and be motivated to make use of them\n\nRelying on others. I rely on my partner, I help more with chores and cooking during the weekend and I rely on him during the crazy study week. He was in grad school before so he gets it, now he\u2019s in industry and has a nice schedule. Give your partner lots of love to make up for leaning on him/her! :)\n\nGet comfortable with knowing that things won\u2019t get done and prioritizing what can wait until the next day. Part of that you\u2019ll feel guilty for but understand it\u2019s inevitable. Sometimes even deadlines have to slide a little. Align yourself with realistic individuals that understand this if you can. If not, make your own personal \u201cI can let this slide\u201d list. I love the gym at school but if I don\u2019t have time, I can save 30 Mins by using the baby gym at my apartment complex when I first wake up. Are you a girl? There are days where hairspray and a ponytail are a must; sounds gross but sometimes dry shampoo has to cut it. I\u2019d rather get a workout in and a quick rinse than actually shampoo and dry my hair. Weird priorities have to be made on crazy days. Not all days will be this crazy! If they are then you\u2019re in the wrong lab/advisor/program \n\nDouble dip and use your resources. Enough said.\n\nGood luck, OP! Hope this helps in some small way:)\n\n",

Most of my time was occupied with things like writing, marking my students' essays, and reading/taking notes on things.\n\nA repairman coming by the house to fix something? I'll just make sure that I have a pile of grading at home that I can work on until he shows up and while he's there. Need to stop by the bank? Use it as an opportunity to stretch your legs after you've been doing research for two hours in the library. A PhD is a lot of work, but the work is much more flexible than other types of jobs. Your schedule is more likely to be almost entirely self-motivated outside of your teaching. A lot depends on your ability to work efficiently and productively. I had a friend who did her PhD in astrophysics, and her approach was basically to work as hard and efficiently as possible from 8 to 5 every day, and my impression of her life was that she rarely did PhD work outside of those hours except from in the last semester when she was finishing everything up. It can definitely be done, but many people simply don't work efficiently.",

I've decided to take one day off each week (30 hours is 30 hours), which is accepted by my team. I know there are people that kind of expect me to work way more, but I really like my work life balance right now, and the project is progressing as planned. I don't work at the weekend, which is why there are usually 3 days a week where I can take care of the household. Also, I usually leave office somewhere between 5pm and 6pm. I usually stop by a supermarket on my way home and then prepare a meal at home. When there is time I'll usually play a couple of matches in Overwatch and turn off my computer at 8pm. Then there's 1,5 hours for household, cleaning, relaxing, and I go to bed at 9.30 - 10 pm. I usually get up at 6-7.\n\nI think it really comes down to the expections there are in the team concerning working extra hours and sacrificing your life for the PhD. And it's also about adressing such issues openly. We all know that research projects can never be accomplished fully and in time, because there are always obstacles you couldn't have envisioned beforehand... So for me, communication is key, expecially about mutual expections ",

And my \"commute\" is a 6 min walk (because I live on campus... which also means I am not responsible for non-trivial home repairs - again not very common worldwide, but renting shared pre-furnished apartments near campus is probably common enough and similar enough). And I don't need to wear make-up (and it's even better that I don't, considering I am doing my PhD in a chemistry lab) nor fancy clothes daily, so taking care of my appearance doesn't take much time (hint: it's better for most people's hair to wash it once every 1-2 weeks, certainly not every day).\n\nIt's still never enough time to do everything perfectly, but I don't have high standards for cleanliness (I usually only really clean when expecting a guest or repair/maintenance), I figured out how to cook what I like in very little time and/or effort, I figured out how to do grocery (and any other) shopping only once every 1-2 weeks, and I hate exercise so I wouldn't do it anyway (except walking to wherever I need to, which often adds up to a lot).",

I wouldn't be able to do that every day - it only happens every few months.\n\nConditions for PhD students usually vary a lot even within a department, let alone a continent. In some places in Europe students get constrained to the same 8-9 h/day 5 days/week (forbidden or unable to be at the school in the evenings and weekends), which may mean much less working hours in total (or not, if the student is expected to do the computer work outside these hours) but still more difficult to do chores as everything else is also constrained to the same hours. That system is probably most common in Germany and Switzerland, but even there it isn't everywhere. Some other places in Europe function in a much more \"American\" way (more freedom, but also more hours and expectations).",
