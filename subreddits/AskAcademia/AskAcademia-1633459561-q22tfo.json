  "title:": "How old it \"too old\" for a prospective PhD supervisor?",
  "text": "As a preface I haven't actually communicated with the professor in question so it's entirely possible that it's not even an option.\n\nI am currently in the process of finishing my master's and looking for a PhD. I know of one professor whose research interests match very closely to mine and I have been following his work for the past few years as well as reading his earlier work. In addition to this, both my bachelor's and master's theses are relevant to what he is doing, and in turn I want to further specialize in his field. My main worry is that the professor is in his early seventies and although it looks from his webpage like he is still accepting phd students and like he is very active publication-wise, I don't know if it would be a good idea in the long term. The  general field is theoretical computer science if it plays any role.  \n\nIs there any general guideline on when a prospective supervisor is too old? Or am I just being ageist and shouldn't take age into account if someone is accepting new students?",

After a certain number of years in the business they tend to start follow other interests related to academia but their focus isn't on the lab any more and their outputs are no longer smash hits, and they can struggle to get funding. \n\nYou need to find out how engaged he is with his researchers, how present he is, what funding he has, and if possible if he has any plans for retirement.",

There's a period where you're the edgy rising star, then you're a huge headline act and then slowly the world moves on while you slow down a bit, there are new stars, and also they have the opportunity do things that you can't do earlier in your career - like being on advisory boards, advising government, journalism, senior university administration, whatever floats your boat (and pays some extra money). But that's not to say any given 70 year old isn't productive and doing good research.",

If you think his work is dated, this obviously matters, but his own age in and of itself doesn't tell the full story here.\n\nThis senior researcher's current standing at your institution is what you should care most about here, imho. We have some \"non-young\" folks that are still very much in the mix. (Cf. the age of this year's Nobel Prize winners in Physics, Fauci, and others. They aren't just old and previously accomplished. They are very much living in the present.) Other old-timers should have retired decades ago already, and if they don't their current PhD-students may suffer...",

Both for the mental component to grief as well as potential of not being able to finish or having difficulty finishing.",

Not only did I find his expertise extremely valuable, he also has name recognition in the field and dozens of other students who graduated in the decades ahead of me who I could network with. Obviously this won't be true of all older faculty, but don't write them off!",

People generally have the strongest connections with people who went through the system at roughly the same time, meaning it's mostly people around the same age. My PI has his strongest connections with people who did postdocs the same time he did, or people who were PhD students when he was. \n\nIf they're in their 70's then probably most of their strong connections are with other people in the 60-80 range. That group is largely composed of people moving *out* of labs and into emeritus positions. Hell, if you're in the UK then that's the age when **mandatory** retirement kicks in. At the very least, they aren't going to have many (if any) active contacts within the up-and-coming group, and those are the people you really want to connect with as a PhD as they're the ones who'll be your colleagues one day. You will likely never work with the 60-80 group.",

So if/when my boss finally retires, the funding, lab, and students will still be ok. \n\nYou could also approach him with these concerns and see if he'd be open to co-mentorship with another PI",
