  "text": "I am a third-year undergraduate student studying math. Prior to this year I had planned to go into higher education, and possibly work in academia, but a single course I am taking (differential topology) is making me question whether or not I'm actually smart enough to do it. No matter what I do, the material just feels way over my head and I can't seem to solve any problems on my own.\n\nIs this a common experience? For those of you already in academia or pursuing graduate level degrees, was there a class/event that caused you to reassess your aptitude for your field? Of course, this question is not exclusive to those in math-related disciplines.",

      "text": "https://www.nctm.org/Publications/Mathematics-Teacher/Blog/Everyone-Has-a-Personal-Green_s-Theorem/\n\nEveryone Has a Personal Green\u2019s Theorem\nBy Dan Teague, posted November 9, 2015 \u2014\n\nIt was early September 1963. At John Hanson Junior High, I was part of a new program in which a small group of eighth graders were taking Algebra 1. Mr. Green was my teacher, explaining the difference between a number and the numeral representing the number and why x = 3 wasn\u2019t the solution to the equation 2x = 6; rather, it should be {x \u2208 \u211c | x = 3}. (New Math\u2014those were the days). As far as we knew, we were the first kids in the history of the world allowed to take Algebra 1 in eighth grade. We thought we were hot stuff.\n\nThen Mr. Green, in an effort to contain our youthful arrogance, said something equivalent to, \u201cYou guys are good, and math is easy for you. But always remember this: Everyone has their Green\u2019s theorem.\u201d Probably this stuck with me because of Mr. Green talking about Green\u2019s theorem (no relation), but I\u2019d like to think I would have remembered it anyway. He went on to explain what he meant. When he was a student, mathematics was easy. Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Calculus\u2014all were all very easy for him. But then he got to Green\u2019s theorem in Multivariable Calculus. From then on, in every mathematics course, although he was just as good as he had always been, he had to work really hard to master the content. His meaning for us was that, at some point, mathematics becomes difficult\u2014for everyone. And when we hit our personal Green\u2019s theorem, as we all eventually will, we need to learn to work at it like everyone else.\n\nFast forward fifty-two years, and I\u2019m talking with a student about courses she wants to take next term. She tells me, \u201cI really like mathematics, but I\u2019m not very good at it.\u201d Her proof? \u201cI have to work really hard to be successful.\u201d In the world of students, if you can do something easily, you are good at it, and if something is not easy for you (no matter how successful you are and no matter how much you enjoy it), you are not very good at it. Moreover (and this is the dangerous part of this thought), if a subject isn\u2019t easy for you, then you just aren\u2019t cut out for it. My student could not imagine mathematics as a major and certainly not as a career option.\n\nBut Mr. Green would tell her that she is using the wrong metric. For everyone, mathematics becomes challenging. Mathematics is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind. Of course, it will be challenging. Everyone has to work at it\u2014some earlier than others and some later than others. But everyone has a personal Green\u2019s theorem.\n\nIt is important for students to understand that, whatever their area of interest, the subject will eventually become challenging. So what? Hard isn\u2019t bad. The real question isn\u2019t whether a student finds a subject easy or hard; all subjects will all be hard eventually. The real question is, Do you enjoy that challenge? That\u2019s how to decide what career path to pursue. You actually don\u2019t want an \u201ceasy\u201d job. You want to be challenged by your work and to draw joy and contentment from accepting the challenges it offers and working hard to meet them.\n\nMathematics is the hardest thing I know, with the possible exception of teaching mathematics. I do them both not because they are easy. Like you, I do them both because I love the challenges they offer and because each day I have to work really hard to be successful. Thank you, Mr. Green.",

You can pick a field that avoids the topics you struggle in and emphasizes what you\u2019re good at!

      "text": "To add to the many perspectives here (by all means, I agree that struggling one course does not mean you cannot succeed in academia), I encourage you to use your experience as a point of empathy in the future. Let's say that it's 10+ years later and you are teaching classes, working with students on research, etc. Know that, for some of your students, your class is going to be the hard one that they struggle with. I hope that you'll use your experience of struggling in a class to meet students where they are at, provide encouragement for their efforts and persistence in the face of difficulty, and ultimately support your students both in terms of academic support (e.g., patiently explaining a concept to a student after class or during office hours) and in terms of emotional warmth (i.e., being kind and affirming, even as they struggle).",

      "text": "All professors are smart. A good teacher can get the information out of their head, through their mouth, and into the students head, in a way that the student can not only understand the information but apply it.\n\nSure you might suck at the subject. But also there might be something lacking on the other side of the equation. (Ha unintended math pun \ud83c\udfc6) \n\nI once had a visiting math professor from Israel who loved to use \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d as his variables and his m\u2019s had 3-5 humps and his n\u2019s had 1-4 humps and with his accent you could never tell which he was saying. I did horrible in that class.\n\nGet a tutor. Or try a couple tutors but if they all try explaining it the same way they aren\u2019t very good.\n\nEdit: example; oh you don\u2019t speak English let me say it louder and slower... still don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying? Let me repeat the exact same thing again... still don\u2019t understand? Well let me say it again! Oh wait maybe I\u2019m not smart enough to realize I\u2019m not an effective communicator and need to alter my approach. Too many teachers feel like \u201cwell 15 of my students are doing well I must be explaining it well, so let me keep explaining it the exact same way when one of the students that isn\u2019t doing well comes to me seeking help\u201d \n\n\u201cA good explanation doesn\u2019t describe what you see, it elicits the proper visualization\u201d",
