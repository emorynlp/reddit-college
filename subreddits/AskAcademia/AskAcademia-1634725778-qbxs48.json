  "text": "Hello, I was asked to put a map on my paper. The map should show the position of a specific city. I don't want to deal with copyrighted material, so I was wondering, can I use a screenshot from OpenStreetMap? The screenshot would include the line  *\u00a9* [*OpenStreetMap contributors*](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) *\u2665* , of course. Do you think I can use a screenshot, or should I export it? The export feature requires too much zooming to be used (the map I need should show the position of the city in a wider area, which OpenStreetMap won't let me do by exporting it).\n\nAny suggestions? I don't want to break any copyright laws.",
