      "text": "I've been in academia in the US for 25+ years now and have only known a small handful of people who were denied tenure at one place and later got it elsewhere; all of them left R1s or elite private schools and took a step down (sometimes a *major* step down) in prestige before getting tenure. Most had to start over or received limited credit (1-2 years) toward tenure at their second institution. \n\nHere's the rub: I've served on far too many faculty searches over the years and have seen how search committees respond to denials of tenure. No matter what the file might say, they tend to think \"There's something wrong with this person, is s/he worth the risk to us?\" because obviously another institution rejected them. When you have a flooded market and dozens, if not hundreds, of qualified candidates applying for every job people are looking for any excuse to weed the pool. The fact that someone was effectively fired from a previous job is a pretty good excuse in some people's minds.\n\nThere are two exceptions: everyone knows that Harvard/Yale et. al don't typically tenure junior faculty so they get a pass, as do most people who come with $$$ external grants. But there is a very strong bias against anyone perceived to be \"damaged goods\" in the US market, and nobody will trust letters of recommendation from a former department because they believe (with some reason) that those often omit serious problems because the writers/school don't want a lawsuit. So unless there's an inside connection-- someone in the hiring department knows someone in the former department --the odds are the committee is going to balk.\n\nFor the majority of US academics, I'd say, a failed tenure bid is a career-ending event. Certainly the vast majority of people I know who have been denied tenure never earned tenure at a second institution.",

          "text": "I'll just tag on my own experience to your top level answer since it's the best one. I failed tenure, and it was kinda career killing but then again, it wasnt. I was at an R2 type school in the middle of nowhere. In my last year I sent out hundreds of apps. I got 1 phone interview and 1 on campus interview. Didnt get either job. We moved states to be closer to my wife's family hoping they would help me find work there, but right after we did so I heard back from a school that was pretty close to where we had just moved. I interviewed 3 days later and was hired the same day.\n\nNow it was only a lecturer position, so it's a big step down. But this is at an R1 school that has the #1 program in the country of the kind of work I do (whereas the school I left has a much weaker program of its kind). So even though I teach a heavy load, will never have tenure, and will not get to officially have the title professor, I still get to have a great academic career. I do research in collab with the tenure line faculty, some are the best in the field, a lot of interdisciplinary cool stuff, we have a promotion path for lecturers so I get 10% raises, and I dont have worry over the stress of expectations for tenure track. 13 years later I'm ok with how my career has turned out.",

So even if they do have options at smaller schools they may not chose to take them. \n\nAnd to add to the \"Everyone knows Harvard/Yale doesn't give out tenure\" if you're at a big state R1 and don't get tenure, I have seen on at least two occasions the R1 reach out to a smaller state school and essentially ask them to hire the person they didn't give tenure to. Just like OP said it is a big step down, and not sure how common that is across states (especially because many states don't have that large of an academic system to support something like that) but in that case it's also not a death sentence.",

In my experience, it's pretty rare for a faculty member to go up and be denied tenure - there are too many checks along the way.  Usually what happens is that the faculty member figures out that they're not going to get tenure long before they formally apply for it.  (Often they'll be pulled aside and hints will be dropped.)

Sometimes hires just don't work out; for us (SLAC) it's most often people who end up deciding they want more time for research and can't teach to the level we require. In my 20+ years at my current school I can count the number of tenure denials on one hand (though more left after third year reviews). Tenure decisions are almost never a surprise to anyone unless the (local) system is broken somehow.",

Sometimes its a bad hire; the committee made a poor choice for some reason. Sometimes a candidate is just a whack job or actually crossed the line into malfeasance. But sometimes they are failures of mentoring and communication, and that falls on the department chair.

It's easy to find people who can publish enough to earn tenure at our school (typically one book or 4-5 articles, field dependent) but hard to find good teachers. People who are denied tenure for not making the publication hurdle at a more-prestigious private might well be considered by us if they had a stellar teaching record. That's much harder for \"everyone in the field\" to evaluate than a publication record.",

Obviously in some fields (CS, accounting, etc.) people can/do move between academia and industry all the time. In others (humanities) it's so rare as to be unicorn level.  Changing jobs-- the downgrade --you could easily explain in a cover letter though, just as you have here; certainly at my school we've seen candidates like that and have been lucky to land some really good faculty who have ended up stepping down (from R1 or elites) to use because their spouse took a job in the area.",

Everyone knows nobody just walks away from a tenure line, and honestly there's a victim-blaming element to it as well-- if someone did \"leave a few months before tenure was up\" there would still be a strong suspicion it was somehow their fault. Anyone with an obvious tenure rejection from a non-elite school is pretty much done, unless there is a well-substantiated record in the file that says it was due to something like budget cuts and the department chair or others from the prior institution validate that in their letters.\n\nRegardless, the very first question an a file showing a departure will draw is going to be \"Why did they leave a tenure track position? Did they get fired?\" Followed almost immediately by something like, \"Whatever, let's move on to a candidate who we know wasn't denied tenure somewhere else...here's file number 322, why don't we start there?\"",

Junior people leave institutions for all sorts of reasons, the two-body problem being a big one. I left my first job before tenure and did better getting interviews than I did the first time I was on the market. \n\nIf you *really are* leaving because you won't get tenure then I think that is usually self-evident from your CV. And typically most places aren't interested in people who aren't going to get tenure.

In the humanities most people (like 95%) feel damned lucky to have a job at all and very few I know have tried any sort of shopping. The one time someone in my department did that (long before I was chair) the provost simply said \"I hope you like your new job in Kentucky\" and refused to budge at all on salary.  In CS and other fields with industry jobs things are different; in the humanities and many social sciences at my SLAC we have hundreds of applicants for any TT opening and basically have our pick of the crop of recent top-10 Ph.D. programs. It's never hard to replace faculty who want to go elsewhere.",

      "text": "More commonly, I've seen people leave after a strong 3rd year review, or after successfully getting tenure at a school. I work at a small-ish teaching school, so we see a lot of transit. We hire a lot of people that are coming from R1s and want to be more involved with teaching, student support, etc, so we get applications from people that look well on their way to tenure. We also get really nice apps from folks that are recently tenured. \n\nI guess the people that didn't earn fall into two categories for me: 1) Not interested in continuing in academia, and 2) poor institutional match. In category 1, well, there's not much to discuss. They fizzled out in TT probably because they just lost interest, which is fine. Number 2 ends up having a CV that looks much more appropriate for a different institution type. That door swings both ways. We lose faculty at our school that publish their asses off, get tenure, and then bounce to another program pretty quickly. We also get people that didn't publish enough for an R1, but have published enough for us to consider them. \n\nTenure is not uniform, so it's probably a good idea to not ask for a shortened timeline. My school has stuff in our tenure guidelines that's not publication related that will take years of work and iteration. \n\nI have seen a few people that were obviously not going to get tenure that applied to programs that I worked in. Their CVs were awful, and the letter was blatantly suggesting how lucky we were that a person from such a prestigious university would be applying to our school. Bold move, but I doubt it works. \n\nI would say the most popular route I've observed is that academics who aren't going to get tenure transition into administrative roles at schools. This can work very well for all parties at times, but can also mean that a person who failed to earn tenure is now a \"faculty development specialist\" or some such nonsense.",

Mostly they are fodder for laughs during search committee meetings, \"Can you believe this one???\"  The other common type is the lawyer (JD with no research degree or teaching experience) who thinks he's god's gift to everything and since he's read some history books as a hobby we'd be lucky to offer him a tenure track job, even though he's be taking a 75% pay cut to do so.
