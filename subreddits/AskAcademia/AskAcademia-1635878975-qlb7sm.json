  "title:": "Is getting a PhD in Immunology worth it?",
  "text": "I'm torn on what to do here. I have a strong desire to go for a PhD in Immunology, and do research for a rare disease afterwards. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm contemplating just taking my Bachelors degree and working in State or Federal government for good benefits, good pay and all that jazz. \n\n* Can anyone help enlighten me on what the reality is if I choose to go for a PhD? \n\n* Will I be overqualified for a bunch of jobs and therefore unable to get a good job? Is there any benefit in pay for getting a PhD, should I choose to abandon research for a government position after getting the PhD? \n\n* Is research all that its cracked up to be? I have an idea to solve a rare disease, but my concern is running from one grant to another and being broke. Though Im okay with a bit of risk tbh. Would a good balance be to become a professor, and do research on the side?\n\n* Any other thoughts/comments/concerns about getting a PhD? Things you wish you knew before you started?",

      "text": ">On the other hand, I'm contemplating just taking my Bachelors degree and  working in State or Federal government for **good benefits, good pay and all that jazz**.\n\nYour question is about academia, but I wonder if you have a realistic view of what life in government with a Bachelor's degree entails. If you manage to get a job at your State health authorities, do you have a realistic picture of how your working life would look like years ahead? Let's say you land such a job, do you have a picture of what your actual workday may look like 5, 10, 15 years down the line? \n\nI don't know anything about immunology job opportunities, but in some fields, you would have to worry that the degree may only be a ticket to get a job that you are basically overqualified for even with a Bachelor's. (At my workplace, the economy people with economy degrees run spreadsheets the way you could learn in a couple of weeks of job training. Their 3-year degrees were a way to get the job, but they are all dumbing down lightyears below what they could do, for the rest of their careers.)\n\nAlso, you have to consider that you are competing with people with MSc and PhDs even if you want to for State or Federal Government outside of academia.\n\nSorry for being so negative, but on this forum, we mainly scrutinize the pros and cons of academic work and ambitions, but less so the alternatives.",

          "text": "No need to be sorry, I prefer cold hard reality than anything else!! \n\nI honestly don't know what life in government with a Bachelors degree entails. I do know that I wouldn't be pursuing my passion, in exchange I would (likely?) have cushy benefits and all that.\n\nThat's one of my concerns, is being overqualified; as well as being severely underpaid for what a PhD is. I perused this subreddit a bit, and was appalled to see people being paid $30-$50k yearly for a PhD in life sciences. Is that standard? \n\nAlso I'm curious about if I decide to go full-ham and do my dream -- get a PhD, and research how to cure a rare disease. Would the only stable way to perform such research be working as a professor while simultaneously running a lab on campus?",
