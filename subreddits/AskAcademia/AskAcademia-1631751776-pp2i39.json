  "title:": "What do humanities lecturers mean by the 'so what' question?",
  "text": "I'm currently applying for a PhD place and my lecturer read my proposal and said it was good but lacked a 'so what' factor. Does anyone know what they meant by this? (I could ask them, but 2bh, they're kind of intimidating, and they don't tend to be very good at answering things clearly.) Currently, my proposal is an argument for the important of a particular writer as an influence on another writer - so it's an influence study basically. But other than saying 'see, this guy's an important overlooked influence and this sheds new light on writer x' I've not really got a whole lot more that I'm saying. Do you think this is what they mean when they say the proposal is lacking something? Is demonstrating influence not a substantial enough project, then?",

If there isn\u2019t anything written on the precise combination, that\u2019s ok (mention it in your proposal), but perhaps there have been studies that connect the second (influenced) author to others? If none of this exists, then maybe mention a related comparative study and link it to what you\u2019d like to undertake. If this doesn\u2019t work, then pick up other contextual cues related to your hypothesis \u2014 does the revelation and exploration of this line of influence uncover anything of interest in a broader sense, perhaps socioculturally or aesthetically, for example? Just suggestions that might help decipher your lecturer\u2019s critique. I feel like I\u2019ve posed this question when reviewing others\u2019 proposals in the past, so I hope this helps!",

Research write ups begin with a general show and tell, a look at this cool thing I found, and if you were only to publish in the field of so-and-so author studies, the \u201cso what\u201d of changing the perception of their legacy matters just as such. \n\nBut in general in the humanities, we have to work to contextualize our work within our broader field (say, English literature, literature studies more broadly, or even the world) to demonstrate potential impact beyond the 5 people who will have to read the dissertation and the 50 readers of a given niche journal. So, why should someone who studies other authors care about this particular relationship? Does this case challenge how we think about authorial influence more broadly? What about rewriting networks of influence in (such and such) area at (such and such) time? \n\nSometimes these \u201cso whats\u201d can be a bit oversold, but it\u2019s part of how you cultivate buy in on the part of your reader (or your highering committee) and a crucial skill to both position your work and also to get you to think more broadly, too.\n\nETA: These so whats can be and are often somewhat to highly speculative at this point in the project.

              "text": "I find asking students to identify the context, phenomena and theory of their research as a starting point. From your other comments I figure that the author you are studying is the context. This is usually the least interesting thing for academics. Eg I often see proposals from students who want to look at existing phenomenon using a well studied theory in a new cultural context without any explanation as to why the new cultural context would add anything new to understandings of the phenomenon or theory. \n\nIn your case I'd ask how does studying the context of author X add to our understanding of phenomena Y or theory Z? You need to identify the gap in knowledge for Y and Z which are the things that elevate a contribution beyond people interested in just X (that particular author) to how this can advance understandings of authorship or inspiration or (insert bigger issue here).",

      "text": "The way I approach this is, every time someone tells me something is _interesting_ I ask, \"why?\" It's just an invitation to elaborate. What makes it interesting? What makes it valuable? What makes it something you want to learn more about and tell others about? \n\nYou can always imagine a petulant child asking, \"why? why? why?\" to every answer you give. But probing those answers will eventually get you an answer that sounds more interesting than just, \"I happened to have written a paper on it\" or \"I had access to these topics so I wrote about it.\" \n\nOne thing I would avoid: don't just pin the \"so what\" on the idea of other scholars having neglected it. If you have a good \"so what\" _and_ it has been neglected, that's gold. But a \"gap in the literature\" is not by itself very compelling. As one of my advisors always put it, \"sometimes there is a reason there is a gap.\"",
