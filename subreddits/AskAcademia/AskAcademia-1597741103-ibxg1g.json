  "text": "Hi everyone, hopefully I\u2019m allowed to post this here ! I am currently an undergrad marker for a calculus class (this is my first time marking). I was just wondering, how do you deal with giving out failing grades? I feel SO extremely guilty for giving students failing grades. Sometimes I\u2019ll look over their midterms 2-3 times hoping I can find some place to throw an extra mark in just so they don\u2019t fail. It really does hurt because I myself am a younger student and can see that some of the students do try really hard, but the grades just aren\u2019t there. Does anyone have any advice on how to not feel guilty? How do you deal with giving out failing marks? I just wanna reach out to some students and offer to tutor them but I literally don\u2019t have time, nor would it be my place to offer. Ahhhhh. \n\nPs: I don\u2019t throw freebie marks in just because I feel bad, but I go over the test a couple times looking for places I could take 0.5 off instead of 1 mark.\n\nEdit: WOW this got an overwhelming amount of replies. I\u2019ll read and respond when I get the chance !!",

And that's what makes it so important that we help our students learn from their mistakes. If we incorrectly tell them \"you did it!\" when they really didn't achieve the course objectives, then ... then we're lying to them. That's definitely not what their tuition money is worth.\n\nI think the issue is that students place so much of their self-worth on their grades. And this stems from our choice to assign numerical grades in the first place. I think we would do well to stop focusing on grades. We should focus on writing feedback and getting students to read and learn from that feedback. Maybe the front page of your paper shouldn't say \"B+\" or \"75%\". It should say \"nice work, your solution to Q2 was very neat. But your solution to Q3 was missing some steps (see feedback). You should work on \\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. And you should keep up the good work on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" Give them some concrete stuff to work on. No more \"2/3, see solutions\" --- how tf does anyone learn from that?!\n\nWhen I was a TA, I tried to write feedback like this on the front page, with more detailed feedback next to the actual corrections. It's unfortunately extremely time-consuming. This is why I believe we should hire more TAs and train them better. That should be the primary focus of our system right now.\n\nAnyway that was a real rant haha. Good luck!",

I was also uncomfortable with the failing grades I was giving, despite the fact that everything was being done fairly on a surface level. I used this discomfort as motivation to look how the class was structured to see if there was a way to help students not fail while also maintaining the rigor of the course.\n\nI guessed that part of the problem might be that 75% of the course grade was coming from exams, and the exams were hard (appropriately so). I guessed that a lot of students might be failing because they were bad test-takers. I decided to add several more components to the course (homework, discussion questions, in-class problem sets) to dilute the effect of the exam grades and to give students more varied opportunities to demonstrate their mastery of the material. If anything, I think that it has made the class better and more rigorous while still reducing the number of students who fail (some still do, of course).",

Imagine you're marking papers for a class far, far away where you don't know the students or the faculty member giving the test.\n2. Grade one problem at a time to be consistent.\n3. If you find similar mistakes in the same problem, make note of the mistake and which student made it.\n4. I have discretion on grades and I do use it, but I have to apply it consistently. I can only be fair if every student is held to the same standard.\n\nTalk to your boss about blinding names on test papers. Tons of ways to do this. I assign each student a test number. They think it's because I write different tests. It's to keep me and my GAs objective as we grade. You can also start grading from the back page so you only see the name at the very end.",

      "text": "IMHO, grades are not that important in the long run. They are poor metrics of whether a student will succeed and thrive in their chosen field, and they\u2019re a product of many intertwined factors. I have never been in charge of the grading schemes for classes I\u2019ve taught. I grade by the book but encourage students not to get hung up on individual grades. Successful students approach learning from a place of enthusiasm, not fear. Individual grades reflect student effort and comprehension, but also instructor competency and how the student was feeling that day. And, yes, they are also influenced by TA competency.\n\nStudents who fail routinely (on multiple assignments in multiple classes) tend to be the ones who either aren\u2019t very invested or have testing anxiety or problems at home. It\u2019s probably not your place to do this, but if the instructor of record communicates with struggling students, s/he should be able to sort out which ones just need more support.\n\nFor students who fail an assignment here or there due to the vagaries of academic life, or bomb one class because the professor and/or TA was ineffectual, these setbacks tend to come out in the wash.\n\nMany students, across the spectrum of effort, aptitude, and success, will come to you whining about their grades and grubbing for more points. I like this because it means they are self-advocating, which should always be encouraged even if it\u2019s tiresome.\n\nI always stand my ground on legitimate grades, but for those students I will double-check how I graded the assignment, make changes if I find a mistake, and take the opportunity to talk to them about their academic goals and challenges.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of being wrong. Professors and TA\u2019s often are wrong (or at least not absolutely right/clear) about things and make mistakes, but if a student is not afraid of them (or terrified of failing), they can sort through conflicting information and come to their own realizations. I think that\u2019s a much more powerful mode of learning than simply trusting and regurgitating what instructors say.\n\nTL;DR: the grades you assign are not that important, and you don\u2019t have to be right all the time to do a good job. What\u2019s important is helping students (the ones who actually care, anyway) work through obstacles to learning and replace fear of failure with enthusiasm for new information, perspectives, and challenges.",

I failed freshmen chemistry the first time I took it, second time I took it the prof gave me a C and made me promise never to take a chemistry class again.

The exams were essays and they wrote research papers that Prof X had me grade very strictly. Prof X went to an Ivy, and wanted to pass on that educational quality to students at our school, which was a large, diverse, public university not known for academics.\n\nWe gave them every opportunity to come for extra help, I regularly made myself available outside of office hours to accommodate students, and the policies and instructions were crystal clear. But many students ignored all that, and their background didn\u2019t prepare them to succeed in the course without giving serious effort. Many couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t, write a comprehensible sentence. They submitted 8 pages of filler and nonsense and were stunned when they got Ds of Fs.\n\nI developed considerable anxiety when I graded. I\u2019d suffered from a mood disorder throughout college that made me really struggle to get through, and if I\u2019d been in their shoes, I\u2019d have felt just as shitty and overwhelmed. It broke my heart to give out harsh grades left and right. Who are we to push these kids to a level of achievement that they\u2019re not up for?\n\nBut then, who are we *not* to push these kids? \n\nI think when you set up your own grading standards and level of course difficulty it\u2019s easier to come to terms with students\u2019 performance.

I really love math! But I don\u2019t think that really has anything to do with this situation, I just understand how horrible it feels to get a failing grade. Also I am marking to gain experience to hopefully build my way into a TA position before my undergrad is over \ud83d\ude42",

For example, put all answers to question 1 in a row, rearrange their order, and have a computer keep track of which one belongs to which student without the marker knowing.",

      "text": "So a few thoughts.  A failing grade is normally earned.  Students know well what they are doing. Learning is a shared responsibility, about 80% is on them, about 20% on you. \n\nIf you had clear assignments, early and often feedback, assessment criteria, available assists (such as office hours), class content reinforcement, and so forth, you've done your part. It is on them to seek out accommodations, compassionate accommodations, tutoring, etc.\n\nIf in light of all that you did, the students still don't show and/or don't do the work, or don't work to the clearly stated level having been offered assists like office hours, then don't feel bad. They earned it. They are adults. They have the right to choose to fail.\n\nI don't know what 'trying really hard' means in your scenario. I have students who complain they try really hard, and upon pressing the issue I find out it's mostly hope and little work. That's not trying really hard. \n\nNo it's not your job to tutor them. There is no need to dumb down content or set up unfair standards that are not available to all students. \n\nSo yeah, you're doing the right things. It always hurts to flunk a student because we want the best for them, we're there to assist with them obtaining a decent future.  Does it get easier over time, not really.  The best way to do it, that I've found, is really be clear and rigorous about tracking everything they do so if there ever is a complaint or grade contestation, you can show all the times they didn't do the work, didn't fulfill the criteria, etc.",

              "text": "You have an obligation to both the failing students, the students who passed and the students who did really well. When you pass someone who shouldn\u2019t have passed, you do a disservice to the students who (1) passed and (2) the ones who did well. This disservice manifests itself in a number of ways. Firstly, the value of the degree (which is in part down to its relevant scarcity) is watered down when a student passes a course who haven\u2019t achieved a certain minimum standard in the course. Secondly, it is very psychologically disheartening and discouraging to the students who worked hard and passed, as well as the students who do exceptionally well, when loafers pass. Students who struggle ought to get assistance to get on their feet and stay there, they ought not to have their cake and eat it.",
