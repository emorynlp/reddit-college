  "text": "Hello.\nI have a Google Sites page but I am not very fond of the platform. I don't know exactly why, but I never really enjoyed using it.\nI was thinking about using WordPress instead, so I'd like to hear about your experience with the platform, especially regarding blogging about research and/or academia, and perhaps some divulgation as well. \nI've usually been particularly blog-shy but I've always enjoyed reading about what other scholars have to say and the discussion that sprouted thanks to these blog posts. I often wished I had a blog to discuss particular topics, but at the same time impostor syndrome prevented me from doing it. This is how I discovered that you can have blog impostor syndrome too, apparently. \ud83d\ude05",

I recommend buying your own domain and hosting so you can have control over your site. Always good for linking on Twitter and other social media too. Either way, give it a shot--won't hurt for sure!",

I hosted an academic blog on my own VPS for a while but then I moved it to WordPress.com to cut down on maintenance (I kept my own domain though). I wrote about a few academic issues that I'm passionate about, although almost all of the views and engagement was with my more how-to type articles.\n\nWith that being said, I haven't blogged in about 3 years now I'm thinking of ressurecting the blog as a podcast. Trying to keep up with the times!",

However, it is probably easiest to upload podcasts to a dedicated podcast host and then link it from your blog so you don't have to worry as much about scalability and bandwidth.",
