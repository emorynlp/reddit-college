  "title:": "PI removing funding due to low publishable productivity, not hours in lab",
  "text": "I'm spending a lot of hours in the lab like 60-70 hrs / week, but it's not being fruitful.\n\nI would like some advice on how to proceed with my PhD please. I entered the program and took 1 year and 3-4 months to finally settle down on a lab (no formal rotations) while taking classes and TAing. I have been in the lab for 3 yrs and 7-8 months and received RA for about that time minus a few months. Now, my PI does not wish to continue my funding due lack of productivity. This is not an issue of insufficient hours in the lab, not working well with colleagues or the PI not liking me as my PI said, but the fact that I have insufficient publishable data or a paper at this point. The main idea is that my grad student salary cannot be justified in moving the project forward to the NIH.\n\nWhen I entered, I really did not know much about the field so it took me a while to learn the background and learn the techniques in the lab. I was taking over one project and in parallel working on my own project using another methodology to find the same end goal as the first project. The graduate student I was working with graduated fairly quickly after I joined, and in the beginning I struggled working on my own on simple lab techniques when things went wrong and made the mistake of not going to anyone else. I have since learned from this and can do these things fairly quickly and go for help if needed. At that time I was told that I playing catchup.\n\nThe thing is that both projects involves 3 parts designing something in silico, generating the components for testing and testing them. The first project was designed already and partially tested, and last year, I successfully completed designing using the new methodology. The issues I am having are part 2 and 3. The issue with part 2 is that it's basically a time suck for me and it takes 4-5 days and has to be done repeatedly every few weeks - months as what I make is very little and goes bad/exhausted quite quickly doing tests. Sometimes I can take an entire month just on this. I've optimized a few of these conditions, but still can't expediate the process, but my PI thinks I should have solved this a long time ago with further optimizations, making little is fairly common or finding a solution in the lit. The part 3 tests are a bit more complex and I've had a tough time with this. One test is giving me fairly inconsistent data for years even after testing various conditions and testing components. Another is giving me negative results. Only one test that is done by the collaborator seems to be working. I've attempted to do 2 more different tests another 2 via collab, but only one of the collab tests seem to be working so far. I've also had a third smaller project that I had promising preliminary data on, but it was partially scooped so the PI has no more interest there. The first project also had a major hickup in which what was designed and showed to working wasn't what it was due to no QA being done resulting in a postdoc coming onboard to help troubleshoot and make what was working.\n\nSo here is my problem. I've been so heavily involved in part 2 and 3 now that I have neglected a great deal of reading. The inconsistent test has been wavering between inconsistent to consistent for years making it untrustworthy as the effect is very small. It works in papers with other's test components, and I've been trying to brute force this thing, but there's no one in this instance that could help. It may just never work or it could if I try a few more things. The PI suggested other tests, but said it should have been me to suggest them. Also because, I was so busy with 2 and 3, it took me a few weeks to actually do them and because I didn't fully understand it, I didn't design it well with enough controls, messed it up or did superfluous experiments the first time round.\n\nSo here's the rub. I think I can change by reading more, but I don't have any publishable work coming soon. My backup third project was partially scooped. The first project will have multiple authors with me unlikely being 1st. The second may or may not have things that test convincingly or may not even work though a few things look promising. My PI is saying that instead of using 2-4 tests, I could have already done like 12 in a year learning and doing a test a month. My pace is too slow esp for a 5th year, and I should have something published by now. If I go back to TAing (assuming there are spots) or worst case self funding, is the change realistic?\n\nedit: Also, my lab is off campus and my dept was fairly new when I started so I've not had a committee meeting until now when my PI forced one to talk about not funding me. Our prelim is just a unrelated-topic NIH proposal and that went very well and my PI basically asked why I'm not doing the same thing in my actual dissertation work. The answer is basically that I spent a month to read and write it up. I've not done that for my actual project. I've been grinding trying to show that things work, submitting things to testing or making more components in additional to weekly journal clubs, presentations every 8 weeks and doing the admin paperwork for $50k+ lab equipment purchases 3x. Sorry if I seem to be making excuses.",

Not getting publications makes you very expensive for them to be successful.\n\nI've talked to plenty of grad students who seem proud of the fact they spend huge numbers of hours in the lab as if this is badge of honor.  Only publications matter, I equate huge hours of time and no publishable results as a problem with the student.\n\nWHat can you do?  Well you can bail with a master's and I want to make the emphasis, that this may be to your advantage in industry even more so than a Ph.D.\n\nOr you can start over in a new program, or in this program.\n\nOr you can write a grant to self fund your grad student work. NIH has some grants for these: https://researchtraining.nih.gov/career/graduate\n\n\nHow to avoid this situation in the future.  Hold regular meetings with you PI and keep them apprised of your progress and any problems you might have.  THey are there to guide you, and if you don't ask for help they may not give it.....Better PI's will actually be more involved in your success...it sounds like your PI has failed you as well by not guiding you and giving you direction on when to leave a project and move on to another one.\n\nThe worst grad students I've seen spent months and even years, reading literature, planning experiments in detail and preparing to do things...but never did anything.",

You are literally told to keep progress reports as brief as possible because your program officer is busy. They are a rubber stamp during the grant period and do not care about the use of funds for a graduate student with productivity below expectations. \n\nWhat your PI is actually doing is trying to get you to master out without it making it look like he has some fault in this. Being sent to the TA mines is the beginning of the PhD toilet bowl. \n\nSince you are a 5th year your options are not as good as if you realized your PI was a poor mentor pre quals. So what do you do?\n\n1. Master out\n2. Engage with your committee and PI to put a plan into action now to get some data into a paper, while simultaneously fighting your PI to convince him that while this will be lower tier than his expectations, that you are his student and he should do right by you. You will need committee support, hopefully a member he is personal friends with to apply pressure. \n3. Join a new lab that has a project ready to go. Samples,  protocols, money. Plan for an 8 year PhD\n\nPush option 2 hard first. Use COVID if excuses and saving face are necessary.\n\nThere is a whole world of getting grad studies and lawyers involved in this type of stuff, but I'm not qualified to speak on it. I've only heard of people graduating after their PIs turned against them. Never got the full story of how they pulled it off.\n\nYou might also just not have the right stuff to be a PhD, but the system should do a better job of telling you that than after 5 years of satisfactory progress reports and committee meetings. Since the system loves it's cheap talented labor and lack of conflict, you should be given your degree like everyone else that goes this far, assuming you have at least met the graduate training experience requirements, not of your PI, but of at least an average student from your program.\n\nGood luck! I hope you will get to join the rank of bitter former graduate students with a doctorate.",

This would be the first committee meeting and it is to discuss withdrawing funds. Plus I am off campus.\n\nI've calculated that I've been in the actual lab for just 3.67 years. I've taken some time to learn the ropes and prep the experiments making mutants, but at least a large chuck of time was to work those additional experiments on the project that was partially scooped. My PI is no longer excited to publish this as this is no longer as innovative as before, but there may be some room there with a few additional experiments.\n\nWhen I joined the lab, they were in a transition after a move with a large cohort graduating. I've noticed that many were graduating near max 7yrs and only had 1-2 first authors and a few other sprinklings from collabs if any. This was why I had not been worried in the past. When I was in group meetings with collab PIs, they seemed to want to push out a few articles published and then try for a high impact journal.",

In conjunction  with having already graduated a bunch of students, they do not  need to graduate another one to look good for the tenure committee or their CV in general. I was hoping this wasnt the case, and you had that leverage in your favor. But you don't. \n\nI am sorry your committee hasnt been with you since the beginning, I was also assuming they were and thus had some skin in the game and would shoulder a little blame. \n\nWhat I see in your favor is that your research was scooped. This means it was novel research and publishable. The goal of a PhD. What you did is unlikely to be  a mirror of that paper.  My advice is to bring that up with your committee and see if you can add to that story for a paper that compares and contrasts the previous one. \n\nMy advice is to get your committee to commit to you making this your dissertation and to design  6 to 9 months of experiments to solidify it. Highlight the details for them in this regard.\n\n Grad school can be incredibly frustrating due to the lack of power. You can't force your PI to publish, to let you work full time on your project, or to even give you supplies to do your project... But I hope your committee can make a reasonable path for you to finish while you split your time teaching next semester. Even if that means they sign your dissertation and not your PI.   Go to them privately and humble yourself. If they dont help,  try another lab option. If that fails... it's one of those life is not fair situations.  But at least you'll get a masters. \n\nI believe your PI wants to move on and wash his hands of this.  He has graduated a half dozen already so he can't be the problem right? There is so much good advice in this thread about how to have the right relationship with your mentor and pursue a project from day 1. I wish I had read those comments 15 years ago. They are very good but don't help you now. They are gold if you start over or squeeze this one out and do a postdoc. \n\nAs an internet stranger new to this story I wouldn't personally believe a word he says from this point on. He already lied about progress reports. I hope you find an advocate and a commitment during your committee meeting. And, again, I suggest you lean on the data that got scooped as your best ticket.  Your PI wont want to publish that, but publishing and graduation are not absolutely linked. Getting a postdoc without a paper is another thread. Good luck!",

      "text": "Hi! First off, sorry to hear about your difficulties. It sounds like a tough situation!\n\nTypically, the most common reason for PhDs failing is a breakdown in communication between student and supervisor. This sounds like your situation - You've invested a lot of time into projects only to have your PI tell you he's not interested in some of these. You should have had some warning prior to this happening, either by meetings or emails with your PI which indicate he would like you to change tack, or to speed up, or to invest your time in some other direction. \n\nWithout a clear record of communication between you both, it's reasonable to suggest you thought you were heading in the right direction. As such, your PI/Committee should not be able to remove funding without allowing you some additional reconciliation period. This is usually 3-9 months (I'm in UK so may differ for you), in which you can produce some results and move the project forward. If you can't move it forward, you will Master out and leave the project. \n\nThe clearest way forward i can see is organising a meeting with your committee and your PI and explaining the situation. Discuss the communications break-down, and come up with a plan of how to salvage the project: weekly meetings with PI, weekly plans of what you will work on, what experiments you will work towards and which ones will you stop. It is imperative that you push this, and that you communicate regularly with your PI. \n\nI hope this helps in some way. \n\nAll the best!!",
