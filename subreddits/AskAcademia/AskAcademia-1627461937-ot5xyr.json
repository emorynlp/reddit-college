  "title:": "9 months in my PhD and my official project has yet to start",
  "text": "So last year in November I enrolled in my 4-year PhD. I am doing STEM research and my project is about imaging of biological tissues in high resolution. In my department a new type of microscope has been developed that should be much faster than conventional microscopes of the same type, so we want to tackle larger specimens and work on data challenges (the microscope will produce a lot of data as it is very fast).\n\nThe problem is, the company of my supervisor that should be finishing the commercial version is extending the deadline again and again. When I started, it was expected to be finished in March. It is July now and they say they will be installing in throughout August. Thought, with no guarantee that it will work without issues. I expect that I will be debugging it together with the company technicians at least for the first months.\n\nCurrently, I am writing a review about my research subject and an experimental paper on the detection method of the new microscope. The review is fine but the results of the detector aren't that great, i.e. the quality of the images seems to be inferior to what we would like to have.\n\nIt feels like we're a bit too dependent on the company for my project. I have my go/no go meeting for the first year in September so that would be a fitting moment to point this out. I am a bit worried that our goal of imaging an interesting specimen will be in jeopardy. Do you have any suggestions?",

      "text": "The concerns about being dependent on the company are valid and good to discuss and work up a back up plan with your supervisor. Don't worry that you haven't started your official project yet though. It is more the exception than the norm that students work on their PhD project(s) from Day 1. Students in my lab often spend the first few years assisting on various other projects, developing methods, etc, and everything that is actually in their dissertation comes together in the last 2 years (or less). With research, there are always unexpected delays as well. I remember the MRI I needed was suppose to be shut down for 2 weeks for maintenance and ended up being 6 months!",

          "text": "Good to hear that, thank you for sharing! I have learned a lot in the past 9 months already which will definitely help me with the 'real' start of the project. A senior PhD student colleague of mine is doing a similar project and we work together frequently to think about new methods and how to improve the workflow that he already has developed for his own project.\n\nMy supervisor already told me in the beginning to not get my hopes up too early, as the first version of the new microscope would be far from perfect and I would probably spend some time troubleshooting the system and improving it together with the company. But it seems like they want to do part of this themselves right now, so I will have to wait a bit longer before I can get acquainted to the system myself.",
