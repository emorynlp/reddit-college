  "title:": "PhD Supervisor missed a deadline, now candidate has to pay $15,000 and wait months before graduating",
  "text": "Hello all.  I'm asking this for a co-worker.  He has been working a full time job and writing to finish his dissertation in Linguistics. He completed and submitted well in advance of the deadline.  However, his supervisor was supposed to submit it to the doctoral committee before the deadline, BUT DIDN'T! Now, the school is telling him that he needs to wait until the next semester to graduate, and he needs to pay an additional $15k for that semester since he's no longer in the country (I don't know how that part works).  So, because his supervisor screwed up, it's going to cost him thousands of dollars and waste a significant amount of time. \n\nIs there anything he can do?",

However, these processes usually require the advisor to be involved and to be a real advocate for the student. If I had done this to one of my students, I'd be in the grad dean's office falling on my sword and trying to see what I can make happen. If your friend's advisor isn't doing that, then either a) his advisor's not a very good advisor and your friend is probably screwed, or b) you don't have the full story and there may well be a totally legit reason why the advisor didn't forward the work.

It exists for people to register milestones (comprehensive exam, dissertation defense) early in the term without registering in classes for that term.  He should speak directly to the international office about his options, and he should speak with the staff in charge of this paperwork (not his faculty mentor).  I'm a staff member in two PhD programs, so it falls to me to oversee this paperwork.  I've also seen students' plans go awry because they (or their advisors) ignore deadlines.  One was in a similar situation---dissertation chair took paperwork out of the country rather than returning to me to submit, and did not mail it back until months later---so the student had to delay graduation a term (he applied for and received this registration waiver).
