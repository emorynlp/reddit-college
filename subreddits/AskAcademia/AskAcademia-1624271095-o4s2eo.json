I'm (co-)supervising 15 student projects, spanning the bachelor to PhD level with students in 4 different countries, on top of which I have all of my normal collaborations that I should make progress on.

Do you some where you meet often and re-hash the same info, could you attend every other meeting? Or suggest to everyone that longer before meetings would give for better/more meaningful updates? Could you look at using shared project management online space for smaller updates?\n\nLearning to say no and manage yourself sounds crucial now, and will be useful for your whole career.",

That gives them practice writing and a nice record of their work as well. Then make like a shared office hour time for if they wanted to discuss the email in person? Zoom lets you setup waiting rooms that work really well for that. Also discord/slack lets you type chat in real time but also lets you decide to wait to respond, that may be better than zoom as you could multitask several students at same time.\n\nI had a super easily distracted student once and we ended up maintaining a kanban board that she updated and I helped her rank items on, my supervisor liked it so much he made one for a larger project I was on with him. It worked well for seeing yes they are progressing or no they've gone off into the wilderness. Also helped with the invisible tasks A is less important than B, but C is still yet more important but cannot be done until A is done.",

I've never heard it put like that before, and I must say that I agree.\n\nI guess my hope is that many of these projects will lead to student-led publications with me as the second author. Two of them have already. That being said, I certainly could have published more papers at this point if I did not spend so much time supervising. Perhaps though at some point this \"investment\" will pay off.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have already published 10 first-author papers in the top journals in my field, and I just secured postdoctoral funding for 5 more years (I just got a national fellowship, yay). So I also kind of feel like I am trying to demonstrate that I am ready for the next step in my career, which will hopefully be a professorship with funding for a group of postdocs and students. \n\nMy current plan is basically to use the next 5 years to apply to the best opportunities and stay put unless I get a really good one (unless my time starts to run out of course!).\n\nAnyway, not sure if the details of my situation change anything. Overall I probably should still dial back my supervisory activities and try to spend more time on my own projects.",
