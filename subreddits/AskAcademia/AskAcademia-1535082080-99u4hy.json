  "title:": "WTF. Why are my Engineering students so demanding",
  "text": "I work at a large research one institution. I\u2019m an academic advisor in a grad program in engineering.  I previously worked in this same position, but in education.  Most of my student population are international students (85-90%) whereas previously it was maybe 20-25%.  Also the majority of my students are males from cultures where women are traditionally not as valued as men. I\u2019m only saying this because I can\u2019t figure out if they are so demanding because of the cultural differences or because they are engineers. This is way beyond the norm of what I would call millennial entitlement. It\u2019s not uncommon for students to expect me to have their paperwork ready and returned to them within a few hours.  I will get multiple email requests in less than a business day asking about it. I have had requests for me to call other offices and have their paperwork moved to the front of the queue for \u201creasons.\u201d  One student asked me about a scholarship and when I referred him to a particular person making the decision he informed me that I could go talked to this person on his behalf. I informed him I have my diplomas and am not currently in need of a scholarship. The immediacy with which these students expect me to act is just insane. So what gives. Help me understand this before I snap and have to hide a body. \n",

      "text": "I teach in an engineering program with a high level of international students from many different countries. It is not necessarily a cultural thing, as much as it is an affluence level. Many international students come from pretty substantial wealth, and some tend to view professors as mere servants. \n\nYou have to check them on this behaviour. Once you do, the demanding entitlement tone tends to go away. \n\nThe international students from the same country that are here on scholarships tend to not project the same entitlement mindsets, which is why I refuse to chalk it up to entirely cultural issue.",

Students from low-income families are sort of rough around the edges, but are typically less sensitive to criticisms. They don't usually demand to see their essay scores until a *couple of weeks* later. Although they can be a little rude--I can't count the times a student shouted at or talked down to me during class discussions--they nonetheless seem to understand that lecturers have heavy work loads. \n\nAlso taught students who are in the upper middle class, some might even be from really wealthy families. (The type who drive their own cars or are fetched by family drivers. Some of these students are more proficient in English than in our mother tongue. One time, a slightly injured student attended my class with her nanny.) They are usually very well-mannered and tactful. They can also be sweet. At the same time, they are very assertive. They want to get the most out of their tuition fees: They would send me an email or text message (yes, text message) when they need clarifications about the lessons. That is, ofc, when they can't get the chance to talk to me during consultation hours. Like OP, I'd get asked about the results of their essays or long quizzes a day or two after submission \ud83d\ude02. (Note: typical work load is 7-8 classes a week or 21-24 lecture hours)\n\n\n",

Personally, I've dealt with extremely rude and demanding East Indian developers and recruiters. Both when I was hiring people and when I was job searching. They would literally *demand* that I do things for them immediately. I just chalked it up to cultural differences. I'm a man and still dealt with it, not to rule out misogynism, just saying it was the same for me too.\n\n/u/leejh06 advice about setting expectations is a good strategy.",

I worked and a much smaller private school (by my current state school comparison) and the wealth and affluence pretty much dripped off the entire student body. The parking lots were crammed full of luxury cars.  One of my students drove a Lamborghini, but it was a hand me down from her mom so... still worth more than my salary. I can say the attitude is similar but not so much the flash.  A lot of them still find assistantships and scholarships very important. I just always thing of the school as a regular school and so I didn\u2019t think of this angle.  Thank you for presenting it because it\u2019s very eye opening and helps me understand their perspective and expectations and manage them better. \n\nAs I said, I think they are really very nice in person and I love hearing about their homes and how they are different from here and if they like it here and just getting to know them...it\u2019s just this one behavior.  It doesn\u2019t help that it\u2019s my pet peeve so I may have to learn to be more understanding myself. I love being an advisor working with students.

My guess would be that the students in question are Masters students. Given the currency conversion rates the students in question are often paying a lot of money (esp for their home countries) for the degree and may often see it as effectively \"buying\" a service. (There is enough evidence to suggest that schools also, in turn, treat them as cash cows.) This also means that you are probably dealing with the richest kids in their home country (who are therefore presumably pretty entitled). Also, I think there is some amount of (unreal) expectation of more efficiency in the US coming from an expectation of the opposite of the bureaucratic inefficiency they have seen back home.\n\nAs far as your charge of possible sexism stemming from their culture is concerned, I may not be able to evaluate it fairly given that I am not a woman and I don't want to deny any part of your experience of perceived or actual discrimination. (Even though your crude and broad-brushed assessment of cultures does bother me). One way to confirm/assuage your concerns on that front may be to compare notes with a male colleague in a similar role.\n\nIn terms of concrete steps I think others have covered it.

The types and quantity of sexism I see aren\u2019t all that different between undergraduate STEM majors (I teach physics for engineers), and undergraduate non-majors (I also teach Astro 101). The pre-service and in-service teachers I\u2019ve worked with were invariably more professional than either the STEM majors or non-majors, but they were also majority female. \n\nBut I\u2019d agree that talking to your colleagues would be a great option here.

I could well believe that students from more patriarchal cultures will estimate that role to be much larger if their academic advisor is a woman.
