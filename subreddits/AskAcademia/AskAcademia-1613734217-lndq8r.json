The stress and isolation of the pandemic combined with high demands and tons of coursework at my program have worn me down to the point that I've been consistently falling behind with my coursework and thesis work for weeks now, if not months. \n\nSo, I've recently started drinking to cope with the anxiety and stress. This is not a road I want to go down, though, especially since I have no illusions that it'd somehow help me overcome the demands of grad school and finish my degree.\n\nHave you had similar experiences during your own life in higher ed, and how did you manage to climb out of the proverbial hole?",

      "text": "I developed a drinking problem after marriage and while completing undergrad and masters degree. I used it to cope with isolation and to cover up feelings. Therapy, although I resisted, was the most helpful thing for me in the long run. \n\nMy drinking stemmed from depression. No motivation. Alcohol, simply put, gave me motivation. It helped me through school. Or so I thought. I ended up with serious anxiety on top of depression. It was horrible. I was scared to stop drinking. Afraid of withdrawals. I was a mess. \n\nI finally went to an actual psychiatrist and got my meds straight and continued therapy. I\u2019m many years sober now. I have weaned off all of my antidepressants except Wellbutrin. I\u2019ve tried to get rid of that one but I have some sort of genuine imbalance where I revert back to needing sleep all the time without it. So I\u2019m okay with continuing to take it so I can have a quality of life. I\u2019m a yoga and meditation teacher. Have a wife and daughter. My practices and family both keep me grounded and well. Open communication with my wife was hard to develop but I eventually just had to become comfortable with sharing and feeling feelings. I found that many feelings I was trying to avoid stemmed from childhood experiences.\n\nI use light therapy every day. The light is called a happy light, the one I use. I run. I take cold showers and do breathwork. Basically every day is about becoming more mentally and spiritually healthy. I and those around me are better for it.",

It\u2019s my opportunity to reality check: \n- am I on an adequate timeline?\n- have I accomplished the previous goals?\n- what\u2019s my next task and how do I maintain a schedule that gets me there?\n\nMood disorders don\u2019t have to be so different! Get an excel sheet going, put your personal timetable into it week to week and use it as a visual cue. You\u2019re working in-spite of your anxiety... that\u2019s a tedious, exhausting task, so give yourself a bit of compassion and conserve some mental RAM where you can.\n\nThe addiction?

      "text": "Hi friend, 29F with similar story. Recently began therapy again for depression. Am scheduling psychological testing to determine whether there's more than just depression.\n\nMy story:\nFor me, prior to my mental health crisis, the stress of Research and PhD was the \"good\" stress and life was the \"bad\" stress. I liked research and usually perform well under pressure.. however, life stress confuses and scares me.. I had a bad breakup, unexpected pregnancy (was on oral birth control) and traumatic termination of that pregnancy, and then 6 months or so of catatonic depression.. I stopped sleeping, so I had no energy to exercise.. I didn't exercise so I had no appetite. I had no appetite so I didn't eat.. etc.. There was a period of 2-3 wks where I didn't shower or change clothes.. at that point alcohol was the only thing that allowed me to get calories and get sleep. But obviously the hangovers made work difficult. \n\nThe rebound anxiety after drinking 1-2 bottles of wine in an evening was unbearable. Meltdowns in lab meeting. Talking back to my PI. Doing the same IFA staining over and over and over again because it was the only thing that made me feel like I had some control.\n\nMy depression also affected my memory. For example, I was completing my qualifying exam in the middle of this crisis and would work all day on it. Then the next day I'd sit back down at my computer and have no recollection of what I had written. It was troubling and scary. I thought I was losing my mind.\n\nMy recovery:\nThe most important thing for me was finally reaching out to a doctor. She put me on an antidepressant. The antidepressant doesn't make the sadness or anger go away but it does increase energy and thus gets you off the proverbial bed of sadness. For me it gave me energy to get back in the gym. Back in the gym I was able to refocus on specific physical goals. Pushing hard in the gym allowed me to eat, and made me tired enough to sleep through the night. Also being in the gym requires me to see people - I live alone and work alone due to covid. Seeing people requires showering regularly. Showering regularly makes you feel better. It sucked at the beginning but now I derive so much pleasure from getting to the gym/in the pool/out for a run. Finding pleasure in things was something I never though I'd have again.\n\nAlcohol:\nIt seemed impossible at the time but im nearly 2 months sober (read: no alcohol ALONE - I have on 3 occasions had drinks WITH FRIENDS). I think back on how I felt in the midst of everything and to be perfectly honest I didn't think I'd make it this far. I don't look at my alcohol use as anything other than a last ditch survival mechanism. It really was the only thing I had to motivate me to get up, finish my work, and get out of the house. Being tipsy/drunk allowed me to have an appetite. Being drunk let me fall asleep. It was what I had. But it is addictive and the first four days or so after I drink I have strong cravings. I also smoke cigarettes so, double whammy. \n\nI cant tell you how I managed to be sober. I think it came down to rage. Once my antidepressant started elevating my energy I didn't need alcohol to motivate me, I had motivation on my own. Which allowed me to realize that, hey, fuck that dude who broke my heart, knocked me up, and abandoned me. I'm going to fucking tear shit up in the gym so I can beast mode my way through his skull. Or something like that. I was able to substitute my goals for my physical wellness for alcohol. But it wasn't easy. There were setbacks. I go on.\n\nThis coming Tuesday I have my work in progress for the dept. In the last two weeks, all of a sudden, I realized my mind was back. My data is actually good. My presentation is actually dynamic and interesting. Most importantly, it feels like me. My passion for my work is back. And that's a wonderful feeling after 8 months of gray.\n\nMy therapist asked me on Wednesday to write a letter to myself about how I feel now that I am sort of out of the woods. Something to read the next time I have a crisis. Something to tell myself that it's survivable. I guess this is that.\n\nAll I can say is - it NEVER feels survivable. It ALWAYS feels like the end.. In the words of Allie Brosh in her new book, \"Solutions and other problems\", the feelings we have of despair, dread, fear, etc... they feel like the end. So we lie on the ground and we feel those feelings drowning us and darkening the skies. We wait for the end to come.\n\nBut the end doesn't come. We wake up, hungover, anxious, depressed, but alive. As long as we live moment to moment, even though we are certain that the next moment brings death, we are alive. And as long as we are alive we might as well do something. And surviving is something to do.\n\nI survived by realizing the sadness, and the anger, and even the love and the joy, that I carry with me, are the things that help me navigate the world. When I lost my love and joy, and when I even lost my anger, my sadness kept me alive. It kept me alive long enough to get my anger back. My anger kept me going long enough to feel joy again. And now that I have joy, I think love isn't far behind. I know somewhere in you is a sadness, or an anger, or a love, that is keeping you alive. And as long as you are alive, keep on surviving. <3",

              "text": "I have gone through periods over the past 4 years like this. Not to sound trite but not having any weed around helps for one, and not buying any more (although while I write this I have a giant jar sitting on my desk LOL). To get some more control over my weed consumption, I first just would tell myself I'd only smoke at night, then from there I'd move it to just the weekends. Hanging out with people who don't smoke is a giant help for me too, because I noticed I was smoking everyday because I was hanging out with my neighbors who would invite me over to eat with them, we would smoke, and I'd waste a bunch of time. I try to just treat weed as a \"treat\" and not something that I use to *treat* my anxiety. I am seeing a psychologist too for the past 3ish years and working through some child abuse/other stuff from my past, which I think is the real source of my anxiety, not even my PhD. So I think I was self-medicating myself for that for a while. You may also consider switching to a high CBD, low THC strain so you just get the kind of mild wellbeing high rather than a full body or mind high (my friend also in PhD did this to quit smoking cigs). Good luck!\n\nEdit: I also think focusing on your health, ie exercising, cooking healthy food everyday helps too. I would get super high then go exercise, and by the time I'd be done exercising, I wasn't high anymore and could do work or sleep. I also adopted  dog to keep me happy which I think has done wonders :D Message me if you have any questions!",

I think my problem is mainly the use of it as a treat, since often times I'll convince myself to smoke early in the morning because yesterday I only smoked in the evening (which is the current dialog going through my head). I definitely use it to treat anxiety and likely depression, but I want to have a healthy, well-adjusted relationship with weed, and I wonder if that's possible. I feel like I lack the self-control required to make lasting changes. I'll succeed for a few weeks, then go right back to the normal smoking schedule. The lockdown isn't helping at all, because there's nothing to do and everything is so monotonous. Hopefully talking to someone about this can help figure out strategies to deal with the mental health problems, and it'll get easier.\n\nAs for smoking company, I agree completely. The one person I smoke weed with is my partner,  but he's been gone for 2 weeks, and my smoking has increased, not decreased as I had hoped. But I'll keep trying. \n\nI'll try switching strains, that's a really good  suggestion. I'm also considering going on actual meds for the mind, which might help this whole thing too.",

              "text": "Don't be too hard on yourself. When forming or breaking any habit, relapse is normal and it's not the end of the world. The key is getting back on the horse asap and not beating yourself up about it. One trick I found useful is pushing smoking as late into the day as possible. Once I was consistently on evenings only, I dropped it down to weekends-only and that's where I'm at now. Not picking up more than \u00a310/week since whatever I have I will smoke. \n\nAlso, if possible, separate tobacco and weed. Tobacco is incredibly addictive and compulsive and when I was smoking joints I'd often find that I was rolling up just in order to get the nicotine hit, without realizing it. When I separated the two and started vaping nicotine and weed separately, I could learn when I wanted one and not the other, and my weed use naturally dropped. Cutting out nicotine is imo much harder than cutting out weed, but it was years before I admitted I was also addicted to nicotine, so I was really trying to cut both out at once and that's much harder than it needs to be.\n\nBut, also, for me, I think there were underlying reasons why I smoked. Mostly to cover up the loneliness and also mental health issues. It was a coping mechanism, and it served a purpose. But, cutting out a coping mechanism without having other (healthier) ways to cope is naturally going to be difficult. For me, I needed to build a proper support network/circle of friends and learn proper self-care skills (eating enough and exercising a bit) in order to help fix the issues that weed was covering up. Otherwise, you might quit but you end up back in a position where it actually makes sense to go back to it. Therapy, also, for the deeper underlying issues.",

Last year I was almost a month sober, but then my partner came back home and everyday was a celebration with weed. The easiest way for me to smoke later in the day is to be out of the house, which I can't really do right now with the lockdown. I can go into lab and not smoke, but I have a hard time being at home with my bong in the next room. Its always in the back of my mind, even when I'm working and everything is fine. I'm considering getting rid of my bong for this reason and just smoking joints and nicotine-free vapes.\n\nI try not to buy weed, but I live in Canada and there are two dispensaries within walking distance, so its easy to just pop by a store and pick up a half o or pack of prerolls. \n\nAs for tobacco, I haven't smoked cigarettes in probably 4 years. But recently I've thought about picking up a pack. I don't know if I think it'll help with the anxiety/stress, but I get these weird intense cravings for a cig. I don't cave to those cravings at least. I have some self-control after all lol\n\nI use weed to cover up my own negative thoughts, and to avoid loneliness. I have great friends, but everyone's doing their own things and we don't talk often. My family doesn't really know about my mental issues, and we don't really talk about serious issues very often. I'm pretty disconnected from my lab and department here,  so the support is very superficial. I'm working on self care; I love cooking but I haven't been motivated to make any good meals, and I try to do yoga everyday for the mind and body. I've also started knitting to have something to do with my hands, but it doesn't feel like enough to replace the weed that instantly makes me feel okay, wanted, stable, neutral. \n\nI've scheduled reoccurring appointments with a counselor, so hopefully I'll get some insight and strategies for moving forward. I'm glad I'm not alone in this struggle",

But I've recently started seeing a cognitive therapist and he's been fantastic. Hopefully you'll have a better experience, but just to say that I've known a lot of people who didn't find the right person initially and were put off by the experience. If you feel it's not helping, or that you're not totally comfortable with your councillor or whatever, I'd encourage you to consider switching rather than giving up on the idea :)",

      "text": "I fell into a hole that I wasn't fully aware of at the start of my undergrad, and things got worse and worse over the next decade or so when something happened that made me realise I needed help. I went to counselling at my uni and have been in therapy ever since, as well as a bit later visiting a psychiatrist for diagnosis (ADHD and anxiety) and medication. It's been over a year and things are on average much better than they were, but there's still a long way I'd like to go, and I'm still having bad days/weeks (but not usually months any more!). My supervisor has been partly included where I felt it was needed, and I take semi-regular mental health days as needed. Therapy, as well as counselling for the actual life skills needed for daily functioning and PhD work, have both helped me a lot.\n\nI'd encourage anyone who was struggling to reach out, either to uni services, any student support groups, therapy, or see a medical doctor. Postgrad is hard enough as it is. I think having some close people to be open to is great if you have that (unfortunately I don't have a great support network, beyond my boyfriend and dog), but I know I never could have done it alone and without professional help and support. \n\nI was also on the start of a slippery slope with alcohol, but it got banned during our first pandemic lockdown so I decided to not stock up, and have barely touched it since. How much I relied on it scared me but I know I wouldn't have been able to tone it down by myself (without the lockdown alcohol ban). I've weaned myself over to some fancy (non-alcoholic) drinks that I can drink in the same parts of my routine that I'd have gone for alcohol. Weirdly it's working. But anyhow, I know a little of how you feel, and it's something that you can 100% find some help, advice and support for! This isn't something you need to figure out alone.",

I was also having a falling out with my roommate, so I started spending more time at the bar drinking, reading, and writing. Sometimes I'd chat with people. Other times, I'd just enjoy working alone to be out of the office and the house. It definitely took a bit of a toll, I was gaining weight, and my sleep quality was much poorer, but I backed off quite a bit and I'm doing OK now since I've graduated. I've seen others fall into a similar trap, and one guy would even come in to work super drunk and sleep in his office, completely passed out. It was pretty bad.\n\nAnyway, it happens. Just make sure to take care of yourself and find some other outlets to help you cope and deal with the stress. Maybe that means some zoom calls with friends. Maybe meditation and more time to sleep. Maybe hiking or a long drive or some coffee with a book.",

I\u2019m now in my 3rd year of my undergraduate degree but, up until a couple of months ago I was experiencing a lot of pressure and anxiety. I was drinking, smoking a lot and behaving recklessly to cope with the stress. At some point I realised that I needed some sort of system if I ever intended on finishing my degree. I started to schedule small tasks (e.g. one hour of study per subject on a daily basis). Through doing this it made the workload feel more manageable and, I would get those little bursts of pride whenever I would complete tasks. Eventually studying became easier and more enjoyable. I also started to use substances as a \u2018reward\u2019 for completing tasks. I\u2019d finish my day at around 7-8pm and then for the rest of the night I would be free to indulge in substances. There are a lot of little helpful tools i\u2019ve used to develop self discipline and to manage stress and anxiety. If you\u2019re interested, feel free to message me.",

      "text": "Yes, so much yes. Up until my first year of graduate school, I was racing through life, kicking ass and taking names. Got into my program with an advisor who had worked under some of the greatest in my field. Only to find out he had just completely given up on research and life. I didn\u2019t know any better at the time, blamed myself for EVERYTHING and started going to the little casino across from my apartment to have a few drinks and be around other people.\n\nNeedless to say, that spiraled out of control very quickly. Unknowingly at the time, I had undiagnosed complex ptsd from my childhood and was having severe panic attacks on a daily basis. My advisor was a huge trigger for me (I\u2019ve since left his lab). I thought I was losing my mind and slipping into a darkness I would not return from. \n\nMeanwhile, my regular physician (she\u2019s a NP) was attempting to treat neuropsychiatric disorders without a shred of competence and had me taking 3 different medications that all acted on the same receptors in the brain. Whooooooo man I really thought my next stop was going to be the psychiatric hospital or 6 feet under. Then to find out it was the meds, she could have killed me, and I was walking around with serotonin syndrome for a month. This was pretty much where I hit rock bottom.\n\nAfter 3 years of this torment, I was able to find an amazing trauma and addiction specialist, a psychiatrist who actually listened to me and I finally started receiving the treatment I needed. I\u2019m doing much better today, but grad school is very much intertwined in the trauma now and I find it difficult to still participate. I am learning that my whole world does not need to revolve around this. Publish or perish? Fuck that. I\u2019m learning how to love and respect myself and grad school isn\u2019t going to take that away from me anymore.\n\nThere is an army of people out here, feeling all the same things you are, and that are here to support you. Make sure you take care of you. That degree doesn\u2019t define you, don\u2019t let it. Take care friend!",

I sank into depression and I have gotten behind on my work for I'd say the past 2 years while seeing a psychologist.

My first year I would drink too everyday I came home from classes because of the intense stress, I just needed something to take the edge off and make me forget my anxiety. I really wish I had seen a mental health professional from the get go, but I didn't start seeing one until I was a year and a half in. Now I am coming up to the end of my PhD and while I am in a much much better mental place, I still deal with tons of anxiety about my work and progress and feel guilty for not being able be at my 100% for the past 2 or so years. I never went on meds because I'm just scared to, and my psychologist said talk therapy would be best for me. I wouldn't rule it out, and I might in the future. I still do feel emotionally worn down but at least I do now feel my emotions are somewhat manageable. Anyways, I hope my story gave you some comfort that you're not at lone at least, I obviously don't sound super chipper because I am mentally exhausted. Haha. But if you aren't seeing some kind of mental health professional, please do! That is what really saved me.",

I don't know which part of the world you are, but many universities have counseling and psychological help services. My first anxiety attack was before my qualifications, and I called the counseling services. Of course, they didn't give me immediate attention, but they interviewed me, and led me to a group therapy session with other graduate students at our university that is 100% paid by my student insurance. The group therapy didn't cut it, so I applied to counseling services again, they led me to a psychiatrist. I've been on antidepressants for 1.5 years, and they saved my life. People told me that I would feel woozy, or I'd feel like a zombie, but it isn't like that. It just gives you enough energy and mood to be able to cope with things that are very much harder to cope without medication. I also see an individual therapist every two-three weeks depending on the criticality of my mood. Three of them have. helped beyond any friend, family, or support system. So, if you have any possible help services at your university, apply without hesitation. They know best how you can overcome this.\n\nSecond thing I can suggest is [focusmate.com](https://focusmate.com). We are very much alone during the pandemic, and we need human contact. This is a website that matches you with another person for work or chores for 50 minutes. It's not for socializing or chatting, but after a couple of daily or even weekly sessions, you don't feel alone. It also has Friday Community Working sessions (which I'm on right now) where you can chat, too. A group of people meet, and work/study for 50 minutes, and then chat for 10 minutes. I'm on my fifth session today, and I've studied for 50\\*5 minutes, and chatted with people for almost 10 minutes. It's been so much fun. There is also a lot of pressure to make community working multiple days a week. So, you cannot feel that alone.",
