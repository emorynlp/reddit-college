  "text": "Dear Reddit readers,\n\ni hope you can give me some advice.\n\nI have a master in biotechnology. I worked on my 1st PhD project for 8 months. I like my project ,but I couldn't work well in the team so I quit. (Believe me, it was a nightmare, I cried almost every week because of lab politics and drama). I didn't give up and applied again for a new PhD position. I started my 2nd PhD project in another group, where my scientific background is quite different from what they do. They promised that I would have time to learn. But after 5 months, they shut down the project and convinced me to sign a termination agreement so that I would stop working within 2 weeks (luckily, I didn't sign). They claimed that I should have learned everything and be dependent within the last months, even a bachelor student could have done what I did. Anyway, I was played dirty and kicked out for no reason. It was quite a mess, even the university advisor told me so.\n\nSo I ask around and 1 professor agrees to take me in his group as a PhD student. But he doesn't have any funding right now. He can pay me a little bit but it is not a position (I'm based in Germany. Normally, you work as a PhD student and get paid for it). He will get funding in December, but everything is not 100% sure. I may have to apply for scholarship as well. It is quite risky since I am not German and need a residence permit. Without a position, it is difficult to get a residence permit. \n\nI also applied for jobs in the industry and got some interviews. Maybe I will get a well-paid job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? Do you think I should try the 3rd time with a PhD? I kind of lost my confidence after I was kicked out from the 2nd PhD. Meanwhile, I know that I'm not stupid (I graduated with very good grade) and I think I will able to make it. I'm just very worried about the risks of getting nothing after several months and having to return to my home country with no money left.\n\nThank you in advance.",

              "text": "Hard to tell how much of a red flag it is for OP without more detail, but in general there's a significant difference between having some funding now that won't last forever and not having secured funding from the start. For example, NSF grants are typically 3 years, so you can't expect there to already be funding in place for your whole PhD if you're going to be on an NSF grant. If a PI has 2 or 3 years to get additional funding there's a good chance they'll get it. If they have nothing now, it's hard to say how long it might take to get something, and it could easily be a year or two.",

Past performance is probably the best indicator of future performance in this area, partly because the grant approval process looks at that as a criteria. If the professor has received consistent grants in the past, you can reliable trust his word, but if he or she has a spotty record, then he or she is just saying it to keep you available to them.",

              "text": "If you take 'red flag' under the traditional meaning of a warning sign (and not necessarily a \"stop this immediately\" signal), it's because the funding isn't guaranteed. In U.S. programs, at least, it's common for doctoral students to get offered guaranteed funding for a duration of time during which they could reasonably complete the PhD, like five years.\n\nOf course, \"couldn't guarantee funding after X years\" can mean different things. My PhD program \"couldn't guarantee funding\" after three years, but when I pressed a little more, I found that simply meant the department couldn't guarantee to fund students on fellowship after that time - however, there were no students who had not found some method of funding to finish their PhDs, usually serving on other professors' grants or getting external fellowships or grants themselves to finish.\n\nOr, for another example, the place where I did my postdoc was a center that was funded via government grants; when I arrived they were preparing to resubmit the grant to get funding again, and talked in \"ifs\" and even made jokes about the center being shut down should they not get funded again even though it was all but a certainty that their funding would get renewed - because, after all, grants are technically competitive. Even as a new postdoc I was *never* worried they would run out of funding. There were so many grants hanging around to hop on.\n\nIn other cases, though, scientists are using the phrase it to signify genuine uncertainty about the outcome of funding. The catch is to figure out where on the spectrum your potential advisor is, and then decide how comfortable you are with that level of certainty.",

On one hand, some people are really lucky. I am not. That's the reality I have accepted over the years. On the other hand, I see many people are with much worse luck than me. So it goes both ways.\n\nAnyway, I would emphasize again \" Maybe I will get a well-paid job.\" this thought should come after you have received at least an offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood day!",

      "text": "I'm not in Europe so I'm less familiar with the intricacies, but on face this seems simple: the professor offered to allow you to study under him, but cannot fully fund or employ you; this lack of employment makes it dubious that you will even be able to study there (since you need the permit), but even if you make it over that hurdle you will be financially unstable. It doesn't seem worth it unless you aren't sure you can go on living unless you get to study whatever this professor is sponsoring you to study.\n\nIt's not about whether you are stupid or whether you'd be able to finish the PhD if given a shot; let's assume that you are not stupid, and that you could finish. The question is whether it *makes sense for you to do so*. It doesn't sound like *this* opportunity makes sense for you.\n\nHonestly, also, I would say that taking a less-than-fully-funded, not-a-real-position PhD puts you at a disadvantage in a system that already has disadvantaged you. This will be your third PhD project in what sounds like a little over a year. For right or wrong, a person who has gone through that many projects will likely be viewed with a little bit of skepticism. Quitting a toxic lab full of drama and politics makes sense and is common enough in academia; however, follow that up with you leaving another project within five months and being pressured to sign a termination agreement, and one does wonder at least a little whether you were truly unlucky or whether there is some characteristic of you that predisposes you to short, uneventful projects.",
