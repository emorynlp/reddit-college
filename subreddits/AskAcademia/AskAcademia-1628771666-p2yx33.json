  "text": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI have book contract signed with a big academic publisher as part of a long-running series. Finishing the manuscript, it's becoming clear that the book will appeal to a larger audience than just this field. The series is only tangentially related to the book topic. It would get more readers as a stand-alone.\n\nObviously I should have thought through this before applying to the series or signing the contract. Now that it's all said and done, could I ask (tactfully) about publishing as a stand-alone within the same publishing house but not as part of the series? Or just be grateful I have a good book contract and move on? Not sure how all this works.\n\nThanks.",

(Why would they even do that \u2014 how would it be in their interest?) This is YOUR book, FEEL FREE to be assertive about it. Especially when it comes to marketing and series and things like that.\n\nLook, if the publisher thinks they're going to make MORE money off of your book by doing it differently, that's a GOOD THING from their perspective. You are HELPING THEM.",

However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't talk to them, especially if you're in a position to offer them something quite attractive - ie a book with mass appeal. \n\nThey won't be insulted but they are a company - that means they'll be quite level headed about it (hopefully) and you should go in the same. It's a business discussion. They'll listen to you and say yes or no. Ultimately though you signed a contract and you will need to deliver up the goods if they say no.",

Hence \"not what's on the table here.\" You might as well explain their legal options if OP decides to murder them all. \n\n> What's the point of a contract if one partner gets to just decide to no longer fulfil their side of it with no consequence?\n\nAs I said, contracts frequently have explanations in them as to how to break them. If you do not know this, you probably haven't signed that many contracts \u2014 or read them carefully. Most contracts are not meant to be binding until death. \n\nAll of this is overly alarmist for what OP is asking about. Hence my attempt to correct it. Nothing personal.",
