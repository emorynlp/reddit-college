  "title:": "Finger and ear tattoos, if I want an academic career in Social Sciences/Computer Science?",
  "text": "I'm a first year PhD in Computer Science, and have a pretty decent academic record, and am well liked by my previous and current advisor, and already have a bunch of tattoos - nearly 30, with most of both my arms and hands covered. \n\nIt hasn't been an issue so far (as far as I can tell), but I was wondering if it might be in the future? I would like to stay in academia, ideally as a professor someday. \n\nI've been really wanting to get my fingers and ear tattooed (with leaves/flowers/small shapes), so nothing people might consider offensive, but some friends outside academia have been telling me to hold off, at least until I get my first academic position, but that's likely 5 years away (at the least).\n\nAny thoughts, insights, advice, experiences?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "No experience because I'm a nobody lol, but if your future coworkers can't accept you for who you are, then is that really the place that you want to work in long term? People can still get fired after getting an academic position and you don't have much power until well into your career, so how many more years are you willing to wait? I don't have a single tattoo but fully support people who want it.",
