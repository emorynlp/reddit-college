I resubmitted it recently, and it was accepted with minimal revisions at a very good journal.\n\nThis happened over four to five years.\n\nIf you believe in the paper and there are no fatal flaws then keep going.

If you have any other academic mentors in the department, they might also give you some pointers.\n\nEDIT: with STEM areas, I know impact factor of journals and perceived quality are a lot more important, and publishing too \"low\" could be an issue.

It's common practice that authors need to declare previous submissions. This would be incredibly hard to detect unless an editor or reviewer recognises it. I've seen this happen in 2nd-submission cases where authors haven't declared the 1st submission, and this is usually an automatic rejection.\n\nEdit: Another example from a higher profile journal:\n\n[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tcom/ieee-transactions-communications-information-authors](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tcom/ieee-transactions-communications-information-authors)\n\n\"a manuscript which is previously rejected by two different journals is not eligible for resubmission to IEEE Transactions on Communications.\"\n\nActually, at least several IEEE Communications Society journals have this policy",
