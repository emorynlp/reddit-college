Obviously, not everyone adheres to this policy, but I think it's a good one - openness should be established as journal/conference policy (or reviewer decision) rather than leaving it to individual authors who are likely to be biased in the reviews they choose to make public. That said, posting brief excerpts from the reviews is not uncommon, so maybe just do that?",

That is not a common practice (except for journals where open peer review is the norm), and readers of your work will not be expecting to see the reviews.\n2. You do not hold the copyright in the reviews, and hence you do not have the legal right to republish and distribute them. arXiv's submission terms require that either \"The Submitter is an original author of the Work\" or \"If the Work was created by multiple authors, that all of them have consented to the submission of the Work to arXiv,\" and you would not meet these requirements.\n3. Peer reviews (except in journals with open peer review) are traditionally confidential, and the reviewers would be quite surprised to see their reviews posted publicly. They would likely have written the review differently if they expected it was for a broad audience, instead of specifically for you and for the editors.",

As an alternative practice, I have started just introducing myself at the beginning of reviews, and then I don't write anything that I am not prepared to be held accountable for. Personally I think that unprofessional and unscientific anonymous reviews are fair game for citing, especially considering that nobody is being identified by name. If you are writing things in your reviews that you would be ashamed of if they were made public, then that's perhaps not the best indication that you are a constructive or fair reviewer.",
