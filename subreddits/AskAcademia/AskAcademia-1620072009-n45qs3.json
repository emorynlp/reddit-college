  "text": "My wife interviewed for a faculty position at R1 university about 4 weeks ago. Last week, the search chair told her that faculty members didn't come to an agreement for the decision yet. All three candidates they interviewed are great, so professors have different opinions. \n\nShe starts to think that the search will be canceled. Is this common in academia? Why don't they do a majority vote? Isn't it better than hiring nobody?",

The best fit criteria can range from what classes the person could teach, the specific line of research, the likelihood of supporting a particular agenda, and on and on. \n\nNot getting an offer is less about the candidate and more about the department. While it may not be easy to do, reframing the search process in this way helps. Your wife met the best qualified part by getting to the final interview stage. Now, the faculty/Dean/HR/Provost among others will make decisions that have little to do with your wife. There is nothing in her control now. \n\nThe political shenanigans can be ridiculous. But there are very legitimate reasons why very qualified people don\u2019t get an offer. We once had a search that came down to someone who would be a new asst prof with no experience and an associate prof from another university with a great track record (who also happened to be a good friend of mine). We selected the new asst prof solely because her research line plugged a hole while the associate prof\u2019s line enhanced already existing research. I was personally super bummed, but both my friend and I understood the rationale.",

I have told half-truths to backup candidates in faculty searches, not ones as stupid as this one would be, but still, something along the lines of \"waiting for a decision from the dean/provost.\"\n\nThink about it this way. If they were absolutely sure they were not interested in a candidate, there is no reason not to tell them that they have made an offer to someone else, or that they are no longer considering the candidate. So, your wife is at least still under consideration or a backup candidate. I would be wary of joining a dept that can't come to a decision, so if your wife has another offer, she should probably take it.

If we can't agree because they are all bad choices, then yeah we may avoid making a decision. However, it would be rare for us (R1 Southwest) to truly cancel a search because then we might lose the faculty line to another college. Most likely, we would open it up for more candidates before canceling.\n\nWorst case we would bring in the least favorite of our options as a way to hold the line.\n\nI",

Eventually someone who was part of the interview process in admin will simply make a choice and offer a contract.  It's very possible that they are negotiating with another candidate; but are keeping your wife in the game in case their first choice turns them down.  It's not a bad thing to wait.  It's also not bad to be the second or even third choice.  Let the chips fall where they may and keep waiting.  Its hard; but that's the only move right now.",

      "text": "First off, it's odd for a chair to volunteer anything about a search other than \"we're still deliberating\".\n\nBut in general, if they've been done for a month and aren't telling a candidate much of anything, there are three possibilities:\n\n1) They've made an offer to a candidate and the offer is being negotiated or the candidate is stalling because they're waiting to hear about another search as well. This is the most likely outcome. When you don't know yet whether your first choice will take the job, you stall the other candidates because you might have to offer to them if the first choice turns you down.\n\n2) There has been an emergency hiring freeze due to some new austerity budgeting that wasn't expected at the time they started the search, and the department is fighting to be an exception. This is relatively rare and generally happens only in public universities when state legislatures suddenly play politics and make a huge unexpected cut to next year's budget. \n\n3) The department is seriously divided and/or was only able to meet quite late in relative terms and has to have at least one more meeting to hash it out. This doesn't happen that often but it does happen--it's often a result of one group or another being very stubborn about their preference. This is the scenario that leads to a failed search at least some of the time.",
