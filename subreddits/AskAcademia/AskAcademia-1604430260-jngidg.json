  "title:": "What do faculty members expect when meeting with a potential graduate student?",
  "text": "I'm an undergraduate senior currently applying to PhD programs. In my field (Theoretical Ecology), it is common (and for some schools required) to reach out to potential advisors before applying so that they can support your application and accept you into the program as a student in their lab. So lately I've been reaching out to potential advisors and doing zoom meetings with them. However, I feel a little intimidated and confused by this process of basically committing to an advisor and *then* getting in to the program/starting a PhD. For one, while I've written up a strong research proposal (for NSF GRFP) and reflected on potential research questions, I'm definitely not 100% sure of the exact project I would want to pursue in my PhD. Also, while I have a general idea of the subfield I'm interested in, I'm eager to learn more about the other subfields and understand how various subfields relate to one another before becoming specialized in a single area. \n\nSo my question: what are these faculty members expecting when I reach out as a prospective student? Are they expecting me to have a clear, specific research question and be able to explain how it relates to their current projects? Or are these meetings usually more about generally discussing backgrounds/interests, getting a feel for the prospective student's curiosity and intellect, and seeing if the prospective student/potential advisor get along and communicate well.",

      "text": "From my experience as a prospect PhD candidate and interviewing incoming PhD candidates, generally the main thing the faculty members look for is a fit - is your research style in line with theirs ( independent or do you require constant supervision)? Are you a weirdo? General vibes. \n\nAfter chatting about your background and general interest, they may introduce a project to you to see whether or not you'd like it. Eventhough this can be one of many project you work on throughout the years, it should be your deciding factor (in my opinion) to join a lab or not. Your starting project will definitely set the tone of your PhD career and usually subsequent projects will be around the same concept so choose wisely!",

They're just unsure what specific *project* they want to work on. @ OP, I'm a current EEB PhD student, this is super common: hardly anyone knows exactly what project they want to work on when they're applying, and even fewer end up actually working on what they thought they would. If you feel ready for a PhD then go for it! Where you're at (in this respect) is extremely typical for EEB PhD applicants",

                  "text": "I\u2019m an EEB student too! For me, I knew I wanted to work in conservation genetics, but I literally had no idea how graduate school works. I went to a small university for undergrad that didn\u2019t offer graduate degrees, so I had never even met a grad student before. So in my case, I went for a masters to gain some experience before committing to a PhD. But I 100% agree that if you feel ready for a PhD, then just go for it!\nOP - as far as interviews go, I was pretty nervous as well when trying to find an advisor. When I finally got a phone interview, I prepared everyday for that interview thinking I was going to be put to the test. Turns out he just wanted to know my background and my career/education goals. He was just testing me to see if I\u2019d be a good fit for his lab, and from what I\u2019ve heard, that\u2019s how most of these \u201cinterviews\u201d go. \nJust a small tip: before you talk to a potential advisor, read the abstracts of a few of their recently published papers. This will help you understand what type of research they do, and will give you some good questions to ask.",

      "text": "I am in a different field (Psychology) but I have had different experiences depending on the PI that I was meeting with.\n\nOne PI (at an Ivy League school) that I talked to asked me for specific research questions, with IVs and DVs, my hypothesis/prediction, and how it related to her research. I was not prepared for this, but was able to sort of come up with something on the spot. We also talked about general research interests, questions about the program, etc. but the research question thing was a big part of the conversation.\n\nAnother PI I met with (at an R1, but not an ivy) asked me a lot about my interests, we talked about what projects she was working on and what parts of that I may be interested in, info about the lab and the school, and she flat out said she did not expect me to have concrete questions this early in the process. It seemed like she cared way more about personality and research fit than me being able to come up with questions on the spot (probably because you can teach research, but you can't teach personality connections). She is now my advisor and I feel really supported so I am glad that she focused so much on the personal fit.\n\nI think ultimately it depends on the school and the PI, but it never hurts to be prepared. Even tho this may be sort of an \"informal\" conversation before applications, this is the first impression they will have of you and will likely use it as they go into reviewing the apps and the interview process.\n\nedit: I think it probably also depends on the field. If you are admitted directly to an advisor vs. admitted to the program in general and doing some sort of rotation that may change how they approach the chats and also future interviews.",

Most of the phd positions are a full time,paid jobs here, which also means you are developing your proposal based on the grant which the supervisor already got. So freedom is limited. But we have external phd positions, which are a lot more open... So here we look at the scientific fit: is the potential supervisor interested, can he contribute or is it outside his expertise. We also assess a phd student as a potential collegue: is it a fit within our education lines, can the student contribute to other projects as well.",
