  "title:": "The 'Other' College Scandal: Grade Inflation Has Turned Transcripts into Monopoly Money",
  "text": "[Article link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomlindsay/2019/03/30/the-other-college-scandal-grade-inflation-has-turned-transcripts-into-monopoly-money/#62c0052e4182) (Forbes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the article:\n\n\"Consider these facts: A 50-plus-year nationwide study of the history of college grading finds that, in the early 1960s, an A grade was awarded in colleges nationwide 15 percent of the time. But today, an A is the most common grade given in college; the percentage of A grades has tripled, to 45 percent nationwide. Seventy-five percent of all grades awarded now are either A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reported in 2013 that \u201c66 percent of employers screen candidates by grade point average (GPA).\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation also has studied college grading. The Foundation confirms the alarming findings recited above. It found that in 1969, only 7 percent of students at two- and four-year colleges reported that their grade point average was A-minus or higher. Yet in 2009, 41 percent of students reported as same. During the same period, the percentage of C grades given dropped from 25 to five percent.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Under legislation proposed in the House of Representatives, the Texas \u201cContextualized Transcript\u201d bill calls for adding to transcripts the average grade given to the entire class for each of the courses on a student\u2019s transcript. This would apply to all Texas public, two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI teach a required course with about 15 sections that is loosely coordinated in our college. We are the notorious grade-inflaters, in part due to the nature of the course (i.e., it's not BIO101 or ECON101).\n\nWe've gotten the very clear, unambiguous message from the dean that our classes are too easy and need to become more rigorous (which of course would reduce inflation). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I resisted but now I see the point. It's not doing students any favors, and apparently many P&T committees are wary of grade inflation and student evals that are TOO high. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your universities doing about grade inflation?\n\n&#x200B;",

          "text": "Our very well compensated Dean recently told us to go easy on grades because students would simply go elsewhere to fulfill their core/general ed requirements, and \u2019we\u2019 would lose tuition revenue. This, of course, at the same meeting where he informed the college that a 15% budget redirection was necessary to give the incoming President a nice tidy budget with a discretionary surplus. The net result for our department being increased class size, class load, and liquidation of the adjunct/contingents. \n\nSuch neoliberal misery aside, I wanted to point out the peculiar tension between inflation and course assessment. As anyone who has taken an online teaching certificate course might know, there is a push for micro-transparency in evaluation. Every second of instruction must be aligned with objectives, outcomes, criteria, etc. Does that evolving, open-ended class discussion meet Bloom\u2019s taxonomy? Sure, this has a pedagogical rationale, in theory, but it also results in the students gauging their efforts a la carte, as everything reduces down to percentage of the final grade.  \n\nHowever, this transparency can be telling. In my writing courses, I employ a standardized rubric for essays, and judged strictly from the rubric the majority of students would be producing C-D work, i.e. average. Long story short, if I didn\u2019t grade on a curve, which is totally arbitrary (everything becomes a high or low B), there would be problems, as it were. The push for micro-transparency in evaluation is symptomatic of a larger legitimacy crisis that drives this grade inflation as well. ",

I can clearly point to what they did or did not fulfill in the objectives when they complain to me.  But I also expect an independent research project and an 10 page paper at the end of the semester. That is more difficult, because along with a rubric of requirements for the paper, I then have to actually evaluate their writing skills, strength of argument, methodology, etc. That gives a little more room for subjectivity. I still have to weigh the fact that most of them have never written in scientific publishing format before.  \n\nI guess I don't see why a grade shouldn't be  mostly reducible to meeting requirements?

      "text": "When I was in grad school I saw this primarily at the low end of the grade curve. In upper division classes we weren't really under pressure to give out good grades, but there was a strong reticence to outright fail people.\n\nAs to what we did to combat it, in freshman labs (the only lower division classes I ever TA'd for), there was a multiple choice final exam that was tightly guarded (no one got to take an exam or any scrap paper home) and variations of the same questions would be asked every term, so the relative performance of each class was measured and considered when assigning final grades. I thought this was a really good system, because it both helped normalize grades between different TA's and helped avoid giving students taking labs off-sequence an advantage by only being compared with students who'd already failed the lab once or more.\n\nThere were other problems with rich kids' parents complaining to the lab coordinator rarely (Yay California!) but for the most part this didn't help people. Though I do know of at least one escaping expulsion for cheating on exams because their rich parents threatened to sue the school. Got a chemical engineering degree from a highly ranked school without being able to do simple stoichiometry problems. There are other stories, but none that scare me more than that one. I also never taught them, but I knew several other grad students who did and eventually they were just told by faculty to pass the kid for that reason. That one is really scary.",

It's all a game, especially in Ontario where you have less than 10% chance of being accepted. Different schools weight GPA differently so you just have to plan accordingly. You want into uoft? Take all your hard courses (calc, orgo, physics) in the summer, then it won't count in your wGPA. You want into McMaster or Queens (I think it's queens anyway)? Save all your easy courses for your 2nd and 3rd year and apply so they don't consider your harder 4th year grades. Because of this game if you decide you want to try to get into med school after your first year it might honestly be too late. \n\nI also hate how they consider every degree equally.

Currently there are two unknowns, the class quality and the grading standard, but with a percentage-type grading there would be only one uncertainty (though it can be argued that this uncertainty would be larger than in the other system).\n\nDiscouraging cooperation is a good argument against ranking-based system. I come from a system where grades were determined almost exclusively by exams (and grading was pseudo-percentile-based), so people still collaborated with homework since homework was done mostly to learn the material, not for grade points. Still, I do see this model would not work for all majors (many have to be based on group projects more than STEM due to practical concerns) and it is absolutely not a silver bullet. Still, I do not like completely arbitrary grading either. I think the idea of publishing the average grade of the class is a good opening for this discussion.",

In many cases, they're as easy as they can reasonably be for that university and that course schedule. \n\nThe problem arises because HS graduates are so far away from having basic adult skills in numeracy, literacy, and IT. But the degrees we give them come with a sort of quality assurance, so at some point, they need to traverse the gap between their current skills and the skills needed to graduate. You can't dumb down the advanced coursework. You have to use the intro stuff to get everyone on a level playing field. So the intermediate classes have to be the biggest jump. \n\nThe first \"weed out\" class is basically just the first class where you move beyond revision of previous HS content and really start on things that are totally new. You're not tested on your ability to remember stuff from last year, you're tested on your ability to learn and master new content throughout the semester. The students have to actually study and learn if they want to do well in the class, and anyone who isn't up to the challenge at that point will fail all of the classes after it anyway. Others find the class tough but learn how to study and find the classes after that much easier, even though they're conceptually more difficult. \n\nIt's much better to have those \"weed out\" classes in the first 1-2 years so that students can change major/degree early on.

In my university you want to retain students in your class because (full professors, not TA's) get their salary computed partially on how large their classes are and how many of their students finish the whole class.  I have been told this but I am still only a PhD student.\n\nSecond, I have TA'd the same class for 5 years (once for my master's), and been paid to convert that class to a short-format 7-week class for online grad students. My class is lab based, technical, and usually has 40 students (which seems small until you realize it's a tech class and they all need help at once). Especially after working with the online learning people for months, I have really stressed to my students that I want them to learn the material and understand how to do this research. Every lab has a point and builds off the lab before, every lab has a rubric, and in theory all of my students could get A's if they did all the work correctly and wrote a good paper. I give them one optional extra credit assignment at the end of the semester. I don't support the idea of curving just to get a normal distribution--since when do people, especially grad students, come in normal distributions?\n\nI grade based on whether they did the work and turned in everything required, passed the tests, and completed an independent practical research project. My goal is to make sure that they understand how to use this tool to conduct research and use what they've learned to ask better research questions and work through difficulties.  I hadn't thought of this as \"standards-based\" until reading this post last night. ",
