  "title:": "How do you cope with anxiety about your academic future?",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm a PhD student with a little under two years left. Like many others in my position, I want to be a professor eventually. I feel like I'm in an ok position. I have an informal postdoc offer, some publications, teaching experience, etc, I don't think the details are relevant.\n\nAnyway, I'm constantly asking myself if I'm good enough, looking up other people's career paths, and pouring extra work in. Logically I know that life will be totally fine, regardless of my job in the long run, and that \"making it\" in academia isn't all that relevant to my happiness. But I can't shake the anxiety recently. Any tips for managing that?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone, this really helps and I will be returning to your comments in the future when these feelings are strong. :)",

Making partner wasn't my goal, if it happened it happened. Until then I'd treat this like any minimum-wage job, clock in, do work, clock out, and enjoy the ride doing cool analyses with interesting people. \n\nYeah except a dude with an M7 MBa and years of experience at GS is guaranteed a comfortable life somewhere. Same for a CS prof from Harvard.\n\nIt's cute to call a Harvard TT position a \"7- year postdoc\", but there are actual postdocs in this sub who have no idea where they'll be next year, or if they'll *ever* have *any* career in academia. There are others who don't have a choice in their work-life balance because their boss sees them as cheap labor. There are even more PhD students in this sub wondering if they'll ever even get a postdoc. The \"don't let work and worry consume you\" coming from a now Chair Professor at Harvard seems more than a little patronizing.",

                      "text": "Sorry for the second reply but if you're a PhD student I wanted to make sure you saw this. \n\nFailure to get tenure at Harvard and failure to have *any* academic career are two very different things. Not to mention that Dr. Nagpal is almost certainly exceptional, and hiring today is vastly different than it was in 2003. There is a good chance people following this advice will get nothing at all at the end of their journey. They'll probably transition to industry, work at a high school or end up in local government, etc. A few will go back to school for a more practical degree. \n\nIf you're honestly OK with this, then you should follow her advice. But please do not consider her path typical or think it has a good shot at landing a job somewhere in academia. \n\nOn the contrary, I've seen the opposite. I first encountered this article in 2013 when my adviser sent it to the entire lab. I thought it was the perfect advice and tried to follow it entirely. While other members of our lab were working 100 hours a week (I forgot my phone charger once and went back to find half a dozen of them working at 11 pm on New Years Eve; there was always 2-3 people there at 4 AM), I limited myself to normal hours. I also spent time branching out and doing cool projects with other departments. I have a pretty wide range of experiences but am not as focused as people who only ever did one thing. All these were huge handicaps in job searches.\n\nIf I could go back, I don't think I would change that. I honestly don't think I could live that 100 hour a week lifestyle, and I don't think I'd want to even if I could. But, the people who killed themselves all have far better positions today. The most successful of my lab literally wrote a paper while giving birth. She had the laptop in the hospital with her. The 2nd most successful got a copy of my advisers office key so she could sleep under his desk and not be bothered by security who would hound her if she slept at her cubicle. The correlation with sacrifice and success is very strong. It may not be fair to expect this of people, but that is how it is. \n\nIf you're sure you'll be satisfied by the journey and content regardless of your position, please continue to follow Nagpal's words. But don't be an idiot like me and assume that doing cool projects + a PhD guarantees you'll eventually find something.",

Sometimes, career anxiety is about self-actualization and fulfillment--if I don't continue on this path, will I feel fulfilled/happy with myself? And sometimes it's about finances--if I'm not employed, what will I do financially? Take some time to reflect, either by yourself or with a trusted family member or friend, about what in particular is making you feel unsafe when you think about your job prospects. Sure, it's the unknown of what the next few years will bring, but what \\*about\\* that unknown? The unknown paycheck source? The unknown day to day routine? Getting specific about what's making you feel unsafe will help your problem-solving brain do its job and reassure you that everything will be ok. Often, the solution to all of the uncertainty around job security is to have backup plans, which make the unknown a little less unknown.",

But we can only hire one person for a job, and there just aren't that many tenure-track jobs any more.

      "text": "Anxiety about the future is not the sole purview of the phd candidate!  You describe a very common set of feelings.\n\nThere are lots of strategies for coping with getting locked in on the future (or the past for that matter).  The one that worked for me was getting older and gaining perspective.  From a certain perch it is easier to accept that life is what happens when you are busy making plans.\n\nMy advice is to open yourself to the idea that your path in life is only something that you can influence and you will never have 100% control over it.  No matter how perfectly you plan, how well tuned your decision making process, shit will happen.  Ergo, \u201csuccess\u201d is how well you ride that river.  Do you get back paddling after you get dumped or do you take a break or do you quit?\n\nIt is so trite, but also so true, and quite possibly not helpful to you at all but... live in the moment to eliminate anxiety.  Anxiety is fear that the future is going to turn out differently than you want it to.  This certainty of disappointment is also known as life.\n\nThe Buddhists solution is to eliminate attachment, because they say all negative emotions come from fear of loss \u2014 and so if you are attached to nothing then you cannot lose anything.  Whether this internal state is an active management of state of mind or recognition of a deeper truth is unknowable.\n\nThere\u2019s also drugs I suppose, of both legal and illegal variety.\n\nIn the end I believe that everyone finds a different mechanism to cope with anxiety.  I don\u2019t think there is a magic bullet that strangers on the internet can know will work for you.\n\nAnyway, good luck and remember that this too shall pass.",

Your aim as a high schooler was to go to college. As a college student, you aimed to get into a PhD program. Those are both pretty straightforward and easy things to do overall.\n\nNow you're a PhD looking further ahead. Postdocs are uncertain and come with a definite \"cost\" that your PhD hasn't, the \"cost\" of being in insecure employment into your 30's. There's a very high chance of failure, and the path that so far has been laid out in front of you is no longer so well-assured. There isn't a single obvious next step anymore and the way to success on any path isn't well-defined either.

When I got my first rejections I got really anxious but now I\u2019m just trying to go with the flow and realise I can\u2019t control the systemic factors that have led to the job market situation so there\u2019s no point worrying.\n\nI now try to see the PhD as a thing in itself that I\u2019m privileged to have been able to spend part of my life doing, and if I\u2019m able to continue in academia that\u2019s great, but life isn\u2019t always about a perceived idea of \u201cprogress\u201d and moving up a figurative ladder. That kind of capitalistic mindset is what has ironically caused the marketisation and overall decline of academia anyway. In short, I try and enjoy it for what it is and remember nothing lasts forever. I\u2019m staying open to everything and applying for non academic jobs that in some ways would make me happier (based on location, work life balance, etc.) I left a different career to do the PhD too, which I think has helped me gain this sense of perspective.",

Even if you try to stay in academia, sooner or later you the supply-demand ratio for people in academia is way too high (too many PhDs, not enough academic jobs). And if you are like me and not willing to move to many different countries just to land a lecturer/associate professor eventually, then your job prospects in academia are even slimmer.\n\nI think what has helped me so far towards the end of my degree is to view the phD not as a degree or qualification, but as a job. A long compilation of group and individual projects that led to some research publications, and required a lot of learning on the job. I got paid for it (albeit very little), but it wasn't a waste of time: it was a contract job for many years. That way, even though I am very likely going to have to change fields after I finish, I won't need to feel regret or like I wasted my time.",

      "text": "Imposter syndrome is very common among people starting out in their careers (with \"starting out\" itself having a broad timeframe), and it's especially common in academia. One thing that stuck out to me about your post, though, is how you make comparisons to others. Don't try to compare yourself to someone with a well-established career, or even someone just a few years in who may have started under entirely different circumstances (e.g., pre-COVID, different field, applied to different institution types). Look at people closer to your reality, and also connect with them and share stories. \n\nI'm also a PhD student (part-time, hopefully finishing in a couple of years), and it's been invaluable having people in my program and others to commiserate with so to speak. That said, of course I'm not the expert on this or your exact situation, though I've had (and have) the same feelings.\n\nThis [video](https://youtu.be/5SXqqANUTIY) was created by a current PhD student at NC State University, and in it she talks specifically about dealing with imposter syndrome during COVID. \n\nThis [*Nature* article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02401-6) gives some tips on \"overcoming\" it during your PhD studies. \n\nThis [blog post](https://researchinsiders.blog/2019/05/23/your-imposter-syndrome-is-irrelevant/) has a nicely sort of flippant way of talking about it.\n\nEdit: I also endorse others' helpful suggestions.",
