  "text": "I have an offer for a PhD in a mediocre university (less prestigious than the one I graduated in). It's tied to a project that I find maybe interesting, but I know I'm not gonna be passionate about it. On the other side, in my country you can't really expect to win a PhD with your own project, because it's more about who you know and who wants you to get in. \n\nAm I ungrateful to turn down the offer and in case, how can I do it without offending the professor I got it from (who would be able to help me in future applications)?",

Is it likely that you will get accepted into another Ph.D. if you decline this one? Are you OK with the possibility of never earning this degree? Is it likely that this person would even be willing to support you in future applications? How important is prestige to you, especially given that it's perceptual? Even though you aren't \"passionate about it\" right now, is there a chance that you could grow to enjoy, tolerate, or learn from this project and/or mentor? If you believe that academia is \"about who you know and who wants you to get in,\" won't you be burning a bridge by declining this offer? Etc. Nobody here can give you an easy answer; this is something you're going to have to decide through introspection.",

On the other hand, it's pretty easy to develop a passion for even the most random boring project if you put a solid effort into it and take pride in your work.\n\nIf there is another project that you 100% know you would rather work on then by all means do that, but if you just have a vague feeling that you won't be passionate about your current offer I don't know if that's a good reason to turn down the offer. I didn't even know what my project was when I started so I certainly was not passionate about it, but I've still done good work and had a positive experience nonetheless.",

The exact opposite might also happen. I was in the situation as OP and went into a PhD in classics with a project that I wasn't totally into. I put a solid effort into it, but ended up getting out halfway because my lack of passion ended up with myself completely losing all interest in classics. I now work in a government department instead.",

      "text": "`in my country you can't really expect to win a PhD with your own project, because it's more about who you know and who wants you to get in.`\n\nI find this statement deeply misguided. ALL PhDs should be based on YOUR OWN project. Working on someone elses project is a masters. I think you're a bit misguided as to what a PhD actually entails.\n\nEDIT: I understand projects as a whole, but PhD students are(should be) required to generate their own questions, methods, and experiments. They aren't there just to collect data for their PI and analyze it. Correct me if I'm wrong.....because I would be shocked if that is what PhDs have become now.",

      "text": "Well, here's a few ideas. First, drop the prestige shit. It really doesn't matter that much unless you're talking top tier elite universities like Oxford, Harvard, etc. It's not beneath you. Good science is done in all sorts of places, so don't think something is beneath you based on some random metric. \n\nI don't know which country you're in and the policy, but in the US, at most Universities, if you drop out of the PhD program after your qualifications, as long as you've met the requirements for a Master's degree, you're granted one. As PhDs in the life sciences in the USA are funded, that's a way to get a \"free\" masters, but it's frowned upon. I wouldn't plan on doing that, but see if it's possible. \n\nSecondly, how familiar with the project are you? How familiar with the professor and the lab and such are you? The relationship with your PI is going to be incredibly important, and can make or break a PhD. If you start it, and you find it doesn't work, it's very possible to transfer within the university, or to another university, much easier than trying to apply fresh. Giving a project a chance is probably the best thing you can do, as you really can't know if you're going to be interested in it or not unless you actually get dug in, learn the current state of research, the bread and butter of the science you'll be doing, etc. You can be absolutely passionate about a project going in and then find a year in you hate it, and likewise, you can find the concept boring as hell, but then find it absolutely interesting once you get stuck in.\nI don't mean to be rude, but frankly, at the moment, it's pretty fair to say you don't know whether you're passionate about it or not, you might have an interest in it based on something you read, but you literally do not know enough about the subject to know whether it's something you'll hate or be passionate about until you spend time learning it. \n\n I'm seeing you focusing on very unimportant (in the grand scheme of things) parts and ignoring the important bits, such as whether or not you can have a successful working relationship with your supervisor, ask previous or current students how they work, and see how that feels, if you get alarm bells such as distant, never replied to emails, never proofread anything, etc., then take that for what it is. But a good supervisor can make a \"boring\" project extremely interesting.\n\nThe purpose of a PhD isn't to learn about a subject. It's to learn how to do research, and essentially saying \"I no longer need a babysitter to ensure my research is done properly.\" The knowledge you learn on the way is certainly a bonus, but it's not the purpose. It doesn't lock you in. Do post-docs in different fields afterwards to get more experience. \n\n>Am I ungrateful to turn down the offer and in case, how can I do it without offending the professor I got it from (who would be able to help me in future applications)?\n\nNo, you simply politely say you aren't interested, but thank them for considering you. The professor isn't going to take it personally, and if they do, that's a warning sign. You both have to find what works best for both of you, so they shouldn't expect an offer to be accepted simply because it was sent. As far as who can help you with future applications, the same people who helped you with this last round. Perhaps work a year in a lab you find interesting as a research assistant, and have that PI write a recommendation letter if they're comfortable doing so. \n\n>On the other side, in my country you can't really expect to win a PhD with your own project\n\nThat's pretty much everywhere, as that's not how that works. Generally, you'll develop your own project based on the focus of the lab. It'll be a very specific project related to the labs focus. You're using the PI's grant to do research on a certain subject, and utilizing some of that to work on a project of your own that'll be your thesis, but it's insane to expect you'll have free reign to just do whatever you want. If it's not within the scope of the funding for the lab, then how are you paying for supplies, your time, etc?",
