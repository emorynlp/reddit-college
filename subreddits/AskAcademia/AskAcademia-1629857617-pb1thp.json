  "title:": "What happens when you quit a grad program before even starting the first year?",
  "text": "Hello, incoming PhD student here, and I'm looking for a little insight. I'm entering into a PhD program next month but honestly am not feeling up for it. I feel burnt out after finishing undergrad and a Master's straight through and I know that I won't even need a PhD for the jobs I want to enter (the reason I accepted any PhD program back in June is a different story - but feel free to ask if you think that adds to context). Because the program starts in a month, I've resolved to try the program for the first year to see where my mental health/thoughts are by the end of that year; I know 1 year isn't enough to gauge how the rest of the program is going to be but figured it would give me a better understanding than where I'm at now.\n\nMy other concern is that my housing situation has amplified this stress. It's been a nightmare finding an apartment in the PhD program's area, even though it seems like my peers were all able to find something. In some way, I feel weirdly superstitious that this is an additional sign to not continue the program, but I also know that it's likely confirmation bias. I guess this was a long way of asking how bad do you all think it would be to drop out of the program before it even starts? I already feel ashamed and feel like I would be judged/criticized for leaving the program after a year like I originally considered. That shame and criticism seems like it would be crippling if I drop out before the year even starts, especially since they've gone through scheduling/organizing of my seminars, classes, and stipends already. Has anyone here actually quit a PhD program before they started their first year? How was the backlash from the university, faculty, and your PI? Do you regret your decision or is there something you think you would have done differently? \n\nI know I'm not supposed to care what people think, but I just feel like it would make a really really bad impression to quit a program before starting rather than a year(s) later (or maybe I have the wrong idea about that, idk), knowing that a lot of people know each other in this field.\n\nTLDR; I had planned to try a PhD program for the first year before deciding whether I should quit or not, but now I'm considering quitting before even starting the program. Have you quit a grad program before starting? If so, what was the response like from the program? Negative, positive, indifferent?",

      "text": "On the PI side, it sucks as we likely turned other students away for you and may have secured funds specifically for you that can't transfer. The specifics of how screwed we are in this varies by program based on how programs fund students. That said, better to take the loss now than have someone go through a year or more unhappy, unproductive, and ultimately leave. So yes, it sucks, but you leaving will always hurt us so decide sooner than later. If you just need a break, talk to them about deferring. This is a good option for me as a PI! \n\nThat said, it sounds like some fear might be clouding your decisions. Transitions are scary and overwhelming and in a pandemic it is even harder. See if you can talk to a therapist to talk through your decision and see if you are making a (sorta but not really) permanent decision based on a temporary circumstance. If you do decide to quit, make sure you have a source of income, housing, and health insurance!",

          "text": "Thank you for your perspective! That is one of the main reasons I feel so embarrassed to leave is that I don't want to disappoint my potential PI, and I feel guilty for having taken this spot to begin with when someone else could have easily started with much more enthusiasm and energy than I. I guess I didn't think about how it would be more desirable for a PI to take a loss early than to put more investment into a student that ends up dropping out.\n\nAlso thank you for that last part. Finishing a Master's project during a pandemic was absolutely exhausting and draining, and maybe I'm scared that this PhD experience will be the same from the get-go. Albeit, PhD journeys are exhausting in themselves but likely moreso during a pandemic. I've been wanting to speak to a therapist for quite some time now, so I think I'll have to do just that!",

      "text": "As long as your scientific field is not super small and tight knit, future programs wouldn\u2019t ever know you were even accepted. (Eg word probably won\u2019t get very far, there are a lot of students and programs out there). Yes they will be disappointed and probably a little pissed but if you explain it in a professional way they\u2019ll hopefully just be glad you didn\u2019t show up just to flame out later after they spent a lot of time training you. \n\nThe question is what you\u2019re going to do instead. As long as you\u2019ll be doing something meaningful  to further yourself in your desired career path then you\u2019ll have something on your vita and you\u2019re fine.\n\nEven if not, you shouldn\u2019t do a program that isn\u2019t a good fit for you.",

          "text": "I don't think my field is as small as some other fields out there, so you're right that word probably won't get very far. And it totally makes sense that they will at least be glad that a student quit before that student got a chance to use up more of their resources and time that wouldn't end up fruitful.\n\nIf I don't start/finish this PhD, my plan would be to go back home, take 6 months-1 year off just to recover from burn out and do more fulfilling things like volunteer trips for a few months as well as volunteering at non-profit organizations similar to where I'd like to work. That way, I have a mix of things to put on my CV in that time as well as do activities I actually feel like doing and would like to experience. Even if I did end up starting and finishing my PhD, this plan of 6 months-1 year off before working would be the same, so I guess it's just a matter of if I want to expedite this break or not!",

      "text": "To answer some of your concerns not already addressed by others: if you don't start the program, there should be *no* direct backlash. It would be highly unprofessional for them to say anything to you besides well wishes and concern for your health. Maybe later over beers they will vent to each other about how frustrating it was that this one student pulled out at the last minute, but that should be as far as that complaining goes. There's no reason for them to ever mention this to someone outside the institution unless you act really unprofessional as you say goodbye (like, if you cuss them out or trash their building or steal stuff).\n\nAt my institution, you pulling out now would be a bit annoying but we could cover what needs to be covered by the end of the week. Making schedules is hard because it's hard to fit together several people's restrictions at once, and if we'd done it without you from the beginning it would have been just as hard -- one person doesn't make a huge difference. \n\nThe loss of secured funding might be the worst part for us, but also this is just a thing that happens every few years. Every year there's a ~5% chance one of the incoming grads would quit before starting, and most of us know that risk is higher now with COVID screwing up jobs and rental markets.\n\nSo don't sweat the inconvenience to them. It's much more important to take care of yourself right now. If they respond with anything more accusatory than \"sorry to hear that, best of luck,\" remember that *they* are being unprofessional by doing so.",

I've been having this fear that if I quit now, they'll be more disappointed and pissed to the extent that they would not only vent to each other but vent to other people outside of the institution (i.e. my Master's PI, my undergrad PI, faculty in places I'd like to work [since there are parallels between the institution and where I'd like to work as the faculty working may have studied at the institution or with the professors at the institution]). But your comment has made me understand that my fear is unlikely and if it did happen, it would be unprofessional and a bit cruel.\n\nAll I can do is prioritize my mental health, not control the institution's response to me prioritizing my mental health.
