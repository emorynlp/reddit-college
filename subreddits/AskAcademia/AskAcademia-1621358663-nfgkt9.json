  "text": "I've got a lot of hurdles to get over before this really becomes an issue for me, but it's on my mind this morning and I can't focus on chemistry until I just ask the question.\n\nI'm a second year grad student who recently realized that I am transgender. I was wondering how name changes effect publication records. I've got a couple first author papers out already, and (as soon as I get some crystals) I'll be submitting another paper in a couple months. I don't know whether I should keep publishing under my given name or if/when I should switch to my chosen name.\n\nI am out with my lab peers, but haven't talked to my PI yet.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some reassurance from someone who has thought about these things before. I'm really new to understanding myself as transgender and it is very confusing.",

      "text": "Name changes are a bit of a problem and do make it harder for people to connect your publications with you. However, things are getting better. Some journals are enacting policies and APIs to allow people to retroactively change their names on their papers. Also you're early in your career so if you're gonna change your name now is the time. In addition, ORCID IDs allow you to ensure all your papers are attached to you regardless of variations/changes in name. I also think in terms of applying of academic positions you can explain it in the application, if you're OK outing yourself.\n\nThis is an issue for trans individuals but also for women who wish to change their name upon marriage or divorce. It's not ideal but as long as you're willing to be open about your former name you should be able to get round it without too much damage but definitely get yourself an ORCID ID.",

I already have two names there because one PI forgot to include my middle initial on the paper and I didn't catch it (I have a stupidly common last name). \n\nI think that thinking about potentially having to be that open with other people in the future is a significant portion of my anxiety about this right now. I just picked my new name this weekend and now my brain is betraying me and dragging me down all these side paths. \n\nYou are right. This is not uncommon, and it is still early. I'll for sure publish this next paper under my old name, then I probably have 8-12 months before it'll come up again. I can accept that and move on for right now.\n\nThank you! That was the prompting I needed to get unstuck.",

              "text": "I ended up coming out to my PI a few weeks before submitting a paper. The advice I got was to switch over as quickly as possible to maximize publications under my chosen name (though, of course, you should do what you\u2019re most comfortable with). \n\nMost journals do not require you to publish under your legal name, and you can set up a separate ORCID ID with that, linking to only newer papers. If you are able to change the name on existing publications, you can start pulling them in piecemeal. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019ll help if you want to be stealth later on.\n\nAgain, do what\u2019s best for you at the pace you\u2019re most comfortable with. I imagine you\u2019ve got enough on your plate as it is. Good luck! :)",

      "text": "I kept my initials, so 99% of the time, no one notices at all. There's a few publications that had my full name right up on the byline, unfortunately. I've been trying to get some of the all-digital ones to change it, but they generally won't.\n\nI made the shift in between getting hired and going up for tenure. I submitted a document with my tenure packet stating that I had changed my name and that all papers published as Name A or Name B were me. My chair and dean were very supportive and that went over fine.\n\nIf you end up working at a university that's not so trans friendly, you'll be in a tougher position.\n\nThere's real benefit in getting the switch done, but if you've already got first author pubs, then you're going to want to refer to both names anyhow, so don't let that force you to make a change faster than you're ready. A name change is fairly expensive (varies by state and other stuff, but about 1.5k) and involves months of paperwork - you have to write to or meet with everyone who has your name on file for anything: car loan, credit monitoring, license, insurance, library, bank, dentist, etc. It probably took me about 3 months to get everything straight, and I had a relatively simple case. Not trying to scare you out of it - a name change was absolutely the right move for me. Just saying, do what works for you. If you want to wait a year, wait a year. If you want it now, go for it now.\n\nLastly, feel free to PM me if you want to chat. Trans academia seems a little scary at first, but there's more of us out there than you think. Welcome!",

Very rare circumstance where someone is making an actual decision about your career and basing it off of Google scholar or Web of Science or whatever\n\nSo in that case the problem of a paper being missed is nil; you just put all of your papers in the CV or PL and there they are. \n\nHowever this might bring up another issue which is that you might not want to emphasize your earlier name once you\u2019ve changed it. Here there might be a bit of a problem, since it\u2019s typically difficult to get the journals to retroactively change publication names. I know that some journals are open to this but this is far from universal. \n\nI\u2019m aware of the issue that some who transition would like to remove references to the older name and I have heard in circumstances similar to yours that this presents certain challenges. \n\nAlso as other people have mentioned, services like ORCID and other disciplinary specific services can keep track of all of this. \n\nIn any case hope this helps",

We\u2019re saving up the ~$1,000 needed for the name change process. \n\nI\u2019ve been hesitant about publishing specifically because I haven\u2019t changed my name yet, so I really appreciate this post.",

I\u2019ve done this twice now for two peer-reviewed articles and it was super easy! It can be stressful to come out in the workplace, but (generally) academia is very trans friendly. Congrats on your name! What an exciting step.",

This includes but is not limited to marriage or divorce, religious conversion and alignment of gender identity. This policy aligns with that of and is supported by our publishing partner Wiley.*\n\nAGU continues to lead the way and I hope more journals/publishers follow suit.",

So I get to learn how to crystallize a highly reactive, light and air sensitive compound.
