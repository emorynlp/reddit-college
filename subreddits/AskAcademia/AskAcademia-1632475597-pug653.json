They get research training through a postdoc type of position. Think Anthony Fauci, the NIH NIAID director, etc.",

Often, nurses with PhDs and other doctorally-prepared health professionals are also not allowed to be called 'doctor' by their workplaces because of lobbying and pressure by the AMA, not because of their level of skill, education, or knowledge.\n\nAnd Doctor of Physical Therapy is a degree with full accreditation and scientifically-validated care. The controversy within physical therapy was whether the six-and-a-half-year degree they that they earned should be called a *doctoral* degree or stick with the *master's* designation, as some argued that the rigor of the degree did not match that of other fields with a doctoral degree - but that wasn't about the field itself or whether they are providing safe, adequate care. I don't have an opinion, but I'll mention that this same argument has been given for many non-medical fields: similar charges have been levied against the Doctor of Nursing Science/Doctor of Science in Nursing degree, for example.",

JD, DPT, PharmD, etc are not conferred the title of doctor in practice by their governing bodies, accreditation, and academic standing. That has nothing to do with AMA. \n\nNow, the fact that physicians and surgeons refer to themselves is also an open issue given that no other professional degree uses the title and it is historically an academic honorific.",
