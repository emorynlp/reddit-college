  "text": "So, basically, it turns out that I have the same name as a renowned academic, and now Academia is sending me non-stop emails about people \"having mentioned me on who-knows-how-many-hundred articles\", even though this is not actually me. I don't even remember what I signed up to Academia for, and I don't really care about this, but I'm just curious: is there any way to tell [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu) that I'm not that guy? Just asking",
