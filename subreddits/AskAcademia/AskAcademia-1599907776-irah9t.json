  "text": "I'm starting a PhD in two weeks time and found previously in my Masters write up period that my mental health went a bit downhill. I know that PhD is a long and hard period of time with lots of challenges and that PhD students have a tough time with their mental health. Does anyone have any tips/advice on how to go into the programme with a good set of skills to maintain my mental health for the duration of the 3-4 years?\n\n*Edit: Thank you for all the advice and tips, I massively appreciate it.",

      "text": "Good sleep hygiene is my number one recommendation. Go to bed at a reasonable hour every night and wake up 8 hours later. Good sleep is one of the best things you can do for your mental health. \n\nThen there's taking care of your body in other ways. Hydration, vitamins, healthy food, exercise. A PhD is emotionally and physically brutal - you spend all your time indoors hunched over a laptop. You have to take care of your body. Make sure to get out for short (or long!) walks, get some fresh air and sunlight.\n\nStart therapy now so you're already seeing someone you like when your first Very Stressful Event happens. It will happen.\n\nMake friends with other grad students. These are your people now. They're your battle buddies. They get what you're going through and commiseration will help tremendously. \n\nBuild into your schedule dedicated off-screen time. No screens at all. It's best if this is what you do right before bed (better for healthy sleep). \n\nDevelop a routine and maintain those boundaries whenever possible. For example, I have email notifications turn off on my phone at 7pm and I don't work weekends unless I have a big project. \n\nGood luck and have fun!",

      "text": "I would say managing expectations from your supervisor(s)/PI so that you don\u2019t put unnecessary stress/pressure on yourself is a good starting point. If you know what is expected and required of you then you can tailor your time accordingly. \n\nI also think that it\u2019s important to pace yourself and if you\u2019re able to, try to maintain a proper work/life balance because a PhD is essentially a marathon. Overworking yourself in the beginning will lead to a burnout and will not do you any good (personally learned this the hard way). Breaks are GOOD and don\u2019t let anyone in academia try to convince you otherwise. You don\u2019t always have to be productive and there will be times when you will be busy and other times when your workload will be lighter. \n\nALSO for managing imposter syndrome, I\u2019ve come to realise that putting people on pedestals makes it so much worse. Everyone is just trying to survive\u2014even your PI. After coming to the realisation that everyone is just human and no one knows everything, it made my life so much easier. And if you pay close attention, you\u2019ll see that even the best ask dumb questions that you can answer as a PhD student ;)",

Their preconceived negativity of PhD was so strong that the things they complained about were things that would be difficult in any job. I certainly noticed clusters of groups in the department who complain, and people who get on with it.",

Make sure you know about your universities mental health services and go there if you get a little low, don't wait until you're really bad. Maybe get a private therapist if you can afford it. Talk to your parents and friends about how some people have mental health challenges during a PhD and ask them to keep track of you.\n\nIf your supervisor is unreasonable or puts too much work on you tell them that immediately. Say stuff like \"the amount you gave me last week made me feel overwhelmed and it was a real struggle trying to work on it.\" Sometimes a good and caring supervisor can think everything is fine until the blowup happens.\n\nSo I guess that's the main thing, if you have a support network it's way easier.",

For you it might be this PhD, but it may not. For me it wasn\u2019t the PhD, although I had fully expected it to. I could go on about protective factors against mental health issues such as developing and maintaining a social support system, identifying a mentor, being aware of mental health resources available in your university and not being afraid to reach out. What worked for me was to brace myself for it. Expect a mental health crisis at some point, and build a contingency for it. If you never need to use it, it might come in handy should any of your fellow students be in need, in which case you would be prepared to help them. At the end of the day, there is much you cannot control. But what you can do is to control your perception and expectation of the future. Think of this doctoral journey in terms of it being only one small step in a series of life challenges that are bound to arrive and will test your mettle. The struggle itself will help you build resillience and will come to define who you are, and hopefully shed greater clarity into your purpose in life. Good luck!",

Enjoy coursework and try to make it work toward other long term goals (sections of your dissertation, maybe use it for publications) if that is how it works in your field. \n\nI would set up a system to take notes and streamline how you study and set up. I am in the humanities so I use things like Zotero, note apps (Evernote), resource organizer (Devonthink. I bought it with my first paycheck), and a word processor (Scrivener). Having a structure that you adhere to is better than racing to finish things constantly. \n\nTake mental health days. Everyone acts as though you need to work at least 8 hours everyday. Don't do this. I couldn't because I have a family but I watched cohort mates burn out in 8 months doing this. Most switched to 5 days at 8-10 hours or 6 days at 6-9 hours. \n\nBuild a committee that gets along with one another. Also, know that your advisor can be a dick sometimes. I just get past it.

Theses and dissertations take years; journal rejections will be numerous. Keep your eye on longterm goals and don\u2019t get impatient. Also, totally get a cat.",

It's not that you'll never need to go outside of that (you will) but it can be easy to to let yourself veg entirely during down time and this can snowball into having tasks built up, especially those outside of your direct duties (lab work, teaching responsibilities, etc).",

For me, it was really important that I relax on my weekends, that I don't work nights unless I feel like it, that I spend time volunteering, etc., so I did.  I might not have published as prolifically as peers, but I lived a life I enjoyed, and that was very important to me.\n\nI think the other thing that helped me was to take more ownership of my work.  I think when you've been a student your entire life, it's very easy to depend on your professors and evaluations from other people to decide how you feel about what you've done.  But part of being an independent researcher is allowing yourself to evaluate yourself.  So in the end, I didn't really care what my advisor thought, if I was happy with what I had accomplished, that was good enough for me.  (Of course, I wasn't always happy, but then I got to decide if my expectations were reasonable, or I needed to work harder, rather than having to worry about the same for my advisor.)",

Vitamin D3 - supplement this if you are getting less than 4 hrs full sun per week.\n\nThe above three things, helped me stay sane when things were at their worst. More importantly, it helped keep my sleep regular.\n\nLast thing - don't work late night. There is no part of this journey that you can fix with one or two late nights. Rather, instead of working intensively, focus on working consistently. In my experience, you only have 4 to 6 hrs of real hardcore research energy in you each day anyway.

You\u2019re going to be in doors a lot and missing out on sunshine. A SAD lamp can really help with that! A lot of ppl think that they are only necessary for seasonal depression but that isn\u2019t true. The sun helps everyone\u2019s mood especially if you have a desk job. I suggest using a SAD lamp instead of a regular lamp when working in the mornings.\n\nFinally, make sure that you talk about everything with your peers.

      "text": "Set boundaries.\n\nMake sure you and your advisor come to an early understanding about your expectations of each other. Learn what your advisor expects of you as a student with regards to work output and time commitment, and ask them what you can expect of them as an advisor. If they have seemingly unrealistic expectations, it's likely that you'll be able to manage them effectively without overworking yourself. \n\nCodify work hours and stick to them. Grad school is a job. Once you've put in your hours for the day, stop work and go be a person. Working more hours does not mean you produce better work, in fact research shows the opposite is true.\n\nTake weekends off.\n\nThere will be exceptions to the above, of course, for example your advisor might need a few paragraphs for a proposal, you may have a deadline suddenly change, or your experiment stopped working one week before a conference. There will be times when you need to crunch in a heroic effort in a short amount of time. Once you push through these times, take a three-day weekend. \n\nThe Pomodoro method and instrumental music work wonders for productivity, as long as you respect the breaks. Read up on this method and you'll understand what I mean. \n\nHave an exercise routine, even if it's just walking around the block three times a week. You don't need to get swole, you just need to stay active.\n\nEat well. Drink water. I mean it. \n\nTalk to people as often as you can, especially during pandemic times. I used to dread lab meetings, but now it's a time to catch up with friends. If your meetings are all \"camera on\", put on some nice clothes. \n\nGet a good ergonomic chair and do your work at a desk. Don't just slump into the couch with a laptop for 8 hours a day, you'll wreck your back. \n\nIt's okay to take a mental health day once in a while. You don't even have to take a full day off.\n\nA day wasn't wasted as long as you accomplish *something*. Anything like \"I responded to emails\" or \"I gathered the papers I need to read this week\" are good, actionable tasks that you could check off from a list.\n\nIf you make to-do lists for work, make them achievable and detailed. Don't put \"write journal article\", instead break it down into the individual steps required. You'll get to tick off more boxes as you go, and it'll be more satisfying to progress. \n\nMake to-do lists for real life, too.\n\nMultiply your predicted time frame for any deliverable by 3.\n\nNetwork, and take advantage of any career resources your university offers. Make connections that will serve you well when you graduate. I've seen several colleagues go through their PhD staying laser focused on work, and when they graduate, they have a useless piece of paper and no leads on a job. \n\nPick up a hobby that requires some sort of investment. I know money is tight as a grad student, but by investing money into something, you'll naturally want to spend more time with it. Cooking is a good one, you need to eat anyway so why not throw a few extra dollars into better ingredients and some cookware and make excellent meals? It's important to have hobbies because my biggest piece of advice is...\n\nYOU MUST GROW AS A PERSON OUTSIDE OF GRAD SCHOOL. It's easy to fall in to the trap of making grad school your only personality trait. This is probably the worst thing you can do while you're in school.",

      "text": "First of all, it's so great that you are aware of potential concerns with mental health in your Ph.D. program, because there is so much you can do proactively to both protect your mental health and increase your feeling of well-being. My suggestions to you:\n\n* During this transition period to your Ph.D. program, focus on becoming adjusted to your new program, people, and surroundings. Yes, there will be plenty of work and there can be some learning curves. At the same time, this is an opportunity to establish friendships among your new peers and get to know your new city, if you're moving. Some of that is harder in the pandemic, making it more important for you to be intentional in your efforts to reach out and build connections. Ultimately, having these connections is both good in its own right, and builds a network of social support for when you experience challenges during your program down the line.\n\n* Know what makes you tick. Maybe it's exercise and fresh air, maybe it's cooking special meals, maybe it's artwork or another hobby. Whatever it is that makes you tick, make sure you make room for it still. It can be easy for a Ph.D. program to feel all encompassing, but these are years of your life, too, and it is important to make room for your full self.\n\n* Know when you've done enough and that pushing harder will not help. There is always more that you can be doing, and finding the line to stop at can be difficult in my experience. But sometimes, staying up later to crank out some more work leads to sleep deprivation, which leads to feeling tired and having difficulty focusing the next day. Have priorities (e.g., what must be done now, what can wait) and find a balance between getting your hands involved in the kinds of experiences you want and that will help you to develop your career, while also being open to saying \"no\" when you have enough on your plate.\n\n* Seek out therapy. Notably, you don't have to wait until you're experiencing a mental health crisis to go to therapy. The transition to your program--which, while a good thing, of course--is inherently stressful, and that is reason enough. You can work with your therapist to have a place to process what happens in your grad program and build skills that help you to cope with the ups and downs of your program.\n\nCongratulations on beginning your new program, and good luck!",

Set boundaries on work and home, with personal goals that are separate from work goals (e.g. train for half-marathon, body-building, etc)\n3. Socialize.  If you're a socially sensitive person (e.g. rejection hypersensitivity, social anxiety, dependent traits) take it slow and set realistic expectations.  But continue to explore and seek understanding of yourself as a social being.\n4. Don't do drugs or drink daily.  Happens to the best of us, drugs become a proxy for more sustainable sources of positive feelings, or an escape from negative feelings.  This kind of short cut inevitably backfires.\n5. Check-in with yourself daily.  Ask questions about how things are affecting you.  Connect with feelings rather than sequestering them outside of awareness\n6.
