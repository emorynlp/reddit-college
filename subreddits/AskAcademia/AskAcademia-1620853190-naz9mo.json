  "text": "i\u2019m the kind of person who wants to deep dive into anything and everything- right from literature to economics. however, whenever i start reading theory, i end up getting overwhelmed and just shut my laptop down. the idea that i\u2019d soon finish a book that\u2019s been on my reading list excites me to no end- consuming me to the point where i\u2019m thinking more about the aftermath than the actual doing. i\u2019ve wasted months, probably cumulative to years at this point, because of this. i\u2019ve started questioning whether i\u2019m even actually interested in academia or is it just the image of an academic- being eloquent, interesting, knowledgeable, curious- that i\u2019m after. i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m the only one this happens to- but if it does, do you have any advice on managing it or arriving to a conclusion?",

              "text": "While it\u2019s good you are thinking about if academia is really what you want, I think you are putting too much pressure on your self as an undergraduate. When I was an undergrad, it was very challenging to read papers. It takes time to learn the jargon and get used to reading super dense and dry literature. Also making sense of complicated theories can require reading tons of other papers to get the whole picture, that takes time! Be patient with your self, struggling with the literature as an undergrad is 100% normal. Don\u2019t beat your self up. \n\nBut, if you feel like academia isn\u2019t satisfying your curiosities and may not align with what you want to do, that is also perfectly acceptable. Academia is tough, and the amount of work done by academics is often under appreciated and under paid. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right path for you, then don\u2019t pursue it. Don\u2019t waste time, money, and the opportunity cost of not doing something else of you don\u2019t feel strongly about it as a career. Just don\u2019t feel like you have to give up because your struggling with the readings, because that is 100 % as a younger scientist.",

          "text": "EDIT: \n\nComment ended up a little long for the context, only read if you have time, i apologise.\n\n>I feel like maybe you have an over-romanticized view of academics.\n\nI know what you mean, but there's also the opposite problem of \"commercialisation/industrialization\" of academics, for which the only cure is to become more idealistic and more \"romantic\" even. \n\nI'm in the lab i'm in currently specifically because i believe in the overall scientific attitude of most of those people in the lab - and if they didn't have an \"idealistic\" mission, i wouldn't want to work with them. I've seen labs/academics which go the other way, and fine for them i suppose, but i think they are the cause of many of the problems in the modern literature. Particularly in my field (medicine).\n\nThis reminds me of a story Malcom Gladwell (i realize it's not exactly the work of a rigorous historian) tells in one of his books. It's about how the Jewish lawyers came to dominate in New York. It talks about how northern/european lawyers used to dominate at the turn of the last century, and their antisemitism would keep out the jews from their firms. \n\nAs the most profitable kind of law changed, the poorer firms which the Jewish jurists had been forced into became the most succesful, as they had worked up all the expertise in this field.\n\nNow, that change in profitable law apparently came about because of a change in business culture, that saw the \"hostile takeover\" of economically challenged companies go from being viewed as beneath a good business man, to being anathema.\n\nThe only reason i like that story is that it talks about how an entire really field can have radically different moral culture associate with it, how a small very contingent event in history can change all of it - and how even when the end contingent event is in itself good (the failings of anti-semitic companies) the mechanism/contingency is morally unrelated and perhaps bad (the change in business culture). \n\nThe reason i bring this up, is that we too often think the course of \"science\", the way we publish, review, build theories, come up with hypotheses, the way they are tested, the way we do hirings, run labs, etc. etc. we often think of this as very meaningfully determined. It *had* to be this way or that way. When in reality 99% of it is culture, and very contingent on arbitrary historical events. \n\nWhat i feel is that we DESPERATELY need romantic/idealistic people to take science in the \"right\" direction (whatever they see as right). And so i think people like the OP, are very important. Being \"eloquent, interesting, knowledgeable, curious-\" are excellent ideals to strive for - and everybody is striving to \"be\" something. For a lot of the people i went to med school with, rich is in there. \"Famous\" is in there... respected... powerful... And i know they are in there for a lot of other academic fields.\n\n\nEverybody wants to \"be\" something. Wanting to be something that has a \"romantic\" teint might not justt be alright, but needed.",

Don't get me wrong, I love it, but it's also bureaucracy-heavy with lots of administrative and secretarial work, very stressful most of the time, and physically and mentally exhausting for about 9 or 10 months of the year (particularly if you're a tenure track or tenured professor, which I believe is tbe type of academic you picture). In terms of reading and learning: it's great that you have that curiosity. Do your best to keep it alive for as long as you can. Feeling overwhelmed  and even overexcited by some ideas is normal. Enjoy the rush!\n\nAs an undergrad you have plenty of time to decide what to do.

On the other, to get an academic job (which has become extremely competitive and difficult these days) and to succeed in it require you to finish projects.\n\nI would recommend talking to some senior PhD students in the fields that interest you - especially those who are in their sixth or seventh year (common in many fields, at least in the US) and are still struggling to finish. \n\nI also agree with others that it\u2019s easy to romanticize academia. I sure did. As a professor, I don\u2019t have much time for \u201cdeep dives,\u201d the way I did when I was a student. I spend a lot of my time grading (which is notoriously tedious and often demoralizing) or figuring out new ways to teach the same material that I\u2019ve been teaching for over a decade. Most of what I write or review for journals is highly specialized, which means that instead of exploring new interests I spend a lot of time just scrambling to keep up. Also, a lot of academic work in my field (most of it?) is pretty mediocre and mundane (I\u2019m including my own work in this category).\n\nAnd then I could write pages about how much energy I\u2019ve had to put into dealing with narcissistic colleagues. Most academics aren\u2019t narcissists, but it only takes one or two to make departmental life miserable.\n\nIf you\u2019re having doubts about whether academia is for you, I\u2019d strongly recommend listening to these doubts. Again, It\u2019s hard to get these jobs, which are disappearing and also not all they are cracked up to be.",

Besides that, I feel this need to get the PhD to prove something to myself.

You are right in assuming that this sort of generalist approach is not a good fit for academia\u2014I am currently finishing out a research masters in the social sciences, and will be terribly glad to move from this sort of work into more applied stuff. I started my degree thinking I could use it as a trial balloon for whether I would like a PhD, and I got my answer quickly\u2014academia is about specialization and churning out finished projects quickly. Not really my cup of tea.\n\nThere are a few things you might think about as reasonably erudite, but not academic, alternatives:\n- policy research: particularly in a small political office like a congressional staff, researchers often get to spend a few days or weeks on one topic before moving to another. This might provide the fast-paced environment you seem to want. \n- medicine or nursing: if you\u2019re good at science, these fields require very good generalist knowledge that can be applied quickly to specific situations.\n- law: if it\u2019s the writing and synthesizing you enjoy most, lawyers have to ingest lots of written information and develop cogent summaries and opinions about it.\n- educational interpretive work: working in a traditional grade school environment might require more structure and focus than you would prefer, but there might be opportunities in interpretation, such as historical or science programming at museums, parks, etc. that could suit your desire to communicate interesting ideas.\n\nI would note, however\u2014there are many people who get lower-level academic degrees such as masters degrees (and even a few who do it with doctorates!) who never intend to work in academia long-term. Masters degrees can improve your earnings and job opportunities greatly, for instance. So you may not want to completely discount graduate study just yet, particularly not having yet finished undergrad.",

          "text": "> Where do you find sympatico folks?\n\nSo the thing to remember is that, when you are an academic, fellow academics are not your friends - they are your colleagues. Friendships happen, sure, but expecting to be friends with your colleagues is not ideal from a professional boundaries perspective, and is also usually unrealistic tbh. Especially once you are working, everyone else in the department will likely be much older than you and in a different life stage, and also it's not a good idea to be bosom buddies with them because they hold power over the rest of your career. The other thing is, you might just not like each other as people, even if you have your job in common. And then, if you, like most early-career academics, are stuck in a small college in a one-stoplight town for the first few years, you're not gonna have much choice in friendships because there just aren't any people. In contrast, if you live in a big city and have some sliver of disposable income, your friendships with people of whatever stripe are limited only by your own sociability and willingness to get off the couch to meet people.\n\n\n> Doing things just because they are interesting\u2014cultivated leisure\u2014is mostly reserved for the wealthy\n\nThat's not strictly true. Leisure time and some amount of disposable income is available from the middle class and up (because it's one of the characteristics that distinguishes the middle class). This economic situation is much easier to achieve if you don't get a PhD. Adjunct and grad student poverty is real.",

      "text": "First of all, like others also mentioned, just focus on the undergraduate and do a masters and seek opportunities to get a better feel of what it's like to do research. For me, it was quite different than I thought, I thought I wouldn't like fundamental research and just tried loads of things. I worked as a research assistant for a while and that helped me decide.\n\nSecond, I THINK I have exactly the same, but missing a bit of info. I'm missing how you feel when you successfully read literature. And that might be because it hasn't happened yet, but I think it's the most important to find the answer to your question. Like I said, I do the same, currently in my final year of the PhD. I consider it a habit, that you just need to learn to efficiently apply. Sometimes, it good to stop and think about your expectations of what will happen after you read the article/book/any literature. Once you have more research experience, at least this is how it was for me, the aftermath thinking helped me formulate more specifically what I was hoping to find. Sometimes I have to force myself just to start, because I know I just need to understand more. It's a balance and it helps to look at it as a tool. \n\nFor me, it's a form of motivation. Sometimes it can be scary to start because it can be stressful at first to read things and understand very little of it. Just understand it's a process. During your studies you'll get more comfortable being uncomfortable with not understanding things right away. Give yourself the chance to see how you like the reading when you're better equipped to deal with difficult literature and see of you enjoy that process. In the end, I think that's what matters: if you enjoy learning more and the process that comes with trying to wrap your head around something new, otherwise academia is not a fun place to be in.",

Some of that stuff is interesting \u2014 the projects, for example, can be quite rewarding if that's what you're into doing, and there is a lot of autonomy involved in research and teaching \u2014 but it is not about being interesting and curious and all of that stuff.",

      "text": "While I agree with other commenters regarding your idealization of academia, I think you can find something that matches your interests in an interdisciplinary program. I am a PhD student in this type of program and it rarely gets boring because my research combines many different fields - ecology, political science, economics, sociology, etc. You can definitely find a research topic that allows you to explore different nuances and perspectives of an issue. If you are part of a collaborative lab/group, you will likely be part of different projects at the same time. However, regardless of general focus, every person in academia at some point has to sit down and read a shit ton and write. Since I started my program and especially with the isolation of Covid, I've really learned that I'm not so good at that at other people are. This highlighted to me that I need to look for alt-academic careers such as consulting and policy work. \n\nI don't regret doing the PhD, partly because I felt like I needed to have a greater understanding of my research interests, and partly because sometimes it is enjoyable to spend my evenings reading different papers and getting excited about how they connect with a cup of tea and my cat nearby.",

Think tanks, government positions, consultancy, journalism to some extent. \n\nYour experience might not be like mine but I got into academia cause I have a love/hate relationship with research. However I have so much admin work, I don\u2019t actually have time for research. And honestly speaking, all the bureaucratic bullshit is making me want to quit. I spend so much time in unnecessary tasks, that I don\u2019t actually have time to dive deep into whatever paper I\u2019m working on. On top of that, I feel like the pressure to publish ends up with people publishing just got the sake of publishing instead of curiosity. For ex, my department head publishes a few papers a year that are basically the same. Effect of a on b. Effect of a on subtype of b. Student perception of effect of a on b. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds negative. I got into academia with rose tinted glasses and I wish I had someone warn me. It\u2019s great that you value knowledge for the sake of it but academia may not be what you are looking for. Try talking to a few younger professors and TAs about their experience. See if you want work with them. Might give you a small taste",
