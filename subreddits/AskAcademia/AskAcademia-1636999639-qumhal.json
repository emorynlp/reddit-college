  "title:": "Masters level thematic analysis- struggling with finding themes and theory",
  "text": "My assignment is inductive so we weren't given a research question, just the transcripts, which are nurses who have transitioned into clinical research and their experiences on many things.\n\nI think I have some key themes that are large in the data but I don't know how I'll find theory for that, or if it's too descriptive and I'm not looking for latent themes. Even though the transcripts are VERY descriptive and factual y'know, there's not a lot I can read into. \n\nSo I thought: The challenges of adjustment and mitigating factors. Does that sound right?  Are those even themes? Another key thing is the similarities and differences of the jobs. Would differences just come under challenges and then similarities under mitigating? And then Idk what theory to have for that. I considered Holmes Social readjustment rating scale but i'm not sure how that's terribly relevant except that the scale gives a quantifiable number for the stress of changing jobs.",

          "text": "Yeah so, so far I've read it through multiple times and written codes like emotions, adjustment issues and those two things I mentioned (challenges and mitigators) seem to be the key. I've yet to fit all the codes in, but I know they'll fit. So I guess I've done it a little bit backwards when I should have tired to group codes together? I just thought of those themes and wondered if I could write a whole discussion on those with theory.\n\nI have read the braune and clarke before you ask lol",
