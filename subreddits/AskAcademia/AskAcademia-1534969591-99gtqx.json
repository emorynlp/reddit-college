  "text": "You don't have to (and I wouldn't want you to) sugar-coat anything, but jeez. It's really important to provide timely, constructive criticism, but many of the professors and grad students I know are really tactless. I've even seen people say something hurtful for the sake of saying something hurtful and then giggle about (\"oops! Did I really say that?\"). Even here on Reddit, responses in this sub and some of the others can be so soul-crushingly blunt. Is any other profession like this?\n\nI think this is especially important for junior academics: people need to know where they stand. Instead of just being nasty to them so they \"take the hint\" that they shouldn't be here, be honest yet supportive. Has anyone else noticed this, or am I just too sensitive?",

The process of critical selection to programs, and the way applications are done, tends to get a larger-than-average amount of people who are \"go-getters\", to put it nicely, who look after themselves. It's not everyone, but it's enough to notice. I've only seen one field, but this occurs in grad school, as far as I know it's also more common in the upper levels of management, in top levels of finance, etc. ",

Nooooo. People who would want to be nice in real life will probably be nice on the internet. People who want to be dicks in real life but can't because of social pressures can come to the internet and with the power of anonymity be nasty little son's of guns.\n\n> I've even seen people say something hurtful for the sake of saying something hurtful and then giggle about (\"oops! Did I really say that?\"). \n\nYeah, these people are just dicks. They're the kind of people who say \"Some people don't like me because I tell the truth\" which roughly translates to \"I enjoy being a dick and I kind of enjoy that people don't like me for it\". And these people exist everywhere.\n\n> many of the professors and grad students I know are really tactless\n\nConsider that they might have a different perception of tact and what constitutes \"blunt\" to you. Also I can't possibly say whether you have interpreted efficient and matter-of-fact communication as blunt/tactless. Without real examples we can't really say if you are being too sensitive. But beyond that, different people have different levels of social skills, and everyone will be dealing with different amounts of stress and constraints on their time. Between all of these things you need to be willing to cut them a little slack.\n\nTo address the tone of many people on the sub, depending on the nature and content of the questions asked people can be very considerate in their responses. But when people ask something that has (a) been asked a million times before, or (b) isn't really relevant to the sub/breaks the rules, or (c) shows no effort on the poster to understand their own question or try and find an answer (even just by googling) themselves, or (d) makes it clear that they are one of those students who thinks they've bought their degree/demands an A/acts like the world is against them because their professor won't break their back to help bump their grade in the last week of the course; well then people tend to lose patience and that is when they get a little snarky.\n",

As for academia more broadly, it's field specific like most things but there are really kind helpful people and jerks everywhere. Personally I think there is a connection between the way we think about what it is to be a very intelligent person and how this stereotype often comes with a competitive nature and disregard for others' emotions. It's just a stereotype. But a lot of people do put stock in it and cultivate their own image around that. ",

      "text": "There are two things I want to pull apart here; rude, and blunt. There is never an excuse for being rude, and fortunately I've experienced it relatively little.\n\nBlunt is a different issue. A large part of our work revolves around communicating clearly, unambiguously, and without flowery language or excessive length. We provide critical reviews of each others work all the time, and as such get very used to getting straight honest (hopefully constructive) criticism. It's simply a communication form that ensures the minimum amount of confusion, and the minimum amount of effort to interpret.\n\nIf I'm reviewing a paper I'm not going to try and prepare the famous shit sandwich (compliment, critique, compliment). I'm going to comment, on an almost line by line basis, on what works and what doesn't. And ideally that review should be considerably shorter than the paper it's reviewing.\n\nNow, in a pedagogical setting it's certainly better to be more supportive; when it's our students we (or at least I and my colleagues, I can't speak for everyone), take a great deal of effort to help students interpret that feedback to improve. What you have on reddit, however, is a situation more akin to grad students submitting their first paper; it is not obvious who has written the paper, or what level they are at,  and the reviewer is not going to make special exceptions. So the review gets written in exactly the same way as any other.\n\nFurthermore, frequently we see people post here who have an alarming disconnect apparent in the way they are viewing their situation compared to what the academic reality is. Sugar coating a response which points this out does nothing but obfuscate the point. Assuming people aren't being actually rude (see my first paragraph), then I am totally on board with being as bluntly clear as possible to avoid any possibility of misinterpretation. This is simply communication psychology; people can be defensive of the ideas they hold, and will grab any thread that allows them to cling to an idea when challenged. If you say \"this idea is wrong\", there is no ambiguity and they are left either trying to reconcile whether they value your opinion or not. If you say something like \"I understand why you think that way, but your idea is wrong\" what they can easily take away is 'this person understands my thinking', and not take the \"this is wrong\" bit so seriously.",

But it is a very important point. We get too many people saying \"I don't know what to do now that I'm 3 years in to my graduate studies and realise becoming a professor isn't a given\" to pussy foot around when people ask \"Can I become a top shot professor in obscure field X when I have some experience in other field Y and my GPA isn't great and I don't have research experience but I'll totally get it and also will I earn a six figure salary?\"... I mean, there's a chance. But also, no. Most likely no. A pep talk won't help here, it is false hope. Which they wouldn't thank us for 3 years later (assuming they even got to the 3 years later).",

We get \n\n* \"What did my professor mean by X?\" \n* \"Can someone give me guidance with this [incredibly vague] assignment?\" \n* \"Here's my brilliant idea about how to change [something in a field OP isn't involved in or has any experience in]\" \n* \"How do I become a professor?\" \n* \"Can I switch majors in grad school?/Going to grad school in different field from undergrad?\"\n* \"Chance me.\" \n* \"Help me find a program in Europe/Asia/another baffling large geographic region.\" \n* \"Where do I get funding?\"\n\nWith a lot of these questions, as u/skleats aptly put it, the social niceties can lead students astray. Outside of what they mentioned - how softening the blow can sound ambiguous, we frequently get people who simply don't want to hear what's being said. Especially on posts about entering academia or getting into grad school. I can't even tell you how many posts I've seen where the sub has provided \"soft\" answers and the OP has completely misinterpreted it to hear what they wanted to hear. There's no ambiguity with \"you're not going to get into a highly-ranked, fully-funded PhD program with a 2.X GPA, no research and no reference letters.\"\n\nI think also, without tone, posts can come across as more blunt or rude than the writer inteded. I had an extended conversation with a secondary school student on this sub a while back who ultimately accused me of being condescending. That hadn't been my intention at all, and none of what I had written sounded condescending to me - the student had asked an unclear question and had been unhappy with previous responses, so I had been asking more questions to try and parse out what they wanted to know - but they were terribly offended by both myself, and other commenters and ultimately nuked the thread. \n\nThis isn't to say that academics aren't blunt, or that this sub can't get nasty (because they are, and it can.) But I do think that a lot of the rude responses on here can be attributed to frustration: as much as I want to help posters, it gets irksome to give the same answers on repeat, and illicit the same responses.

If a person asks to change him/her for PhD admittance and the odds aren't looking good, then it's difficult to formulate this in a supportive way. \n\nBeing blunt is also very related to culture. The dutch have the reputation for being more to-the-point and blunt. Flemings have the reputation of being more shy. To the dutch, we (I'm flemish) can seem like people that won't tell you when we have a problem. To us, the dutch can come across as rude for being too direct. On the internet, you generally deal with a very multi-cultural environment. This combined with the aspect that the internet is textual (no body language to read/show) makes communication on the internet tricky. \n",

As secondary ed and even general ed have become less rigorous, then some of the bad habits that people have developed over time are arriving unchecked in the 300-400 (and Master's) levels.\n\nI know that I will occasionally have to do a \"gut check\" for students.  I have one who emailed me late last night about an assignment that was due ... late last night.  They hadn't checked any of the material they needed to, and they were basically completely lost.  They wanted to let me know if I would be \"an awesome professor\" and extend the deadline for them.\n\nThis is after they didn't come to the first week of class (M/W) and after not signing into our LMS the entire week.  In other words, they're asking for an extension on the deadline and already pushing the absence policy to its limit.  In the first week.  The primary excuse was that they were taking other classes.\n\nI'm not going to be rude to the student, and I realize shit happens, but in those cases, I am going to simply ask: Are you going to be able to do this?  Are you going to be able to keep up the pace?  It's not an insult to their intelligence or their ability.  It is simply me, taking a look at the gathered evidence, gathering some years of experience, and saying: look, this may not work out.  Are you sure you want to proceed?",

I have a mental list of \"warning signs\" where I think a student is displaying behaviors/ideas that will lead to poor performance in the classroom.\n\nSo, in this particular case:\n\n1. not signing into the LMS for the first week of class\n\n2. not participating/attending in the first week of class\n\n3. realizing, with hours to spare, that an assignment was due\n\n4. asking for a favor because it would be a good thing for ME, not them\n\n5. stating that they were overloaded in classes \n\n6. not looking for an answer where they would be located -- asking questions about assignments that are clearly marked and explained on the LMS, policies on the syllabus, etc.\n\nAll of these things combined to tell me, from experience, that the student simply doesn't have the time/energy to devote to class (especially not even bothering to log in to the LMS, which takes, at most, 15 seconds to just \"check in\").  There's no shame in that.\n\nNow, can all of this stuff happen and the student still do well in the class?  You bet.  But it's pretty rare.  So, I do advise the student to think about their workload, what they're hoping to learn, and so on, and make the decision from there.  \n\nAs for extensions, more generally, remember the same thing applies--the older the professor, the more students they have in their mind that have tried to \"game\" them.  It's easy to say to take a student on a case-by-case basis, but it's REALLY hard to do.  When you ask for an extension, you're swimming upstream against hundreds, if not thousands, of students in the past who have attempted to game/manipulate/threaten/cajole the professor--you may be asking for an extension just a few moments after another student has done the same with a clearly bad reason.\n\nI've always found honesty to be the thing.  Not flattery.  Not tears. Not threats (and, if you're a student, you would be astounded by the number of students in the past few years who have started to do this), not \"excuses.\"   Just a quick clear explanation with \"how do I improve on this\"?  And a simple polite \"please.\"  It will do wonders.\n\nAnd, if you don't get an extension, see if you can stop in for office hours with an eye toward the next assignment.  Show you care and are invested in your education--hell, stop in for office hours or hang out after class early on.  Make yourself known as a conscientious student.  Most (though not all) professors want you to succeed, especially if it looks like YOU want to succeed.  \n\nThat alone will make your path forward a lot easier, extensions or not.",

The erosion of tenure, combined with the precariatization of academic labor via adjuncts has created a dizzyingly vertical power structure wherein faculty at almost all levels have truly massive levels of power over those beneath them; and it is likely that they, too, spent time in the trenches getting sniped at and lorded over by the academics before them.  Essentially, people are assholes to the degree that their social structure will allow them, and academia lets its stars get away with everything short of murder. This is all conjectural based on my personal experiences, but things like the NYU lawsuit have me thinking about this subject more often lately.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Of course there are good mentors in all of those fields, just as there are in academia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also the person in your story was being a jerk.
