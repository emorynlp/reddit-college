  "text": "Posting with a throwaway....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSituation is this -- my spouse is also an academic.  After getting PhDs in 2012 (I am in social sciences), spouse got a TT job in the middle of nowhere US, while I struck out.  We had three kids in quick succession, I stayed home as primary caregiver.  \n\n\nThis past academic year, I worked at spouse's university just as a VAP filling in for the year after an unexpected vacancy that fit me.   Spouse was denied tenure and is done with academia, looking for a job in industry now, flexible on location.  I have been decently active with research, particularly with limited resources, and the fact that I was a stay at home parent for 6 years.  In the last year, I had three peer reviewed publications, including one that got a fair amount of press coverage.  However, those were the first publications I've had since I was a graduate student.  \n\n\nHow should I address the gap when applying for academic jobs in the upcoming academic year?  I've received conflicting advice from my mentors.  One of my letter writers told me that I shouldn't mention it at all, as it will make search committees think that since I stayed at home with my children that it will signal that I am not sufficiently committed to my research.  But at the same time, I feel like otherwise search committees will see a single VAP, and only a handful of publications post-PhD without accounting for the fact that I wasn't even employed as an academic for six years.  \n\n\nAny suggestions going forward?  Would this make sense for my recommendation letter writers to address, or should I cover it in my own cover letter?  I am female if that makes any difference here at all.",

I would suggest it's better to give the committee an explanation than have them make up their own stories.\n\nYour letter-writer's advice might be sensible if the situation were different (e.g. if you could just write \"2012-2017: Big Name University\" and not mention that you took 2014 as unpaid leave). But I think any committee that's going to have issues with spending time on kids is going to have issues with an unexplained CV gap, too. I suggest mentioning it your cover letter, but positively, as a statement of a perfectly normal fact. Don't be tempted to make excuses and justifications - you just encourage people to view it negatively.",

Having a child is a choice people make(whether that choice was to not wear a condom or an active one). Single people are being punished at my school for not making that choice, and hiring selection is extremely nepotistic and anti single.

And, if you applying to a university that doesn't understand this you might not want to work there as it might not be a good cultural fit for you and your circumstances. \n\nI suggest you continue to publish but look beyond academia. Practitioners who also publish can be, after about a decade in practice, much more attractive to universities. So see getting into academic as an ongoing goal, as opposed to a \"right now\" goal. \n\nMoreover, there is a lot of rationalizations happening in the sector right now,and there is some generational change slated over the next five years. This might open up more opportunities.",

I've been on two dozen (plus) search committees, typically with 100-200 applicants in the pools, and we *always* read the cover letters along with the CVs first. More applicants get dropped due to the letters than the CV, since most are \"qualified\" in terms of having the appropriate degree but many clearly have no idea about our institutional mission or are just sending out generic applications by the hundreds.

      "text": "Hello u/frozenthrowaway3,  \n\nFirst off, I thought I'd wish you the best of luck in your search. In many Social Science fields at my U, probably because they are not high paying disciplines, it appears that the few remaining boomers and a fair portion of the older part of the Gen-X-ers in departments are deciding to retire rather than return to face to face teaching in (possibly) Covid infested classrooms. With six retirements announced in the last 45 days, my department is looking for a lot of people to put in the classroom even this fall. (Though, to be honest, those will be adjunct or visiting, with TT searches beginning in the fall.)  So... long way to say, I think it may finally be a decent time to be seeking TT jobs in many fields. \n\nAnyway, I disagree with your letter writer and agree with those who say you should mention it. As a veteran of many search committees I would say that not mentioning why there is this six year gap may raise some eyebrows. My advice is to turn it into a positive. Don't devote more than three or four sentences or a short paragraph to it, but talk about how you've been able to maintain a research agenda and have a good publication record without having any U resources behind you while simultaneously working full time working a demanding job as stay-at-home parent raising three kids for six years. Stress that you've remained current in the literature and use your publication record as a venue to address how much more productive you would be with U resources behind you.\n\nHope this helps.  Best wishes.",

But with that and some pubs you'd be OK-- though people will want to know about the gap. I'd recommend figuring out some way to address it and putting it in the cover letter.

      "text": "I am not as far in my career as you, I am only just about to start my masters, but I was a single mom when I started college, and I have boldly addressed the importance of my role as a mother in every application I've submitted. I transferred to a fairly prestigious University for my bachelor's after some community college, and I would absolutely not have been able to handle the workload without the support and understanding of my professors.\n\nI am a big proponent of changing views towards working and academic mother's by not being silent about the role of mothering.",
