  "title:": "Why did you choose to work so hard to be a tenure track faculty if industry pays you more, gives you better work life balance (I guess?), and provides you with unlimited opportunities?",
  "text": "I finished my PhD in CS recently (my research is centered on AI). I'm researching about the differences between being a TT faculty member in academia and a researcher in research labs in industry (in computer science and AI). I  like research more than engineering and so I am more inclined toward academia. However, the industry jobs benefits are very tempting. Industry pays you more, gives you better work life balance (?), you can easily move to any part of the country (USA) that you want, you don't need to teach or write grants and worry about funding, and also most of the novel AI algorithms come from industry labs (such as Google Brain). What was the reason you preferred academia over industry?  I'm doubting my decision on staying in academia or maybe I'm just tired of being in academia and think grass is greener on the other side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all very much for your comments. I'm reading and following this. I like these comments way more than the cliche points and comments I could find online about the differences between academia and industry. Very detailed and relatable and eye opening, thanks!",

My research is purely theoretical and has only vague connections with any real-world applications, so nobody outside of academia would pay me a cent to work on this crap. I would have to completely change my research if I decide to get an industry job, but I like what I do so for now I decided to stay in academia until either I get a permanent job or they realize that it's a stupid idea to keep paying me.",

In my field in astrophysics, every single permanent job I saw advertised for several years asked for people doing observational work. People doing theoretical work literally had no options. Also since to become a professor these days you are expected to be some kind of academic entrepreneur (get funding, get prestigious publications, increase your indices, have lower people doing your work for you, advertise at conferences, be active in community engagement, etc.), doing highly technical over a long time period is basically a no-go and young people who do that basically doom their careers.",

Since professors are paid in part for teaching and service, it's possible to work on research that isn't necessarily aligned with existing trends, if one so chooses. If you're in a field that requires more funding in order to maintain a lab and support graduate students and postdocs, then yes, you might have to at least pay lip service to current trends, but even then, it's possible to have an important fraction of your work be more blue skies research. You also have the option of moving into different areas of research, funded by different grant agencies, which is virtually impossible within the confines of an industry position.",

If you can't get funding or a post doing that then yes you either change direction or you fail out. While governments and funders often have an agenda, no one walks into your office and says \"today you're working on this, and you need to do X, Y, Z\". Even if you do change course to align with a political agenda you're still the one proposing the research and choosing your course. In industry it's \"the company has decided to invest in this area, we want to investigate whatever and you need to do it\". The decision of what a company will work on is generally made by senior leadership not senior scientists.",

Only at bad or backwards companies is your manager telling you what to do directly. As Steve Jobs put it \u201cI don\u2019t hire smart people so I can tell the what to do\u201d. \n\nAny company that is willing to hire PhDs is smart enough to give them immense freedom on what to work on. There\u2019s an implicit trust that the work will be in the interests of, and for the benefit of, the company. But you wouldn\u2019t be working at Google unless there was something they did that interests you.

Almost all industry in my field is focussed on applied technologies, products or services that have a very focussed goal in mind and require very strict and regimented standards to get there. This means that there's often not a lot of room to stray and discover novel things, which mostly happens in academia and then is advanced by industry for an applied purpose.

                  "text": "Many of these people absolutely, 100%, would not want to do these other jobs. You are absolutely correct.\n\nBut being brutally honest, universities and employed professors are right now committing literal malpractice by continuing this charade of accepting way more students in their program than can get good jobs, and misleading people into believing they'll all get good jobs in academia, and providing zero \"plan B\" training/options/counseling. Why are these universities doing this? Mostly because grad students are pretty good and very cheap teachers.\n\nHuge numbers of these grad students absolutely cannot, mathematically speaking, get jobs in academia. And they have probably built up what I think is irrational belief that their lives will be terrible and they've failed themselves if they decide to go to the private sector. The truth is that there is rewarding work in the private sector, lots of nice people, a chance for higher incomes, and arguably a chance for better work/life balance.\n\nOne thing that I think a lot of people fail to realize is this simple reality: your happiness can come primarily from things outside of your professional life. Your professional life can, in fact, facilitate your happiness outside of your professional life (by giving you money that you can use to have fun and by maybe giving you more time to yourself to have fun). This probably sounds cliche, but I think there's a clear sunk cost fallacy with graduate school where you are prone to feel like a failure if you don't get an academic job, and so people stay in it too long to avoid failure, when they shouldn't avoid industry to such extremes.\n\nHere's a better plan, I think, if they feel like they **must** work in academia: get a job in the private sector for awhile. Maybe a year or two. Build a good reputation. Build job stability. Build expertise in the field. Then find a part time job teaching at a university in your spare time -- like night classes. Or maybe your professional job will let you take one day off per week to teach.",

I'd never tell an individual person they shouldn't follow their dream and I'm sorry if my post gave that impression. I've told lots of people before: when you hear this advice that it's hard to get a job, do not ever let yourself think that it definitely applies to you, that you can't succeed.\n\nFor all of the people who don't get jobs, there are plenty of people who absolutely succeed and get great jobs and so on. I know many people like this. \n\nBut I am afraid that you are more likely to not get one of these jobs. And so my advice is simply, for starters, be aware and realistic that this is a possibility (which you are). Don't lie to yourself that you can't be one of the people who doesn't succeed at finding your ideal academic job. Also, don't tell yourself that you have failed if you don't get a job in academia. Because if necessary, you can thrive outside of academia and be happy -- maybe even happier. \n\nI'm sure you're also aware, by the way, that there are numerous people who **do** succeed in getting a good job in academia and then they are miserable. I know some people like this too. So it's not like life becomes perfect if you just get that job.\n\nYou are also absolutely right that focusing on plan B would take energy from plan A. That's the hard thing. But again, just do not fall into the trap of feeling like your life is over if it doesn't work out. And maybe, if you can, try to find some skill you can learn simultaneously along with your literary studies work that could be useful in industry, maybe something that complements your research if possible. Maybe that's computer coding or statistics or using Excel or whatever. Either way, your writing abilities are a skill that will be valuable in industry in tons of jobs.\n\nEither way though, your degree will be worthwhile even if you don't get a job using it in academia, because it is enriching you as a human. And so regardless of what happens professionally, for the rest of your life you will get to use that deep inquiry of knowledge. You are also skipping out on all of the incredibly vapid and boring academic fields that so many people major in, like accounting or marketing or whatever, all because they think they need those degrees to get a good job. And then as it turns out, the people getting more interesting liberal arts degrees can still get great jobs in industry and -- as it turns out -- it was unnecessary for so many people to go through the dryness of business school.\n\nGood luck!",

But I've recently amended my advice; I tell them not to get a PhD unless they're OK with the idea of spending six to eight years getting the degree only to \"fail\" into something other than academic career, possibly just as interesting as academia.\n\nI changed it because I genuinely enjoyed parts of getting my doctoral degree, I learned a lot that I find useful for both my professional job and my every day life, and I generally value having the PhD. I love that I was able to spend six years getting paid (a little, but still enough to meet my basic needs) to conduct research on something I was passionate about. I think there are a lot of people out there who are similarly passionate about something and don't mind getting paid very little for a few to several years to study it.\n\nThe thing is, I just think most people should think of it as a first career, one that they will very likely leave after six to eight years. It's kind of like management consulting: the vast majority of consultants know they're going to leave after 2-3 years; very few are sticking around to become engagement managers or bigwigs. But the ones that leave usually find something really interesting to do afterwards, and there are many, many jobs that welcome former consultants because of the broad skillset they've acquired.\n\nI think it's pretty similar to the PhD situation, although with less salary and more debt: plan to leave. Expect that you will leave. Are you OK with doing the PhD for the sake of doing, and having, the PhD? Then go forth and academe; worst case scenario, you'll have spent several years doing something you really liked, hopefully somewhere you liked, and then can move into another career that you hopefully also like.\n\nBut I think that also means that I've adjusted my advice for aspiring PhD students, in that I think they should try to do non-academic internships (at least one) and spend meaningful time researching alternative careers while they're getting their PhD. And I also think that they should select PhD programs where they think they can thrive and be happy - no matter what that means to them - in addition to finding academic success.",

They steadilu erode the goodwill on which universities (and in fact businesses) run.\n\nFor example, I'm surprised by the stories from the US of professors who are being forced to teach in person and cannot require students to mask. Wherever I've taught (5 different European countries) it's been unquestioned that I can set the format of my course - so, even before COVID, if I decided I wanted to move the course online I could - and I can set the safety rules for my labs.\n\nBut I think there is still more freedom in academia than industry.

It really varies depending on where you teach or where you work.\n\n>And then there's the fact that a lot of people would rather be a leader in an academic department, with tenure and pretty much guaranteed job for life.\n\nThat's true! Although I have found industry to be more stable than previously advertised, there is always the risk that your company lays you off, changes your focus so much that it's unenjoyable to stay there, or replaces your manager with someone horrible. Also, at least within my industry, researchers rarely ascend to high leadership roles within a company - they can become leaders of research divisions, but I rarely see them advance to corporate leadership. (That could be by choice, though.)\n\n>And in a professorship/research position, you'll have significant power to control your research agenda. In industry, you'll do the research that they want you to do. Tons of people would take less money to be able to do exactly the kind of research they want to do for their whole lives, instead of the research that some big company wants you to do.\n\nThis is true, and something I think anyone considering industry research should seriously consider. You don't get the same level of freedom to pick your projects and your area could be changed or defunded by the company at their whim, sometimes relatively suddenly. If it's really important for someone to do research on exactly what they want, they should attempt to stay within academia if they can.\n\n>Related to the above, there is a not-naive difference that a lot of people see between research that benefits humanity versus research that benefits massively wealthy people. There's being a leader of some research lab that focuses on your research that primarily tries to help people versus being a researcher at a company where the goal is to use patents and legal mechanisms and a narrow research agenda aimed at maximizing profits.\n\nWell...this is where things get complex: sometimes those things aren't necessarily orthogonal. My research in the tech industry has health implications for millions of people (I work on assistive technology), and while it will help to enrich our shareholders, it also has the potential to support a huge swath of people in every day life. I've also worked on innovative approaches to educational technology that had me helping teachers and school districts figure out how to deploy lessons across multiple kinds of subjects.\n\nThe other thing is that \"industry\" is often used as a synonym for \"non-academia,\" and there are lots of organizations that are not academia but also not for-profit corporations: non-profits, non-governmental organizations, government agencies at all levels (local/city, state, federal), international aid or quasi-government organizations, etc. I know researchers that help Sesame Street make educational content for preschoolers; that track epidemics like the one we currently find ourselves within; that learn how to better apply curriculum across entire school districts; and do other kinds of research that \"primarily tries to help people.\"\n\nStill, a researcher in industry *does* have to be comfortable with the knowledge that their role is, primarily, to increase value to the company's stakeholders. They also need to carefully consider the company's history and reputation and feel ready to support, or at least live with, that company's mission and values.\n\n>Then there's the benefit of working with younger people your whole life -- being an educator -- versus not having that same environment in a professonal work setting.\n\nWell, that depends entirely on what you do after you leave academia.",

Basically academia allows me to spend my time doing the thing that I want to do and find rewarding, which is teach, without most of the challenges associated with teaching high school.\n\nWith respect to work-life balance: I have a huge amount of flexibility in academia -- as long as I'm not missing classes nobody cares where I am, and as long as I am teaching my classes effectively nobody cares what I am doing.  Yes, many tech companies have lots of flexibility but I'd suggest that they don't have the same level of flexibility as academia.  I'm able to do school drop off and pick up most days for my kids, and pre-COVID I could occasionally volunteer when they needed parents to help with an activity at the school during the day.  Unless I'm travelling I'm home for family dinner every night.  But that also means that I almost always open up my laptop again once the kids are in bed and work.\n\nWith respect to compensation: As a computer scientist I could definitely make more money in industry.  But I'm decently compensated where I am, have a decent pension plan, and the stability of a tenured faculty position is unparalleled in industry (and as somebody that likes stability this is a big factor for me).  The flexibility and freedom to pursue ideas strictly because they are of interest to me also helps make up for the lower pay.",

CS profs are some of the better paid 9 month profs at universities to compete with this. I'm \"losing\" money not being in industry but I make enough to be very comfortable. Most industry folks also don't get to pick the work that they do/don't actually have unlimited opportunities - they do applied research for a specific problem area/product at a company that makes money. It is a small group of researchers at FAIR/Brain/etc. that get autonomy - otherwise, you do research on products to help company bottom line. As for work-life balance, this depends on the company but yea, generally, it's probably less stressful than a TT position!\n\nOne downside of industry is that if a company decides to shrink its R&D or restructure, your job is WAY more likely to be cut than in academia.\n\nShort version why I did NOT go to industry - I hate product/applied research; I have real independence on what I work on; I love mentoring students.",

Salaries at Google are honestly not that impressive. Fields where industry is an option pay more in academia. CS profs at a research university can make 150k and up. Tech industry jobs that pay *substantially* more than 150k are neither easy to get nor do they have good work life balance. \n\nI am in Business. Finance profs can clear 300k. Could they make more on Wall St? Sure. But those jobs have crazy burn out! How many years can you realistically do that?\n\nI like the fact that I'll be able to keep doing my job for quite a while..I don't have an expiration date and I'm not going to burn out.

But I was on the hook for my own retirement to the tune of $25k if I wanted to live nicely when I'm old.  And its intimately tied to the success of the stock market.  Academia gives me a pension with no risk of losing it.\n\nAcademia has resources to treat their employees well and like a human.  Programs like that cost money and cut into the profit margin so are almost non-existent in industry.\n\n\nI won't get fired from academia because the University wants to increase profits by reducing costs.  Academia views you as an asset if you just do your job.  Industry recognizes you as a liability and cost that needs to be managed.\n\nIn industry, I was told what to do regardless of my skill set.

In industry, you research what they tell you to - obviously within your area. But the research has to produce tangible, profitable results. Also, 9 to 5 hours are expected for the most part. You can teach if you are near an institution and they offer contracts, but it will be night classes. The academic route is EXTREMELY competitive. This might mean several postdoctoral positions (slave labor) for many years until something is available. Once you do get an academic position, the freedom is wonderful (work hours and research freedom) but the expectations are high, grants are tough to get, and that pesky thing called tenure will loom and wake you up at night more often as it approaches. Post tenure, you can relax. But to make it that far takes about 10 years (postdocs + time being untenured). The academic money is good eventually and so is the job security, but the money was way better in industry. I hope this is helpful.",

      "text": "FWIW, jobs in industry in no way have better work-life balance than in academia. I mean, at least in tech-related fields (tech/software/games/AI)  the career demands are incredibly tough. I came from software, AI, and games, and am now a very happy Professor of Practice (no PhD). I can't even imagine someone saying that jobs in software/CS/AI have better work-life balance than in academia, unless you chose the most mind-numbingly boring no-advacement career job you could find.\n\nSo, I went the other way: spent 20+ years in industry, then came to academia. I'm a professor of practice, so I'm not really \"climbing the ladder\" in academia, and I expect that helps. My work-life balanced is inestimably better in academi than in industrya, even if my pay is quite a bit lower. I have the effective rank of a full professor, having just climbed a different ladder. \n\nFor me anyway, it's worked out incredibly well: I have the effective rank full professor in terms of class loads, committees, etc, and never had to do a tenure case.",

People who don\u2019t get academic jobs are quickly branded failures and losers\u2014 at least that is how my department operated. It\u2019s been 7 years since I graduated and I honestly feel like that whole mentality \u2014 while very much is what makes academia running \u2014 is terribly destructive. I\u2019m looking for a way out but it\u2019s not easy when academia is all you\u2019ve experienced for the past 15 years.",

      "text": "Couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, I came back into a PhD program from industry, after having spent several years working for a string of crappy companies. Academia seemed like a much better fit, If only because the autonomy and pay relative to my crappy industry jobs were much better.\n\nDuring PhD programs in my field, students are pretty much indoctrinated into the idea that a tenure track position is the brass ring. People who finish a PhD and go on to an industry position are generally regarded as failures.\n\nIt's an antiquated view, especially in view of modern availability, or lack thereof, of tenure track positions. But it persists in my field.\n\nWhat I found didn't quite measure up to what I thought I was going to find, when I finally landed the tenure track position. There was zero work life balance, I was working all the time. And of course, unless you land one of the coveted R1 positions, You're also often stuck trying to burnish your record so that you can trade up. So I was teaching a 4/4 load and trying to research like an R1 or R2 level faculty. Burnout was pretty much inevitable.\n\nI'm much happier in my current position, as a senior level person in industry. I can publish if and when I want to, because I still am involved in research, but my day today is much more mixed and varied. And I don't have to deal with student complaints and emails.\n\nI left only about a year and a half before the pandemic, as well. My decision has been justified almost every day, as I watch former colleagues of mine struggling with teaching in this environment, dealing with students, and seemingly just generally hating life.",
