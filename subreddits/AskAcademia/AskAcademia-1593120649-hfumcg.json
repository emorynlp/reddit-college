      "text": "We're having \"blended learning\"; lectures online, labs and smaller tutorials in smaller groups and socially distanced settings. They're also proposing having students in the same courses placed in the same accommodation to create their own bubbles. Great if they all get on, a nightmare if they don't and they have no respite from each other at home or in lectures.\n\nI honestly think things will fall apart as soon as people start having to traverse our building in large numbers. The corridors are barely 1.5 metres wide, the floorplan wasn't designed for one way systems, and there are going to be unavoidable crossing areas. And I can't imagine the situation is better in other departments. Plus this is a physics building, and provision of women's toilets is patchy; it'll be like a game of snakes and ladders trying to get to them.\n\nAlso I think it is beyond optimistic to think that students will stay in their bubbles.",

We're online fully in the fall but I'm sure once a new wave of the covid19 flu or another strain of flu hits next fall that they'll freak and probably put January through the summer online too.  \n\nThere's no way they'll be able to deal with some masks, all masks, people who will bring in doctors notes saying they have a medical/psychological reason for not wearing a mask but the school can't ask what it is due to privacy laws, numbers in a class, shared lab facilities, students unable to hear what anyone is saying due to a mask, and on and on. \n\nOne department said, by the time they take one class and divide it into three sections (for social distancing) then have the lab correctly wiped down after each section, that one weekly lab will take two days to run.  Now multiply this by all courses. \n\nAdmins don't realize, that often contractually breaking one class into three sections equates to three courses and thus violates teaching loads.  They don't have the money to hire the faculty to teach 3x as many courses. But like I said they aren't thinking things through and they have no plan.",

We disinfect regulary touched places in the rooms a few times per day and we wash our hands properly and often.\n\nAs far as I know, lectures for the students this year are entirely online, all off-curricular activities are cancelled. Meetings are allowed but with masks and a limited amount of people and with enough distance. Cafeterias are open but with limited choice, trays are prepared for us so we don't grab into the cutlery containers etc., and 50% of the seats are strategically not usable to keep distance.\n\nI think, after all, Japan is handling all of this better than initially thought!",

Japan could have done the same, and it could have been done just as orderly and efficiently as the aforementioned countries, but politics and the pending Olympics got in the way. To the credit of the Japanese people, though, the public response even without government aid was quite proactive and effective. \n\nGlad to hear things are being managed a little better over there now, anyways!",

Even when the politicians didn't act, the population did their part. We had no real lock down, despite the majority of shops closing and also universities asking their employees and students to stay home. This took between 1 and 2 months. However, restaurants were open and everyone could go wherever they wanted.\nHere, 98% of the people wear a mask, constantly! Even outside. Even in the heat and humidity. They dont complain, they just do it.\nOf course there is that 2ish % that doesn't give a shit, but this is a faw lower number than anywhere I see on the news.\nOverall, at last I'm very happy I got stuck in Japan than in almost any other country!",

It is hard for the students to focus, it is hard to feel the connection that is such a big part of learning, it is hard for students to feel the sense of shared purpose and structure that helps them get work done. I think big proponents of online teaching think learning is \\*just\\* information transfer. Which....it is, but that's only a fraction of the reasons college is valuable. I want to be clear, it is not worth people \\*dying\\* for me to teach in person, but what we do IS important and a lot of that is lost in an online-only situation.

All classes larger than 15 or so will be online, including labs (not ideal when you\u2019re teaching conservation biology...) and smaller classes are meeting in person with masks and social distancing. Lab work can resume as long as precautions are put in place. We\u2019ve all been advised to be prepared to transition to fully online if the need arises again, which seems possible. I\u2019m immunosuppressed so I was really nervous, but everything I\u2019m taking is online and my adviser (who I\u2019m TAing for) has made it clear I\u2019m not expected back in person until there\u2019s a vaccine.",

All physical science labs are being completed in person but following social distancing protocols. We\u2019re forcing masks for anyone setting foot on campus, limiting the number of people in any given room at one time, and ensuring that each classroom is sanitized after use. All great in theory. Of course, Arizona is now a hot spot of COVID activity so my guess is that it all gets tossed out the window, many of our physical sciences are cancelled, and we go fully online.",
