  "text": "I\u2019m a fourth year PhD student in a neuroscience program. I\u2019ve started feeling this weird impostor syndrome... or maybe it\u2019s real, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but I don\u2019t feel \u201cpassionate\u201d enough about science to be a scientist. I\u2019m happy to do work when I work, I like attending talks and reading papers, but I don\u2019t like to work weekends unless I have something time sensitive. I don\u2019t seek out science in my free time (I enjoy listening to podcasts but I have never wanted to listen to a science one) and I never grew up liking science fiction. I\u2019m super confused about what I want to do post-PhD \u2014 I\u2019m not sure about academia, I\u2019d like to explore positions in industry/data science but I haven\u2019t ruled anything out yet. Thoughts? Can I be a successful scientist if I don\u2019t want to live and breathe science all the time?? Is it normal to be confused?This sounds stupid but it\u2019s genuinely been causing me so much stress of late!",

      "text": "After the first 6 months I stopped regarding my PhD as this golden ticket amazing once in a lifetime opportunity and moreso as a job. I go in, I do my work, I get paid for it, I go home. Do I like my job? Of course I do. Do I worship it like I once did? No. I'm incredibly grateful for my position but I don't feel the visceral passion I once did. Of course I still do readings and I'll at times go above what is expected of me but I'm not going to allow myself to be asked to work absurd hours for the \"passion\" of it. Being passionate is fine and all, but I've personally seen some people work hours they didn't have to and disregard personal care and hobbies because they want to chase that passionate feeling. I don't care how passionate someone is, you need to have balance in life.\n\nDon't worry about it, the coin loses its shine for everyone eventually.",

I\u2019d say their work is not better than ours, and often not as good. \n\nYou will find that people work in different ways - especially in open-ended, flexible setups like academic research.

Part of that can be developing habits for reading more widely to sample your broader field - that\u2019s part of the job, not your down time. \n\nFWIW this approach has gotten me to senior levels at an Ivy.

      "text": "First, I just want to say that I relate to this hard.  I've often thought of myself as somehow deficient as a researcher, because it wasn't my passion. For me, it was also exacerbated by the fact that I grew with two parents who were extremely passionate about their careers and often worked 60 - 80 hours per week because they wanted to.  Like you, I enjoy my work, but I can see myself being just as happy doing other things as well.\n\nSecond, after meeting and befriending more academics, I have learned that people like us are more common than you might think. Sure, there are those who are live and breathe science, but I think they are the exception rather than the rule. Not to mention, you are only seeing aspects of their lives that they are allowing you to see.  For all you know, these people have personal lives that are filled with other pursuits and hobbies that have nothing to do with science.\n\nFinally, in terms of being successful, I think you have to set up your career in a way that is most conducive to your working style. Personally, I find it hard to be self-motivated (again: not passionate or thoughtful enough), so I make an effort to force collaborations.  Though I may not be able to write grants and publish papers for the pure pursuit of science, when I know I am indebted to someone else, I will do the work and do it well. Now, I certainly don't have a super star career, and will never achieve that level of success in my field, I think this strategy has worked pretty well for me.",
