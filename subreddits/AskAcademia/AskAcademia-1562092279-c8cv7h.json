  "title:": "Male profs/students always referring to female scientists (profs & students) as \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cladies\u201d",
  "text": "I (F 25) am a doctoral student at a large American research university. Something that has been bugging me (and all of the other female students in my department) is that most of the male professors exhibit some sexist behaviors. What\u2019s really disheartening and offensive, however, is that one of the younger PIs (early 30s) and his male students appear to go out of their way to always call attention to our gender. For example, they constantly refer to us as \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cladies,\u201d express actual surprise that the female students are able complete work by deadlines and meet/exceed expectations, remark that it\u2019s so unfair that a female TT \u201cwill get tenure only because she\u2019s female\u201d\u2014I could go on but you get the idea. I don\u2019t understand why our gender always has to be mentioned in every conversation. \n\nI voiced my reaction (\u201cit makes me feel uncomfortable when male students and faculty members constantly remind me that I\u2019m female. I don\u2019t understand why every sentence has to end with \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cladies.\u201d) to one of the students in a graduate student seminar when we were discussing inclusivity in the classroom, and he didn\u2019t even try to understand where we were coming from (\u201cBut if you\u2019re talking to a group of girls, what\u2019s the problem with stating that?\u201d) and it has only gotten worse since then. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a female professor that I can go talk to for advice, so I came to you,  R/AskAcademia. These are good people with good intentions, but they don\u2019t realize how the words they choose on a daily basis reinforce the \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d feeling of our department. What can we do to encourage them to think about it from our perspective?",

There's a blatant disregard for/dehumanisation of a person based on gender at play here. It rings starkingly similar to the way people denigrate race inclusivity programs.\n\nThe \"ladies\" and \"girls\" remarks seem innocuous if taken as just that but if it's coming from people who partake in and condone that kind of discussion, there is a problem.",

Most people I know have said they use that too, or I've heard them use that too, but I've read that since it is gendered that it could come off badly. Obviously I'm trying to change that habit but I'm wondering if others think it is equally bad or more minor (still trying to change, not suggesting otherwise).",

When I've brought it up as a concern in person, I can't recall if anyone has had a real issue with it. Many others use it though I know a few people who are also trying to limit their own usage of the word.\n\nI brought it up above just because of the context. It seems based on my own discussions that it's a fairly minor problem. But as I mentioned to /u/IncontrovertbleSnail, it's up to us to be inclusive and not the other way around. In academia, and especially STEM, there are many more males than females and so I can see this language making someone feel as an outsider. And while the people I've talked to don't seem to have an issue with it, that doesn't mean there aren't many others who do.\n\nI'm a little less concerned about usage outside of the professional setting honestly because of the prevalence. But even so, since it is a minor thing, it's something small that's easy enough to change that could just make the professional environment a little bit better.",

Think of \"ladies who lunch\" for the latter and \"young lady\" as a term men use to daughters or women to make them shut up and behave \"nicely\".\n\nIf you are asking the \"ladies\" how the work is coming along, are you also doing it in the same way you ask the \"gentlemen\"? With the same tone? Because the OP is also talking about microagressions where there's surprise when women accomplish work, or skepticism about them accomplishing work, and that is another layer to consider.",

Maybe it's because being called a \"lady\" has negative connotations since when I'm getting catcalled I might be called a lady or my friends addressed as \"ladies,\" whereas a man will probably never be cat called using the word gentleman. \n\nI also found it a bit patronizing, but that could be because I'm oversensitive.

My colleague argued that I should go with \"ladies\", but again, it feels so much more patronizing that I couldn't make myself actually use it.\n\nI'm open to the idea that I should just suck it up and use something that feels awkward to me and that that's how language evolves for the problem to go away, but it doesn't solve my problem of feeling like there ought to be something that works reasonable well today.",

There's a history of hostility toward women in the academy so a greeting such as this is a way of drawing attention to something that--again, historically, though we've made great strides--has been a reason to undermine my professional capacities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Gentlemen\" is not nearly as loaded a term because men of wealth and power have always had access to academia.

Why choose an exclusionary term for them either? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, your scenario isn't a HUGE deal, but imagine that it's the 11th tiny experience I have in a day that hints that I'm different and probably lesser.

For instance, if you know the person well and interact with them informally frequently, it would be ok to ask once, outside of work - but be prepared for them to say no. Where most people screw up is if you have NO informal contact with the other coworker (indicating that you have a crush that is NOT reciprocated), you ask them out over and over again after they have said no (indicating that you think the relationship is \"changing\" when you're really just being creepy) or where they make it awkward after the coworker says no (by being petty, passive-aggressive, or otherwise overly-dramatic). \n\nFor the record: I'm also in America, I am a final-year PhD student, and I'm a lesbian. A couple of my academic \"coworkers\" from this institution and my previous institution are lesbians and I have dealt with this a few times from lesbians. There are just so few lesbians around (deep south rural GA, plus I'm pretty socially isolated in my academic field) that I understand the desire to immediately be interested in asking one out when you find one.",

It is blatant sexism of the truest form, is humiliating, counterfactual, and demoralizing. I would consider comments like this grounds for throwing someone out of my team if I had the power, or at the very least would result in a very serious firm discussion about what is acceptable and what isn't, with warning of possible future consequences, as well as some education on actual facts. If it were me, I would have prepared responses for these kinds of comments and confront them in a controlled firm way, and investigate what other options are available. Calm tone: \"Listen, I know you think it's a good laugh, but that comment is unacceptable and so I'd appreciate it if you rather don't continue to make comments of that nature. Thank you.\" If persisting and while knowing your options: \"Look, I'm pretty easy going, but if you're going to disrespect me in a manner that relates to my gender, I'm going to be forced to report it. Let's rather not.\"\n* \"constantly refer to us as 'girls' or 'ladies' - this seems really context dependent and while you may know that they are being subtly sexist, I doubt you can report calling a group of women \"ladies\" and including it in any other report probably weakens your case. I'd let it go. \"But if you\u2019re talking to a group of girls, what\u2019s the problem with stating that?\" this actually isn't the worst point, unless someone is being deliberately obtuse. Yes, it's probably better to go gender neutral on everything, but an enormous number of people in the world aren't offended by this *at all*, so I think it's a bit of an arbitrary demand for rigor to wish for this not to happen.\n* \"it\u2019s so unfair that a female TT 'will get tenure only because she\u2019s female'\" - this one is sticky. I think they shouldn't say it, but you also have to understand that this is genuinely a situation that many men stand to lose very badly from and obviously they're going to talk about it grumpily. There are also many women who don't support these policies and are pissed off about it. Yes, it's wrong for them to imply that a particularly qualified female professor got ahead just because she was a woman, but on the other hand I know of several specific cases of faculty members at my university who genuinely were hired only because of their X political group status and are really not as good as their other colleagues, but it is the law in my country. This hurts the university and hurts students and I reiterate, there are plenty of men and women who are against these policies (just like there are men and women in favor!). Maybe you can try get them to talk constructively: \"hey, I'm not sure I agree with you, but maybe you have some different policy ideas that you can suggest and perhaps you can convince me.\" This disarms the situation (yes it sucks that you have to be the bigger person, but that's *always* how life is) and if they have nothing intelligent to contribute, then you wreck them: laughing tone \"oh so you guys just moan like babies about jobs but you don't actually have any ideas on the matter apart from complaining?\" Otherwise, perhaps they do have something more than a catchphrase to say and maybe you have a less adversarial and more meaningful discussion and you may find that the sexism decreases.\n\nAll the best.",

I feel like they're being a tad overly sensitive and that they're thinking the Prof./his lab have nothing better to do than go out of their way to ever so subtly poke and prod at them by saying things like \"ladies\" or \"girls\". I was the youngest in one of my former labs for a long time and was often called \"kiddo\", should I have taken that single utterance as though my PI saw me as a child and completely ignore how every other interaction has demonstrated that they saw me as competent and responsible enough to work in their lab and research for them? When I'm in the computer lab with other male students and a female prof. we all know and love comes in and says \"What are you boys up to?\" should I suddenly get up in arms? I've seen some other people commenting that \"lady\" comes off almost derogatory because traditionally ladies didn't have access to that sort of position or access to higher education whereas \"gentlemen\" did. But I feel like that overlooks how we DO see women in positions of authority/respect/power and how how the polite formal normative title is still applied to them - Madam Speaker for example.\n\nThere are things OP mentioned that ***may*** be worth concern (such as if she went up to him and said \"I don't like being called 'lady' \" but he did it anyway). In which case, I'd chalk the prof up to simply being a jerk and not caring about your preferences rather than it being an enormous issue worthy of further involvement.

          "text": "I'm going to assume that you really don't get it and that you're not trolling.\n\n* OP stated that this professor openly says that female professors only receive tenure track because they are female. This is wrong for several reasons: one is that it downplays the importance of what the tenure track professor did to get there; two is that statements about colleagues should never be made from a professor to a student; three, that statement is inherently sexist.\n* OP stated that the professor is openly surprised that female students get their homework done on time and that they meet/exceed expectations. There is no reason to be surprised that a female student can do her homework and meet/exceed expectations. Again, even if this professor was secretly surprised (that would still be wrong), he should never express that surprise in front of students.\n* Saying \"girls\" or \"ladies\" is also considered demeaning, unless the professor also calls all of the men \"boys\" or \"gentlemen,\" but, according to OP, that's not the case. \n\nThat last one is a little harder to explain to someone who doesn't get it, but I'll do my best. If the male professor walks in and says, \"Good morning ladies and gentlemen\" or \"Good morning boys and girls,\" that would be OK (well, \"boys and girls\" would be a little weird for a college setting), but he's not addressing the men as men. He's only addressing the women, which is weird and (in most cases) inappropriate.",

              "text": "Thank you. I really am not trolling. I really wanted to understand what was wrong with calling girls girls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose first two are obvious, and I totally understand how those are wrong, but the majority of the OP, and the title is all about that third point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I assumed that the PI was the type of person who addressed both genders, since that's normally the case. I know plenty of people in academia (both male and female) who refer to refer to guys as guys and girls as girls. I do it on occasion with no malicious intent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo thank you for trying to explain. I wasn't even going to bother anymore as the majority of people just wanted to fling around microaggressions like:\n\n\\> They sound like the type of men who will turn it into \"you can't say anything around women anymore, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, everything is offensive, I'm the real victim here\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf people really want change they should be like you and try to explain their view point.",
