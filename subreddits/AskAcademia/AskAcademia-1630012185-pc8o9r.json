  "title:": "On a CV, When is a TA an Instructor of Record and When Is an Invited Conference Presentation an Invited Talk?",
  "text": "I'm updating the CV (back on the market this year) and realizing that maybe I'm selling myself a bit short.\n\nDuring my PhD I was a Graduate Assistant for a professor in a few classes over the years. I didn't just grade exams, I also designed all of them, and I also held office hours, gave feedback on drafts of term papers and graded those at the end, and I even did a share of the lecturing. Fast forward to me now post-PhD at a different university and I just finished co-teaching a class this past semester. I've realized that I did a higher percentage of the work as a \"TA\" than I did as a co-\"instructor of record\" just now. Is there an appropriate way to reflect the extent of the work I did as a \"TA\" in those previous classes, because it would greatly increase my teaching repertoire on paper.\n\nI'm also revamping my conference presentations section because I understand \"invited talks\" are more prestigious and they could easily get lost in my catalogue of conference presentations. I've given basically three kinds of talks:\n\n1. A faculty invites me to give a lecture at their university - clear that goes in \"invited talks\"\n2. I submit a proposal to a large conference and it is accepted - clear that goes in \"conference presentations\"\n3. A conference organizer requests/invites me to give a paper at their specialist conference - where does this go? Is it an invited talk because I was specifically invited or a conference presentation because it was at a conference and not just a spotlight on me.\n\nAny feedback would be much appreciated!",

      "text": "You\u2019re the instructor of record generally when the official course listing has your name instead of a professor. When students registered for the course, you are not the instructor of record if they saw a professor\u2019s name listed as the instructor instead, even if you as the TA did most of the work. Even if you as the TA taught all the classes, if the Registrar\u2019s Office listed a faculty member as the instructor that\u2019s the instructor of record.",

      "text": "You can indicate, perhaps parenthetically, that your TA experience was \"primary instructor\" and \"designed course.\" As far as the other, the best criterion might be what a reference might say if checked. If a caller asks, \"Was this an 'invited talk'?\" and you think the reference might say, \"Well, I wouldn't really call it that\" then that makes the rest of your CV suspect. If you think the reference would call it that, then you call it that, too.",

Could you tell your friends at university x in your letter that you didn't do most of the work in your courses but gave it to me to do?\"",

      "text": "For conferences, #3 is just a regular conference presentation. If you gave the keynote speech at a conference that would be a different story, but since you just gave a conference presentation like usual, this doesn't belong under invited talks.\n\nIf you organized any panels for conferences, you can list those under service. I usually do it in a section called \"Panel Organizer\" where I list the conference name, year, and title of the panel. I think that shows that you're plugged into the field in a nice, concise way.\n\nFor the TA stuff, I would have a teaching experience section, where you list the class name and number (e.g., ENGLISH 101), and then say co-instructor of record. Then, in your cover letter and/or teaching statement you could mention some of the specific things you did as co-instructor of record (e.g., did you develop assignments? guide students through a research project?). But definitely make sure you clearly say co-instructor of record on the CV, since that is quite different from just being the TA.\n\nEditing to add: Be descriptive about your TA duties in your cover letter and teaching statement. You probably did a lot of work that might not necessarily be captured by typical TA duties, so make sure to be specific.",

      "text": "I've had a few teaching and TA positions with different responsibilities, so on my CV I always put a brief description (2-4 sentences) underneath the official job titles. The descriptions say things like, \"gave brief background lectures and guided lab activities\" or \"organized study sessions\" or \"graded weekly homework.\"\n\nDescriptions are also helpful because different places have wildly different job titles for teaching positions, like a \"TA\" could be someone who just grades exams OR someone who leads discussions with no prof in the room. Or (at one place I've been) you could be the instructor of record, leading hour-long lectures, students call you \"professor,\" and your job title is still something like \"graduate teaching assistant\" that sounds minor.",
