  "text": "For some reason, no one really ever discusses peer review, at least not in my immediate academic circles, so I'm just curious to hear others' experiences.\n\nI got my first peer review requests last year, around the time of my PhD defense. In the first year of my postdoc, I was getting requests maybe once a month on average. Just starting my second year, and I've been getting almost one a week now.",

      "text": "What I noticed that simply publishing didn't get me PR requests - it was once I started receiving regular citations that they started to come in. A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots.\n\nThat being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit.\n\nThe other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators. It also means the more junior folks are getting press ganged into service earlier. This is both a good and a bad thing.",

After 5 years I was getting 10/year. After 10 years as a PI I was getting 20-25 per year. Now I get about 50-100 requests per year, but I only do 20-24. The general guideline is to do about 2-3 reviews for every manuscript you submit.",
