  "title:": "Embarrassing question but... what does it mean to \"present a paper, \" exactly?",
  "text": "I'm applying for a conference and it has two options: poster presentation or paper presentation.\n\nObviously, I would prefer to give a talk instead of doing a poster, so I need to choose the paper presentation option. The website says that I should submit an abstract (they request a LONG abstract -- around 1000 words). The website further says that all abstracts will be published online, and a selection of them will be published as an edited book.\n\n**My question:** does \"presenting a paper\" in this context mean the paper should already be written? I would love to write it up as a full paper for them, but for purposes of applying, they're only asking for the longish abstract. Am I correct in understanding I can apply for and give a talk that is a \"paper presentation\" without the full paper actually existing yet?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I would add that in addition to the essential difference of stand in front of poster and chat to passers by vs present to an audience in depth... there are some practical issues too.\n\nConference paper presenters are likely towards submitting or have already submitted a paper for publication in a journal for a major piece of work, whereas poster presenters often are earlier in the process and setting out their project. Poster therefore can be very useful if you might like to attract some collaboration, input or advice from people, whereas presenting a paper you are basically putting yourself up there as the expert on a thing. \n\nAlthough not a hard and fast rule, but also because of the difference in papers being usually one of a number a person may have written, those presenting papers tend to be more advanced in their career / field whereas a poster presenter could be someone just starting out in postgrad, masters even occasionally. Obviously people have to present their first conference paper at some point - so it does happen, though again field dependent you might expect them to have co authored a few things before leading a publication. \n\nSo I guess it comes down to - consider which fits your needs and aims more.",

Some conferences require you to submit full papers to the section discussant at some point before the conference and some don't (usually the national ones do and the regional ones don't). The presentation itself is usually powerpoint and has a specific format which is basically the same as a peer reviewed article: intro (attention getter and then research question and some lit review/theory  but only insofar as setting up your question), data and methods, results, and discussion. Results should be reformatted for powerpoint- no joint tables in tiny letters crammed into a slide. Good luck!",
