  "title:": "Curious Question about STEM Professor Start Up",
  "text": "How common is it for assistant professors to think of a new research avenue not based on their prior work? In other words, I noticed a lot of professors began their career by working on a similar or identical project that they began during their respective postdocs. \n\nFrom what I understand, normally a new professor is given start up funding by the university to build their labs. So, hypothetically, one would expect that a lot of new ideas would be possible to at least initialize as well.",

      "text": "Yes, you can start new lines of research, but you also have to produce papers and grant money ASAP. That's easier when your research is closely related to your previous work. I regret moving away too much from my previous work and getting off to a slow start that is still hurting me many years later.",

      "text": "When you go for a faculty post you're basically presenting a business case to the university you're applying to and asking them to invest in you. Therefore, you need to demonstrate that your proposal is viable an that you have the ability to deliver it. If you can do that on a totally new topic then more power to you. Most people will need to show a track record of successfully delivering research, an in-depth understanding of their chosen topic and that the project they are proposing to do is possible and will deliver impactful results. \n\nDifferent organisations have different risk appetites and as such some wouldn't even consider a project that doesn't build off of a proven program of work. When you're handling tax payer money and money is tight, there's a strong justification for being cautious. The organisation I work for has a fairly unique way of working and it's not possible to do a lot of the work we do elsewhere (or maybe at one or two other places in the world) so we're pretty comfortable with people coming along with new ideas. This is because the overwhelming majority of academics won't have ever had access to the kind of facilities we have and we don't want to limit our candidate pools to people who already work for us, or people who have collaborated with us. We look for people who are able to think about research the way we do.",

      "text": "I think of a career in academia as an ongoing roulette game.  To get on in your career, you have to make successful bets time after time after time.  When you build up a bit of a stake (multiple grants, a track record etc) you can afford to make the odd bad (risky) bet.  Do it too early in your career, and you can wipe yourself out.",
