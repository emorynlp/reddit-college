  "text": "I reckon in most schools there might be a process just as the one I'm going through now, in my case is called transfer, and basically after 10 months in a PhD I have to say what I have done and what the next steps are.\nHowever I really feel like I have done very little, which in sum is taking an article, reproducing results and making a small extension for an algorithm.\nOf course saying it like that is not counting the training that I undertook during the first months, and it doesn't help that I still feel under qualified, insecure about my abilities, and of course I haven't had much contact with my peers because of the pandemic.\n\nAnyway I would like to know what the experiences of other people are about the progress in their first year in a research degree.\n\nIf it is relevant one could say I am working on applied maths.",

      "text": "I didn't make anything substantial in the first ~2 years of my PhD, and this was without having a pandemic mess with things. The first part of the PhD is bound to be a lot of training, reading and preparations for stuff to come. So the aim for the 1 year \"check up\" (heard it called \"early stage assessment\", \"candidacy\", etc. depending on location) is to make sure that the student has understood the basics to be able to perform the intended research plan you want to perform. Having concrete results at this stage is not a necessity (although always a plus, and it does seem like you have some). Feeling underqualified (a bit of imposter syndrome) is surprisingly quite common in academia, so don't think too much into it (it is very seldom the actual case).",

Reproducing results and extending an algorithm doesn't entirely sound like the basis of a PhD project although reproducing results is the starting point of many projects. Is your work laying the foundation for a PhD-grade project?\n\nI spent the first 3 years of my PhD expressing and purifying proteins. I had zero results until my fourth year when everything came together and I produced 4 chapters worth of data in 9 mo and was finished and written up 6 mo later.",

Maybe I am concerned because in my previous studies I think I performed better and was expecting to have results quicker, but certainly this is a very different situation, I shouldn't be expecting anything particular of a situation that I haven't experimented before.\n\nEdit: Formatting.",

In previous studies you'll probably have been given the low hanging fruit that will rapidly generate data, stuff that had already been worked up by someone else and you just had to do it. As a PhD you now need to step up and start your first steps as an independent researcher - that means laying your own groundwork and it can be painful. Hang in there, it's far too early to be judging whether it's going well or not.",
