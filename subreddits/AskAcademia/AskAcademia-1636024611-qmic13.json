I can also forget to have a \u201clife\u201d of my own, forget to take care of myself and my relationships. I\u2019m 32 and still learning how to find balance without losing that excitement.",

People can\u2019t shut you up? Unusually gregarious? You don\u2019t feel like you need the sleep, family history of bipolar or mania, etc?\n\n\u2014-\n\nAn occasional all-nighter is ok (cortisol diurnal variation will get a little screwed up for a few days and you\u2019ll feel colder around 2-5am, thinking will be different, less capable, easy mistakes)\u2026 recheck your work in the morning after some sleep.

I've been coaching students the last 2 weeks on implementing parts of it. The students are excited and the cohort is made up of the \"go-getter\" types so it's so much fun to work with them on a topic we all are passionate about. \n\nWe used the campus proposal and surveys/interviews with students and wrote up how we would implement the project for a research paper so practitioners could utilize our findings. I'm not a PhD, I'm a practitioner myself, so the faculty I'm working with have written it up and going to publish it. I'm listed as an author and it'll be my first peer published work!",
