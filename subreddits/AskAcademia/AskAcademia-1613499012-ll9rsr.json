  "title:": "Is there any talk of scaling back PhD programs in light of the higher ed bubble collapsing/demographic cliff?",
  "text": "For example, the academic job market has been bad for decades but has gotten worse and worse as the predicted wave of retiring professors never materialized, research funding has been flat since the end of the Cold War, and we keep pumping out more PhDs every year with a relatively fixed number of faculty positions available.\n\nNow we have COVID popping the higher ed bubble ahead of schedule and the demographic cliff, the situation is going to get historically bad.\n\nIs there *any* talk in your departments of admitting fewer grad students to avoid contributing to the problem, or is cheap grad student labor just too valuable to pass up?\n\nDo faculty in your area tend to dissuade people from going to grad school or what?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI retract the claim about funding after the Cold War, it\u2019s more complicated than that.",

But the idea of a PhD student is that you are taking salary far below industry standard because you're learning and will one day secure a better job. \n\nExcept the reality is that PhD students ARE the \"industry\" when it comes to basic research funded by government agencies and industry. \n\nI mean why are we even accepting that 3rd party industry labs can: a) have \"PhD students\" at all or b) that their R&D can be outsourced on-the-cheap to the university system where it becomes a \"PhD student project\". Why are we doing industry's research for them (which they'll then patent and lock-off from us) and why are we allowing them to pay \"student\" wages for this?\n\nIt's an exploitive scam that only gets fixed by only funding research where the \"person-hours\" are paid out an industry wage levels.",

                  "text": "Here in Europe both PhD positions and postdocs are typically unionized with fixed salary and \"all in\" (i.e. including any tuition payments) yearly costs. \"All in\" is not their salary, it's what they cost the uni/PI with all additional costs included. In my country the \"all in\" costs for a PhD student is 39,780\u20ac, for a postdoc is 70,040\u20ac. A professor's \"all in\" (including benefits, etc.) is quite a bit higher.\n\nIn the US tuition for graduate students is \"funny money\" anyways. It's \"creative\" accounting with the uni \"charging it\" to PhD students and then \"paying it out\" in stipend. It's a tax fiction.\n\nAnyways, here it's common to have something like an industry \"BRIDGE\" project (where the government covers some or often MOST of the costs) or for industry to start their own project and those numbers I listed are the \"sticker prices\" so they could get 2 year's research with two PhDs (and the engagement of their PI) for ~160,000 Euro and that's if the tax payer doesn't cover some or all of that and in the end they didn't have to hire anyone, they didn't have to open a research lab, or have to hire administrators or technical staff and when the 2 years are done they are completely free of any financial commitments as if they just laid off their entire work force and they can just walk away. And on top of that whatever was researched may be locked off behind a patent handing them a government backed monopoly on the final product.\n\nAnd we get projects of no benefit to the tax payer. Stuff like \"we're having this problem with our manufacturing process, could you look into that?\" and it'll make a BRIDGE project with the taxpayer paying 80% of the personnel costs.",

At many US institutions, graduate students don't pay their tuition (and at some, fees). Instead, that tuition is paid for them (a waiver) by an external source (grant funds, departmental funds, etc.).

A PhD student teaches 1 or 2 class sections a year and needs lots of mentorship. So a lecturer is much better bang for the buck on teaching.\n\nPhD students do produce research, but most PhD students are not producing great research right off the bat, it requires training and mentoring and a big investment of faculty time. And then you lose them after 5 years, just when they're starting to get really good at research!

For others that have a more \"direct\" approach to their research program, PhD students with less desire to innovate are fabulous robots to perform laboratory work. It doesn't mean the \"robots\" are lesser people or will be poor-quality labor; rather, they are essentially required to produce decent quality results to publish or graduate, and the PI has both professional *and academic* leverage to oust a non-producer (much more than can be said for staff technicians on uni contracts where I am in school).

It worked out for me and most of my first gent grad school colleagues, but not all of us ended up in academia. I have met grad students at conferences who are toward the end of their degree and just looks so deflated and sad. I was there once. It\u2019s difficult to mentor students who want to pursue a PhD because I never know how much to share. When my students do get into a PhD I do have \u201cthe talk\u201d with them before they leave.",

I try to be conscientious of sharing my experiences, what I know, and what the reality of it all is without trying to be overly negative. It's not easy at all. I try to frame it as \"be aware, have your eyes open, know that this degree is a license to practice, and not a promise to practice, and do your absolute best\"\n\nWe both have the first gen thing in common! Definitely makes life a lot harder when you don't know what you're even trying to navigate. I got very lucky and met the right mentors along the way. I also learned way too much the hard way.",

The programs don't have proper certifications for what they're selling. I've been in curriculum meetings where one of these faculty members LIED TO EVERYONE about BLS growth numbers for their supposed \"area\". I roasted this person hard to their face right in the moment and pulled up the real data. And guess what happened? I got in hot water for calling it out. The reason? It draws attention to the fact that our self-study and accrediting bodies didn't actually do their job. \n\nAt the graduate level, I've seen promises of fellowships, research projects, and even over-promising for job placement - \"you're my student, you'll get hired right away\". \n\nI agree with you that there are students out there who are irresponsible and don't investigate enough for sure.

Academia and industry are substantially institutionally different, even in fields that have close private sector links, even down to basics like how people comport themselves in the office. It is a real challenge even for undergraduates in liberal arts fields to navigate applying for jobs, couching the skills that they have in a language and context that is understandable to employers, even just understand what different careers entail (marketing? HR? sales?). You know those people who think that being in grad school means taking classes? That's a non-trivial number of people that you will meet in any industry that doesn't routinely hire PhDs (and occasionally in ones that do). What is expected of you is different, how you are evaluated is different, the needs and values of your peers and superior are different - and a lot of employers would rather hire someone with industry experience than some unknown quantity that spent x years doing who knows what, because for fields that don't have an industry linkage, there's no intuitive reason that having a PhD would make you better at the job. And then there's the fact that you're a full-fledged adult, so a lot of the mistakes that would be forgiven for a 21 year old will not be forgiven for you. Saying that it should be easy for you to find your footing outside the academy because you've interacted with other people is like saying that you should be able to fix a car since you've ridden in one. So no, leaving academia for industry is both subjectively and objectively difficult for this class of professionals.",

Too many people get stuck in the perpetual \"carrot hunt\", to the point where anything outside is looked down upon. After seeing so many people around me get burnt out, I feel like getting out of academia should be destigmatized enough that a tenure track position doesn't feel an end-all-be-all to undergrads starting out.\n\nNow, I understand that this might not be the case for humanities.

Here's what I said:\n\n> Sure\n\ni.e. \"I agree with your comment about your field\"\n\n> but in many humanities and social science fields (and some STEM ones, like pure math or theoretical physics), industry research significantly differs from academic research, or research outside the academy does not exist.\n\ni.e. \"what you said does not apply to **some other fields that are explicitly not the field you talked about**, and the rest of my comment is going to be about that\"\n\n> But my original point was against your original comment that \"there is no other vegetable\".\n\nI apologize if that was an unclear metaphor, but I never intended that going out of academia should be stigmatized. I intended (and also stated in explicit language on several occasions now) that, **in fields that are apparently dissimilar to your field**, there are many obstacles to successfully transitioning out of academia, the lack of non-academia research opportunities being one but not the only one. That was the purpose of all of my comments.

Just an issue of a few months to learn those skills.\n\nWhich frankly doesn't make any kind of sense (why should having interacted with people make it easy to transition into any sort of career whatsoever?), is pretty rude and dismissive (are you saying that any job outside of academia simply requires experience interacting with humans?), and does not appear in any way connected to waht you are talking about in the comment I am now responding to.

I wonder if getting dunked on for pursuing their dead-end career makes some people cling harder to \"someday\" making that career work. Along with this societal notion that, if somebody is interested in that kind of thing, we should make a joke about fries with that instead of being like, it's great that you're interested in something other than doing the least work for the most amount of money - here's some realistic careers you could have that are fulfilling but are not academia. \n\nOur education system isn't structured to help people, particularly people who don't have resourced parents, make intelligent choices about their professional lives. I know lots of people who got themselves locked into an unusable PhD/some other dumb career choice because that's the only thing they could think of doing.

          "text": "I don't think admitting less PhD candidates is a good solution. That comes across to me like an austerity measure. Why are we rolling back on scientific investment when it is the only certain way that we advance our nation (and more generally humanity)? In my opinion, there is no such thing as overproducing qualified people, I think there is only an under-exploitation of that labor. We need to increase the number of PhD's we give out for the long future (I think the future requires a skillset made for creativity and tackling new problems), but before that, we must ensure there is an ecosystem of stable employment opportunities for trained people to move between, and change the culture such that moving between adjacent careers is possible and not looked down upon. We will not and should not persist with this monolithic academic path that ties you so deeply to established individuals and offers very little in way of security. We need to increase basic science research funding, democratize/federate data so that more institutions and individuals can contribute peer analysis to shared datasets, and begin publicly funding drug discovery and development. Finally, we need to expose incompetence in tenured positions and expose toxic and exploitative workplaces, by widespread union membership. There are so many toxic workplaces in academia which only persist due to their granular and fragmented nature. Unions might also help tackle the exploitative pattern of adjunctification we are seeing. Universities are shooting humanity in the foot to benefit themselves in the short-term. All they are doing is scaring many deserving and qualified people away from science, which is intensely stupid for a national government to allow, considering scientific innovation is probably going to be our saving grace in the shifting future of the globe.",

We have that at my institution, with [the retirement age set at 67](https://www.hr.admin.cam.ac.uk/policies-procedures/1-retirement-policy/2-statement-policy). People can petition to stay on beyond that date, but only [under certain circumstances](https://www.hr.eng.cam.ac.uk/academic/accbeyondretage), most of which revolve around the issue of funding: you can't stay on and be paid your full-time wage by the institution.\n\nYou might have quibbles over the details of it (especially the age you have to retire), but there's no other legitimate or reasonable solution.\n\nInstitutions can't stop admitting PhDs and many have already cut back as far as they can go without abolishing the graduate school altogether. There is not enough funding to support a large net addition of jobs, especially not to transform adjunct lines into tenure. If we want more ECR moving to permanent jobs, and we can't increase the total number of jobs, then we have to push out the people at the other end.",

It would take effort, yes, but all good policies do.\n\nOr if that's really not possible then I guess you just have to abolish tenure as a concept or seriously rework it to have less teeth so that professors can be made redundant (with a severance package etc). The position is *too* permanent and so off-putting to your own universities that they're trying to avoid it, replacing the positions with adjunct lines that have no long-term contract and no protection. The UK abolished formal tenure in 1988 following a bunch of other countries, I'm sure the US is capable of doing it too.",

Meanwhile, they actively suppress working outside of the university once you are enrolled, with my PI even asking students during lab meeting if they are working as a way to distract themselves from their PhD work. It's a toxic time to be in academia, because a lot of the faculty rely on student work to meet department standards on their performance reviews, but you need to support students in order for that to happen. \n\nI don't think the reality of this new job market, or how long the consequences of the pandemic will last in academia, has really hit in my field. There are more and more one-year \"assistant professor\" positions being advertised as a way to bridge the gap between this year's funding and 'getting back to normal' in the future, but I'm just not that optimistic.

Like, finance TT employers continue to face competition from industry employers who also hunger for finance PhDs, which means that there's likely a floor to the compensation they can offer and still get candidates. So when they're looking to reduce budgets, probably the strategy they are taking is not to reduce compensation for new TT hires, but to reduce number of new TT hires. Which would mean that, while finance PhDs can still expect a high level of compensation, getting a TT position would become more competitive. In a field that doesn't have a similar floor, e.g. some humanities field, schools can choose to drop compensation and hire the same number of people under a budget constraint.\n\nSo in effect, no, it's not an indication of a glut in the overall labor market for finance phds, but it's not necessarily indicative of those positions being as feasible to obtain as prior.",

The same is true for dozens of fields.\n\nThe demographic cliff is a looming disaster but only for *some* schools in *some* regions. It's going to wreak havoc on the many private liberal arts colleges in the Midwest and New England, where populations will decline the most. But it may not effect similar schools in popular places (LA, Seattle, Sunbelt, etc.) much at all.  Since the academic job market is national, though, these regional declines will mean the net supply of TT job openings will decrease-- so shouldn't the supply of Ph.D.s logically do so as well?

If they say they have their heart set on academia, then I do the best I can to help them, but in my mind helping them also includes explaining very unambiguously just how difficult finding a TT job is these days.\n\nI have heard talk of reducing the number of people admitted to PhD studies, but I don't think it will happen, for two main reasons:\n\n(i) somebody has to be first.  Some university is going to have to step out in front of its peers and say \"we recognize that overproduction of PhDs is a problem, and to begin fixing it, we're going to reduce the number of people admitted to graduate studies at our university.\"  The difficulty, to nobody's great surprise, is that no university wants to be the first to do this.  As soon as you start scaling back your graduate programs, the perceived prestige of your university begins to fall.  So, unless some fairly large number of universities all decide to take the plunge together, I don't see any practical and concrete reduction in PhD program admissions happening anytime soon.\n\n(ii) if some universities were brave enough to take this step, they'd immediately face legal challenges from special interests groups, along the lines of \"yeah, everybody recognizes this is a problem, but I won't accept any cuts to PhD admissions if it affects *my* racial/social/religious/national/whatever group.\"  NIMBY applied to academia, essentially.  In essence, reducing the number of PhD admissions means that the competitiveness of admissions will necessarily go up, and as soon as somebody feels slighted, the legal floodgates will open, in the US anyway.  No university wants to open itself to an endless tide of costly litigation, so no university will be willing to take the plunge, even though it's crystal clear to almost everyone that this is exactly what needs to be done.",

A department looks great if it says \"look at all these graduates we have who are now very successful professors and researchers at these fantastic universities.\"  And nobody cares about the much larger number who are underemployed.  So, as long as nobody cares about the department's students who don't do well, the way to maximize the number of students who *do* do well is simply to maximize the number of students total.  The more you pump out, the more total success stories you'll have.\n\n> I guess I  don't understand the desire to have a PhD program that isn't productive.\n\nAgain, I think part of the problem is that \"academic productive\" doesn't really have the same meaning as \"productive\" does in everyday language.  As a simplified example, a company with $10 of income and $1000 of expenses wouldn't really be considered \"productive,\" but in academia, the $10 of income would be celebrated and nobody would pay attention to the $1000 of expenses. All that matters is the success stories, and the more of them a department can pump out, the better.",

In my field (molecular bioscience), the position of postdoc is part of the problem.  Because there is such an overwhelming shortage of *permanent* academic positions like professorships or staff scientists, people end up as postdocs for a decade, beholden to short-term contracts and low pay in relation to their skills.  Eventually, some few of them will strike gold and land a TT position, but the overwhelming majority will not, and many even leave science altogether.  So, I'm glad your former program posts the outcomes of their graduates (certainly a first step in the right direction), but in my mind it would be better if they knew what became of those graduates *after* their postdoc or stint as a visiting faculty member.",

(I was one of the leaders of this initiative.) \n\nEven though I felt it had to be done, this has had a lot of *bad* impacts, by the way.  \n\n- With fewer grad students, grad classes are fewer, which means grad student get fewer specialized courses.  (if any:  most of the grad courses we offer now are the broad generalist courses, and ALL specific focused thematic work has to be done as Independent Studies.) \n\n- smaller classes means fewer different points of view... and fewer opportunities to riff off of each other, intellectually.  In fact, it 'feels' very different... with so fewer PhDs now, it feels like the grad students are more like 'students' (working closer with professors, but feeling ? more subordinate?) and less like young professionals in an intellectual community of their own...   There aren't any PhDs who are working in the same subfield anymore, so there's no ability for them to work with each other.  (our grad program is thereby a pale shadow, intellectually and socially, of the program I myself attended two decades ago.) \n\n- our grad 'community' is much smaller, and hence, much more isolated... it's lonelier for the grads.  (fewer are dating each other/marrying each other...) \n\n- this has also been tough for undergrads, who in the large survey courses now get TAs that are available... and often have no training in the subject their TAs for.    And we rely more heavily now Masters' students as TAs (some of whom are barely out of undergrad themselves) who are grading their papers, and making a general mess of it. \n\n- on the plus side, fewer grads means funding for everyone.  (we don't have any unfunded grads... even at the MA level... though we did 10 years ago, if you could believe it).  I insisted on changing that.  No one needs to take out debt to get a PhD in our department, which is imperative.\n\n- at the same time, we are no longer able to replace retiring faculty (because:  sustained assault on the Humanities) and so our faculty itself has shrunk by 1/3 as well.  So, that's also demoralizing.  \n\n-  overall, while a necessary step, shrinking our grad program feels like yet another step towards the slow, spiraling Death of the Humanities... where \"college\" will soon just be glorified trade school, i.e. coding-camp to churn out code-monkeys for silicon valley capitalists.  Decline and Fall of America and all that jazz. \n\nTLDR:  yes, we have, and it really sucks.  (though necessary)",

I just finished a master's in an engineering discipline and it seems like that's the highest level that's recommended for a lot of engineers. If you want to pursue a PhD, you know up front that you're really lowering your stock as far as working in industry is concerned, university positions are highly limited and underfunded, and working in a government position at a lab is highly, highly competitive. Plus the abundance (well, when there isn't a pandemic) of private sector jobs available to people with bachelor's degrees lowers the desire in a lot of people to go for advanced degrees relative to other disciplines.",

      "text": "There's no real incentive for universities to permanently scale back their PhD programs. PhD students are a source of cheap labor, why cut that off in favor of paying more, especially with tighter and tighter budgets?\n\nPlus, the bigger the supply of PhDs, the more universities can get away with paying them less and treating them poorly. It's basic supply and demand. So of course universities are going to do whatever they can to keep as many PhDs and PhD students in academia as possible. The few success stories are used to promote the PhD programs, and the rest continue to provide cheap labor.\n\nIMO, nothing is going to change until PhD program enrollment (particularly in programs that are not very employable outside academia) goes down significantly. Maybe unionization of graduate students and/or adjuncts might help, but I think that as long as there are hundreds of applicants per tenure track job opening, some of those people will be willing to break strikes or otherwise help bust unions, if they think that doing so could help them get a leg up on the competition (by getting better recommendations, not getting blacklisted, etc).\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see me in the grad school subs discouraging people from doing PhDs, or least encouraging people to carefully consider their goals and options. Unfortunately, too many people enter PhD programs because they don't know what else to do. Unfortunately, too many people don't do enough research before enrolling in graduate school. Unfortunately, too many people think that the odds don't apply to them, that they will surely get that tenure track job if they graduate from the \"right\" program, get the \"right\" grants, and publish in all the \"right\" publications, and they go through graduate school without any solid backup plan.",

I'd hazard a guess that even if someone was doing a sociology PhD and could include some basic machine learning into their research it'd actually give you a pretty good start to getting into industry (if that's your interest).

US educational institutions are not bringing enough US citizens in to the PhD programs, and it's causing issues across the entire vertical from undergrad education through to hiring policy at highest levels of publicly funded and private industry.\n\n2. To make matters worse, the Biden Dept of Education has indicated 'nation of origin/nation of citizenship' will be considered in diversity in a new expanded, vastly expanded definition in regards to higher education.\n\n3. The above two issues are truly fucking over the graduates of US high schools, permanently over their educational and career spans.\n\n4. I like using Spain and France as an example, the countries have way way too many PhD candidates and in some fields they are graduating seventeen PhDs per one open PhD job position each year.  In the liberal arts across all disciplines, France is graduating 6.7 PhDs per one open PhD position.\n\n5. Unless Biden and the Democrats both wipe existing student debt, AND remove incentivizations of the universities as money making corporations from causing further inflation across cost basis and the entire cost spectrum, the US is reaching a point where PhD holders from the GenX generations are still paying off their own student loans by the time their offspring are also taking on debt to attend grad/post-grad school.  This is unconscionable and has to be adjudicated or it will literally break the back of the United States higher educated workforce.\n\n6. On the eastern seaboard, the Universities have gotten so fat and bloated they are destroying the very communities and cities they exist within, be it rural and public such as Penn State, or urban and private such as Colombia U in upper Manhattan.\n\n7. If COVID dislocates the networking and pedigree validation of geographic proximity any further, the entire concept of Western higher educational institutions located in seats of urban power or dedicated suburban/rural campuses, the concept itself becomes an anachronism of a prior age, along the lines of buggy whip manufacturers.\n\n8. The overhang of US and state level debt, should in itself lead to a reallocation of capital away from institutes of higher education in ways not yet manifested.  Unlike 2004 recession and Bush's weird and broken bandaid programs to 'retrain workforces', the more likely outcome here is like 2009, where state legislatures and US Federal programs just doing hack and slash burning of the grants industry while under enormous pressure to reign in run away inflation and gov worker pension obligations.",

      "text": "This is a formal debate right now in some disciplines, including my own (history). The circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic are creating some confusion within that debate, however, since it was already underway prior to this past year. \n\nEssentially, there are multiple camps on this question:\n\n1) There's a very vocal group in many disciplines who insist the problem is not with supply but demand--that dramatically throttling down the number of people doing doctorates is conceding far too much to the defunding of public universities and the institution of neoliberal austerity policies at many private institutions, even quite wealthy ones. I think there's at least something to this argument, but the upcoming demographic shift has to be taken seriously and has so far been compensated for by competing more aggressively for international undergraduates, something that the last four years has seriously limited. I think you could more successfully argue that many universities have misallocated significant proportions of their budgets to growth in administrative ranks or other non-curricular program. All of that said, it's not a great idea to just keep training as many doctoral students as ever as if they're an irresistable force that will wear down an immovable object. All that's really doing is feeding into casualization.\n\n2) There's a small but influential group in many disciplines who aren't interested in talking about this as a collective action problem in any way shape or form. E.g., you all can go ahead and do whatever you think best but MY institution is so special and great and prestigious and wealthy that we'll just keep training as many Ph.Ds as we see fit to train because we are the best. \n\n3) There's a sizeable group of faculty in many disciplines who teach in graduate programs who want to significantly curtail doctoral admissions in their program or in their entire institution. That can run into some countervailing pressures: administrators or boards who perceive numbers of doctorates trained as a metric of productivity or institutional prestige; institutional demands for cheap teaching by doctoral candidates and lab support from postdocs; the difficulty of getting TT faculty in any given department to agree on any long-term strategic changes; institutional \"entrepreneurs\" who are constantly looking for ways to launch new programs/new sources of revenue as a way to aggrandize/get rewarded by administration/genuinely create something new of lasting value. \n\nOn balance, this means that any movement to reduce admissions of doctoral students has been and probably will be uneven at best: currently tenured faculty are the least hurt by the current job market and thus the least inclined to push harder for changes of any kind.",

My R1 still saw an overall growth in AY 2020-2021 and my PhD program had its largest new cohort ever this past fall.  But I do very much agree about the lack of jobs issue.",

          "text": ">The bubble bursting is news to me.\n\nIt's a basic demographic bubble, which we've known about since the recession. Often [labeled the \"demographic cliff,](https://www.cupahr.org/issue/feature/higher-ed-enrollment-cliff/)\" it's not going to impact specific fields but rather the entire college-age population in the US will peak in 2025 then tumble. Moreover, the makeup of the cohorts will be different in the future, with larger percentages coming from non-white families, lower SES, lower educational attainment, and most coastal/southern geographic origins. So the writing is on the wall for many of the Midwestern and New England private colleges that enroll primarily white, middle/upper-middle class kids from within their regions. Many of those schools will go right off the cliff with the demos.\n\nThe impacts will be uneven. [This map is pretty scary](https://www.cupahr.org/wp-content/uploads/Forecasted-growth-and-decline-in-college-going-students-2012-2029-Source-Nathan-D-Grawe-Carleton-College.jpg), projecting >15% declines in over two dozen states. But it will have little impact on elite schools, coastal schools, or departments that are in high demand.",

They provide all the usual career center assistance (including internships and all that) with a PhD angle. \n\nMy field (English) has already been admitting fewer people for ages, and at this point there's no way to cut back even more without destroying departments. A lot of us just love this and know full well we're not getting jobs. (In my case, I already had a non-academic career before I entered, so I'll be fine.) I think it's worth doing for its own sake, and having committed, educated, qualified people is good for society as a whole.",
