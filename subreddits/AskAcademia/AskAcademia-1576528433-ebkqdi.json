  "text": "Not that I'm advocating for any kind of punishment for busy faculty or anything, but I'm just curious.  There are lots of stories about committee members never reading their students' theses/dissertations - in fact, I suspect this happened to me when I finished my master's.  I'm sure plenty of graduates get through that never should have passed.  Is there any mechanism by which committee members are held accountable for this other than a nosy individual or reporter looking into it and trying to make a big deal out of it?",

      "text": "Not that much, to be honest. Bad dissertations don't often get the students the sorts of jobs where anyone would care.\n\nAnd short of some actual fraud at work, there isn't much interest in that sort of thing. So and so had a poorly thought out dissertation - big deal. Particularly if they don't stay in academia.\n\nNow, all that said, advisors very much *do* pride themselves on successful students (where success is typically - but not always - defined as an academic career), so they have motivation to not pass a bad dissertation.\n\nThey have to be capable of telling the good from the bad, though.\n\nJunior folks on the committee are sort of screwed - it can cost them a lot to dig in their heels, especially if the chair is a senior person in the department. I left a committee because a masters thesis was going up a dead end and the chair wouldn't listen. It was costly, in terms of political fallout. At least locally; once I left no one cared.",
