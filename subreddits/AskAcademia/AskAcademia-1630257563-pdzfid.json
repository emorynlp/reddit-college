  "text": "I've been applying for a lot of advertised PhD positions (20+) in European universities over the last year. However I've got rejected in them all. I feel my covering letter is a bit weak in a way that it doesn't convey my experiences and objectives properly. I know a good covering letter alone doesn't guarantee an interview call but I'm looking for help in refining my letter for future applications. Please DM me if you would be able to help me out with this. Thanks a lot.\n\nAny online resources for the same would also be appreciated.",

Then you need to craft letters specific to those programs that show your interest in them, their research, and how being part of their program will help you achieve your goals. You need to be reaching out to the faculty in these programs before you apply so that you\u2019re building a connection to them and they know who you are.",

I am in STEM and in Europe. \n\nThe cover letter is not the most important part but it should show that you spent some time on your application. It should contain a short introduction of yourself and why you are applying to the group and what you could bring. The latter is important especially if you are applying to an interdisciplinary position which is very flexible in terms of applicants background (maths, physics, engineering, computer science, etc.)\n\nIt is also important to show that you have read some of the publications  of the group and make sure to also suggest some potential research directions. This takes time but is crucial. Template/generic applications are systematically rejected. \n\nIf you want me to review your application package, just send me a direct message and we can see what can be done.",
