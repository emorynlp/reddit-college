They are enrolled on a masters degree, to say that they are starting a masters degree is entirely accurate.\n\n> It's starting a combo BSc/MSc.\n\nIt isn't, because you never get the BSc. I have never seen it described as a combo BSc/MSc. An MPhys is always just referred to as an [MPhys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Physics). It is simply an undergraduate masters degree.\n\nPeople in this thread are getting really nit-picky with OP over what is an accurate description of the degree they're doing, all because they assumed one thing based upon what OP wrote, but that doesn't match the reality of the education system in which OP is working. I'm not saying it wouldn't have been helpful for OP to state they were in the UK at the start of their post, but that doesn't warrant people trying to portray OP as playing up the 18-year-old-masters-student element, when in fact they were just stating what they were doing.",

The MPhys is an undergraduate degree, it is only ever billed as such, and at no point does anyone starting it think they're doing something equivalent to graduate level work.\n\nWhen I started it was literally a case of \"oh yay, I get to go straight through to getting my masters without paying graduate level fees for my fourth year, and with undergraduate (which had lower interest) loans to cover my living expenses that year\". Now they've jacked up tuition fees, but it is still a good way to graduate with more research experience and something beyond a BSc.\n\nI feel like you (and others) are getting het up because of how you are used to interpreting a masters degree, so it seemed to you like OP was making a grandiose statement. But to a UK physics student saying you're doing a masters degree (meaning MPhys) really isn't a big deal. Literally no one cares if you're a BSc or an MPhys, MPhys is just more useful if you plan on doing a PhD later.\n\nSimilarly, OP is probably only going to be familiar with the system they've just signed up to, so I imagine they were quite surprised by how strongly people reacted to the words they used, which were wholly accurate for the degree that OP is studying.",

At no point in the 4 years are you working towards a BSc and all your grades count towards the classification of your MSci degree.\n\nThat sounds a hell of a lot like starting an masters.\n\nThis seems to be a cultural difference, maybe you don't really have MSci degrees wherever you're from, but I can assure you that this OP's language is perfectly appropriate for the UK. Also, an MSci is different to an MSc, but both are masters degrees.",

Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard British undergraduate degree classification scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.\n\nSo the first three years are the same as the BSc course, you just don't graduate at the end of it. Although the way it describes the 4th year doesn't match what I and other people I know at other universities did. In my 4th/masters year we each did a research project that spanned the whole academic year (and did literature reviews over the summer before the year started in preparation) and we did write a thesis at the end (some universities may call it a report instead, but the length usually corresponds to the length of a typical STEM masters thesis).",

An undergraduate masters is a well understood concept in the UK and your choice of words were completely accurate, since you will not be getting a BSc, just the masters. For some reason today, rather than accepting that systems can just differ between countries, some people seem to have decided to just tell you that the UK system is wrong. I like to think we're usually more open minded than that here.",

Yet, people on this thread seem very very offended that another country uses words differently.\n\nI wonder how they're going to feel when they find out that there are some countries that speak completely different languages?!\n\nAdditional point: I've seen some people claim that you don't get to say that you're starting your masters until you reach forth year. This is just incorrect. On an integrated masters program in the UK you are at no point working towards a Bachelor's degree, so what should you say you're doing for the first three years?",

However, it was somewhat meaningless as all of the Part IIIs (integrated masters) are conditional on Part II results (usually a minimum of a 2:1) so, as you mention, it's not actually possible to guarantee enrolment in the masters from the start. You could even argue that you can't even technically get a masters in astro as the certificate will say MSci in NatSci. (Can't remember if it's the same for candidates who don't have a Cambridge BA who get awarded the MASt instead \u2013 another oddity.)\n\nActually, in some ways it's even weirder than that. All Cambridge bachelor degrees lead to the award of the same BA in no specific subject and no class. So you could say that it's not technically possible to enrol in NatSci at the start as there is no BA in NatSci awarded. NatSci only appears in the MSci certificates. This is all rather pedantic though and obviously in practice there are different kinds of BAs.",
