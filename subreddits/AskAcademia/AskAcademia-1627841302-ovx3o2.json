  "title:": "Intense guilt over possible academic dishonesty",
  "text": "Hey everyone,\nEven though I've been done with this class (it was my advisor's) after the Spring semester and passed, I'm feeling some guilt. Long story short, I got a bad grade (C) on a major assignment in the middle of the semester. I was allowed to resubmit before the final grading deadline.\nIn the midst of venting about an awful meeting I had with my advisor over that grade, one of my colleagues sent me pictures of her feedback (although I didn't ask). Eventually, the colleague asked me to delete those messages but I already had those pictures saved (which are now also deleted as well). I made sure to only use my feedback I had prior and the feedback she got on her own paper as a reference point. I still looked over my own notes and took my retake closed book and closed note. Despite this, I still feel like this was probably unauthorized collaboration, which may be academic dishonesty. Although there's no way of ever knowing, I still have to live with knowing I got through my advisor's class after I reviewed what was sent to me.\nAlthough this doesn't resolve my guilt at all, I still would've passed the class since I only missed a few points on the final and would've ended with a B even without a resubmission. However, I only mention this because I was nearly given an Incomplete for the class before the semester ended because of how I did on that assignment. \nI'm sorry for the length of the post but I'm writing this as I'm dwelling on my past desperation to just get a grade and how dishonest I feel in general.",

      "text": "Professor here. Your guilt seems disproportionate, and this situation seems strange. In general if we allow a student to redo an assignment, we often do provide some feedback on how to improve. While it's odd that your colleague had access to your advisor's feedback for you and wrong that they chose to forward it without asking your advisor (as far as you know), isn't it the case that if you had asked your advisor, they would've provided it themselves? I'm assuming that by feedback you don't mean \"the objective answers to a test.\" You mean critical remarks that pinpoint major and/or recurring issues in a complex assignment.\n\nSomething you could do is to ask your colleague if they actually discussed this with your advisor at all or if they got permission to share that feedback and just forgot to tell you. It's not at all clear how they accessed this information.\n\nWhat you did wasn't great, but that's mostly because there's this weird lack of clarity surrounding what happened. **If I've gone through the trouble of writing feedback for a specific student, it's ultimately** ***FOR*** **that student.** We don't spend our precious hours writing evaluative comments just to leave it in a random Word file for our personal pleasure. I can't imagine a professor being upset that a student used feedback to improve their work. We spend most of our time frustrated that students ignore our feedback.\n\n**In any case, feeling guilty is actually a good thing in this case.** It means that you'll strive to act in a way that aligns with your internal moral compass and that you can consider this a lesson learned. *Accepting the guilt doesn't mean casually excusing your actions. It just means that you should accept it as a natural consequence of being an imperfect human who will strive to do better.* Trust that the guilt will fade over time, but allow the moral shift it inspired to guide you moving forward. Good luck.",

You can either wallow in your guilt and get stuck forever at this point, constantly harping back to it and seeking validation for your actions, or you can learn the lesson that cheating taints your achievements and makes you unhappy and that's not the life you want to lead. You can  move on to bigger and better things with a personal ethos of integrity and honesty while using this experience to keep you grounded and humble. It's your choice.",

          "text": "Professor here: This isn't really true if you count professors as positions of authority. Many professors fall into the category of not needing to cheat because they were the top of the class and everyone else was compared against them. More often than not my exam grade was the high and used as 100% for the rest of the class due to the curve. Cheating was pointless. And I am far from the smartest professor I know, so I'm pretty sure I can't be the only one that just had no need to. \n\nAll that being said: I think OP is fine. Feeling guilt over it is a healthy response and probably sufficient punishment for a one time, relatively minor infraction. It serves as a learning and character building moment, which is ultimately what college is about. Also, since it was a redo, it was clearly the professors intent to serve as a teaching moment and the learning outcome was more important than the grade. The biggest mistake was the profs in that they probably should have allowed the redo for the whole class to be fair.",
