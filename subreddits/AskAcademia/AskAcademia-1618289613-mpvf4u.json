  "title:": "Is it necessary to have an academic twitter account?",
  "text": "Today I saw some crazy nuts trolling under a tweet of a simple PhD recruitment ad. I know in general twitter is a very toxic environment but I didn't expect ppl can troll under sth unrelated with them at all.\n\nI know a lot of profs have twitter accounts with their full name and affiliation, and most of their tweets are new papers published/conference announcement, and they retweet paper they are interested in or tweets by ppl they know, and it looks like a causal way of networking. \n\nI wonder how necessary this is. I have an account using fake name just for collecting info and I never tweet. Personally I extremely hate seeing trolls so I quit a lot of social medias already. I want to do networking for opportunities of collaboration and jobs, and I am wondering whether twitter plays a major part in networking nowadays in academia.",

(If there is a \"rescue\" culture, getting a dog/cat is a provisional decision. Get a pet  and if you can't deal with it, dump it at a shelter. From there someone gets to be a hero rescuer. Another way of doing things is that people don't get dogs/cast/birds in the first place if they can't deal with it.)\n\nOne gazillion downvotes ahead:",

The earth science Twitter community is largely excellent.\n\nPerhaps even better than the teaching resources, my main collaboration which has now been running for ~8 years, and has led to a wealth of great opportunities as well as a job all stemmed from a Twitter interaction.\n\nIf you go and look at most well-followed academics twitter accounts, actually most of it isn't just tweeting papers. Most of it is discussion with other people, sharing/retweeting relevant stuff, and lots of day-to-day real life things.\n\nI think you have something of a mechanical view of networking as a thing you go out and \"do\".  For me, Twitter is a very straightforward way for me to have daily casual interactions with a whole bunch of other scientists in my (and adjoining fields) because it's interesting. \n\nIf it's not something you want to do, don't do it. Most don't. But there is some phenomenal content out there, and with a little curation the trolls and the shit can *mostly* be straightforward to avoid.

Most importantly, I like to keep my professional and personal lives distinct. There's been a trend in the last few years where indeed academics blend their personal and professional lives through Twitter, notably by making stances related to political matters. If this makes them happy, then fine. \n\nHowever, there is a social expectation that is created in my field (interdisciplinary social sciences) where you must try to engage with public matters through Twitter. It is viewed as the role of a researcher to do knowledge translation in the public sphere. I'm not comfortable with that, especially with the underlying cancel culture, because I have some personal opinions that could clash with dominant discourses in my field and in the public area. I'm quite preoccupied by the self-censorship that results from this cancel culture. I prefer to do knowledge translation through other conventional means (KT projects, open letters in newspapers).\n\nTherefore, I prefer not to have a Twitter account even if I've been told that it could be useful for networking. I find other ways to network and it's working great.",

      "text": "I know several people who use Twitter as a networking tool. Connecting with different scholars, getting their work passed around, helping to organize panels. Twitter as a platform to sell yourself and conduct the 'business' of being a professional academic seems pretty useful, pretty powerful. It also seems like a black fucking hole, trying to game the system for RTs, trying to get RT'd by the right people, its *probably* one of those things that makes the difference breaking through in someone's early career. But its not something I do. \n\nSay the same about tweet threads. They can be an interesting way to get mass feedback on an idea you're working on, something you want to say, or contributing to a pressing debate. But theyre also the definition of ivory tower, and Im not sure a tweet thread has every changed the world or pushed a field forward. They are a start, but not an end to themselves. I have met many academics, however, who might disagree. But its important to keep in mind Twitter isn't the real world, and you have to treat it as such. \n\nThen there are those who use Twitter to express their political beliefs. For a tenured faculty member, that can be fun, useful, productive and cathartic. But I've also known several Jr. faculty and grad students who did something like that just to realize that everyone hated their political beliefs.  @ -ing people in the expression of ones beliefs can also be detrimental, especially for those who hold extreme political views. After all, you never quite know who review 2 is. But they may well figure out who *you* are. \n\nSo IMO the best use for twitter is as a professional in a public space making use of it as a business tool. Build your brand, tweet your publications, engage pleasantly with your adoring fans, but leave drunken shower thoughts at the bar (or to your shower, depending).",

Definitely \u2014 if your area of research has an active Twitter community, it can be a way to network on a very impressive scale for essentially no cost. Can it be harmful? Definitely \u2014 there are cases of people whose careers got destroyed because of dumb tweets of theirs. But the latter is I think a pretty rare thing. \n\nYou can always have a relatively passive academic Twitter presence \u2014 Tweet out a new paper when it's ready, comment on the work of others in a favorable way, congratulate your colleagues when they have good news, etc. It won't get you pulled into most of the networking benefits in an active way, but there will still be more passive benefits (like knowing when new things are out, conference CfPs, etc.).",

Ultimately it's up to you, you could always make an account and just use it occasionally to share publications. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I will say in general the trolling isn't that bad.

This visibility is needed for two primary things:\n\n1. Getting your name attached to the work you\u2019re doing. \n\n2. Getting access to opportunities (short term consultancy, giving advice or a full time job after your PhD or current situation). \n\nIn my case, Twitter has helped in both. \n\nI work in a very niche area and Twitter has helped me connect with people who are interested and work on similar stuff. \n\nTwitter has helped me get some short term (always paid) opportunities. Eg: research reviews for think tanks, policy work for a particular organization, or just giving trainings. \n\nI know probably these would\u2019ve been possible even without Twitter (maybe LinkedIn, Idk) but it didn\u2019t happen to be before I had the Twitter account.",

It was--and still is--to me an outlet for self-expression, a medium to share possible, sometimes extemporaneous, sometimes deliberate, insights. I try not to view it as a mechanism for professional outcomes, although that has become increasingly difficult, in productive and killjoy ways. Still, I find it relatively fulfilling, a \"useful\" means to track the pulse of a community, to be informed by that community convivially and startlingly. By using my full name and affiliation, I protect myself from an innate desire for total transparency, which speaks to what I said earlier about advantages and disadvantages. Discernment is definitely an asset, which is hard-won and tricky. Social media is all grown up and so, as with all things once innocent and innocuous, prudence, I find, precarious in its manifestation, is what's necessary, not calculation.",
