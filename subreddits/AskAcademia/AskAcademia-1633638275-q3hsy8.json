  "title:": "Writing a diversity statement as someone from a low-income country",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'll be applying to PhD programs in the US for next fall and recently came across the concept of diversity statements which some universities are asking for as a part of the app. To be honest I'm pretty lost on this one, a lot of advice out there seems to be suitable for the stereotypical cis white male, just volunteer and say you recognise the benefits of diversity across its multiple dimension and promise you won't be a c\\*nt to minorities.\n\nI grew up in a working class household in a low income country so volunteering is something that was always out of reach and something nobody I know ever even thought about as we were so busy dealing with our own challenges. So all I can say about my previous contribution to helping others out is by assisting my buddies who aren't for example good at English, or lending them money out of my fellowship so they can give TOEFL. Would it be acceptable to mention unaccountable anecdotes like these?\n\nI've faced my fair share of racial discrimination during my internships in Europe so I can at least back up my sensitivity to racial justice and fostering an equitable environment but I'm pretty much lost on making my statement as cool or accomplished as some undergrad from Princeton who spent a summer helping build wells in the Indian countryside.",

      "text": "To me those statements are more interesting when they show how you will help create an inclusive environment than in listing your past as a victim. Of course you can rest on past experiences you've had, but the key is what actions will you take to help value diversity and create a sense of belonging.",

      "text": "All the stuff those cis white men describe is supposed to help back up their assertions that they're \"sensitive to racial justice and fostering an equitable environment\" (and no, no one ever checks up on their claims). So if you have lived experience that has taught you to be sensitive and equitable, you're ahead of the game and will sound less fake because you didn't have to seek out experiences like they did. Write about your mindset, and describe one or two of your lived experiences to illustrate that mindset and how it formed. These should be concise, like just a couple sentences.\n\nThe other important thing to include is clear actions you will take to help propagate equitable environments in the future. It's important to spend at least half the statement on this topic, otherwise you'll sound like you think your history naturally gives you this sensitivity (it doesn't). So, think about a few specific situations you'll find yourself in while at the PhD program, write about how you'll navigate them, and highlight the specific choices you'll make that advance equity. For example, one such situation could be a classroom where you teach, because many decisions have to be made there that are complicated by the students' variety of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.",
