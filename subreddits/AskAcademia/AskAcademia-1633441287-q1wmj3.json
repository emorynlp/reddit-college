  "text": "One of my mentors has asked me to write a letter of recommendation for their promotion to professorship. The requirements for the letters stress that any service to the community or the academy \"must be fully documented.\" \n\nHow do I do that? Do I include hyperlinks to web pages listing this person as the editor at a journal or the organizer of a conference? Do you think they mean that they could easily look it up and find out? What's standard practice, here?",

It's no good saying \"Professor Joe is a really good colleague and helps out all the time\". You need to say \"Professor Joe is an excellent colleague. He has successfully mentored X number of students, ensuring he meets with them weekly and encouraging them to take on blah blah. Furthermore, Professor Joe sits on the llama committee where he is an active member. He campaigned tirelessly for llama shearing to move from April to May which has had a significant and positive impact on faculty work loads and welfare\". Give specifics and the outcome/impact.",
