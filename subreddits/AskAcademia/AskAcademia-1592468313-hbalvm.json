  "title:": "Job Offer Delayed Due to COVID, Acceptable to Apply for Other Jobs?",
  "text": "I have just finished my PhD in the Netherlands and last month was due to move to the US to start a postdoc. This has obviously been delayed due to COVID - the start date keeps getting moved later and later. However with the situation getting bad again in the US and talks of Trump's visa bans, I'm starting to think the position could fall through (I don't have a visa yet). All my future boss has said is that they don't know what will happen, we just have to wait and see.\n\nI recently saw a postdoc advertised in my own country that I'm very interested in. Would it be bad to apply to this postdoc, even though I have accepted another?\n\nThe US postdoc would be my first choice, but I'd hate to turn down another great opportunity just to then find out I lose my US postdoc because of visa bans or COVID. I'm currently not working so have no income. I have some savings, but don't know how long this delay will last.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it considered poor behavior in academia to apply for jobs when you have already accepted an offer?",

      "text": "Not in this case and these times. As you said, you still don' have a visa, and in fact what you have is a job offer, not a contract. Therefore it's not bad at all to apply to a postdoc in Europe, and in fact is not bad at all to get it and start working. You have rent to pay, groceries to buy, a retirement fund to nurture, and it's just natural that you want to get a job ASAP.\n\nWhat would be very poorly seen would be you quitting the Post-Doc for another position, in this case you have not quit  because you have not even started. Just apply and if you get it, you tell the PI in the US that you're sorry but you got a very interesting position elsewhere.\n\nBTW, I think it would be healthy for all of us to stop romanticizing non-tenured academic positions, be it PhD positions, Post-Docs, Lecturer positions. They are jobs, like any other, where you get paid to deliver something, in this case research outputs. And even though we do it out of passion for research and love of knowledge, we cannot eat sunlight and survive in the woods; researchers need money and salaries as anyone else, so apply to as many positions as you can, and get a job. Would you feel the same if it was an industry job in the US? If not, that means that something is wrong with academia and its expectations, and not with you.",

It is true that I haven't signed a contract, though I have signed an \"offer letter\" (basically just a 2-page letter stating salary and start date, so perhaps not comfortably binding).\n\nYou're absolutely right, I wouldn't be thinking this way if it was an industry job. I guess I'm just very aware of how I'd feel if I found out they started re-advertising for my postdoc 'just in case' immigration becomes a major issue.",

Am I wrong? Is it badly considered to quit before the end of a Post-doc contract to work somewhere else (speaking about Academia not industry)?",

If, say, OP had actually started the postdoc in the US and a month later was applying for jobs back in Europe, their employer might not be very impressed. On the other hand, if you've been there for a year or more, then talking to your supervisor about looking for jobs elsewhere wouldn't be an issue, as you say.",

The US borders will be closed at least until July 26th, and the visa will take even longer, so starting by September would be an optimistic scenario, and a realistic one would put it in October or November. Therefore, in this specific case it would be understandable to renege on the offer letter because due to external circumstances the starting date is changing every month. \n\nOn the second part, I do agree with you: the smartest thing would be that the OP agrees on something with the PI in the US, perhaps having a Post-Doc starting on Fall of 2021, explore collaborations, and keep things on a very friendly tone.",
