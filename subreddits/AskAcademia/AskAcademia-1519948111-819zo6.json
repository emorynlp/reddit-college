It's disconcerting that, despite cutting their teeth in their respective fields for years, suffering through the process of graduate school/publications/existential doubts etc., that some people in this sub have felt the need to tear down my comment, despite the fact that they were certainly at that same point in the not so distant past.  As a first year and first gen student, this is exactly the type of behavior I expected from phds, and further confirmation of that is... challenging.  \n\nCommunicating to a lay-audience is something that all researchers need to be able to do.  Part of that is obviously recognizing who that audience is, and not talking down to them.  After all, they are the community that you have responsibilities to.  By demonstrating a lack of that (to an inexperienced colleague non the less) only serves to worsen the scientific community's standing in our society as a whole.\n\n",

                  "text": "> I was on a hiring committee a few years ago and we got over 350 qualified applicants for one TT position.\n\nHow do hiring committees even begin to widdle down that pile? I mean, I can imagine coming up with some reasonable criteria that might eliminate half or two thirds, but then you are still left with 100+ really good applicants. Is it pretty much just name recognition at that point that determines who makes the next cut?",

                      "text": "Step One: Strike the committee. Might be like pulling teeth, might be like a hot concert. Depends on the department. \n\nStep Two: Hire grad students to weed the pile. The criteria are *at least* one published monograph or a journal article in a major impact journal with a completed PhD. Although all openings say \"ABD may be considered\" this is not true in the vast, vast majority of cases.\n\nStep Three: Committee actually sits. Take the pile that the grad students have shit out, and check to make sure there's nothing weird going on (either in or out). Weed out anyone who is looking for an upgraded semi-lateral move (community college to university, lower tier uni to this one) and anyone who is obviously out of the field and hoping that somehow their particular brand of shit sticks.\n\nStep Four: Actually compile a long list of 50-100. Talk about it at the table, and chuck applications that people have spent dozens, even hundreds, of hours on for minor things like going to a minor state school, publishing in mid or low tier journals, doesn't seem like a \"fit\" for the department etc. This is where axe-grinders and the old-boys-club (and it's old boys, and they're all white) comes in.\n\nStep Five: Make a real shortlist. At this point someone(s) will drop an application onto the pile. Depends on who has the horses, but they'll probably get through because that guy needs that other dude's vote at some academic conference for a board position and it's their grad student, and they used to get hammered together in grad school. Their application gets through.\n\nStep Six: Make a *real* short list. Three people at the top, and alternates.\n\nStep Seven: Send out the three invites. These are probably rockstars, so they'll have multiple offers. Hence the alternates. Get three people to agree to be shortlisted.\n\nStep Eight: The three shortlisted candidates come for job talks. They are evaluated by the faculty and graduate students. After another meeting, the department makes an offer of employment.\n\nStep Nine: The candidate declines because they have an offer elsewhere, so you take the #2 candidate. They accept. \n\nStep ten: Congrats, you've successfully hired a new professor. The differences between them and the other 350 candidates are huge, but the difference between them and the stack of 200 (or so) that the grad students handed over in exchange for free pizza and $20 an hour is exceptionally small. \n\n\n",

As a Ph.D. biochemist, I came directly into the Army as a Captain (O-3).  My direct compensation comes from three sources: my basic pay ($48,600/yr when I first came in) my basic allowance for housing ($13,000/yr) and my basic allowance for subsistence ($3,000/yr).  I am currently stationed overseas, so I also get a cost of living adjustment of around $5,000/yr and since I can speak a foreign language, I get an extra $3,000/yr for that.  That's what I made with less than 2 years of service.  As soon as I hit 2 years in service, my basic pay increased to $56,400/yr and I'll continue to get regular pay raises depending on rank and time.  Add all that up and I'm ball park going to be making around $80k this year to do a 9-5 biochemistry job as a laboratory chief while wearing a green suit.

For actually wearing the uniform, I started by getting in contact with a recruiter (for me as a biochemist, I had to get in contact specifically with an AMEDD recruiter as opposed to a normal recruiter - a google search for \"Army direct commission\" should get you on the right track. I got in touch with mine after filling out an online form).  There's benefits and drawbacks to both sides - I gain time off at a faster rate as military as opposed to Civilian, but I'm also held to the same standards as all other Army Soldiers (i.e. weight standards, physical fitness standards, etc).  You'll go through MEPS (military entry processing station) just the same all all military applicants where they check you physically and mentally.  For a direct commission as a biochemist, I also had to provide letters of reference, a CV, and a statement of motivation.\n\nOnce a year, a board meets and are given a quota of biochemists to join for that year.  The board racks and stacks the candidates and selections are made.  Your first duty station is completely at the needs of the Army - you might get some say in which of the openings you go to, but you don't have the wider range of options that you will after your first change of station.",

I'm on my second year in one, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nI finished my PhD in English in 2014 at an R2.  I went on the market, had interviews at MLA, campus interviews--the whole bag.  Two years later, I was still a hired gun doing adjunct work for pennies. One semester, I taught six classes across three institutions, and that year, I cleared about 12 grand.  I was publishing during this period as well.  \n\nAbout two and a half years ago, I was looking at a semester with no adjunct offers, and I starting looking at other options. I cold-call emailed a number independent prep schools, and got one response--from a boys prep school.  Initially, they said they had no openings, but at the time of my info meeting, a faculty member had just broken her contract, and they hired me more or less on the spot. \n\nMy starting was more than associates were making at public universities in my state. The school has a substantial endowment, and they're interested in innovative teaching approaches.  Virtually any project I propose is approved, and securing funds generally requires nothing more than a short conversation.  I teach in my general field (Brit Lit), my classes are rarely over 10, and many of my students are headed to Ivys.  I teach more challenging courses here than I did at most of the universities.  I can also branch out in terms of teaching--in the summer, I teach a short course in darkroom photography, and this summer, a colleague and I are teaching a class on the connection between food and cultural history.  I also coach rowing in the fall and spring.  In general, the faculty culture is better than any university where I've taught--many are PhDs, but there's no competition, and I don't have to deal with egos.  \n\nI did have to get used to things like disciplining students, working longer hours, wearing a tie every day (not all prep schools are like this), and getting up early.  However, these are all small things really.  \n\nAll of my former professors either warned me against this transition, or they responded apologetically.  This is horseshit.  Most of them are locked in an insular environment that virtually breeds egotism by virtue of the isolation aspects of higher ed.  More pointedly, they don't know what they don't know, but most won't admit that.  \n\nAnyway, that's my piece.  I got out thinking I'd failed, and I couldn't be happier. \n",

Nearly all the teachers at my school coach something, but it may not be that way everywhere.  Also, where I am, \"sports\" includes bowling, ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, and debate (really loose interpretation of \"sport\" with that one).  \n\nSports or no, you will likely be required to do extracurricular activities.  Essentially, what many of these schools look for is versatility in a potential hire.  I was scanning over your recent posts, and it looks like you've done Latin translations--so what, a Classics degree?  At my school, a colleague (PhD Classics) teaches Latin, German, and Greek.  Before he came to the school, he'd never taught German.  \n\nSo, in short, not coaching is not a deal-breaker.  You simply have to keep an open mind with the whole thing and remember that it's a different animal than higher ed.  \n\nHere's one of the most prominent placement agencies.  \n\nhttps://www.carneysandoe.com/\n\nGood luck.

If you can't land a job after a few cycles, I think it is best to start looking at other options. Keep applying to academic jobs, but... don't just wait for one while being a part-time adjunct. It will end up setting you behind far worse than anything else. I know when we see someone who has been an adjunct for 5 years the first question is, \"What's wrong with them?\" It's like when a house stays on the market too long and people assume something is really wrong with it, even if there isn't anything wrong with it. \n\nI know a few that took full-time lecturer positions at schools and decided that is what they really wanted to do so they stopped applying for TT gigs.\n\nI knew one that did a near perma-postdoc. It seemed like they were there for years and years between 3 labs at 2 schools. Eventually they took a staff scientist position at a very well-known university in the states (Ivy League). Still not a professor, but I think they gave up on that. ",

It's all the mentoring new generations in lab, taking care of technical and other practical matters, helping and doing research, but without constantly giving talks/lectures and without constant pressure to generate high-level ideas and get money for them. Sadly, it's even less likely to be possible for me than becoming a professor (even though I've already been doing at least about half of what a staff scientist in our lab would do if we had one, for more than a year, while doing my PhD - it isn't a position for which hiring a foreigner could be rationalized anywhere except as a spousal hire, and my native country doesn't have enough opportunities and generally won't hire people who did PhD abroad).",

My boss had been stringing me along for a couple of years to promote me to a RA position and I had no real leverage to make him.  I felt pretty trapped, making barely enough to pay rent and working as much as I was.  All my friends were in IT and made more than twice my salary with all the free time in the world.
