  "title:": "Is it okay to do a personal/side project in a full-time postdoc position without letting the supervisor know?",
  "text": "I am doing a postdoc in computer science. I kind of lose interests in the project after 1.5 year, but I still keep trying to be productive (2 papers accepted).  I was doing a side projectby myself from like half year ago. The side project is not quite relevant to the funded project. The result is interesting and I think it's publishable. I am considering submitting it to a conference without letting him know, as  I am concerned that my supervisor would be upset as he might think it's a full-time job and I should not do any other side project.  Any advice? thanks",

After I got a green card absolutely nothing in terms of a contract or statement of responsibilities with the hospital.

In the UK it is not that big of a deal to work on something else while doing the postdoc project as long as the majority of your time is spent on the post doc project (and that any papers give credit to the grant number).",

Depending on the university, you may even be funded by multiple projects at once during your postdoc. In Sweden, they are even considered faculty and could be PIs of themselves.\n\nResearch funding can come in all shapes and forms, including high-level descriptions of projects, fellowships, internal funding from uni. etc making it impossible ard to generalise any terms.  Probably, the only common term in grant agreements is that deliverables should be on time \u2014or the funding body's PO consent for any delays.\n\nI agree about the need for the 'supervisor' to know about the project and even be given the chance to contribute.
