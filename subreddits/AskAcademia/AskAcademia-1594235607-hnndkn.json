  "title:": "I love working for my PIs because...",
  "text": "So this isn\u2019t a question but I just wanted to take the time to make a shout-out to all the awesome PIs who are nice to their students, and I\u2019m posting this here instead of r/Academia because 10 times the audience haha \n\nContext first, I am a student researcher. I\u2019ve been making a lot of mistakes with my work recently despite having a couple years of lab experience, for a multitude of reasons including Covid. Instead of getting mad at me or engaging in any of the negative behaviour we hear often on this sub, my PIs (I\u2019ve got 3 advisors) have been wonderfully understanding about my poor performance. They\u2019ve repeatedly reassured me that I am not a dumbass, that I am adding value to the lab and projects, and that it is ok to screw up sometimes. At this point, they probably believe in me more than I believe in myself.\n\nAlso, my PIs seem to make it a point to thank me whenever I\u2019ve done extra work or taken initiative, and are lavish with praise for anything they think I\u2019ve done well. They make me feel like I am valued in the lab and their actions assure me that they will be here to support me no matter what. I feel like I would do anything for this lab.\n\nIt may not mean much to them, but for a young student like myself, being praised and supported by my PIs means the world to me. It motivates me to keep at it, and it pushes me to want to grow and work harder and be a better version of myself. \n\nTLDR: be nice to the students and the students probably might sell their soul to your lab willingly",

It's nice to hear that there are actually decent PIs out there, the academia subs can sometimes portray a skewed picture because people come here to vent (absolutely legitimate, but might be a sampling bias if people come looking for advice and leave horrified). \n\nIf you don't mind the question, is this a universal impression in your PI's research group(s)? Can you name any \"green flags\" that people should look for if they look for a group in which people are treated well?",

These are people who are trying to get you to work for them so they'll probably say anything in the beginning.  It's like dating.  \"Oh wow a guy who was interested in me the first time we met, that's a huge green flag!\"  Uh no, it's the bare minimum.\n\nSorry for the pessimism.\n\nIf it's sustained interest and it comes at the cost of research, those are the kinds of stories you're hoping to hear.  I had a couple of bosses who would repeatedly tell me to get out the door to go for a workout instead of extra time in the lab and yeah they were good bosses.",

          "text": "My PhD advisor is an extremely good scientist, and always makes a point that her students are the top priority - in terms of looking out for projects they can collaborate in, useful angles on the data, and when it's time to knuckle down and take the next step on some research. It was amazing to have someone like that in your corner, and now that I am a postdoc I appreciate that even more.  \n\nI'm still not sure how I got this lucky, but the usual green flags were there: it's a pretty big research group, but a very productive one, with good (open) discussions about science during meetings, and the students in the group finished their PhDs, they seemed ambitious, and she has a network of former students and postdocs who do well (and turn out to be nice people).  \n\nOf course, that information is not always available to you. Honestly, trusting your gut feeling at an interview is underrated. How does it feel to discuss science with this person - do they challenge you, and in what way? Do they push you to explore the implications of ideas you've had? Are they kind? This kind of stuff differs between people, but you should look out for your own green flags, so to say.",

My PI is pro-student, and throughout my PhD sat down with me and went through every word of any paper/grant/abstract I wrote so I understood what worked and what didn\u2019t and why, and now I\u2019m a freelance editor and plan to make a career out of it, which they encouraged. My PI is also a cool person, and so down to earth it\u2019s fun to just chat and have a beer as a lab with them around. But probably the most important part of my PI is that they understand that life is still happening outside of lab, and I\u2019ve never in my time in the lab have been guilted for needing to deal with things outside the lab. When my husband suddenly lost his job, my PI offered to postpone a committee meeting so I could deal with logistics. It\u2019s a refreshing thing to have a PI who encourages a work-life balance and understands things happen and you have things that take priority over the lab. \n\nEncouraging taking time for yourself, a work hard play hard philosophy, and supporting their people makes my PI one of best, and because of the way they run the lab, we all enjoy working there and that of course facilitated both quality and quantity work.\n\nI won\u2019t miss being in a lab when I transition, but I will miss my PI.",

It's always great to have a good PI who pushes you hard. \n\nI remember once being quite upset with the first paper I wrote with him because he changed literally the entire paper and yet told me my first draft was still quite good. He did tell me that if I thought I was going pump out a high quality publication having never written one before and that it would just go through and be accepted (and also have his name on it), that was an unlikely prospect. \n\nIn my subsequent papers I always considered it a minor victory when fewer and fewer parts of my drafts were re-written once I had gotten better at writing.",

Everybody is busy working and there are days in the lab where people are frustrated or angry, but it's not the kind that makes us want to give up, and if anything a motivator of our work is the overwhelming sense of guilt in potentially letting her down.
