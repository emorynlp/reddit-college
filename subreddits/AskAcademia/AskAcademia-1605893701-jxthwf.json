  "title:": "Update on Inappropriate Dean (Dean checking out students)",
  "text": "TLDR: we have a second witness and yet nothing is likely to happen.\n\nFirst of all, a HUGE thank you to the people who responded and validated my experience. I'm going through this alone and I only shared a small part of the story. I'm not a victim of sexual violence, but I just had a infinitesimally small taste of what it is like to have your story, one that is very personal and private, discounted by internet strangers. I have nothing to gain from posting this other than feeling slightly more control over the situation--if not in reality, at least in my own mind.\n\nHere's what I left out of my original post: My college has become so toxic that long-time friends and colleagues are now distrustful of one another and can no longer talk about such issues. Another instructor, a woman, also saw him check out a student on a separate occasion. Believe it or not, I have not told her that I saw the same thing. It's incredible. My colleague's theory was that the Dean moved from a cold, more conservative region to a hot and fairly progressive campus where female students wear very short shorts. We also have a lot of student athletes that pass through our building on their way to the adjacent gym. They're tall and, like I said, it's about 105F in the summer so yeah, if I was a woman I would wear as little as the law permits- especially after practice in the summer.\n\nShe also told me how flattered she was when the Dean sent all the female faculty and staff roses last Valentines day (yes this happened too and only to the female faculty/staff).\n\nOur college was barely getting by for about two years without a dean. Once the new Dean arrived, he was a stressed out mess because he began his position in the middle of a ABET accreditation. He's also been pushed by the provost to improve graduation and retention for women in the college. Imagine, women feel uncomfortable in upper division engineering courses? I wonder why?!\n\nWorst part is I still need to hear this shit in meetings: he said that women should do more academic advisement because they are good caretakers. In our campus, advisement does not count as service (yes I know, terrible). The female instructors, mostly part-time, dedicate countless hours to advisement while their male colleagues, mostly full-time instructors, ignore advising and concentrate on building their portfolio. When I raised an objection to a related issue, the Dean looked at me like I'm a male traitor and twisted the argument. He again, told me that women are very compassionate and \"I don't think you'll disagree when I say that women are better parents (he knows I'm married with a kid)\" I was like yeah, mofo, that's because people like you pigeon-hole them and expect them to be perfect caretakers and professionals at the same time. I'm not a white knight like he makes me out to be, but I married someone whose work is based heavily on women's issues and I am constantly confronted with polar opposites and it's exhausting.\n\nThanks for reading.",

(As in, pantomiming an up and down sweep of the eyes with leering and gross lingering on specific body parts).\n\nThere are just too many reasonable other explanations and you have no way to prove intent.\n\nWas he lost in thought?\n\nWas he staring at her because he thoughts she looked like someone he knew?\n\nDid he see a piece of toilet paper trailing from her shoe and spend time debating whether to tell her?\n\nWas he looking at something behind/beside/beyond her?\n\nWas he craning his neck because he was trying not to sneeze or adjusting his mask?\n\nNow, the other things you mention, which were so strangely left of the original post, are far more substantial.\n\nSending roses to only the female faculty?  That\u2019s something a ton of people witnessed that could be addressed, to which people could attest.  Will it get him terminated on its own?  Of course not.  But if enough faculty were to object it would be an issue.  You could complain to HR about inequitable treatment based on gender.\n\nSimilarly with regard to his comments about women being responsible for advising due to being \u2018better caretakers\u2019; again, cite inequitable treatment and take it to HR if you want.  This is a clear statement that he is unequal expectations for job roles based on gender.\n\nThat stuff will give you traction.\n\nWhere his eyeballs are (as seen from behind his head), not so much.",

In my case, I just witnessed him frozen, unnaturally turned to look at something very intently. When I checked to see what he was transfixed by, it was a tall student with shorts. It was a longer period than one would expect. It was so awkward I changed directions and tried to stay out of his sight so that he doesn't see me witness him. Another thing that's bugging me is I am not sure if he saw me see him. The last thing I saw was him still staring.",

If academic advisement is so very valuable, why not add it to the metrics for evaluating staff as something they should be rewarded for spending so much time on? If it is so incredibly valuable, why should only one gender do it? Why shouldn't men mentor women students? Before you cry \"OH SEXUAL HARASSMENT RISK\" you really ought to know I'm engaged to a man who managed to mentor high school and college female students into various engineering programs (bachelors and PhD), so it actually can be done - if you're a decent human being.\n\nJust to throw a loop in it  - all staff should have received flowers and chocolate for valentines day in my opinion. Equal means all in this situation.",

But the dean is 100% contributing to an unequal workload by encouraging only one gender to do the unpaid work of mentorship. A dean focused on actual gender equality would push back on the university system \"Oh, you want me to produce more female engineers from my department? That's great, let's add metrics to the employee evaluation that says instructors who devote 25% or more of their time to student mentorship merit a 1% pay raise on top of cost of living raises.\" That university needs to put their money where their mouth is, or it's just lip service to inclusion.",
