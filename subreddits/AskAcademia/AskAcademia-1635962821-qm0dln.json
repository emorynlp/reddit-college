  "text": "So, I'm very burnout from my PhD and I'm leaving. I've already published a paper and I'm finishing another.\n\nI've done all the work, alone, for months, with my own means and with barely any help. I've had to do everything. My director and a colleague are helping me write the final paper to send for publication. They are included as authors and I don't mind because they're helping me out. Also the guy who provided the data is included as an author, ok by me.\n\nNow, there are three guys who I've never heard of and know nothing about, who have had absolutely no input in anything and are also listed as authors. They are very relevant in their fields, but...\n\nIs this normal? Can I say something? Or should I say something? I have worked on my own and created a decent publication with very low resources and in a difficult situation and there are 6 other guys who also get credit, three of them that literally I didn't know of their existence before reading their names as authors?\n\nI don't know if it's common in academia, is it?",

      "text": "Every PhD student's graduate education should include thoughtful discussion about the ethics of authorship, effort, and attribution. Discussing authorship, including listed order, should be an essential part of the initial process - or at least as early as reasonably possible.\n\nMy standard advice is sit down with a trusted academic mentor and talk about the issue both in general and in specifics. If that trusted academic mentor isn't the PI on the project, then you also need to have the conversation with them subsequently. Learn to develop the skill of talking about authorship and attribution so that everyone's expectations are clearly set before the project begins. \n\nYou really need to educate yourself on this topic beyond a reddit post. Search out statements from groups in your field. For example, here's a statment by the APA: [https://www.apa.org/science/leadership/students/authorship-paper.pdf](https://www.apa.org/science/leadership/students/authorship-paper.pdf) Look into books and other resources for graduate students.\n\nBut if you've already decided you're leaving, then I'll shift my advice a bit. If you are burned out and leaving academia, then the question should be: A) What are your future plans and how will the expanded author list affect those plans? B) How much of your time and effort do you want to put into addressing what you perceive as unjustified authorship credits? What's in it for you?",

For the moment, I think I'm ok with being credited with what I did. I'll talk to them and try to include a CRediT author statement.\n\nI want to move into the industry. I don't know how relevant the publications will be but I've included them to have something to show for this period of time. Also, I don't think recruiters will really look at the publications and the credits, etc (maybe they do) so I think it's best to leave be and leave as soon as possible.",

That would be the best possible outcome, I think.\n\nIf not, you can complain (and you would absolutely be in the right), but I am not sure it would be worth your energy. Either way, going for the CRediT statement seems worthwile. \n\nUnfortunately, this is not as uncommon as it should be according to my experience.",

I told my supervisor how much this annoyed me, which she agreed with and after considerable discussion the second paper was cut down to 8 authors.\n\nTheoretically there are indeed requirements to be author. In practice, however, these can be... bent and stretched.",

You can just go straight to your supervisor and ask (as innocently as possible) \"hey who are these guys and why are they on our paper?\". The onus is then on your supervisor to come up with a reason. He/she might actually have a legit reason; if not, then that's when you can suggest removing them. \n\nIf your boss doesnt have a good reason to include these authors, yet insists to do so, just say \"OK\", then report it to the research ethics committee without informing your boss. make him/her answer to a research ethics committee. \n\nbridge is already burnt by this point by your boss (not by you) by not reasonably justifying his/her actions",

I was recently added as a coauthor to a paper I knew nothing about, the student was evaluating some old data I took some years ago with a new method. The thing is, in my field it is very much consensus that if you took the data, you are a coauthor on publications using your data. In other fields, these things are handled differently.",
