  "text": "I\u2019m writing my dissertation. I want to reference a good idea that someone else came up with and has funding for. When I looked up the funded researchers I could not find a single paper of theirs that mentions the idea they have funding for, potentially because it\u2019s a relatively new grant. Can I reference their grant from NIH RePORTER somehow? I\u2019m assuming I could just reference the website but idk if that\u2019s weird or not. When I tried to look it up every website just talked about citing your own grant not someone else\u2019s for reference. I\u2019m stumped but really want to mention the idea cause it\u2019s pure gold.",

          "text": "I have no plan on scooping these guys lmfao. Their idea is way outside my capacity. Like where biomedical science meets biomedical engineering\u2026 I\u2019m not an engineer in the slightest. I\u2019m actually talking about how the research I did has no obvious translation (basic science) even though it\u2019s under the guise of helping whereas other research such as theirs has potential to really help people. Its literally a overarching thought at the end of my dissertation in the discussion lol. People who scoop other people either cant think for themselves or are lazy. AND the only reason I figured out it existed was because I thought of it while laying in bed at night and googled it to find out it\u2026already exists. To which I was pleasantly surprised considering I have no plans on bringing that to fruition but I\u2019m glad someone else is.",
