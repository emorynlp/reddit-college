Some careers are extremely straight forward.  Some of them are just a job that needs to be done.  And that\u2019s fine.\n\nBut I also think everyone in our society can benefit from those skills within life.  I also think every career can also benefit from those skills.

I never had much motivation to do homework unless I could get it done during class without getting into trouble for it. I felt like I never really had a choice, my parents always hyped up my intelligence and it felt like NOT going to college would mean I was a failure. I went to college for one year with plans to be a high school English teacher. I had good grades but half way through the year I started having strong feelings of being insecure about my choice. What if I wasn\u2019t motivated enough to do so well that I would get hired, what if I ended up hating it after all that effort? I wasn\u2019t sure I had the skills and discipline to do my homework and relying solely on good test scores in college seemed like a terrible idea compared to high school. My grandfather was an electrician and had always been my role model for the type of person I wanted to be. He worked hard every day and I couldn\u2019t have been prouder of him, so I applied to the local IBEW apprenticeship in town. I got accepted and dropped out of the end of my second semester and haven\u2019t looked back since. It\u2019s been 9 years, I\u2019m really good at my job and love the sense of accomplishment it can give me. It sounds silly but I even take pride in every piece of conduit that I bend. I\u2019ll challenge myself to see how nice I can make everything look and am now teaching my apprentices helpful techniques that I\u2019ve learned. On top of that I make better money than I ever would had I continued with college, and generally feel appreciated by my bosses and colleagues. I was elected to the Executive Board of my Local last year and am looking forward to pushing us to sign up for local job fairs at schools so I can pass on advice to people who may be like me. That advice being to at least strive to try college, but that if it doesn\u2019t feel right for you there is no shame in putting in a hard physical days work and that you shouldn\u2019t feel looked down upon for not having completed college.",

Not to mention- your job requires skills that a majority of people don\u2019t have (I sure as heck don\u2019t.) people also seem to think that by not going to college it means that person A who went to college is smarter/more qualified/more capable than person B who didn\u2019t attend college; and that\u2019s simply not true. I love the classroom, the work, etc and I\u2019ve always been really good \u201cat school,\u201d so the natural next step for me was college and I enjoy it. My career that I know I\u2019ll enjoy, also requires me to have a college degree so there\u2019s that too; but, my fianc\u00e9 for example, he went to a technical college and has a couple of certifications and a job that\u2019s not even related to those- but he\u2019s equally as intelligent as I am (not meaning that in a mean and/or braggy way) and can think critically and analytically. But college wasn\u2019t for him (he doesn\u2019t like the classroom setting and is the same as you when it comes to homework) and that\u2019s fine because he does work within the community that helps better us locally everyday. The world needs a person in every field and just because you don\u2019t have a college degree doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not as equally qualified, intelligent, etc as someone w/ a degree. For example, he just applied for a position higher up and was passed on Bc the other applicant had a master\u2019s; well, it turns out this person is in no way qualified (other than by degree), cannot do the job, and they\u2019re most likely not going to be there much longer. I\u2019m sorry for the rant, but my main point was that I\u2019m glad you shared your story, I think going to high schools would be great- especially sharing your story Bc many high schools make it seem like if you don\u2019t go to college then there\u2019s no way you can get a good job, and thank you for the work you do!",

But not many people have the kind of free time early (immediately after high school) or later on (after starting a family and/or working) to make it a part-time thing and give it a chance and decide whether or not school is what they want to do. But the problems remains is that they probably need to be spending those hours actually at work or taking care of their kids.\n\nI have also been quite excited when a family member in their 50s earns their first Associates degree or Bachelors, even if it didn't first appear that a degree would be earned.

Some people need the space and freedom of a big state school.  Others really thrive in the focus and cloistered feeling of a smaller college.  That matters a lot. \n\nBut also, a lot of students in my survey classes--between 5% and 10%--have no business being in college.  They are primarily interested in getting drunk/getting high.  Or they are video game shut-in addicts.  Or they have major family issues (parents dying while having to take care of little brothers, kind of thing). \nOr they are going through serious, serious mental health issues.  (one of my students suffered full-onset schizophrenia two years ago.  poor kid.  but once it began to manifest, the stress of college was just exactly the wrong environment.) \n\nYou just can't \"do\" college if you're in any of those situations.\n\nIf it's just a matter of motivation, maybe a different peer group or college or other sort of \"re-set\" is the way to go.   But if it's something very serious (like the aforementioned) I just worry that college is a waste of money for those students.",

I pursued my undergrad right out of high school, but the day before my first sophomore semester my grandmother died and around that time my mental health issues also started manifesting and I had dealt w/ major family issues for my entire life basically; I moved out at 17. (For context I am female, and with what I\u2019m diagnosed with the time period/age was right on target- bipolar disorder, C-PTSD, panic disorder, severe situational & mixed anxiety.) So my first couple of years in undergrad were horrible and I dug myself into a hole that caused me to have to extend my undergrad (to bring up GPA, retake classes, gain lab experience, internships, etc), so in that regard- yes it was a \u201cwaste\u201d of money. BUT, my dream was/is to get my Ph.D. in neuroscience so I pushed through and I have to make a choice every day to continue treatment/therapy and to discipline myself to do what I need to do despite the adversity I face daily. I think I agree with your general sentiments, but I also think it depends on the student and how bad they want it. I\u2019ve had to finagle, juggle, and learn how to deal with a lot, but here I am still plugging away and I don\u2019t think it was a waste of money- despite the struggles I still face. I will say though, I did take a 2 year break when things got really bad because I was just failing my classes, not going, etc and I knew if I didn\u2019t that I\u2019d never be able to get through college or life (I needed that time and I needed to get help.) The break also helped me to realize what I really wanted though and that was to finish my degree and to continue to pursue higher education.

      "text": "\"College isn't for everyone\" is political propaganda. There is no planet on which higher ed is not worth pursuing if it's what you want. Politicians benefit from a less-educated populace, so they feed into a narrative that discourages education, using phrases like this and their other go-to, which is calling higher ed \"elitist.\" They also don't want to pay for education, and the business elites need a reliable workforce in areas that don't require a 4-year degree, and don't want to have to pay people more because they have a college degree.\n\nAs for your personal circumstance, if I can do it, you probably can. I have ADHD (that can't be medicated due to a heart condition), autism, dyscalculia (math disability), and depression/anxiety. I went back to school in my late 20's and finished in 4 years. Now in a masters program. If I can do it, anyone can.\n\nHere is the way I see it instead: College is for anyone who wants an education, or whose career aspirations require it. Even if you want to be an artist, there are colleges for that and you will benefit from the rigor that the good ones provide. If you want to be an electrician, or a piano tuner, there are of course trade degrees for those things, and I suppose that's not what you'd call \"college.\" But if what you want requires a 4-year degree, don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't accomplish. Only you get to decide that.\n\nIf you're not sure if you can do it, just do what I did: Literally just keep going until they kick you out, or until you decide it isn't worth the personal costs, or til you discover something better. If you fail, at least you will know you tried and you won't spend the rest of your life wondering.\n\nAlso, find mentors. Either your professors, or someone else who is further ahead of you in the career path you want to pursue. Mentors are invaluable, and essential. I cannot stress this enough.  \n\n\nEdit: Why is this getting downvoted?? I hope it's not academics doing it. Your job is to encourage and support your students, not to limit them. If I had listened to people who told me to go choose a trade job instead of doing a 4 year degree in science, I wouldn't have founded a nonprofit, be working in an amazing lab doing exactly the kind of science I want to be doing, and be working on my first publication now. If you want a college education, then yes--college is for you. Period.",

The correct response to that problem is not to tell students to aim lower.

Universities don't make it easy and the people who are there to help you are understaffed, underpaid, stressed and miserable. \n\nAnyways. Yeah, unis are getting worse. If you go to Harvard, most of your classes will be taught by TAs. Professors will take on maybe 1-2 undergrad students a year to mentor. My current uni has like, 10000 undergrads or something. Most of those kids won't get any sort of mentorship because there simply aren't enough people to provide it.",

      "text": "No, it's not that simple.\n\nIn truth, college \\*should\\* be for everyone... that wanted to go. But college in America- and the broader Western world, really- is less about legitimate pedagogy and instruction. It used to be, in many cases. But that was back when nuns ran many educational institutions. Currently, school is more a revenue-generation tool. And a means of protecting /manipulating wages for certain industries. And a means of social control.\n\nBeyond institutional incentives- which are created well outside of academia, in many cases- the problem extends deep into one's childhood. \"The problem\" occurs even before kindergarten.\n\nNot only are there considerable differences in the quality of instruction in k-12, often explicitly predicated on the ability of local jurisdictions to generate property tax revenue (which is tied, of course, to more expensive houses), but there are disparities in access to technology, disparities in access to literal books, deficiencies in special education access, a lack of access to housing, nutrition, etc., facilities that are literally a threat to human health, and even air/water that contains known carcinogens.\n\nAdd in the very real- and well-documented- reality that a teacher can alter the entire trajectory of one's life simply through their bias, and there's a recipe for disaster. And, yes, a teacher thinking someone is a \"bad\" student has been proven to be linked to that student becoming a student with poor educational outcomes. That because the student basically wants to live up to the expectations that have been set by the authority figure, i.e., the teacher.\n\nOn top of all of that, we're in a climate where it's incredibly hard to be a k-12 teacher. There are algorithms that basically dictate who gets to have a contract renewed. And those algorithms get things wrong- a lot. Everyone is potentially at the mercy of an irate parent. Curricula has been politicized to the point of chilling expression. You can't acknowledge that racial divisions exist because that's \"socialism.\" But you also can't acknowledge that slavery wasn't exclusively limited to Black people who were trafficked as part of the African slave trade. AP classes are seen as problematic, but so is removing clearly disruptive students from a classroom. Etc. Add in conflicting federal guidelines and standardized testing and...\n\nIt's no surprise that many Americans now enter college without the necessary tools to succeed. And that's just academically. Some have estimated that up to a fifth of first-year college students are functionally illiterate, and up to a third require at least some remedial classes in math or English.\n\nBut, beyond that, the money in higher ed is now in international students.\n\nHowever, if you have too high a ratio of international students, you not only disadvantage local communities and disrupt local labor markets/industries by lowering the potential supply of skilled workers but also create barriers for existing students, since international students may have language/cultural barriers to success that need addressed. And that does nothing to comment on the logistics of ensuring students can physically get to classes and remain in the country legally- without angering what are likely high-level officials in other countries.\n\nOf course, not pissing off oil despots or genocidal maniacs because you want to keep the international student tuition coming in imposes limits on adjunct professors. They need students to fill out surveys and tell administrators how wonderful the professors are- and they need people to get good grades. Which means less freedom to actually tell the truth or conduct legitimate empirical research.\n\nNow, all of that said, colleges are very different. Some care more about money. Some care more about students. Some have been sued successfully over not having enough ADA resources. Some have mid-level bureaucrats with a work ethic and who actually care about their jobs, which means more Trio resources or whatever. Some just have good lobbyists, which means more money flowing through the institution.\n\nIf you like partying and want easy classes, look up party schools. Wisconsin would probably work. If you like frigid weather, there's New England, the Dakotas, Alaska... If you want to study a niche topic, there's a university out there. If you're a URM and want to be around more people from your historically marginalized community, there are HBCUs, as well as schools with large-ish populations consisting of pretty much any desired demographic. If you're not good at reading or math but can't find the drive to do online classes, there are schools for that, too.\n\nCollege, overall, is, unfortunately, not for everyone. But, with that said, if one is willing to look and relocate, there \\*is\\* a college for them.",

Then in grad school, I got to have a different kind of experience, and it sort of balanced out the weird parts of undergrad.\n\nWhatever happens, remember that a huge part of your education is learning about yourself.

Going through the learning curve is something we've all gone through without school, but it's very hard to be consistent about (learning an instrument, new language, etc). If you're extremely diligent and passionate, you can technically remove the school component and try going through the curve on your own. It's incredibly difficult but possible. \n\nTo be successful in life, one would hope that you would have the obsession and intense vigor that it would take to bypass college to begin with. None of this requires college as all practical knowledge is based on experience. \n\nSo college does look good on paper at the current moment to the average individual.

Many are not in the right mental place to pursue higher education. However, most simply don't have goals compatible with pursuing higher education. They're simply looking to get out of their parent's house and don't know what else to do.\n\nImagine for a moment that we did it like most of the developed world does. If you're attending college at all, it's because you've already accomplished most of what American universities consider \"general education\" requirements. The college you attend is normally going to be a non-residential commuter college without sports team, extracurricular activities or pretty much anything except purely academic spaces. Spots for low demand majors are extremely restricted.\n\nDo you think that sort of college would be appealing to most high school students in America? College without the 'college experience'? I doubt it. My suspicion is that they'd save boatloads of money and just not go.
