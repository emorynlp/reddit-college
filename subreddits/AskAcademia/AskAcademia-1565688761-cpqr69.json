  "title:": "Update: gave my 15 minute presentation about my PhD at a job interview",
  "text": "Hi all- I just wanted to say thanks x1000 to all your super helpful tips. I posted here last week about summarizing my doctorate work for a job interview. \n\nThe job interview was about 2 hours of questions/discussion going over the position and my past experience. I then gave my presentation, which in the end took 18 minutes \ud83d\ude2c. I summarized two papers from my work, the 2 I thought would be most interesting to the outside world. And per your tips, I really just gave the most high level take home messages, didn\u2019t get too lost in methods and details. \n\nAnd in the end I was offered the job \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a. Thanks reddit family!!",
