  "text": "I am currently beginning a master's in IR. I have trouble truly understanding what is going on in academic debates. This is true in IR, and it was true in my Bachelor's (Arts and Culture; I believe the American equivalent is 'liberal sciences'. History, philosophy, arts, and politics). Because of this, I often got average grades, and I think it stems from my inability to understand at a deeper level, and because of that, I'm unable to find an 'academic gap' that I am interested in, and my writing ends up being (I think) very surface-level.\n\nI'm worried about keeping up in my master's, especially since my bachelor's is in a different field. Are there any resources--blog posts, podcast episodes, youtube videos, articles, other answers on here, etc.--that can help explain this to me? Or, is this a conversation to have with a professor who has graded one of my papers?",

      "text": "If it's not a case of impostor syndrome (where you feel you are less than you truly are, very common in academia) I'd say that you probably need a better basis to stand on. Likely you don't understand the conceptualization expected in whatever debate you're in the middle of, and thus do not follow the arguments. You need less reading about academia than you need reading in your current field. Go to google scholar and search for current (2019 forward, depending on the case) articles to read. If you are also unsure if you read well, I'll point you to a small guide on reading academically a friend of mine put together based on her experience teaching methods to undergrads https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6NaxivVFTkSMHpSTF9nSk5Qckk/view?usp=drivesdk&resourcekey=0-EbgFm4t1lGa5POc8i7kgpQ",

But it takes me a lot longer than others to understand them, because I don't have a background in this particular field. That's to be expected; there are no shortcuts. Thanks for the handout!!\n\nEdit: Just read through that handout. This is exactly what I was looking for. I am wasting my time trying to understand everything by trying to jump straight into the 'second pass', and also ignoring the third. Thank you!!",

      "text": "I'm actually sure that there are videos on youtube etc that explain what realpolitik is, do Kenneth Waltz for dummies and so on, much like there is similar content for philosophy. That said, if you want improved understanding of the content/better grades, especially at the master's level, I doubt you'll get far with content aimed at laymen or freshmen at best. You have to read and understand that actual, you know, monographs and journal articles that these people put forward. So tbh why you are asking for\n\n> blog posts, podcast episodes, youtube videos, articles, other answers on here\n\nis puzzling to me. If over the course of your education you have avoided the assigned reading and instead looked to Khan Academy-type resources - in a nutshell, that's why lol. Read what you're assigned for every class, actively, probably more than once if you are struggling, and participate in class discussion. Speak to your professor when you have questions. You can't be relying on blogs at the graduate level.\n\nThat said, IR is not lucrative in any country. If you have struggled this much with IR in your bachelor's, I rather wonder why you elected to continue with it in your master's. It's not the kind of degree you should suffer through to benefit financially later - because you won't.",

      "text": "I felt that I was in this situation a while back. I realized the problem for me was that I lacked the basic ontological and epistemological knowledge of academia in general as well as important basic theoretical principals that I often glossed over on the first week of classes, and as a restult I had a hard time understanding what authors were doing in their IR research. This gap in my personal knowledge was primarily I think because of my own naievetity that the first weeks werent important but also I think I lacked personal experience with both theoretical and empirical research. Until I went to my undergraduate university I had never met an academic, so I did not have any exposure to establish any sort of building blocks. However, over time I met some great people who were willing to meet me half way and break things down for me and help me see the bigger picture. I worked hard to expose myself to the industry, and one day it started to click. You'll never know it all but eventually I think it all comes together. \n\nDon't listen to people here telling you that maybe academia is not for you. Keep at it and one day you'll have that aha moment.",

      "text": "Echoing what many commenters have said above, I wonder if obsessing over the \"gap in the literature\" is also stifling your learning and creativity. Obsessing over a \"gap\" can be a very STEM way to view knowledge production.\n\nCoursework and reading can also be thought of as orientation-building, developing numerous literacies to understand, track, and eventually join (academic) conversations. The publication process, in turn, is one of enunciating what you're seeing in the world and situating those observations and analyses within an on-going dialogue flavored by your discipline.\n\nWhat opens up when you reflect what you would need to allow yourself to better develop your fluency with the languages and ideas in your field of study instead of searching for hacks to extract information and frack gaps in the literature?",

      "text": "One very important part of academic debate, is academic debate is often done based with depth of knowledge and sources.\n\nTwo things will help you here.  First is to survey the history of the field.  I find a strong understanding of the history a field leads to understanding how the current viewpoints evolved and their assumptions.  Focus on the paradigms and what caused them to change, and the key scholars.\n\nThen survey the modern literature.  Read what is being researched in your own area of interest.  Know who the big names active right now, and their positions.  \n\nWith these two areas, you should have at least the background information to better debate modern issues.\n\nFor where academic debate differs from normal debate, academic debates are based on assumptions, theory, and evidence.  For things you are making cases for you will want to know what are the assumptions that are made by people, what their theory's are and what evidence they have.  When critiquing you often want to focus on the assumptions or the evidence.  Are the assumptions valid and does the evidence conform to the assumptions.  If the evidence violates the assumptions of the theory, then the theory has signs of weakness.  \n\nLook at how others write in these debates for examples.  Special issues of journals with a key article, replies and a rejoiner are great places to start to see how academic debates play out.",

      "text": "I agree with everybody else suggesting that you do more systematic reading. Adding to that, maybe you could find a way to map out the framework you feel is lacking. \n\nFor example: Does your field (fields, I suppose, pick whichever you want) have some foundational thinkers (may be 'classics' but they could be relatively recent)? I would write them down, then draw lines between the names or theories. Label those names; do they agree? Do they build on each other? Are they mutually exclusive? Do they actually respond to each other at some point? I would not be ashamed to use Wikipedia in this process, but if you still have them, old syllabi will be invaluable here! Wikipedia will very often have a separate paragraph with 'critiques' or something similar, which will be helpful too.\n\nIf you feel like this has helped you get an idea on foundational differences within the field, you can revisit more recent/less influential/more applied work, and add them to your map. Do they correspond with one or more of the foundational thinkers? Do they build bridges between several of those? Do they improve on, nuance, or criticize those big theories or names? Those are contributions to academic debates. \n\nThe advice to keep reading is good, but in my opinion that is not the only resource you have to figure out academic debates. One (absolutely wonderful) prof in my master's program would show us a list of five 'debates' or standpoints that authors in social sciences can have/should relate to. She would then invite us to apply those to our readings and determine where the authors stand on those topics. It was incredibly helpful and it still is, years later. So  you could also, if you feel comfortable, contact one of your profs if they have office hours, and simply ask them: I have identified this set of debates in the field, have I missed any and can we go over how different positions in these would limit, shape, or guide the research a person would do.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",
