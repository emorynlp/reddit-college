Help from librarians. Relying on the savvy of older colleagues in the field to suggest seminal work. Making friends with obsessive coworkers with huge filing cabinets who would save every paper they read.\n\nYou were furious if you tracked down a paper with a grandiose title and/or abstract that actually covered only a nuance of a subset of what it claimed to cover.",

      "text": "We went to the library. We consulted physical reference works, like printed bibliographies. To find those, we consulted (literally!) \"bibliographies of bibliographies\" that were, as you'd imagine, annotated, topical listings of other published bibliographies.  We read summaries of book reviews in Book Review Digest. We looked up authors in a reference work called American Authors. We used gazeteers to find place names. We used the card catalog and browsed the shelves. Once we found cites for articles we had to get them by finding the actual journal on the shelves, or the microfiche, or more often simply had to fill out an interlibrary loan request (on paper) and then way 2-3 weeks for a photocopy to come in the US mail. Or-- if you weren't at a major research library --you would *drive* to a major research library and do it all over again.\n\nHonestly, I really do miss the reference section and all the specialized resources that used to live there. It wasn't much over 20 years ago that this stuff still mattered, and I taught students how to find and use all those physical resources in the actual library.\n\nBut it also wasn't that much *longer* ago (late 80s?) that I could get a reference librarian to fire up the ol' teleprinter and query Lexis to look up legal info for me-- it cost something like $5 a search and we had to submit them (on paper) a day in advance. Around the same time a friend was house sitting for a guy who was writing a reference book, some sort of historical dictionary IIRC, and his home office was almost entirely taken over by many thousands of 4x6\" note cards in meticulous stacks...when visiting we were allowed only to gaze into the room from the doorway.",

I averaged 4 hours a day in the library for weeks when starting any new project.

He also told me to regularly visit the library and check new issues of other journals. We had a huge university library, so that was indispensable. Lots of photocopying. PsycINFO and similar databases existed back then and were more useful than they are now. Also regularly attending conferences and talking to people was pretty crucial (still is but for slightly different reasons).",
