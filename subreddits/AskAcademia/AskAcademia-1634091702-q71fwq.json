I'm a slow typist and often feel like there is a block between my thoughts and how they come out when I type. Speaking my thoughts feels much more natural.\n\nDoes anyone have experience using dictation software for academic writing? I'd be very interested in hearing your experience and what setup you use.",

      "text": "Hey! So, I suffer from a similar problem and have found that the most useful dictation software thingies to use aren't necessarily the ones you find on a laptop e.g. Dragon, and certainly not the built-in Word dictation tool. Rather, I've had success using what are essentially automatic transcribing apps, mostly designed for journalists, which record an audio recording and transcribe as it goes. The one I use is called Otter, and it's available for free as a mobile app. Literally switch it on, press record and watch as your words fill up the screen. You can then email the file to yourself as a text file. Accuracy rate is around 90%, I'd say, and since it records the audio, you can easily go back and correct anything where the transcription is incorrect.",

It's dreadful for academic writing because coverage for scientific/domain terms is really weak and punctuation is a huge pain. Obviously anything that requires Tex or fancy markup is basically impossible.\n\nI ended up spending a good 50% of my time correcting dictation errors, rephrasing sentences, and adding punctuation. This was true across every tool I tried. \n\nI think dictation is fine in an office job where you're emailing colleagues, but for published work it's slower than even the worst typing.\n\nTry getting yourself some typing-tutor software. It'll pay off far better to just learn to type.",

It highly depends on which software you use and how good your mic is, otherwise it becomes frustrating very quickly. \n\nDragon is the best I've found, because it can be loaded with specialty specific vocabulary. However, the dictation software in Google Docs is a close second. It's free and rather decent. The built in software for Windows is dead last - it's the worst and not worth the effort to train it imo. \n\nRegardless of what you use, I'd recommend giving it a solid week of a try because it takes a bit to get fast.",

Should work with french names, town names, whatever....\n\nIf you feel particularly nerdy, listen to this: I personally use Vim for writing reports. By the power of the linux terminal, I have looked through 1000s of those reports and made a list of unique words (there is literally a 'unique' command), then deleted all words shorter than 10 characters (I do not want suggestions for super short words) and used that as my spellfile. \n\nImagine you write an essay about the bible and you apply that method to the text of the bible first - all your weird names of towns and people are already there when you start.",
