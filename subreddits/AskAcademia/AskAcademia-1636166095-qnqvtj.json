  "title:": "Writing my first reference letter for someone's graduate applications. What should I include?",
  "text": "Hey r/AskAcademia,  \n\nI was asked by an undergrad I worked with to write a letter of reference for his Master's in Computer Science applications. I was wondering what are the things that should go on the reference.  \n\nFor context, I worked with this person when I was the lecturer of an undergraduate course (not an official university course, but still pretty comprehensive and rigorous). My letter's subject (say Bob) was the student organizer and the head TA of the course. I was a master's student at that time and now work in a large industrial research lab. Since I am not a faculty nor do I have a PhD I think my letter would carry much less weight than a professor's. I am not sure what I can do to alleviate this and help his application.   \n\nFor my first draft, I have commented on the student's work ethic and preparedness, his knowledge of the subject, and his ability to work in a team. I have tried to contextualise these qualities through ranking Bob among ~300 undergrads that I have advised/worked with, and also giving concrete examples of things that I stood out to me while working with Bob (like one time we discussed one of my research papers in-depth).    \n\nAny pointers on how to write a strong letter would be much appreciated.",

          "text": "I wouldn't say conforming to the norm in a reference letter is bad, I'd say it was good. Having seen what happens when people decide to go rogue or maverick I think playing it safe with a solid, positive letter is really the best thing you can do by the person you're writing it for. Not a reference but a colleague and were reduced to helpless laughter when we had a job application that included the candidate introducing her husband and announcing her recent wedding and name change. It was so inappropriate and extreme.",

      "text": "I usually ask people to write some bullets about what they'd like me to address (ideally they should reflect the desired characteristics from the job/program advert but I don't spoon feed them that much). Then I write about those. Just because I think it's important, you should also take time to consider any implicit bias in your reference if you haven't already. References are awful for bias - women are nice, team players, collaborative, pleasant. Men have leadership potential, authority, assertive, lead their project, clever etc. I'm currently on a faculty recruitment panel and some of the letters have made me cringe.",

Yours is only one of (probably) three.\n\nYou cannot write a letter exactly like a professor would, so do not try.  Those letters will focus on his academic background, his academic abilities, his facility with discipline-specific theory and method, etc. \n\nYour description of your letter focuses on the skills that Bob has that you can identify and explicate by providing specific and detailed examples.  That's exactly what you should do.\n\nI think your letter sounds terrific as is.",
