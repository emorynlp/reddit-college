  "title:": "Dealing with uncertainty with respect to creativity",
  "text": "Having spent some time in academia, I realised that performing research is quite repetitive: you generate an original idea, maybe apply for funding, design the experiment, perform it, write the paper. The rate at which you are supposed to repeat this process has been accelerating in recent years as well, researchers are required to produce many more papers now than they did 50 years ago. My question is about the very first step in this process: generation of an idea, so lets assume that you are good at everything else (experiments/simulations, data analysis, writing papers).\n\nAs a young researcher, how can you be certain that for the rest of your career (30+ years) you will be able to generate new ideas? Or, if you do not want to think that far ahead, how sure are you that you will have an idea to work on in 3 years from now?\n\nOn a similar note, among successful researchers, is it normal to struggle with finding the right idea? Are successful researchers actually so creative that they never have to worry about this (and consequently, a lack of good ideas is a sign to leave academia before it kicks you out)? Or is creativity something that you can work on?",

      "text": "Generating those original ideas is the most fun part of science, but also the most difficult. It is completely normal to struggle finding those ideas. And if it's any consolation, I find that I am getting better at it with time. I think there is a good reason for this: more of an overview, and experience.\n\nFew weeks ago I actually made a little vid about why it is so hard to get these totally new ideas.  Would be interesting to hear what others think. [https://youtu.be/1T0h1jyaAlA](https://youtu.be/1T0h1jyaAlA)",

      "text": "This is why theres this huge search for gifted children in schools generally. Most people shouldnt do research in the regular way. Research is one of the most creative jobs out there and so intellectual giftedness aka being a creative is the single most important thing for success. Not being able to see the bigger picture, connecting the dots and thus finding new endeavours constantly renders you useless. Anyone could do normal science work.\n\nThe independent thinking and exploration part of science is what makes research so incredibly unique.",

          "text": "Sure, but a person's intellect does not exist in a vacuum, sometimes your field can run its course, or others have snatched all the good ideas by the time you finished your last project. How do you manage these risks and how do you mentally deal with the uncertainty?\n\nAs for the second part of my question... Is your average PI generating 100s of good,publishable project ideas, or is it more like 2, and the luckiest researcher survives the grant season? How much time does the average researcher put aside to work on finding good ideas? Surely the average person does not come up with them all randomly in a shower, I think that only happens in Hollywood movies.",

              "text": "In my field I've found some people do just stick to the research but most actually end up with research only being one aspect (and it's questionable how much of the creativity is theirs and how much is younger staff that they support to get grants etc). Many end up doing a whole host of activities alongside their research - become directors of institutes, set up spin outs, sit on boards of interesting things from museums to foundations, go into policy, senior university administration, running international initiatives, advising WHO, I even know people who established public engagement departments for their organisation. It's less that they run out of creativity, it's more that ambition and their creativity needs more outlets than a straight up academic career can provide. I can't think of a senior academic I know, who is only doing research in their lab.",

              "text": "As a creative and diagnosed \"gifted\" person i can say that it usually is the shower thoughts that lead me to breakthroughs. Theres a constant film going on in my jead 24/7 no matter what i do. I am thinking about what i do every single second.\n\nNormal people tend to be more focused than i am if i am not in my hyperfocus/hypomanic state though. Some people are made for some jobs, others arent but in turn can do most things in a mediocre manner. \n\nYou do have to live what do if you decide to go to research. Bein a researcher is not only a job but a way of thinking and perceiving the world to some degree. Especially looking the the current conditions when working in the world of research one can only survive for longer if one is passionate about he/she does.\n\nEdit: concerning thheft of ideas i would highly advise you to have a secret bullet journal and do some secret work at home if you are planning on causing a possible paradigm shift kn your field.",
