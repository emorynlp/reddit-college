  "title:": "Am I a bad scientist and not cut out for research, or not trained to standard? Would appreciate advice on how to proceed.",
  "text": "I\u2019m a student and new to the lab months ago with no experience.\n\nI feel like such a sh*tty incompetent scientist. I have a 4.0 gpa and am supposed to start a PhD in the fall - I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m not cut out for this, and am wondering if someone could tell me if I am the the problem (please don\u2019t sugar coat). I am close to tears writing this and would like some advice about how to move forward. \n\n\nHere\u2019s a few instances:\n\nWhen I entered the lab on my first day,\nmy postdoc supervisor told me to make SDS-PAGE gels - I had no protocols and no one had shown me how to.\n\nI then spent weeks some weeks shadowing the post doc and helping them with their projects. During that time, the postdoc regularly laughed at several of my questions and made \u201cwtf\u201d faces. I grew to feel scared to ask questions and it made me feel like I wasn\u2019t fit for research. \n\nWhen I started my own project, I asked for cloning protocols I had never done before/ was never shown. Postdoc laughed at me and told me they were so basic he didn\u2019t have protocols.\nFor some other things I was told to just look online. \nWhen I asked how to use the auto clave, postdoc made a \u2018wtf\u2019 face and told me \u201cyou just turn it on\u201d. \n\nFor many of the protocols I was trained in, I was shown a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach. \n\nDuring my training, post doc told me to do several things incorrectly, cut corners, and was doing research in a manner which I believe to be unsafe manner, and I carried many of these habits into my own project obliviously. \n\nE.g. We work in a class 2 microbiology lab and postdoc supervisor walks away from his bench and leaves the Bunsen on, almost never cleans their bench or anything despite working with GM and highly-resistant bacteria, and has an open beaker of ethanol sitting on their bench at all times even though they use their Bunsen on a regular basis. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if I was trained poorly, or whether this training/ lab practice is standard and should be adequate, but I am just a \u2018snowflake\u2019. I feel worthless and incompetent and don\u2019t know how to proceed. \n\nI would be grateful of some advice.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you very much, everyone, for taking the time to respond to my post. I\u2019ve read through all your posts and taken onboard your advice and thoughts on the situation. Much appreciated!",

That\u2019s how we introduce students in our lab. They first get to work with us (PhD students/postdocs/research engineers) for several weeks before we allow them to work on their own projects. \nLab workers should also create a safe environment wherein everyone feels free to ask questions, no matter how stupid these are. So overall, I think you got unlucky with the lab and its workers. \n\nYou should not feel worthless because of a postdoc treating you badly. You have still many things to learn as a student and practise/experience comes with time.",

The postdoc seems to be sabotaging your efforts and should be directing you towards how to learn at the bench. But maybe it is his first time teaching and when he hears \"how do I do that\" he is laughing at himself???...okay that might be a stretch. But in either case try to learn how to build your own protocols from notebooks in the lab or ask to watch someone (maybe not the postdoc). For my students we all have one online notebook they share and we have general protocols and then they can see each others notebooks and share (with hyperlinked credit given). When there isnt a general protocol, they can use JoVE or Biorad or Jax protocol videos in combination with a company protocol. For advanced protocols....their project actually starts with making that protocol itself. It's tough if there aren't already protocols but those students know their shit. If you can do this you will blow the PhD out of the water. But....you might want to avoid shadowing that postdoc...he doesn't sound organized enough to have standard protocols and that can lead to some bad science...and bad training.",

The stuff about your postdoc's bench is not super relevant to the story, don't go to your PI with that. Focus on the actual problem here which is the postdoc refusing to show you things from scratch and shaming you for asking questions. I know plenty of microbiologists who leave their bunsens running etc, they probably know what they're doing even if you don't like it. From every learning experience you'll take away things you feel are useful and things you will decide to do the opposite of.\n \n3. I've often asked students to find protocols online for simple stuff if I didn't have it written down, and to bring it to me to check through before using. Did your postdoc want to check the protocol, or give you an idea of what site to find it on? If so this isn't necessarily as malicious as it sounds. If they're saying \"ok, New England Biolabs has a great protocol on how to use restriction enzymes, go print it out\" that's ok. If it's just \"cloning? go Google it\", that's below par and again go your PI. \n\n4. In terms of your long term prospects, GPA beyond a certain point doesn't really correlate with potential as a scientist in my experience. So once you start your PhD, forget your GPA, it really won't help. It's an extremely steep practical  learning curve when you start your PhD, everyone is super bright, and you're starting from the bottom which I do think makes absolutely everyone feel incredibly stupid at times (but again, that's the work itself, your bench supervisors should not be making you feel stupid, and you should start to feel much more confident after about a year at the bench - just be ready to power through that difficult period and know that everyone feels like that at first). \n\nAs someone who has supervised students at R1 institutes at the US and elsewhere, and is now running a lab - if you came to me with this, this is the sort of stuff I'd be talking through with you. Your postdoc doesn't sound nice and I've no doubt they don't like you much, unfortunately. That's not your fault. So you should probably give the PhD a go if you were convinced before this experience you wanted to do it. But if you have a few bad experiences like this, maybe reconsider. You deserve to be happy!",

I hear you on the rest, but if you go to the PI with a laundry list of complaints it just risks being painted as the student's problem rather than the postdoc's.

As none of us has seen the postdoc's bench, I guess it's up to the student how strongly they feel about the genuine risks posed there. If they feel it's a real risk then I agree they should definitely report it. I didn't get that impression, but you did, and it certainly could be depending on the setup and distance.

Post doc sounds like a real jerk and you should report the safety concerns and the attitude to the PI, some of the stuff you describe is NOT okay. \n\nI worked in a handful of labs and I am always given new protocols and taught the labs protocols one on one with a lab member, even for things I have done previously. Every lab does things a bit differently, has different equipment, animals, tissues, and protocols. It is ludicrous to expect you to pilot your own protocol for everything from scratch if the lab has established protocols. especially for your first lab experience. I\u2019ve been doing research for years and still have a hard time piloting out the details of new protocols with out help. The whole point of being a lab \u201cunit\u201d is to work together and help each other succeed. Last week I taught a new post doc with a decade more of experience than me our labs western blot protocol. Yea she could probably figure it out, but why make her when I can spend an afternoon to give her the specific details of our equipment, solutions, and protocol that we as a lab already figured out, and save her a ton of time and effort. \n\nYou are 100% correct to ask about the labs procedures and how to use the lab equipment before trying by yourself, please do this in your next experience. Doing things without training is how people get hurt , equipment gets broken and time gets wasted. The only time you should be encouraged to just use the internet to do something is if you are having a hard time trouble shooting an issue with the already established protocol and no one else in the lab can help, or if you\u2019re bringing a new method into the lab. Shame on that post doc, this does NOT represent other labs. This makes me angry just reading this.\n\nYou sound like a smart thoughtful person to have in the lab, and keep that attitude in your next experience, this is NOT okay lab culture.",

      "text": "As others have said, the postdoc is a terrible mentor. Unfortunately during PhD training (all over not specifically to any one country) learning to be a good mentor is never formally taught.  It's also why profs don't always make good teachers in classes, they are never taught.  \n\nSaying that they don't have protocols is bad science and lab notebook keeping.  For me, I always included one full detailed protocol (even for basic cell culture) and would reference in future entries noting any changes (like dilution or different media).  Start practicing this now so when/if you decide to move on, you already have begun this skill.  \n\nIf you do decide to go for your PhD, when interviewing ask the PIs their mentoring style.  Also ask the lab members (if you can) what their mentoring/training style is.  It's better to ask that in interviews cause 1) it gives you important info when selecting labs for permanent or rotation and 2) it shows your interest and desire for knowledge in a different way.  I know PIs when interviewing potential grad students or postdocs (or even undergrads) if they don't ask questions even just on mentoring style (doesn't have to be research related) then they aren't interested.  \n\nFor training/mentoring styles, I used the 3 step method (that's what I call it).  The first time I show a new student or undergrad, I give them a protocol or tell them to write down since I'm also going to demonstrate it every step.  The second time, the student does it with me watching.  I'm there to answer questions or help remember next steps.  Third time, student is doing it without me hovering (though I'm usually doing something else not far away or at my desk so I'm available for questions). I find this way worked great me for and builds confidence in the student.  \n\nFor questions, I only get annoyed if it's the same question for the third time. At that point, I'm going to walk you through the thought process or check you notes to get the answer.  But not answering a question at all is unacceptable.\n\nOverall, the lab you are in is a terrible training lab.  The idea that you should be fully trained before you join a lab is wrong.  Lab courses don't prepare you to work really full time in a lab.  And every lab does things slightly different.  I'd recommend either leaving that lab or fulfilling your contract and/or switching labs.  Not every lab is terrible like this.",

But their behavior toward you tells that they are not professional and weren't trained well to train others.\n\nAnd here are my tips to deal with such people when I was a graduate student.\n\n\\- Look around in the lab or neighbor's lab for a book Molecular Cloning, published by  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Every basic thing about cloning, DNA miniprep, bacteria innoculationg.... is presented there. You'll learn the right way how to make buffers and most stuff for your Molecular Biology lab work.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cloning-Laboratory-Manual-Three/dp/1936113422/ref=asc\\_df\\_1936113422/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241914467431&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4855660534219337662&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1026578&hvtargid=pla-331387250390&psc=1\n\n\\- Read the user manuals for every single kit, equipment, and instrument before I use them. If I want to follow anyone's method in any publication, and not clear about what they wrote, I emailed the first author and ask how they do it (in most cases, you can find them on Researchgate or LinkedIn). People are generally happy to share their knowledge.\n\n\\- I build close professional relationships with my PI, other Ph.D. students in the lab or in the institutes by reading their research and ask questions to make clear I understand what they did. PIs in general, never turn their own Ph.D. down. They are always very helpful, especially you're bright and new. \n\nAnd here is my protocol for training someone lab works, so you know that the bench supervisor doesn't do their job.\n\n1. I send my trainees protocols, presentation of workflow, and education links made of BioRad, Thermo fisher scientific, Agilent, NewEngland Biolab... or whoever makes the equipment, instrument,  reagents... If I'm too busy and ask them to search for a protocol, I check it before they use it.\n2. Demonstrate for them how I do the experiment or use the method in our lab setting. \n3. Ask them to write a protocol on the subject using their own words, and ask them to design their own experiment and make sure they have/know everything they need for their experiment before they start.\n4. They do their own experiment and I'm around if they ask any questions or need help.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "The situation you are in is unpleasant, but understandable. I will try to give some advice instead of sympathy, since I've \"been there\" some years ago and know, that sympathy does not get you too far in such situation + you already got some in this thread.\n\nAsk yourself a question - what is in it for a postdoc? They will relocate time and energy from their work to train you, so what are they getting for it? The postdoc is also a human being with there own emotions and hardships, they are probably trying to discourage you from taking their time. Before being a grad student, people around you are paid for teaching and tolerating you, but now it is not the case. Now you are a researcher, expectations have changed and other don't HAVE TO help you (they can, they probably should, but they don't have to).\n\nMy biggest advice is to understand, that stuff you do is your responsibility. It is not you helping out with postdoc's or PI's projects, but your work, your project, your responsibility. If you have a problem - it is your problem, not theirs, so do not expect people around to take a proactive approach to resolve your difficulties. Imagine having no money and being upset at people for not taking a notice and giving you some (since they have it and have the ability to help you if they want, right?).\n\nIn my opinion, what you need at this point is owning your work - taking active approach to it and being humble about receiving help. Here is an example: you don't have some protocol. Asking a postdoc is a legit way of going about it, but what if you have none of the protocols and have to ask everything? It will quickly annoy the postdoc, they will be reluctant to help you since it will seem to them that you go to them for everything instead of putting in any work yourself. Another option would be to try figuring it out yourself first as much as you can. Yes, \"look it up online\" and put together the protocol to the best of your ability, then ask postdoc if it seems right. In some cases you will have to figure it out on your own through trial and error.\n\nTry treating the postdoc a little nicer - they are not some help robot, but a person. This might entice them to help you. If that doesn't work - try looking for help elsewhere. It is not easy to find, but you never know before you try.\n\nIf you try and things just do not work out, you can switch a lab. This is something better done early, since you lose less progress this way. I agree with other comments here, not all labs are like that, what you described is a bad case.",

      "text": "Absolutely your supervisors fault not yours.\nYou are there to learn first of all and even if you did a majority of the tasks you are supposed to already at uni it's still not easy and scary and you'll come across a lot of questions and insecurities. In my experience you do things a few times in uni classes with a detailed protocol, someone to ask at all times, maybe even going through the whole process before actually doing it and even then you only did it a few times maybe. For me it was so scary to be left alone with just a task when I started. I asked a ton of questions to reassure my process and it felt all so big. But that's what your advisor is for. Answering questions and helping you to get rid of this feeling. I think almost all people feel unprepared and ask a lot of easy questions when they start. But when you work for a while and have good support and help you get rid of that feeling and it's the supervisors job to get you there. It's also in their best interest to be sure you do it right and all your questions are answered. Nobody has anything from experiments done wrong and it's easier to answer twenty questions then to do the experiments all over again.\n\nYou are there to learn not to know everything already.\nEven with experience and having worked in the field for a longer time it's hard to get into a new field with different tasks and protocols. That's why most labs will give you a partner when you start who helps you finding your way and gain experience. And this also accounts for people who worked in the field for 10 years. In a lab I worked in we had a new colleague who worked as a research assistant for 15 years and changed the specific research field and she had a two month phase of just working together with someone who showed her everything. She also asked a ton of questions and needed a lot of reassurance to get into it.\n\nMy point is your feeling is absolutely normal and normally that's what your supervisor is there for. He just does a really bad job. There are almost no stupid questions and if you don't know a technique than that's just a fact. If no one showed you how to to something than that's maybe a bit annoying having to spend the time explaining it and controlling the process but it's better than letting you just try out something and fail with it. And honestly if you don't know how to do SDS page than it's a lot to ask for to let you just figure it out on your own. It's not your fault you don't know how to do it and it's not a big deal to show you how. If you do this together with a colleague once you are fine.\n\nI think it's weird they don't have protocols for everything. How do they even protocol the work? Don't they have lab journals? Publications? Protocols for QM? I always either had lab journals that needed to be kept in detail or be referenced to an archived and readily available protocol for the Standart techniques or forms that referenced standard ways of doing techniques that were set in absolute detail. But there were always a protocol readily available and if you did something new you needed to write a new one. Maybe that's handled differently elsewhere but I only ever experienced it this way and heard of it like that.\n\n\nI think they expect way to much from you and have standards you can't possibly meet unless you did the work for a very long time which isn't the point of you being there.\n\nYou probably do a great job and could do very well in a good environment. You try and want to ask questions and take the initiative to learn and I feel so sorry that you are treated so terribly. Maybe you can talk to someone higher up about this? You definitely can because of your safety concerns. There should be a safety inspection/guidance you can go to and maybe talk about that. Maybe this also helps you to change the lab if you describe how poorly you are treated and that you are concerned about your safety.\n\nI wish you all the best! Good scientists ask questions and want to learn and I feel you already did a good job at this asking for the right things instead of just doing something. I think in the right environment you'd thrive.",

      "text": "It is definitely common to neglect to train graduate students at their job. Many PIs don't want an apprentice, they want a fully autonomous student whose papers they can tack their name on. It's the \"baby turtle\" model of grad student having, (as opposed to the \"baby chimp\" model): have a ton, invest very little, and whoever makes it to the ocean survives.\n\nIt's still shitty mentoring.\n\nPart of it seems to be a trend similar to other cases of bad treatment by superiors (like with hazing, workplace sexism, or child abuse). People say variations on \"well I went through it, so why shouldn't you?\". They use excuses like \"learning how to learn is part of the job\". Which is true. But also, we *could* train people in their basic job and there'd still be plenty left to learn how to learn. \n\nPart of it is that the trainers are themselves incompetent, so they can't train you. It's hard to re-invent the wheel to create a functioning research lab on your own if you haven't been trained.\n\nOr they are incredibly over-burdened so they resent any demand for their time that doesn't directly benefit them.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like the postdoc is very insecure (and likely incompetent in ways you haven't realized yet). For some reason, it's important to them to feel better than you, and to make you feel bad for not knowing things that they know. They also don't seem to believe in their ability to successfully do research competently and ethically.\n\nMy advice is this: try to remember that the world is MUCH bigger than this lab. You are basically in a psychological funhouse right now, and you must trust yourself (and perhaps a confidante who is NOT in graduate school with you) to figure out what is real. The people around you are stuck in it too, and some of them feel like they're playing against you to get out. So if you trust their impressions, do so carefully.\n\nFirst, don't let this post doc get into your head. In addition to directly cutting you down, they will probably depress you in other ways too, just by sharing their worldview. They are behaving like the world is hostile. Being around them will make you feel like the world is a hostile place, and the only way to succeed is to cut corners. Instead, see them as the sad and insecure person that they are. Learn what you can, but keep your Teflon suit on.\n\nAlso, know that academia is broken in many, many ways, and you will not be able to fix them. Most of these issues are sneaky. They usually announce themselves by making you wonder \"am I worthless at xyz?\". If you find yourself asking that question, realize that you've flown into one of these weird psychological Bermuda triangles. It's an illusion, the question itself is a farce, and spending time on it will just frustrate, exhaust and trap you. The only way out is to keep going forward. Remember: you aren't a dummy, so if you're struggling, then it's a sign that you're doing something hard. If you are an idiot, so be it, but be an idiot who cannot be stopped. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is this: focus on your own journey. Take things one at a time. Whatever you're doing, focus on doing it well. Not perfect, but well. Ask \"what is the minimum product I'd be reasonably satisfied with?\" And do that. Then if you want, you can do more. \n\nYou don't have to learn everything tonight, or this week, or this year. You CAN'T learn everything at once. Instead, you will learn things the only way you can: one at a time for 5 years. If you focus on what you're doing right now, and do it well enough, then slowly you will become more and more competent. The next time you do it, you'll do better, and become more efficient. The more things you do, the bigger your area of competency will be. Until one day you'll realize that you actually know a lot, since you've carefully learned a lot of things.",

Safety always comes first and you should not break instruments, so it certainly helps to be trained by a competent mentor. However, a lot of proactive inquisitiveness is also required.\n\nThere are a lot of online resources for widely used techniques such as SDS PAGE and cloning. There are training videos, protocols, and forums such as research gate where you can seek guidance, even for more advanced and specific techniques. Be safe in handling, wear PPE, always read the MSDS, and dispose chemicals safely. That said, don't be afraid to poke around a bit. Dare to fail, learn from experience. If your first gel isn't good, discard and repeat. \n\nYou are not restricted to only going to your post doc mentor when you are stuck or need assistance. I can't even count the number of times I have walked up to a random researcher in lab and asked nicely if I could watch what they are doing. Read on your own first, observe, ask insightful questions, and find your 'team'. Pay it forward, teach others things you know.\n\nPhD can be an emotional roller-coaster. There will be times of self doubt, especially when experiments don't work. Almost all PhD students get stuck at some points, the idea is to be resilient and make things work for you.\n\nGood luck!",

Milk the situation to your advantage (it's good if you're encountering lots of new things and can learn from them) and try to ignore the faces/comments of the postdoc. It's not his place to judge what you know.",

      "text": "Yeah there are lots of half arse post doc... Seems like the one in your lab that you rae interacting with is a piece of shit... Best way to learn might be asking some of the other senior PhD candidates in your lab if there are any... If not make other PhD candidate friends from other research group on campus and ask them for help... Would not be surprised if there are lots of other PhD candidates around the campus with your situation...\n\nBut in a way shit post docs are kind of blessing if you got to the end of the tunnel... I learned lots during master by research program because I had a shit post doc... And have a few group mates who know what they are doing... Some lab technicians are awesome well of technical knowledge too... Be nice and ask nicely say you don't want to break anything or their precious machine and i think most of them will be willing to give u some advice... Don't have to care about what the other people think asking questions means you care about doing the job right... Also start reading up more to familiarise yourself with the techniques and terms used in your research topic... I think nature protocols is a good place to learn techniques and jove - journal of video experiments is good too because they show video of experimental techniques used...\n\nShit postdocs make u a good mentor in the future too... If you don't turn into one yourself... Got to mentor and supervise some interns on the lab and that was quite fun... Not easy job but learnt a different set of skills...",
