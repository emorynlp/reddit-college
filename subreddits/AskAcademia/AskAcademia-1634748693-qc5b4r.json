  "text": "Looking for some help or advice for a co-worker of mine.  We work at a local community college together in the states.  They are a part-time employee and currently also attending our college as an international student.  Recently a member of their family passed away back home in the UK and the whole family is shook.  I spent about an hour today with them in our coffee/break room being supportive and wracking my brain for any ways to help them out.  Are there any programs, grants, financial aid or other resources out there that could help them pay for a ticket to get home for the memorial and to be with family?  I work exclusively with military-connected students (which this co-worker is not) so I am at a loss to where to go or where to send them to get the assistance they need.\n\nAnything that the redditors of the world can do to help would be more than welcomed!  Thank you!",
