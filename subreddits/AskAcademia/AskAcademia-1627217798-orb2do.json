  "text": "Hello\n\nI have finished my Master's in pedagogy (working as an upper secondary school Swedish/ESL teacher) and began working. I meet people who finished their studies years ago that simply stop reading academic papers or anything unless needed for the job.\n\n\nI do not wish to become one of those. However, I barely have the energy to read when I have time off.  \n\n\n----------\n\nHow do you keep up with new studies and theories? \n\n\nWhat are your best suggestions? \n\nDo you know about any audio format source where someone discusses studies or theories? or maybe even read studies in an audiobook format?",

      "text": "Well, I have no idea if something similar exists in your field but in biology, I participate regular online conferences where current research projects are presented and discussed (especially due to Corona it has never been easier to attend one of those conferences). \n\nScientific magazines that publish current research are quite expensive but I believe there exists also something in between; more than the average \"interesting facts-\" magazine and the expensive one for experts.   \nIf you start looking for some social media resources, you might also find some magazines/blogs (at least in my field) that regularly post interesting articles.",

      "text": "Small suggestion: do conferences instead. Do a few each year and read up thereafter on what interests you. I think the social aspect of grad school is a main motivator for people. This could replicate it.",

Another thing you could do is subscribe to mailing lists with some of the different academic publishers in your field, that way you\u2019ll get updates on new and upcoming books. Hope this helps!",
