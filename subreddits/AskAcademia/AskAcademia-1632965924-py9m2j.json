  "text": "I'm a new phd student. I'm going back to school full time after 10 years of working in industry. I would call the pace of work to be a comfortable jaunt vs the fast paced work I was doing. \n\nI'm keeping up with class work and doing what's asked of me for my funded work. But it feels way easy and I have a lot of free time. I think part of it may be the classes I'm taking first are basically recaps of the work I was doing, so everything easily makes sense \n\nSo I'm not certain I'm doing this right. How do I guage if I'm working enough? Should I pick a # hours per day and fill it with more reading and coding? How can I set goals to come away feeling accomplished each day?",

      "text": "there is a lot of discourse surrounding \"how much\" phd students should be working. many people believe a successful phd student should be working +40 hours/week, late into the night, on weekends, etc. however i do feel like the culture is beginning to shift and the focus is more on productive working hours as opposed to quantity of working hours. \n\nin short, everyone has different expectations and the amount of work a phd student will have to do will fluctuate based on year, workload, supervisor expectations, etc. you should be doing enough to get good grades in your classes and keep your supervisor happy with your progress (within reason, of course. some supervisors demand extreme work hours). if you have spare time, cherish it now because you probably won't have as much as you progress!",

      "text": "As I see it, the answer to that question should really come from you.\n\n1. In industry, it is often the case that your tasks and their respective deadlines are given to you. This wouldn't be so in academia and as a PhD student where the expectation is that you'd be passionate and pushing yourself enough without a lot of external motivation. Some of my friends had advisors who pushed them. But my advisor was really hands-off and being accountable for myself and my progress was one of the skills I had to learn. The work should be enough of a challenge to keep you on your toes in order to find it enjoyable. If you find it too easy, talk to your advisors and senior students about what more you can learn.\n2. One thing I really miss about being a PhD student is the amount of time I can give to sit down and learn a completely new field of work. There will be several new related research areas that you can dig deep into and learn. Some of my best papers happened to come to me by applying ideas I'd learned in other areas onto my primary area of research.\n3. It's also very important not to stress or burn yourself out. You can't really enjoy your work if you're racing against other people or killing yourself working all day. There will be a few deadlines and other stressful periods along the way and those can't be avoided. But the other days need not be that stressful. Your work and schedule should be sustainable for the long term. There's really no point in missing out on friends, family, relationships, travel, hobbies, sports and life in general for the sake of your PhD.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "My goal in graduate school was to work 40ish hours a week at my research, with natural flexibility there for days where I wanted to do less and those inevitable deadlines where you have to do a bit more. I had a similar experience to you in my graduate program and law school, where the course work and TA/RA duties took more like 20 hours a week than 40.\n\nWhat I did instead was spend my remaining 20ish hours doing related things that ultimately really improved my CV down the line. My first year I made an effort to attend seminar talks with interdisciplinary labs, reached out to a professor with whom I did a project (that became my first publication), and looked around for cool training opportunities, student networking events, and interesting smaller funding opportunities. I also did a lot of consulting, and still do. If you would like to be a professor, I'd highly recommend reaching out to some faculty (or talking to your advisor if your program assigns them this early - which not all programs do) and starting another research project. Not all projects end up perfect and publishable, but you really learn a lot and doing so earlier when you have more free time can be very rewarding down the line.\n\nAlso for the record: don't worry about this random \"work 80 hours a week, work 90 hours a week, work 365 days a year\" stuff. I'm a professor in an R1 department and I can tell you - I have never seen someone work 80 hours a week and produce their best work for 80 hours. If you can really work at top quality 80 hours a week - dear god take your magical skills out of my office and go change the world! Everyone takes some time to get in the pocket and figure out what works the best for them. Some people swear by treating grad school like a 9-5 job, some don't. I personally wake up in the afternoons, teach in the evenings, and work in the nighttime. Unconventional - but aren't all academics a bit unconventional anyway? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck with your first year and enjoy it!",

There are definite down times in academia (at my current level) that I did not experience in my industry roles. When it hits though, it hits hard. Use your downtime to do deep thinking but also to enjoy life. I find having a task list relevant to your work helps. I have also used my downtime to do self-driven professional development on writing and statistical methods, note-taking, and other hard skills that 100% pay off at the pointy end of your candidacy.",

Can you be competitive while working 40 hours? Some people certainly can, and if you are one of them, then definitely do so! I know that I can't.",

      "text": "I finished my PhD in Computer Science in three years time with 6 publications - not the best student but also certainly not a problem. My typical week, once done with classes, was probably 15 hours of working (bike to the office for 11am, leave by 3:30ish having had a lunch break), skip most Fridays and some Mondays. I had maybe two deadline crunch weeks that got up to 50 hours and a few weeks of on-site work in an industrial partner's office that were proper 9-5s, but nothing terribly strenuous. Anyone working excessive hours is probably missing the point, has a tyrannical supervisor, or is dreadfully inefficient. Time spent in the lab has basically zero correlation with academic success, IMO, and potentially negative correlation due to all the administrivia/drama/volunteering that bubbles up. In some fields (hard sciences) time spent is more relevant (you can only pipette so fast), but generally it's more about making a point to only work on tasks which are directly beneficial to you for a small number of high-productivity hours that makes the difference.",

      "text": "A PhD is one of those many things in life where the more you do (quantity & quality of work, networking, new skills learned), the more doors open up to you afterwards.  \n\nSo I'd suggest that (within reason!) you turn up your ambitions and strive to excel.  Only to a point, though - it needs to be sustainable for the long-term, and to allow you to maintain a decent work/life balance and health.  \n\nAs another commenter said, many PhDs are expected to be independent and self-directed.  Some advisors push their students to be highly ambitious.  Others only define the minimum and expect you to demonstrate your own ambition and quality above that.  Both styles have pros and cons; the former can really stress out your students, while the latter can set them up for mediocrity.  Regardless of your situation, your future self will benefit from using this unusual free time to develop skills and knowledge that will make your work better and set you apart, so you may as well take advantage of it.",

I remember one week in grad school I was running six different experiments the same time. Slept 3 hours per night. Got pulled over one night leaving lab for not having my headlights on (3am) and speeding.  I just looked at the cop and said, \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d  He told me to turn my lights on and I drove off, haha.\n\nEnded up publishing six papers during grad school and had data for two more (only one of which I got around to publishing).  I even snuck a figure on one paper without stats. The effect was so pronounced.  To this day, now, I never take anything beyond pilot if I need stats to know.  \n\nMy second paper was a theory and review paper though, which would be applicable to any specialty.\n\nGo after it!  Think thoughts never thought before. That is the beauty of immersing in a specialization.  Long walks in the dark to think.  You look right at the universe itself and think, \u201cI got this.\u201d  The fact is, if anyone else has been able to do it, why can\u2019t you? There is always an unsolvable horizon to hunt.",
