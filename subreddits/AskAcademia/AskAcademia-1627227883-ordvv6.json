  "title:": "Are acknowledgements standard in a taught masters thesis?",
  "text": "Hi, just finishing my masters thesis at the moment and was wondering are acknowledgements a typical thing to include? I don\u2019t feel like I can ask my supervisor as I\u2019d be acknowledging him so feels a bit awkward to ask! I thought it was as I included them in my BSc project at another university, but now looking at the BSc examples from my current uni no one has included them. I can\u2019t find any taught MSc examples for my school and I don\u2019t know anyone else on my course! I\u2019m at an English uni studying physics if it makes any difference. Thanks :)",

Normally the taught elements are completed in the first half of the year, then the research element i.e. the thesis is completed in the other half. \n\nMasters of Research (MRes) is a pure research Masters degree. Either way for both of them you have a research element and you end up writing a thesis.",
