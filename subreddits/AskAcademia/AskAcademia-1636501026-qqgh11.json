  "text": "At what point should a graduate student draw the line? My PI told me today that work doesn't end after I go home for the day. He expects me to put in 8-10+ hours of work in the lab each day and then go home and put in more hours. Yes, rest is important; however, I am in the last six months or so of my degree. Do I just give in and drag myself through the hours in the evening? Or do I commit to resting in the evenings so I can be refreshed and ready to go on all cylinders the next day? I am doing what I can at this point, but I feel like I am riding the line of burning out.\n\nAdvice on lab/life balance would also be appreciated. Thanks!",

Your supervisor shouldn't be dictating this to you.\n\nThat being said, if you are in the final six months of a research degree and you need to write a thesis, you might end up having to out in extra time regardless of what your supervisor says. Maybe not if you are super efficient and good at managing your time.",

      "text": "Your PI is perpetuating toxic norms. There is no reason you should need to work like that except that unfortunately a substantial proportion of academia think a) they suffered so everyone else should, in a race to the bottom and b) that the only good science is science done at 4am by a sleep-deprived student on the verge of a breakdown. They don't believe it's possible to produce good work in office hours. \n\nI'm not saying you can do your work only in 9-5. Reality is you probably can't but there's a gulf between a 37.5h week and a 80week like your PI believes you need to do. \n\nI don't have much to offer except my tactic has always been to largely ignore such comments, walk my own path and as long as I'm producing they can get in the bin about the rest of that shit. Producing really means working smart, not hard. What are the things that will get results and what are the things that will get your PI off your back (hopefully there's a good overlap between the two). \n\nAlso, I learnt the heard way but time off is vital for creativity and long hours will only harm your research not improve it. You can't see the wood for the trees when you don't take a break and step back.\n\nETA a caveat to the above is that academics are as a group poor managers and it's very common for PIs to fixate on how many hours someone is working when they have a concern about a student's performance. Rather than being open about their concerns they just focus on trying to make you work harder (like more of the same will solve the issue). As long as you are certain there's no issue with your output, I'd put this down to your PI being a bit of an AH combined with maybe feeling anxious about your thesis submission. You may need to manage him a bit.",

The question is, \u201cIs pursuing a PhD a job?\u201d  The damaging toxic norm attitude here is that every hour not working on the PhD is one more hour tacked to the length. That puts a major gray cloud over your head for 5,6, \u202610 years until they let you out. The stipend isn\u2019t hourly pay, it\u2019s just enough money to let you sleep indoors and minimize malnutrition. I\u2019m long past my PhD but those norms produced some lasting damage to my psyche. \n\nThe best strategy is described in the post above. Seek a balance and take care of your mental health because that feeds real productivity. Productivity isn\u2019t at all correlated with the number of hours you suffer.",
