  "text": "We are only 2 students in the lab and every lab meeting we go through, my PI always gives updates on the projects I am in but not the ones that are run by my lab mate. Currently I found out that she is running a second set of experiments but this never gets communicated during lab meetings and it makes me wonder whether there are other things she is doing that do not get communicated with during those lab meetings. Is this weird or am I over analyzing the situation?",

      "text": "It depends on the fields and on the research groups. Some PIs prefer keeping the different projects confidential, even within the same research group. Sometimes, even the lab members prefer to keep their research confidential because they do not trust all the other lab members. This can be particularly true in fields like Biology as I have experienced myself. In the group where I am, we have group meetings where everything gets communicated to all the other lab members. It helps a lot as people can make comments and suggestions, this can foster collaborations too. \n\nI have even seen some PIs advertising PhD positions with incorrect topic/projects because they did not want to give information to the \"main competitors\". PhD candidates were all very surprised that the PhD position they had applied to turn out to be completely different.",

I was once in a meeting of a different lab where they were debating whether they should present something at a conference because they were concerned some other research team might steal it and publish first. Seems like an unhealthy field to me.",

They could be having different meetings to discuss that project, especially if the funding source or collaborators are different.  No need to make the main lab meeting longer. \n\nMy grad school advisor had an insane number of different collaborations he was a part of and I definitely didn\u2019t know what all of his other students were doing, some of them didn\u2019t even attend the same lab meetings I did",

It\u2019s just something I notice reoccurring , so I don\u2019t think he just forgets , he just never talks about what the other student is working on (and neither does she). I just wonder if this is normal lab culture considering how small our lab is and that we do mostly the same stuff",
