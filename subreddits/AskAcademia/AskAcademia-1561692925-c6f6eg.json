                  "text": "Most conferences are not in remote places. Typically they are hosted by large institutions or groups of institutions which form a center of research capacity in a major urban area capable of hosting said conference. I'm not talking about small 100-200 person conferences that are hosted by small regional societies or that represent an occasional focal meeting on a subject of niche interest. I'm talking about the bigger academic societies. These are typically held in or around major urban centers with international airports. Why? Because you need a big meeting center and associated hotel space to host all the attendees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will also note that many/most of these meetings are held in the US, which further reduces the cost of travel for many/most attendees from North American institutions (although it places a high burden on international attendees, particularly attendees from East Asia, Africa, and Latin America). Imagine the travel costs associated with intercontinental travel for your colleagues from, say, Johannesburg or Buenos Aires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of disparity of travel allocation, the real issue is the size of the pot rather than the way it's being allocated. The pot is small and students are expected to make due with essentially no money. Why? Largely because of a few things. First and foremost, there have been massive funding cuts to education from many/most governments (state, federal, etc), which means that there are fewer discretionary funds from which to draw money for travel grants. Second, funding agencies are pushing for more and more trainees on a given project or operating grant and are awarding fewer grants in general, meaning that fewer student travel grant costs can be paid out of grant money while there are more students, leading to many more people relying on travel grants. Finally, as these meetings get bigger, it becomes harder and harder to get a truly competitive bid from hosting venues. A multi-thousand-person meeting is restricted to a relatively small number of convention centres with essentially noncompetitive hosting prices, which means the base cost of hosting these meetings is much higher as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPoint here is that this is a really complicated issue without a clear obvious solution.",

I also wish these conferences had an orientation package (what to do, what to wear, how to navigate) for first time attendees. Especially for those huge annual conferences. It is a very un-welcoming (and scary) experience to go to those conferences as a student for the first time.",

Conferences are expensive because of the professional for profit companies that are the ones organizing them 99% of the time. If you want to make them cheaper, convince schools to let academics organize them there during the summer and use the currently empty dorms for lodging/classrooms for talks.  You still have the issue of getting there, but that cuts lodging and registration costs by ~80%",

          "text": "In my discipline the big conferences are organized by non-profit organizations. They are not making money off of the conference, it is in fact a huge burden to them to organize it. The money goes mostly to the hotel fees: Conference hotels require certain staff (like IT) to be in the rooms, they charge fees for using this and that. Even though these hotels offer conference rates, you are still staying at a hotel you wouldn't otherwise stay (and paying for their $10 bottled water because your conference picked a golf resort in the middle of nowhere). That's why your solution (have the conferences on university campuses, stay at their dorms) would actually reduce cost. Then travel grants/funds would actually be sufficient because you would using it mostly for travel and not lodging. I don't know why the organizers of these conferences can't see this.",

That\u2019s how many schools make extra money to facilitate the upkeep, remodeling, and construction of new buildings combined with other funds and grants. \n\nIt would still be a much more affordable option than hotels though and bring down the costs some, but free is likely impossible. Someone still needs to be paid for cleaning the spaces, other building employees like directors and RAs need to be paid, utilities, etc.",

Presenting ongoing research or traditional presentations are more suited to digital means, and we obviously have the technology to support such things. I think it's also an issue that first-gen and low-income students are often in PhD programs or jobs with less access to research funding and support, meaning a traditional \"present a paper\" style session isn't applicable or helpful. \n\nI'd like to see national organizations host a kind of digital conference for presenting ongoing research, something that could be organized into a virtual proceedings that would allow all academics to browse through short descriptions of emerging research (increasingly necessary with the amount of research coming out). \n\nThe conference could then feature a large number of regional meetings that focus less on presenting original research and more on connecting academics across a variety of axes. I'm envisioning round tables focused on issues in graduate school, early career, mid career, etc with opportunities for all these groups to interact. Workshops would also be great. \n\nI think these regional events should be low/no charge with opportunities for couch surfing/ staying in dorms on a campus. No more 500 dollar a night hotels!",
