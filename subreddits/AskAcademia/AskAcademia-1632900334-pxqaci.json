  "text": "Hi, so I recently teached my first lesson and I have conflicting feelings about it. \n\nThe class participated, they answered my questions and that was fine I guess. \nWhen I proposed some exercises, they told me multiple solutions and we discussed them.\n\nBut for one particular solution I really had no idea about what was going on, I told them I needed to reflect on that, and then I apologized for not knowing what was going on, that I needed to study that aspect and that we will discuss it in the next lesson.\nAt that point, one student told me something that helped me in arriving to the answer.\nThat was fine, it was like understanding the problem together, but I felt incompetent for not knowing the answer in the first place.\n\nIn the last part of the session, for another exercise, students come up with multiple solutions, one student asked my a question that I really didn't understand, I said that I didn't understand, and he laughed politely and said that there was no more need for the answer. That was very kind, but again, I felt incompetent. I only desired to go home.\n\nSo in the end, I don't know if that was a good lesson or not. I had the feeling I will meet them next week. I hope that what I explained was clear. But I feel scared\n\n\nEDIT: I want to thank you all for your kind comments, they all made me smile, and cry a little :)",

      "text": "Look, I'm not kind of guy who replies to posts like these in order to comfort or cheer up the one who wrote it. I just tell how I view the situation and maybe offer some advice.\n\nBy what you described it seems that you have had a great first lesson. You managed to promote student's participation, which is the most important and difficult thing to do.\n\nRegarding the times in which you didn't know the answer, I'm guessing those were some fairly complicated excercises. You reacted well by being honest and promising to go back to that exercise next class. That shows honesty and commitment. Students value both.\n\nMaybe in those instances when a complicated problem comes up and you don't know the answer you could add some humor to it and take the opportunity to explain that higher education - and that particular field - is not easy and part of it is learning to find the answers to new problems, so you'll work on it next week together.\n\nSo in the end, I would say that you shouldn't get used to always having good lessons as your first one was. Sometimes they will be better. But sometimes they could be awful too, when a certain class won't answer any of your questions or participate at all. So you were lucky with these students. Enjoy the semester.",

Maybe the subject is above their current knowledge and the only thing you're doing is embarrassing them and blocking any possibility of future voluntary participation.",

I don't propose putting anyone on the spot, but sometimes when a whole group isn't participating it's because nobody wants to break the ice, and in such cases asking individuals is one possible solution. You always need to read the room - the idea is to encourage people to participate, not to force them. (This is all thinking of smallish groups, which I think is OP's situation. No idea how to work a large lecture hall.)\n\nQuestions like \"so what does everyone think\" only work when you already have a confident group, but you hear these questions a *lot* (in classes, meetings, etc). The rest of the time the result is either silence, or 1-2 confident students completely dominating the class.",

At the beginning of each class, I ask students to discuss what has made for good class discussions in their previous courses and what has made for class discussions that they didn't like. Students often say that they strongly dislike cold calling on specific students.\n\nWhen I pose a discussion question and students do not respond, I find doing one of the following to be helpful:\n\n1. Make sure students understand the question. For example, I might reword it, or I might ask students if the question is clear.\n\n2. Ask students to answer the question in a smaller context first. I might ask students to spend 30-60 seconds writing a response, or I might ask them to discuss an answer with a partner. Then, when it comes back to the whole class, students already have an idea of something they could say and are more likely to participate.",

I remember I had one series of seminars, in which there was one very bright student who would always ask the most piercing questions, and I often honestly had to say: no idea, I'll look it up, and let you know next time -- or I bounced it back at him: you look it up, and let me know next time what you have found.\n\nI worried, too. The feedback I received for these sessions was excellent, however, especially from this student. He particularly praised my ability to take his points seriously, that I showed that science is not clear cut and nobody knows everything, and that in this way I promoted independent enquiry.\n\nSo, from all you said, you seem to be on the right track -- you can be much more confident with not-knowing. In my experience that is part and parcel of research.",

      "text": "Not in academia, teach English as a Second Language, but as a teacher for 5+ years I can tell you: No matter how knowledgeable you are, students will always, always come up with something to stump you. Unfortunately many teachers (bad teachers) are incapable of confessing ignorance, and instead respond with a deflection, a non-answer or a sudden attack of deafness. Being able to honestly say \"hmm, good question and I have no idea, let me read up on that\" is a sign of a good teacher. Working with your students to find the solution is even better! Socratic method FTW!\n\n(Just make sure to write down the question and  definitely **answer it next class**. I keep forgetting and it's awful.)\n\nWhen preparing ESL lessons, we're told to \"anticipate student error\". This means going through the material beforehand to try to guess, based on experience and imagination, what language mistakes they will make and what questions they will have. When preparing your lesson (if you aren't already doing this) spend some of that time thinking up alternative solutions / confusing points / questions students might have. They'll still manage to come up with the ONE thing you didn't think of, but it feels good to have the safety net. The more you teach the same thing, the easier it will get.\n\n(On another note, don't feel obliged to answer every question. \"That's a great question but we don't have time right now\" is a legitimate response if you feel the session is going off track. \n\nIf you're pressed for time, some people recommend asking your students to write down their questions and collecting them to answer at the top of the next lesson. This might also help shyer students. I've never really tried it myself, as I have trouble staying organised and it can get overwhelming.)",

I see myself as a facilitator, not a teacher. \n\nI've taught 3 tutorials each week for the last 8 weeks and I have good days and bad days, as do my students. Striving to be better is what I try to do all the time. I'm always thinking about how I can redo things or how I can increase participation in the class. It's hard! When the content changes, engagement changes. Students moods can change week to week as well and their interest in the topic will vary too. \n\nJust reflect on what you felt didn't go well and then think about how you could fix that. You didn't know the answer to a question and if that really bothers you, maybe you need to prepare better for your next class to ensure you do have the answers. Worst case, you tell the students straight up you don't know but will let them know later. \n\nIt sounds like you're teaching a STEM course.
