  "title:": "My former PhD supervisor is firing one of their PhD students mostly over personality differences - should I try to do anything?",
  "text": "We are in Germany. I'm a postdoc in a different institute than where I did my PhD. I have been helping to supervise a PhD student of my former supervisor in a STEM field. The student is about 2 years in to what should be about a 3 year PhD program. They are trying to finish their first paper, and ideally should have about 2 or 3 papers to graduate. The work has been going pretty well - perhaps a bit slowly, but not unusually so. \n\nThere is always a lot of tension between the student and the supervisor as they don't get along well on the personality level. The student frequently asks if they are on track, which annoys the supervisor. The supervisor often asks very specific questions with known answers trying to test the student in the group meeting, which makes the student quite nervous. The student is very detailed oriented and has spent a lot of time ensuring that their calculations are correct and robust to the assumptions of the work, which slows the project down more than the supervisor would like. \n\nNormally I mediate a lot of this in our online group meetings, as I get along fine with each of them individually, and the supervisor has thanked me numerous times for being the \"translator\" between the two. However, I recently took several weeks off from work as I was moving between universities. When I came back, I was informed that the student will be fired for lack of progress and ambition, as their first project should ideally have been finished by now, and they do not show much initiative in coming up with new ideas or beginning their own projects. \n\nBasically, I want to know if I should do something in this situation. I emailed the student privately and told them that I'm available if they ever want to chat. Obviously I will try to be supportive, but I don't know if I should intervene in the situation or just offer moral support and ideas for future career steps. Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Edit: I see from a comment of yours that the supervisor has actually followed through on asking the student to leave and they've agreed to do so. In that case I would amend my advice to say:\n\n1) See if the student can switch supervisors - depending on how they are funded that might not be simple.\n\n2) See if there is any way to re-establish them with the current supervisor, as per some of what I wrote below.\n\n3) Offer to support the student if they apply for a new PhD, and be ready to write them a letter of recommendation for whatever they do next. Odds are they won't get a good one from the current supervisor so yours will be important.\n\n4) Only agree to co-supervise students with this supervisor again in the future on the the proviso that they don't pull something like this again (worded in a slightly more professional manner). Keep in mind that not only have they done something bad for the student, but they've also effectively taken your time and effort with that student for granted. This should have at least been discussed with you, not simply revealed.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n> When I came back, I was informed that the student will be fired for lack of progress and ambition\n\nWhat did you say when you were told that? \n\nDo you think the student is capable of completing their PhD? If so please advocate for them. You say their work has been going well, and not *unusually* slowly, so based on your account of the situation it does sound like their supervisor has indeed just decided to ditch them because of a personality clash rather than provide them with the support that they need.\n\nIn my research group, if we had a student who was falling behind, or consistently doing things that poorly impact their performance, then we would sit down with them and try and make an action plan to get back on track and to address their performance issues. And if the supervisor hasn't done this before deciding to fire them, then they're honestly not doing their job properly.\n\n> The supervisor often asks very specific questions with known answers trying to test the student in the group meeting, which makes the student quite nervous. \n\nAlso call this out. I'm not saying that the student shouldn't be able to answer these questions, but at least while the student is trying to establish themselves it is counter productive to make group meetings somewhere where they are consistently on edge. This is just very poor (or even cruel) management from the supervisor.\n\nI understand that the supervisor is more senior than you in this scenario. But you are still in a greater position of power than the student. And you can advocate for them without necessarily getting on the wrong side of the supervisor; after all, you've already distinguished yourself as \"the translator\" between them, so clearly you can communicate differences in a conciliatory manner.",

I found a much better lab with a better known advisor, published well, and had a very happy and successful PhD. \n\nIf you can serve as an alternative source of recommendation letters for the students that could be extremely helpful.

To my understanding, the ordinary route via Abmahnungen and then a personenbedingte or verhaltensbedingte K\u00fcndigung should be available. Obviously, you do need a valid cause, but I don't see anything in the TV-L (\u00a734?) that would prevent these mechanisms altogether.\n\nBut as OP clarifies in a comment:\n\n> the student isn't really being fired; they have been asked to quit, and have agreed to do so.\n\nThe student should at least have talked to the ombudsperson if there is one and also the Personalrat before taking this step, but oh well...\n\nIn reality, of course nobody was going to fire them. I have a colleague (wiss. Mitarbeiter:in, time-limited contract, TV-L) who dropped off the face of the earth - not in  town, not answering emails, not showing up to project meetings, not producing research output as far as anyone can tell, and nobody is talking legal consequences.",

The threshold until you can fire somebody under this law is extremely high, for example unexcused missing from work for weeks or committing a crime are valid causes, but nothing that OP stated is at that level, and that the supervisor doesn't like the person is not a good reason. I do know of cases like the one that you're listing, but even then the amount of paperwork is so high that many people would shy away from this, especially if this has been, e.g., 2.5 years into a 3 year contract...",

And you are the one who understands it better than anybody.. and \nAnother thing.. don't ruin your relationship with that supervisor and try and finish your post doc with that supervisor.. after that.. \nI don't know.. what else to tell.. \nMay god bless him and be kind to him in his difficult times . And keep in contact with him.. without getting known to your supervisor..\nBecause supervisor thinks bad about you.. thinking you are thinking bad about him or her by expelling a student..\nSome where in supervisor mind.. that guilty and ego will be there . Don't try to evoke them.. it's for your own good.. hope god bless you strength and courage to finish your post doc under that supervisor",

I know a few people who actually got out of depression because they were fired and left their toxic labs.\n\nAnd anyway, you can't live in constant fear of ruining your relationship with your advisor. Of course, things should be handled tactfully, but if your approach is to cower before anyone in authority -- that's a very quick way to get depressed if you're constantly suppressing what you want to say.",
