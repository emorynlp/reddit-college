  "text": "I remember seeing creative paper titles before and I just don't like titles that try to do anything but convey what the paper is about. If it just so happens that the title has an accidental play on words or something, then so be it, but I don't like the idea of creative titles.",

      "text": "I have the opposite (well, ok, not *exactly* the opposite) reaction: I dislike it when people get on their high horse about paper creativity and insist that titles and/or writing more generally must be bland and uncreative (despite the fact that my titles are usually bland and uncreative). It sounds like you're just taking the piss out of people for having fun and taking pride in their work, and I don't see any reason to do that.  \n\nAs with basically any other academic writing, if style gets in the way of a title that clearly communicates what the paper is about, then it's a vice; otherwise, it's a virtue. As with virtually all things in academia, many \"creative\" titles are bad; but so are many non-creative titles. I guess I'm skeptical that there's really that much to communicate in your average bland title that putting in a creative title actually takes away from the communication. I suspect that this may differ from field to field---in microbiology, for example, it may be that you really can pack enough into the title that going creative is a real problem---but in most cases that's what a good abstract is for.",

I used \"Monkey see, monkey touch, monkey do\" in a title for a conference presentation and just thought one day \"would be funny to use that in my thesis\". I wrote my official title and just added the \"Monkey see, monkey touch, monkey do\" in front of that. Made me happy. Then, when it came to handing the document to my PI for proofreading I intended to take it off. But... that stupid joke was there for weeks at this point and the cover page looked empty without it. So I added it back but intended it as an unofficial addition to the title and planned to just hand in the \"scientific\" title (without the monkeys) to the office. I made the font smaller and thought that was the end of it.  \nNow my PI... he said either I remove that OR I include it in my official title. He disliked the idea of having an unofficial addition and thought it would be confusing. He said it's my decision since it's my thesis but he would suggest taking it off to make the title shorter.\n\nI left it.  \nThe cover page looked empty without it.  \nSo now that's part of the official title of my thesis.",

Which means there's ~0% chance of me ever citing it. \n\nI want my own papers to be read and cited by people in the field, so I try to make my titles clear. Haven't had any where a funny/clever title was going to be possible without totally destroying the clarity. \n\nCould do the whole colon trick, but we already do that in the form of \"Overarching subject/project: specific research question\". Adding *another* colon just so we could put a funny pre-title would be... weird. \n\nIn astrophysics we do sometimes try to make actual words out of acronyms, and sometimes they're funny but they're usually not.
