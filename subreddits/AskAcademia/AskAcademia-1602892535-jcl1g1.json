  "title:": "My (undergrad) professor assigns 200 pages of readings a week and hasn't answered my last three emails :(",
  "text": "I'm in a senior research seminar for my humanities major. The professor is someone I completely adore. I have, in fact, a bit of a crush on him.\n\nBut he assigns so much in terms of readings - up to 250 pages a week but usually closer to 150. Do you guys think this is reasonable? Half of it is usually primary source material, half academic discourse, and then sometimes media pieces. So it's not like it's easy reading either.\n\nAnd then, and I'm not upset about it but it just makes me feel a bit embarrassed/rejected, he hasn't answered my last three emails!\n\nThe first email was about something we were discussing in a meeting I had had with him. I thanked him for the meeting, sent him a picture which I had asked him a question about during the meeting, and commented about my interest in a memoir written by an academic he knows really well.\n\nNo answer. That's fine, I guess, the email didn't have any action items.\n\nThe second email was about my research proposal. I mentioned an author we had both been talking about, linked to a really interesting interview with him, and then asked the professor if he might be available to meet sometime in the next few days to help me refine some things for my research proposal, which would be due the following week.\n\nNo answer. Ouch! I was really embarrassed. After this, when I went to class, I was a bit quiet. He noticed, and he was like, you're quiet today. have you done the readings?\n\nI was like yeah, of course I have. He said, so what's going on?\n\nI didn't say much. But I was actually a bit hurt that he hadn't been answering any of my emails, and I was also really tired...\n\nAnyways, I sent the third email a few days ago. In the email, I explained that I've always done the readings, all of them, take them really seriously, annotate extensively (my annotations document is about 70 pages now!), and then I mentioned that I find upwards of 200 pages of readings to be challenging (something all the classmates and I had agreed on - they were just too afraid to broach it with him), but that I still appreciated the readings and learned so much from them, and would even miss them after this class is over. I also asked if he assigns about this much in his grad classes. A few weeks ago, he'd said that I could take a grad class with him, so that's why I asked about that.\n\nNo answer!\n\nI don't know what to do. Why isn't he answering any of my emails??",

There's a good chance there will be no one else in the zoom room.",

I don't mind (it's very common in undergrad and school in general-- and like I said, I've been there too!). But as an instructor it's an awkward situation where I don't want to give them the idea that I'm romantically interested but also don't want to offend them. Often these are students I like a lot. So he might be in a similar position-- or he might be completely oblivious and just busy, who knows!",

I've never been 100% sure anyone had a crush on me, and it's never bothered me except in one instance, where it wasn't so much as a crush as it was sexual harassment. If the person is just overly friendly but respectful I don't mind. \n\nUsually I start to suspect it when it seems like the student is just making excuses to be in contact with me. For example, I had a very bright student who would frequently attend office hours and send me emails. They would alternate between very smart and curious questions and obvious questions that I imagine they could figure out themselves. They would be very grateful (even when I don't think they really needed me) and would often include personal details in their emails and emojis. I always enjoyed interacting with this student but I would sometimes not reply right away both because I didn't want to encourage them and because I had a lot of other things on my plate. \n\nHope that helps! :-)",

So not at all out of line, at least at my institution. We teach a sophomore \"reading for historians\" course that assigns a book plus a few articles every week, but that's a specialized course intended to teach history majors how to read like historians (i.e. efficiently using active reading strategies).\n\nMissing emails is another matter. It happens sometime, especially when they flood in on a busy day and sometimes I'll just overlook one. But three times in a row? No.  That's certainly the point at which I'd hope a student would say \"I've emailed you three times this week but didn't hear back, I'm wondering if somehow you aren't getting my messages?\"  Sometimes people get swamped, and with COVID workloads are through the roof while faculty are also dealing with personal stuff-- child care, kids at home, family members ill, etc. are quite common among my colleagues.\n\nI have had issues with students emailing from non-campus accounts...first years especially seem to think their old gmail account from high school or some [\"shagger44@hotmail.com](mailto:\"shagger44@hotmail.com)\" account is a good way to reach their professors, when in fact they're either going to be ignored or caught by a junk mail filter. But that doesn't seem to be the issue here.",

So I'm a bit discouraged to hear everyone say this is a totally normal reading load and to expect 1000 pages for grad school. \n\nI have only ever emailed him from my university email. And I'm way too embarrassed to actually mention the emails to him, I don't want to confront him like that, it would be embarrassing for both of us and a bit degrading for me, I think. I actually brought up something I had mentioned in one of my emails, and his face looked totally blank. It's not like he's not receiving the emails - he responded to my first two at the beginning of the semester. He just doesn't really care much or pay attention to them unless I'm making a very clear and strong request - and I think even that has stopped now, since I've emailed him so much. \n\nThe reading for historians class sounds really interesting!",

However, my concern is based on how this workload would gatekeep low-income and marginalized students, who likely wouldn't be able to commit that much of their time when they aren't being paid, when the people in power care more about deadlines than limiting the number of hours expected for students to spend on the topic.

It sounds like you're trying to move this into a personal relationship, and your professor is trying to keep things professional. Three long emails, particularly if they're primarily sharing your thoughts and not asking course-related questions, is A LOT. Take a step back and reset this as a professional relationship. \n\nAlso, I have to mention that your writing and this story (undergrad English major w crush on make teacher) sounds extremely similar to a poster that used to write under the names minervajones and disorderedfiction. If that is you, please all take all the comments here as a reminder to step back -- as you've been advised each time you've mentioned this professor -- and to bring up your emails and your feelings in your next therapy appointment. I'm only mentioning this because you're placing a lot of responsibility for your emotional well-being on this professor. If those other posters are not you, I'd still encourage you to take a step back, but it's not at such an urgent level, yet!",

I've always connected really well with professors, and they're always been really responsive (I'm at a small, teaching focused institution), so I guess I'm not used to being snubbed like this, especially by someone I like this much.\n\nThey were three short emails, actually. And tangentially related to course material. But since this professor is someone I'm interested in working with academically, one of the few in my area of interest, I definitely plan on stepping back and trying to adopt a more professional conduct. \n\nThank you for your response.",

We deal with this mostly unnecessary glut of information on top of our actual research, teaching, service, and family life.\n\n(As a side note, keep in mind that you probably don\u2019t know his teaching load or the number of students in each class. It\u2019s also often the case that at small schools, students email professors **more** frequently precisely because classes are more intimate.)\n\nYou wrote in another response to someone \u201cI don't want to schedule office hours just to chat.\u201d If it\u2019s not worth dropping by office hours, it\u2019s not worth sending an email (unless you\u2019re okay with not receiving a response. Sometimes it\u2019s just satisfying to share a cool link). I care deeply about my students, but we\u2019re not friends. It also kind of sounds like **you may be front-loading all your \u201cchat\u201d in the emails**, which he\u2019d only be skimming, and **making it hard to see whether you have an actual, urgent question** that only he can answer.\n\n250 pages/a week for a senior research seminar is normal, especially if some of it, as you say, is not actual reading but related media.\n\nAnd I agree with others he\u2019s aware you\u2019re crushing and wants to shut it down. There\u2019s nothing shameful about your feelings. But know that good professors\u2014who understand the asymmetrical power dynamic at play\u2014enforce healthy boundaries. Take care.",

Additionally, I've had profs not respond until the second or third email (reminders of the original email and content, not entirely new content like yours).  Since you do have a class, I would approach your prof to discuss either setting up a meeting or to answer quick questions about an assignment or reading. If a longer discussion develops from those questions, great!  For example, the additional info you sent in the third email would be a good opener.  Just asking that they did receive would be appropriate.  Even checking they received the second email and asking again to schedule a office meeting to go over it more (if necessary) also works.  The content of the third email is a bit more problematic.  Complaining about the amount of reading is going to bring up questions about you succeeding in a grad level course.  To overcome this, I'd ask for reading strategies to help you handle the increased reading load for this class or future classes.  \n\nNot responding to emails isn't personal.  People miss emails or think they responded but didn't (had that happen).  Learning to handle it is important.",

It was probably pretty obvious in retrospect, but he did always reply to my emails, and he ended up as my thesis advisor and good friend postgrad. \n\nI would agree with others that your emails are a teensy bit superfluous. I would recommend in the future only emailing a professor if absolutely necessary. That being said, he should have sent you like a one sentence reply at the very minimum by email number 3. \n\nDo not let your crush cloud your judgement. As another poster said, you are placing a lot of emotional responsibility for your wellbeing on your professor. Just know that who you are doesn\u2019t change based on whether or not someone likes you. Just do good work, and he will respect you for that at the very least. \n\nIn terms of keeping up with readings: read the intro, highlight the thesis, find one interesting passage OR 2 points of evidence/support for the thesis, and then skim the conclusion. That should cut your time spent on the readings considerably.",

Bit we live a world where things are not perfect, life happens, and we have numerous obligations that share our precious time.\n\nThe best way to consider your assigned reading is that you are \"responsible of the material\" meaning you should understand the reading, be able to discuss the reading, and synthesize any arguments or theories that include the reading.  \n\nAs a student, your expected to be able to research, manage your time efficiently, and complete tasks.  Sometimes, reading involves more those three things than actually sitting down for 8 hours and going line by line.  Just consider those thoughts and try not to stress out.\n\nI did have a new professor when I worked on my masters degree assign our class about 15-20 pages of writing per week.  It floored me and sucked up most of my time.  I had a discussion with her, showed her other syllabi from her colleagues within the department, and informed her that she may want to scale back the sheer amount of written pages, given they were works with the intent of publication.  She took my criticism and made changes the following semester.  But I took my medicine as did the rest of the class.  It would have been inappropriate to ask that professor to make major course changes after the start of the semester.  Sometimes it's better to be creative than to throw a monkey wrench into the machine.\n\nIt sounds like your professor wants you to come out of the other side with a very complete contextual understanding of the material.  I'd lean into that and reap the rewards when you're done.",

I would suggest scheduling a meeting during office hours to let him know that a) you\u2019ve emailed a few times without a response, so ask if there\u2019s a different way they should contact you when you need to get in touch and b) ask for tips on managing the reading. Yes, he\u2019s busy but working with his students is one of the tasks on his plate. As your teacher, he has to be able to work with you when you need support, or if that\u2019s not possible, he needs to communicate that.",

      "text": "I'm sorry but these comments are insane. This faculty member is not being reasonable *at all* in terms of their communication (can't speak to reading workload as I'm not very familiar with the humanities). This person is being pretty rude not responding to emails. Yes, workloads are higher this semester, but interacting with students is literally our job. I also find it strange that he doesn't have a set office hours time. If you're only going to meet with students by appointment, maybe check your damn email for students who want to meet. Seems like someone who doesn't like to interact with students in general. I get not everyone loves teaching, but sheesh.\n\nEdit: I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. For those that are downvoting...can you explain why? Where are you that it is considered acceptable behavior for instructors to refuse to interact with students? This is not something I have ever encountered, even at R1s that don't value teaching. It is expected that students are able to contact you outside of class.",

(We actually had a discussion the other day on what computational psycholinguistics is exactly ...)\n\nLol yeah those are certainly eye-popping. I said this in my other comment as well but I almost never did readings in undergrad, nor did pretty much everyone else. Only some of the classes had readings, and even in those that did, the readings usually weren't useful for the mid-term or final so most folks didn't bother with them. There was this one time when a lecture got cancelled and the professor hinted that we had to do the reading for that lecture because it'd still be on the final ... and from talking to my friends afterwards it seemed I was almost the only person who did the reading.\n\nFor grad classes I do have classes that go over 100, but 200 is still high and 250 ridiculous lol. <100 is definitely still the norm, especially for classes taught by older faculty (younger faculty tend to assign more for some reason). I think we need time to read papers that are closer to our own research interests, and classes with too many required readings would be detrimental - I wouldn't want to spend a few hours a week reading about implosive stops in Caucasian languages or whatever, when I can spend time reading stuff that's relevant to my actual interests.",

I said this elsewhere, but I just don't see how that amount of reading can even be useful past a certain point, *especially* in grad school. Maybe if you were changing fields it could be useful? But just being in your field and paying attention you'll suck up the baseline knowledge pretty easily. Much better off devoting time to reading things in your own field IMO...although implosive stops are fun hehe!",

Everyone is just responding and saying, this is a normal amount to ASSIGN. But is it a normal amount to expect each student to have completely read and understood? It appears not! Everyone knows that most people don't do all the reading. But you're actually expected to do ALL of it in this class, which is why 250 pages feels like a lot.",

Hell, even at my first TT job where I taught 12 credit hours a semester, my teaching only counted for 60% of my annual evaluation.",

The only rational explanation I can think of is that he has figured out you have some sort of crush on him, isn't sure how to respond, and is asking people for advice about how to handle the situation before getting back to you. I would find this pretty hard to believe though -- most of us have encountered situations like this in the past, and even if not, it's not acceptable to delay so long that you provide zero assistance to students on major assignments. This whole situation is very strange to me, and not something I have encountered from my experiences with hundreds of faculty members. There must be some other side that I am not understanding...",
