  "text": "So I've been lucky enough to be accepted into multiple phD positions simultaneously and now face a very hard decision. They are all great programs that pay well, but they were never my top choices, however I didn't get into the top choices. They are all interdisciplinary, 2 include lab work and 2 are primarily desk based.  \nI have been making a pros and cons list, but they all tie.\nKeeping a 10 year picture in mind just confuses me even more. Has anyone been in a similar position before? If yes, how did you ultimately nake your decision and not regret passing along the other opportunity down the line. \n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "I agree with this. Who you work with will have both a huge influence on your experience as a Ph.D. student. Working with someone you get along with well and who is supportive and affirming will be a very different experience than working for someone who is more absent or is not particularly affirming -- especially since you're looking at a 5+ year commitment.\n\nIf you are choosing between two programs that are very similar in terms of what they offer you academically, you might also consider some non-academic factors if you haven't already done so. For example, do you have a preference for living in one of the locations over the other?",

I guess these questions are irrelevant if your goal is to join industry after getting your Phd, but if you want to be an academic, it is important. The academic market is brutal (basically a caste system with a handful of stars and a lot of miserable others), and which school you decide to go might change the outcome quite significantly (obviously this is not the only thing that matters, but as someone who was quite naive about the academic market before selecting a school, I feel that I could have taken some more realistic advice before just pursuing my passion).",

Which option will allow you to live in a place that keeps you close to your support network (SO, friend, family etc.) . Imagine yourself in each scenario, which one is the one where you see yourself thriving? \n\nIn my opinion, prestige, fancy papers etc. do not matter because there is no guarantee that you wont end up on a dead end project. Imagine that shit will go wrong and try to see which research group you would want by your side when you are going through a rough patch. Kinda like picking a life partner :)",
