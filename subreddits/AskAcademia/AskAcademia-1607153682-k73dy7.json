  "title:": "Should I Speak up About Homophobia in Research Center?",
  "text": "**I am a gay graduate student who's part of an NSF research center in the hard sciences.  An external evaluator is polling members about the center's climate to send to the administrators and to the NSF.  I've been on the receiving end of homophobia on a number of occasions in the center.**\n\nIn one instance, another grad student learned about me while we were at a conference and spent the next day following me around and calling me gay slurs when others were out of earshot.  They also told people not to trust me and that I don't belong at the conference.\n\nAt a professional lunch with another lab in the center, the other graduate students made horrible gay jokes throughout the meal.  Two of them managed to mockingly imitate a gay couple and a third dropped the f-bomb a few times for good measure.\n\nI have more examples that I won't list here, but there's an atmosphere around the center that makes me feel unwelcome and at risk of being treated unfairly.  Having to hide myself has probably has affected my mental state and therefor my research.  The only other gay student in the center ended up leaving because of this environment.\n\n**I've been considering anonymously emailing the person evaluating the research center to let them know about my experiences, but have been struggling with the decision.**  I want someone to know and for something to be done.  On the other hand, I'm worried about danger to my professional life if I speak up and don't think anything will change even if I am heard and go through that risk.\n\nTalking to the evaluator could be seen by the administrators as me sabotaging the center's funding, but I am mainly concerned about what would happen if people in my home lab learn that I am gay from the report.  They don't know about me, but if people hear about someone complaining in the center then it wouldn't be hard to find out who it is since I'm the only gay one in a tiny research center.\n\nMy advisor is super catholic and Russian and a lot of the people I work with are also pretty religious.  I'm only a year away from graduating and am thinking that I should just suck it up and then leave this bad situation when I get my degree.  However, I also feel like such a coward for not being able to speak up about this and having to pretend that everything is great when I am literally fantasizing about leaving the field I am in to be around more accepting researchers.\n\n**What do you think Reddit?  Has anyone dealt with a similar situation and what did you do?**",

Survival is key.\n\nIf it were me, I would probably tough it out while building a case to submit to the institution and government agency after I left. I mean daily documentation of dates and times and actors and passive observers of each incident  in the notes in my phone that I would transcribe to a document.\n\nThen the hot second I either found a better environment or finished and left off it would go to both of those entities. I'd also find out how to get representation through the aclu and or glaad  or whomever. Then I'd go on about my damn life and let those folks Duke it out. At that point you have essentially provided a dossier and insulated yourself from repercussion.\n\nBut again. You are under no obligation to take any action which threatens your safety or well being if it goes against who you are to do so.",

          "text": "Thanks!  After looking through some of the comments here I think this is what I'll do.  Just try to keep my head down and finish off my degree.  Alert people about the environment and culture I've seen once I'm safely away.\n\nThe good news is that I will be spending the last four months of the year I have left in my degree doing research away from my home university.  The group is part of the same research center, but they did seem more friendly.  A lot of the toxic behavior in the center seems concentrated in just a handful of member labs (which are also the largest labs in the center).\n\nI think it will also be a good way to test drive another working environment before graduating and is part of the reason I applied for the opportunity.  The PI I'm working with would be a potential postdoc advisor if I decide to continue in research.  If I end up having another bad experience, however, then I'm probably just going to ditch this field for greener pastures.",

Being right doesn't protect your interests - and ultimately you have to look out for interests by not picking a fight you can't win.\n\nThe same issues crop up frequently with sexual harassment cases.\n\nIn a sense, it's like car insurance. Even if you're completely blameless when you file a claim, the mere fact that you filed a claim means your car insurance will go up.\n\nLikewise, the mere act of complaining can sabotage your advancement. If you want to 'make things right', you need to wait until you're in a position where people's bad opinions can no longer impact your future.",

      "text": "As a queer scholar, my advice is to protect yourself FIRST. Obviously, no one in your lab, not even your PI, is putting any value on your well-being.  You must safeguard your well-being in every way possible.\n\nRight now, that probably means not risking your position and reputation so close to graduation.  I am furious about this, and I am so deeply sorry that your graduate education has been so badly affected (and yes, disrupted) by this hateful climate.\n\nAnd I know you want to identify and help dismantle this toxic environment, and you want to make it safe for you, and for others who might come after you.  But as they say on airplanes, you must put your own oxygen mask on first before helping others.\n\nOnce you are safe (that might mean out of that lab, that might mean after you complete a postdoc and have the assurance of excellent letters of rec -- only you will know when you feel truly safe), then you will be able to act.\n\nIn the meantime, keep the contact information of the NSF investigator.  Keep a meticulous record (with times and dates) of every instance of discrimination and harassment you have faced during your time at this research center.  And then later, when you are safe, send that information to the NSF investigators, noting that you were afraid of retaliation while you were still a student there.  At that time, you can also decide whether to send this report anonymously.\n\nI personally hope you soon achieve such a degree of safety, security, and success that you will be able to file this report with your name signed legibly -- in purple glitter ink.\n\nI am rooting for you.  Find and draw upon support from friends and loved ones.  Keep your mind clear from distractions as much as possible, and do excellent work until you can get out of this vile environment.  Then, when you are ready, toss the bomb.",

You can pretend you are one of your peers, and write something like \"a colleague of mine told me... They don't dare speaking up themselves in fear of ripercussions... It is a serious issue I thought should be reported and I thought I'd do it even if they [aka you, OP] decided not to report the situation themselves...\" Something like this. It will not hide for long that you are the gay student in the center, but it will maybe help avoiding the blame for the report.\nI'm not sure this helps.\n\nI do think you would do a good thing for yourself and for students who might find themselves in your current situation in the future by reporting this. I know it is a big burden and it takes a lot of courage. Don't forget that there is really no blame on you if you can't gather this much courage. For you, it is going to be tough either way (although in different ways, maybe) unfortunately. It is just up to you to choose whether to face possible consequences but bring some kind of attention to the problem or just leave it (if you can tolerate it) and just be done with that place as soon as you graduate. Whatever option you choose, you won't choose wrong.",

One thing I love about academia is that I can be myself after growing up super religious so it makes me so sad to hear this. \n\nI like the suggestion of reporting witnessing harassment and not saying it was you. But if you have less than a year to go I might stay quiet and report it on my way out personally. I don't think either is the wrong decision and it is fine to work in your best interest even if you don't save your whole center from homophobia in the future...that is not actually your job.\n\nThere is a a great group on facebook called Queer PHD network.",

      "text": "I know everyone here has said some variation of: report them. I would say, don\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to say: do the right thing, there are departments to help. Others need it. However, they\u2019re not in your shoes. You are miserable now. If you \u201creport them anonymously\u201d as some have suggested, the slurs and the jokes? They might get worse. Academia is gossipy and everyone knows each other or is two or three degrees separated from each other. In highly specialized fields with these types of grants? World shrinks even more. \n\nWhat about allies to write up a formal complaint or to take up a series of signatures to show this is an issue? You already said people can be openly homophobic and it\u2019s a joke. Hell, they can torment you directly by throwing that shit in your face and nothing happens. If you could find people to sign or support you, how far would that go when they have to decide between being a good person or putting their careers on the line for a possible competitor once they graduate?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a dick. You have endured homophobic abuse this long while working and this seems like the perfect opportunity to shine a light on this type of abuse. But if you do and it gets ignored, then it might feel super shitty to have put yourself out there and no one gives a fuck. If they do and it\u2019s negative, then it gets worse for you. But, best case scenario: you get some traction, will the environment suddenly change because people have to watch a new training video and get a certificate that says they won\u2019t use slurs in the workplace?\n\nI am not trying to say this is not terrible, but I am saying: you are not a coward for wanting to survive. You are being realistic and you are taking care of yourself as best you can in that type of environment. You\u2019re stronger than a lot of us, but you are also exhausted and that\u2019s understandable. I don\u2019t have the right answer. Maybe speaking up is right. Maybe it isn\u2019t. All I know is that you haven\u2019t spoken up before, and having an external source of help might seem like a good idea, but they just evaluate. At the end of the day it\u2019s up to the research center and your direct supervisor to change the environment. If it hasn\u2019t changed, that might be your best indicator of whether this is a fight you want to add on top of your research and work related stressors.\n\n**TL:DR** \u2013 *speak up or don\u2019t. It\u2019s up to you. Just keep in mind all three scenarios: best case, worst case and neutral/nothing happens case. And be prepared for the most likely, given the current climate and your colleagues, supervisors and administration.*",

But generally, these things are personal and have nothing to do with science.\n\nDon't let it set you against the field or discourage you from your science! \n\nAlmost all the scientists I know are 'wierd'/unusual in some way, that's one of of my favorite things about it. \n\nIf you think you'd be punished, maybe try to document everything and wait a little until your closer to graduating before going public. Then get the hell out.\n\n If anything, speaking up and making a stand would be considered a positive attribute by any research institute that you would want to be in.",

Your colleagues are just horrible, like what in the hell, and to tell people you don't belong, just Christ what a horrible environment. Are you in a state which allows recording? If so there are recording devices on amazon that look like pens. I have one from a sexual harassments nightmare I worked at, and ended up having to give it to the police for evidence later on when shit really hit the fan, I was glad to have it. I would get one of those if your laws allow it, it looks like a normal pen and when you want to start recording you just click the pen like a normal pen. I would gather evidence before speaking to anyone. Although there are supposed to be laws against harassments to protect us, it never works out they way it should. If you have any emails or texts or any evidence, start saving it in a folder so when you do talk to them you will have all your evidence to support it. Sadly when it comes to harassments it is usually much easier to just leave then any action to come of it. But I know that is a bit harder since you are a grad student and not a regular employee But know this is not normal, you are just in a really terrible lab.",
