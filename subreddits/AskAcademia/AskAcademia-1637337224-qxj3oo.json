  "text": "I am what someone might call an early-mid carreer scientist. I have a respectable number of publications and I like to believe that my name is known in my community. Despite that, I will be marrying next March and I plan to take on my SO's last name. Should I publish future papers with my new name? (It is tremedously easier to read and pronounce for an international audience). Shall I email everyone I know about my name change? Is it legit (and pratical) to keep my old name for scientific publications? How did people in my situation handle this?",

              "text": "You're correct. The ORCID will help with most things that track your publications but it will not transfer the reputation you have already build up to your new name. Informing collaborators of the name change would help a bit but you'll always lose some of that \"oh, that person is really active in X area\" effect. \n\nMost people I know in this situation just stuck with their maiden name. It's obviously your decision but if you don't have strong feelings either way, I'd strongly recommend sticking with the name under which you started publishing. It's common and not much different than authors or artists being known by names other than their legal names.",

Regardless, getting an ORCID account is a good idea.\n\n>Shall I email everyone I know about my name change?\n\nI wouldn't send an email explicitly for this purpose, though I have seen people change the name in their email signature to something like: FirstName NewLastName (OldLastName).\n\n>Is it legit (and pratical) to keep my old name for scientific publications? How did people in my situation handle this?\n\nI know female faculty in my departments who kept their name in the professional world, but do change the name personally.",
