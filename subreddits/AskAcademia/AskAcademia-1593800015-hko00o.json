But they're in an industry that often pays very poorly, with few opportunities to contribute to retirement. I'm younger, but one reason I went into academia was because I could be assured work with minimal physical requirements as I get older. Everyone needs health insurance (in the US), and everyone needs to eat. This idea that all senior faculty are coming to work 4 hrs/day, 4 days/week and pulling in $150k/year is absurd. Maybe at the top end of some fields in some institutions, but it's hardly the norm. I work with senior faculty who wish they could afford to retire, but they make barely more than half that and put a lot of effort into teaching and service (and are not in the sciences so grants are not an issue). They're not at fault for the trouble young graduates have in finding work. Blame the universities, not the employees.",

Especially if we are talking about the U.S. higher education system, it has a lot to do with our lack of a social safety net for our older folks, as well. Why would you retire from a job you love - and are good at - that pays you six figures when your retirement income might be half that, depending on how much you were able to save? Keep in mind that many academics may not be able to contribute meaningfully to their own retirement until they are between 30 and 40, depending on when they finish their PhD and postdocs and get an academic job.\n\nMost of the professors emeritae at my graduate department were hustlers - some of the most productive in our department as well as well-known and widely admired for their knowledge.

Furthermore work being done is only a (fortunately) frequent side effect of wanting to retain one's salary: capitalism's precariousness encourages people to find ways to retain their salary without work, i.e. leverage their positions as opposed to work within them, which only further individuates everyone experiencing capitalism and worsens its issues.\n\nThese cushy-positioned people are each in a prisoner's dilemma in which the system they find themselves in will only get changed if everyone makes themselves uncomfortable. It's analogous to what we see with mask-wearing in the pandemic \u2014 lots of people think that there's no point inconveniencing themselves to wear a mask if nobody else is inconveniencing themselves to wear a mask. So few people wear masks and the status quo degrades as usual.",

It has been a shock in a way to adapt to the manner of discourse and thought because I feel that people never get to the point. My brother and I discuss this often and he has shown me some atrocious things he has read. We joke that only in the humanities you can find a thousand-word essay that develops at most half an idea and the rest is just reframing the same things with longer and longer words.

              "text": "Coming from someone in history, I think it depends on what we consider good writing. Some people love the really blunt, technical style in a lot of sciences while others prefer a more literary flow. Some fields love passive voice while others limit its use. For me, it comes down to two things: is your central point clear, and does everything else in the paper support it? You can add flourishes and extra literary flair, but those two components are essential for me.   \n\n\nI find a lot of my colleagues in neighboring departments bury their work in obtuse writing. It is quite common to see papers in fields like political science, literary/cultural theory, and qualitative branches of sociology that are almost impossible to read. I've also have had a number of students in these, and other, fields submit papers that had less substance than a cereal box but hide it behind complex theory-laden language. I usually tell them to keep their writing as simple as possible, and only use complex language when necessary to prove a point.   \n\n\nThis is NOT universal, and some branches of history are not entirely innocent (as EastCoastLizardBoi already pointed out.) I've read a few books recently that fall into the same traps I outline above. Last week, I read a book on the same topic that was MUCH clearer and more engaging.",

To be sure, Continentals offer reasons as to why clarity is an elusive concept and so on.

Oh and the mandatory guest lecture is at 7:30pm, following by a book launch for the lecturer at 8:30pm. You can't miss that, don't worry it directly conflicts with your child's bathtime. Don't forget every Monday we're going to have a departmental seminar that starts at 4pm and runs until 6pm and we're not saying you *have* to be there but, you have to be there. \n\nAnd that's not to mention teaching. We can be rostered to teach any time from 9am-9pm. Sure, you can request a preference but the university sets the timetable and if your course gets moved, it gets moved. Sure it might only be once a week that you stay late, but it still means paying for childcare for significantly longer than if you were coming home at 5.\n\nI have a colleague who is a single mother in academia. She's not sure she can stay in academia because it's making it incredibly difficult to juggle her child. She doesn't have shifts she can plan around, or a guaranteed 9-5 every day for which she can hire a regular sitter to fill the gap between school ending and her coming home. She has three different babysitters because they can't all guarantee they'll be available for her due to the ever-changing nature of her schedule.\n\nShe's a great scholar and an excellent teacher. It would be a loss if she were to leave, but because all hours are options when it comes to scheduling lectures, seminars, meetings, conferences etc. it makes it extremely difficult to manage a home life.",

We do learn about the reproductive anatomy of males and females, menstruation, fertilization+embryo development plus some contraceptive methods in grade 10, but Idt that's enough for a student. One good point is that they focus on topics like female foeticide and family planning.\n\nIf you take Biology in grade 12 though, its is pretty comprehensive - they go into a lot of detail about reproductive anatomy+contraceptive methods + fertilization + ART bcs most students who take Biology in grade 12 are pre-med. \n\nI think places where India's sex ed could improve is writing about LGBTQ in our syllabus(they just dont mention it at all), plus mentioning efficacy rates of each contraceptive method before grade 10, when it is compulsory for everyone to take Biology. \n\nWhile the govt and society may be conservative, I think everyone realizes the necessity of sex ed in India and the need for a population decrease. The fertility rate is decreasing for those states which have higher literacy rates + more urbanized (~1.7), for the rural areas though it's pretty high.",

And just because there\u2019s a tacking on of family planning and population dynamics (which, if you look at how it plays out in policy is actually an extension of decades old policy) doesn\u2019t make it sex ed. There\u2019s no discussion of consent, of power, of a range of contraceptive options (also, \u2018family planning\u2019 \u2260 contraceptive options... especially when we don\u2019t have enough of a method mix in country).\n\nThe fertility rate is decreasing overall, but that\u2019s not necessarily because of sex ed, especially in rural areas. There is still a concerted push- via frontline health workers- to target women\u2019s family planning uptake.... and sterilisation. India is the only country that has reported an increase in tubectomies- it has decreased everywhere else. Sterilisation after \u2018two\u2019 remains common, not necessarily voluntary. It\u2019s sometimes made conditional as a requirement of care.\n\nJust because schools teach evolution, it doesn\u2019t mean people know how procreation works (in part because talking about sex remains taboo). I can tell you from my fieldwork (on abortion) that they don\u2019t- I\u2019ve interviewed enough young women who get pregnant within a month of their marriage who say \u2018I didn\u2019t know about all this (family planning)\u2019 or \u2018even he was shocked- \u2018already?\u2019 he asked me\u2019\n\nAnd pseudoscience is very present in India- just think to the murders of rationalists and the number of them sued for \u2018hurting religious sentiment\u2019- see: Kalburgi or Dabholkar for instance. And don\u2019t even get me started on the likes of Baba Ramdev and Coronil. These aren\u2019t anomalies- they\u2019re still part of a quickly modernising India, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as peripheral as it\u2019s made to seem. This article [(on pseudoscience in India) ](https://www.nature.com/news/indian-scientists-urged-to-speak-out-about-pseudoscience-1.22957) is  from 2017, on the issues folx are pushing back against. There have been similar events, well attended, incl by senior government officials, in recent years.\n\nSo as not to derail from the largely conversation: I think this is an issue in academia. The lack of interdisciplinarity- I often struggle with seeing how complex social phenomena (with lasting policy implications) aren\u2019t engaged with across departments... or are dismissed to the periphery. I see in my own \u2018interdisciplinary\u2019 department: there are the \u2018star\u2019 topics (for us: political economy of... whatever) and there\u2019s \u2018oh, I can\u2019t speak to that\u2019 about anything even vaguely outside that comfort zone.",

I eventually switched advisors but was terrified and the experience significantly delayed my degree/career progresion. Advisor was elderly and expected me to attend creepy hours long meetings at his home (insisted it would save him the trouble of a trip to his office as he used a cane.) He'd treat them like a social call. Offered me alcohol, commented on my body & graphically described the bodies of other female students, asked me repeatedly about my sex life, enquired about my plans re: having a family, even invited me to international conferences and suggested we could save money by sharing a room+. He was well regarded in his field and this was an open secret. Personal life was a mess\u2014 multiple ex-wives, relationships with past students.... Others had spoken out. Even department staff. Yet faculty still assigned female graduate students to work with him. Later found out one of the reasons why he held so many meetings at his home was because he was told to keep his office door open when holding student meetings on campus. When I eventually complained was offered counseling to help me cope with his advising style. This was at a progressive institution! Can't even count how many stories of male faculty trolling for women from their student pool. By far the worst sexism/sexual harassment  I've ever experienced has been  in academia (especially as a graduate student).\n\nWanted to add I didn't speak up sooner because a) Graduate research can be extremely isolating. Wasn't told by staff/faculty of the past charges he'd faced till years in. Just recently heard from a student who left the program that he wrote her a 5 figure personal check to keep her from going public. b) Wasn't sure who to go to. Mentioned the situation to staff and administrators over the years but they never mentioned we had a Title IX Coordinator. Many laughed it off to him being from another generation. c) I personally never felt physically threatened and knew I could fend him off if he ever escalated. Far too focused on being strong and toughing it out.\n\nThat said, I completely underestimated how damaging the entire experience was academically, professionally, and health-wise. To this day I'm disgusted by the many socially progressive faculty and staff who let it go on for as long as it did. It was inexcusable and unfortunately not rare. One of the many reasons women drop out of doctoral programs at such high rates.",

From the grad school level to being a full professor, it seems that no one ever escapes the constant barrage of \u201cthis isn\u2019t good enough\u201d. \n\nNo one wants to talk about the crippling anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, and insomnia that comes from being a part of academia, because everyone wants to seem like they\u2019re doing well and have it all together. I think grad students are the best at discussing this, but after you get out of school, no one wants to keep talking about it. For your students, sure, but for you and your colleagues? It\u2019s instead joked about over beers. It\u2019s no secret that the academic world can be incredibly toxic, but I feel like it\u2019s avoided the higher you get through the ranks.",

Everyone else presenting in my session were very well experienced professionals or academics while I was just there like an undergrad with a mediocre at best research who only got to present to meet their inclusivity criteria of undergrad students. I got to talk with all these people about my work and I was getting so many suggestions and corrections. Their intentions may have been good to just honestly give me suggestions but I couldn't help but feel out of place. My sub par work was selected just because I'm just an undergrad over someone else who deserved more to be on that stage. This just drove me into more stress and working more hours to do the best I can and  make sure I'm worth being on that stage.\n\nA couple months later, another conference and same experience. Eventually I ended up focusing so much on my reasearch that I ended up with very bad grades in my regular courses. Eventually, I got over it and just started working moderate hours and stopped trying to push out good publications like a machine. My profile won't be as good and I won't get into a good grad program but at this point I don't care. If a bunch of sub par publications and my mental health are the cost to get me into a big name university, it wasn't gonna be worth it anyway.",

I can't imagine being accepted to this school, being so excited and paying all this money just to learn (probably in your second year, as many liberal arts schools make you wait that long to declare a major) that you will not be able to do your major of choice. I find this so unacceptable;  at least if you have to apply separately to the college/major/program you want, you will know ahead of time whether you got in or not.",

He didn't leave academia because he was being silenced, he left academia because academics and people who take him seriously are two mutually exclusive categories. There are plenty of academics out there with regressive views. I've heard professors in my own department refer to wearing the hijab as an \"abomination\" at a departmental conference with zero backlash. If anything, I've found that, contrary to the right-wing crying wolf about \"SJWs gone crazy\", the actual institution of academia has one of the most entrenched forms of systemic racism and sexism in our society, precisely because it's continually left unchallenged and unaddressed.\n\nIf you think that an individual calling you out for saying something racist constitutes the suppression of critical dialogue in academia, then you really need to develop some thicker skin.",
