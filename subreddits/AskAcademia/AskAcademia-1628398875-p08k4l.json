  "text": "Hi Academia!  \n\n\nAs I write my first psych. annotated bibliography - am wondering if it's standard to feel uncertain while writing?   \n\n\nThe uncertainly - **not knowing whether I am 'right' or 'wrong' with my expression and style feeds into procrastination** (annoying).   \n\n\n* Any fellow science students share similar experiences? \n   * If so, how did the journey unfold for you: **did you become more skilled/confident overtime** \\- or is the uncertainty a constant?\n   * Any **tips or recommendations** to overcome this issue? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest wishes, \n\nYour procrastinating psych. student.",

      "text": "Yeah, I would say a very typical problem. \n\nIt sort of comes to how to teach academic writing, which universities should do but don't.\n\nA) Take a look at 2-3 samples. The instructor should explain what makes them good: what are the criteria for structure, content, style, word choice, references etc.\n\nB) You make the first draft of yours, trying to do your best but not over agonizing about everything in this paper because then you ...\n\nC) take it to the instructor, who reviews it, explains the things that don't work, identifies how you can improve every aspect: structure, content, style ect.\n\nD) you re-write your paper and take it to the instructor again. Discuss what else can be improved and if you met all the criteria of a good paper.\n\nThat's a standard way of teaching academic writing but departments and programs are kind of lazy to teach this stuff and suppose that you somehow learn it yourself (by breathing in the air of the department hallway, I guess). So you have to teach yourself. \n\nFind and ask for samples from your field (are you working on a dissertation or a paper for publications), 3-4 should be enough. Analyze the structure, write down the good lingo.  Make the first draft as it goes, give it a quick polish and find somebody who can read it for you and give you good advice on what works and what not and how to improve it. Ideally, it should be your advisor, then the Writing center but if these are not helpful, you could pair up with some peers from your program. Having a second pair of eyes is usually way more helpful than trying to figure out your writing flaws by yourself, which is oftentimes like looking for a black cat in a dark room.",
