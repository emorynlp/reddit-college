  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI'm an undergrad art history major at Stony Brook University. I really enjoy my major, and I enjoy writing/researching topics. I was recently offered a 5 year master's program my first semester freshman year in a 300 level class. That was pretty exciting -- except graduate level work in art history usually means going into academia. \n\nI'm passionate about the work. I do well. It's the only thing I've really ever liked in school. I can't even do addition in my head so anything STEM is out of the question. But all the time I hear that academia is cutthroat, the coworkers are petty and the departments are budget minded and not work-minded. \n\nDo I take a shot on art history and go all the way? Or do I switch to business or something and do something that can at least get me some job.",

      "text": "Stony Brook is a good program, and if you're in-state this is a great opportunity to get a taste of how academia will be without a huge time or financial commitment.\n\nAfter your MA you might take a couple years away to work at a museum, auction house, or somewhere else in the heritage biz. You'll get a sense of what that kind of work is like (low paid, though). Then, you can decide if you want to go back for a PhD.",

Studying art history does not imply that you must \"go all the way\" - you can quit at any point. You don't need to switch to business, or switch away from art history, to get a job. \n\nThis is probably an unsatisfying answer for someone who is experiencing career anxiety, but - take it easy. You're a freshman, and for the next couple of years, just liking your major and doing well in it is enough school-wise. Outside of that, join some clubs, do some internships, even if they don't directly relate to art history, see what there is in the world. It's silly to commit yourself to a path, whether that's art history or not-art-history, before you know the range of options available to you. You don't need to decide about grad school now.",

      "text": "> That was pretty exciting -- except graduate level work in art history usually means going into academia.\n  \nI assume things must be different in the US but I'm from Germany and here a PhD is pretty standard if you want to work for larger museums. E.g. look at [the people running the Pinakotheken in Munich](https://www.pinakothek.de/ueber-uns/team) (the \"Referent:innen\" are subject-area specialists with curatorial responsibility). After all, curators are (at the very least) also expected to edit exhibition catalogues of academic value.\n\nSo, maybe look towards larger institutions and/or Europe.",

      "text": "Why not do both? If you're already in 300 level courses you should be able to start business classes and have enough credits for a double major. If you enjoy writing and researching, there are a lot of disciplines that still allow you to do that. Check out social science fields (geography, sociology, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that master's programs are how a lot of schools make their money, so they will probably advertise that program heavily. If you do decide to go into graduate school, I recommend finding a funded program, so that you won't have as large of a financial burden after finishing.",
