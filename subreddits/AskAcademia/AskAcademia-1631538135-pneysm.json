      "text": "I don't know any comprehensive lists that would answer your question, but I live in Canada and I think it's a good option for you. You don't have to worry about laws making Canada unsafe for transgender people and culturally, it's very LGBT-friendly, especially in bigger cities (think Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal). Those cities have great universities with plenty of graduate programs to choose from.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, this is probably going to vary a LOT between labs, even if the uni/dept has a strong diversity and inclusion statement, so finding the right place may end up being harder than just finding a school in an inclusive country. The \"good\" news is youll probably not get very far applying to labs where the PI is going to be a shithead. But, even with a good PI, its going to be hard to predict what youll deal with from people outside the immediate lab, unless you have a lot of very productive interviews with other graduate students before accepting an offer.\n\nAll that said, i think youll have better luck avoiding transpobes in academia than you would elsewhere. The community outside your school is where Id be worried, so id def recc trying to find another queer person to chat with during your interview so you can get some first-hand thoughts on what the experience will be like.",

      "text": "In the US, the Transgender Law Center has an [updated map](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/equalitymap) that tallies the number of positive/protective policies vs negative/discriminatory policies in each US state and color codes them. They make a map for laws/policies related to sexual orientation, another for gender identity, and a third that is a combination of the two.\n\nQualitatively, I will add that, even within \"protective\" states, things are going to be culturally better in liberal areas, which tend to coincide with urban metros, but not always. The NY Times has probably the most detailed map of how people in different areas voted in the [2020 presidential election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html). Aim for large swaths of blue (like the DC/Baltimore area, greater NYC, coastal CA, etc.) and avoid anything red or even small blue areas in a sea of red (like Reno NV, Urbana Champaign IL, etc.).",
