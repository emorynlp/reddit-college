  "text": "Hello! I am considering doing a master's and PhD at the same university that I am interning at. I would love to do my master's here but I have some questions about doing a PhD here and would appreciate your input.\n\n1. The university is a top university in Korea and does this increase my chances of getting into a PhD program at a better university provided that I do well during my master's? If it does increase my chances of getting into a better university, is it worth leaving my Professor here?\n2. Do professors prefer master's students who want to get their PhD under them and are there any repercussions if I am open about leaving after my master's?\n3. If I should do my master's and PhD here, should I opt for a combined master's-PhD program?\n4. Does it depend on the field I am in? If so, what should I consider being in Computational Neuroscience?\n\nThank you so much for your time. I genuinely appreciate it.",

      "text": "> Do professors prefer master's students who want to get their PhD under them and are there any repercussions if I am open about leaving after my master's?\n\nGenerally speaking, PhD students are the most valuable to a professor. Masters students are good for quickly producing papers, but beyond that, they are limited because of the short nature of the masters program. Training and building rapport takes time, hence most professors will rather expend that energy on a PhD student. This dynamic changes depending on what academic rank the professor is. \n\n> If I should do my master's and PhD here, should I opt for a combined master's-PhD program?\n\nThis depends on how your school structures it. The best case scenario is if the combined program gives you access to the funding opportunities available to PhD students, but the flexibility of getting both an MS and a PhD degree (rather than just a PhD). The benefit here is that should you decide that a PhD is not for you, you will already have your MS in the bag. \n\n> What are the pros and cons of doing both master's and PhD with the same professor at the same university?\n\nPros: Consistency - you learn what your professor wants and how s/he wants it. This makes it easy to set expectations. You develop a strong relationship which will often help build you network contacts.\n\nCons: if your professor only cares about their own success (eg. Getting tenure above all else), they may have you waste time on things of little value to your own career. You miss out on learning the fundamental basics - how to do research, how to build a network, involvement in academic societies.\n\nNote: it is often said that getting your MS and PhD at the same college is *bad* because you do not challenge yourself to different research environments/styles. While this is somewhat true, from my experience, your academic track record (publications, teaching experience, college status) will trump this fact more often than not.",

Do you even know if the professor will have a PhD position available at the time you would be starting, have you spoken to them about this?\n\nTo answer some of your questions:\n\n1) In general in research the professor is more important than the university as a whole, though it never hurts to have gone to a famous university. When choosing your professor it's important to think not only about their reputation, but also to consider if their supervising style fits what you want - if you have a famous professor you might barely ever see them and only work with their postdocs, some professors are more hands on with students giving a lot of guidance, while others will expect more independence.\n\n2) If the professor already knows you & your work from masters, it is much much less risk for them to take you on as a PhD student. Equally, it's not automatically true that you will get preferentially hired over another candidate, or that it's impossible to get a PhD position without already having a masters in the same group.\n\n3) Depends on the specifics of the programme. I don't know the specifics of Korea.\n\n4) I don't know about your field so can't really comment. What I write here is kind of general though.",

I've seen a few come, do a hell of a job, and get multiple offers from top 10 universities for PhD. For PhD, there just aren't that many \"westerners\" if you are indeed one. Most foreign students are from China, SE Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. In a way, this can be an advantage. I got a good job after graduation.",

              "text": "If someone was looking for a MS-PhD rather than just PhD then you could get passed over. Feels like it's a wash.\n\nDoing your PhD in Korea is pretty much similar to other places... except most lab works are in Korean so you can't really participate. Freeing your time to do other things like most research. If your goal is to work in research centers or become a professor then focus on writing lots of papers.",

      "text": "I think it's more important at PostDoc level to move out. Doing a masters + continuing to a PhD is sometimes a great thing. You're wasting less time familiarising yourself, you probably already have a good rapport in lab, equipments and materials are in order etc. As for having a change in research environment, I'm pretty sure there must be a clause in the PhD contract stipulating that one can spend a few months building collaboration in another external lab. I would check out that option if available :). I think it's most important to have a good supervisor and colleagues, same lab or not. Good luck !",
