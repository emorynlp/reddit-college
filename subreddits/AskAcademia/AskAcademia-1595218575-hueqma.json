We\u2019ve been shut down for months (STEM lab), and though we are now slowly reopening, I\u2019m finding myself with little excitement to return. Maybe working from home just zapped the fun out of my research, but I\u2019m definitely not in the same \u201czone\u201d as I was prior to the pandemic.",

The frustrating part is mobile Adobe only saves to their cloud, but as soon as you open the adobe app on your computer and sync you can download the mark up to your computer.

I'm also quite stressed because I have a temporary contract that has to be renewed by the end of this year and I feel like I haven't been quite able to fill up this position to justify the pay. My job (that I started at the beginning of the year) is partly administrative/managing and partly \"research\" which would be filled in by myself. However, as we locked down in March and only the most necessary experiments are continuing (e.g. for phd students who need to finish at some point) I haven't been able to set up anything so far. There's talk that with the new academic year there will be more options for working but I'm probably rather low on the priority list. But that means that I'm afraid that when it comes to the contract renewing, I have \"failed\" on the part of the research and that I have to reduce hours and continue with the administrative part (which isn't enough to fill a fulltime position).",

Make it a game to see how many neighbours front windows you can look in as you pass and see what their WFH setup is like, or judge their decor, or smile at their pets. Take up gardening - herbs are easy to grow, small, great for food and a useful covid anosmia test!\n\nDesign in and celebrate small wins - if your work has far away deadlines or you are stuck and making little progress, find a side project or online course that you can dedicate half an hour or an hour a day and make some definite useful measurable progress. I did a course on Coursera and it is broken down into lessons and weeks and tests, so you can clearly see your progress.\n\nEdit to add: I release just giving advice might come across as judgy, so I'll add that I totally have the same feeling, it is so hard right now! I hope you have some supportive friends and colleagues you can talk to. The above tips are what I have found helped me these past few months, you might be in a very different situation but I hope you find something here that helps. Be kind to yourself!",

My work is mostly background research, so there aren't any deadlines nor is there really a sense of urgency, which makes it so hard to concentrate. If anyone has any tips on what kinds of deadlines are helpful to set in history projects (reading individual papers feel too small but I can't think of a bigger deadline that's not just like \"finish the project\"), would love to hear them!",

I miss going to the lab, even if it means to sweep the floor or wash some glassware (I suppose I could do that at my house, but it's just different, you know). The quarantine has been hard. I've tried modifying my environment. I would connect my work laptop to my monitor, keyboard and mouse, and would stay like that for a few days, then disconnect and go to the sofa or bed, especially if I only had to read and take light notes. It kinda works, but is not as ergonomic, so I still need to get up and walk around the apartment.\n\nRecently I finished adjusting a paper the boss requested that came back from peer review. I was so fed up with it, I couldn't look at the screen any more. I took to reading a physical book (on statistics and design of experiment, light reading) as a form of \"healing\", and kept use of the notebook to a minimum. Hell, I even took up bookbinding, and made a \"perfect bound\" book that I wanted to read but didn't want to stare at the screen. I plan to do a \"deluxe\" edition of my thesis once I figure out the final kinks in the layout and imposition.\n\nWe are financed by an oil company.

What I've found helpful is to have at home an \"ergonomic\" \"office-like\" space. Sofa/table chairs are right out, they tire you. But I do understand (a lot) the motivation issues. Also I can't find the will to work 100% even now, let alone when we were lockdown. \n\nSo, I work in a country that has reopened quite a lot by now and also, I do research in a hospital so we were never really forced to stay at home by law, despite having the strongest lockdown in the world. \n\nSo... I restarted going to the lab ASAP when they reopened because, despite doing computer based research, which I can do 100% from home as effectively as in the office, not being able to interact in person with colleagues just kills you. How can you do research without sitting in front of a whiteboard and getting feedback on your ideas? Is it even theoretically possible?\n\nDuring the full lockdown my scientific productivity has been on a huge rollercoaster. First week: panic attacks, didn't know what to do. Second week till 10th week:  Super high productivity. I gave myself a rigid schedule from waking up to going to bed and I was either indoor training or working or cooking. Nothing else so that my mind could not get depressed by what was happening. No listening to news on the radio or reading newspapers after 10 a.m. 7/7, working like 13 hours a day. I've studied many new topics that I had left behind last year, produced a nice new work.  10th week till end of full lockdown: breakdown, couldn't do anything at all.\n\nRelease of lockdown till now... Despite going to the office 3 times per week, that helped me a lot mentally, I'm like at 50% productivity because I can't focus",
