      "text": "My take on it is simple.\n\nThis is a trait you are very likely to display while conducting your PhD. You therefore want a PhD supervisor who recognises and is able to work constructively with it.\n\nDisclosing this in your cover letter or similar therefore does two things:\n1. it gives you an opportunity to demonstrate in your cover letter how you have succeeded and managed your ADHD, with examples. Overcoming challenges is a great trait to be able to show.\n2. It filters for supervisors who know what they're getting in to. \n\nWhile what /u/Logical-Bell-4382 says is true in a sense, in that disclosing this can reduce your chances of getting accepted, the only people it's reducing the chances of accepting you are the people who would struggle to work with you in the first place. Getting into a PhD with a sueprvisor like that is going to be a pretty terrible situation to be in. A PhD is hard enough without a shit supervision experience as well.",

              "text": "If you can use it in a constructive way in the letter, do it there. The opportunity to bring it up naturally in interview may not present itself, and \"forcing\" it into the interview might come across a bit odd. Remember, disclosing these things is not required, and it's not something they will be able to ask about in interview due to recruitment laws in place in most if not all european countries.\n\nPresent it maybe halfway through your letter (it's not something you want to lead with, and it's best to close with something really strong that focuses on your competence and/or fit). Ways I've seen it done have been things like \"WHile completing my undergraduate degree I also developed the skills to effectively manage my attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Through doing X and Y I was able to effectively engage with modules. THis resulted in an increase in my grades in year 1 from X% to graduating with a Y%.",

Look, it\u2019s kind of a gossip in my family but my brother-in-law got into a perennial top four MBA program in the United States, the number one for Quants (Pretty much guaranteed average salary of like $400,000 plus if you graduate in the top 10% of your class in your first year out of school,) And he was born missing an ear. Sadly, my brother-in-law has not done much with all the opportunity that\u2019s been given to him, but we all kind of feel pretty strongly that he wrote a letter it was very thoughtful and touching and probably warm the cockles of whoever rabbits heart about his struggles being have to and having no ear even though they did do a wonderful job at birth of sort of creating an ear for him out of other tissue, so it\u2019s not as noticeable as just no ear whatsoever. And hey, forget about the aesthetics being half deaf has got to be somewhat of a challenge, to say the least, especially with all the people picking on you all the way through high school maybe even in college for looking a little different and not being the same you know how cruel youngsters can be and yet persevering and making it to that level, now as I stated before I have ADHD I have a reading disorder it\u2019s not the same as what he has Cara but we feel very strongly that he probably talked at the heartstrings of the admissions officer and that\u2019s how he got in or at least it grease the skids for him. Again that\u2019s an American university, the university of Chicago, I can\u2019t speak for European sensibilities, but some schools even have quotas where they have to have a certain amount of \u201chandicap\u201c people even though the lines on a adhd blur as it can be quite a strength too at times, But the bottom line is you still have to persevere a little bit harder, and that might count for something. It\u2019s got to be done with tact I would really think it out, but you should never be ashamed ever",

      "text": "I didnt disclose my adhd until after my initial interview. I wanted them to see what I can do without the judgement that I have adhd and dyslexia. I had an informal interview with my supervisor after my initial interview (which was in front of 3 academics) and he asked me some more questions about myself. I said that I had both disorders and he was more curious then anything and also reassured me that if I need help I can get it as someone in his group previously had dyslexia as well and it wasn't a problem.\n\nI would say that you can disclose it but as some have mentioned it may harm your chances. My mentor at the time told me that he would not put it on his cover letter if it was him but that was my choice to make. If you do disclose it focus heavily on the positive of your disorder and how it gives you an edge over others. If you choose not to disclose it in your cover letter maybe think about mentioning it at a later date if you have the opportunity to as they will most likely find out anyway.",

So you could explain that in the past you struggled with whatever presentation you have, and that it has been much better since you were diagnosed and started medication/therapy but that you're still happily learning how to manage it even better. \n\nIn general though, can I ask why you want them to know? Will you need special arrangements, flexible work hours, do you just want to work in a space where people know...? Etcetera. Many people have well-treated ADHD so if it's the latter you could casually talk about it after you've settled into a job at some point.",

                      "text": "I must tell you orbital Pete, I have been enjoying and rooting for everything that you\u2019ve been saying, makes sense, but I must correct you, ADHD is not really a \u201cmental health\u201d issue. Mental health is a category, at least that precise term, is defined by certain disturbances more along the line of psychosis depression, borderline personality disorder, ADHD is a learning disorder, now I could see how that\u2019s considered mental health in a certain way, but that\u2019s not the vernacular that you use for it I promise you that. Yes, if you pick up the DSM-V It will have ADHD in there but that\u2019s because it has everything in the kitchen sink it\u2019s more about being able to properly diagnose things. But learning disorders and mental health are two different things, at least in America in a clinical psychological setting. I know what you mean though, I\u2019m just giving you a heads up because you sound like someone is very thoughtful and there\u2019s a stigma that\u2019s associated with mental health that I don\u2019t think should be but there is versus learning disorder, at least the stigma\u2018s are perceived differently I should say. Frankly I think people should be phoning whoever they are whatever their struggles are, especially if they\u2019re achieving in life because it just shows how tough they are whether it\u2019s a mental health or a learning disorder. Believe me I\u2019m sure people who have none of these things just as tough and someways, life is a bitch, at least it is it moments for everybody",

          "text": "I\u2019ve got a masters degrees from the best university in the country and let me Telya, having ADHD gave me a leg up, granted I had to take a full-blown IQ test cost $3000 consumed something like 8 to 12 hours of my life few separate visits to a psychologist for a long testing sessions, that was for time and a half on the GMAT, which ironically I never ended up taking, and didn\u2019t really even require the extra time on the practice tests. I would run over every now and again because I have a reading disorder as well and I didn\u2019t even know I had a reading disorder until I took his IQ test, apparently I read slowly even though my comprehension is extremely high, but I\u2019ve had two IQ tests as an eight year old and high schooler, also to establish ADHD I believe, and yet they still made me take one because you have to have one within the last two years. So for formalized testing, there are going to be certain rules. I will tell you that I tried not to lean on it at school but I did let my professors now and my professors were the dean of the departments and one case and sort of the head of the department in the other one but not the dean, And they were very vocal that there were perks if I need it and there were a couple times that I did need it. Look, if you were definitely have it, it\u2019s a real thing, I hate that it\u2019s called ADHD just because I feel like it\u2019s slightly different for everyone but they have to put people into some sort of a group that have a certain way of processing information. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to hide, I don\u2019t think it may hurt you bad at all, I think it\u2019s a very ignorant and Ellen forums person, unless they want to stand and deliver as I have just now based on so many experiences, I\u2019m not actually like a fan of \u201caffirmative action\u201d or whatever, but if it\u2019s the schools policy that they\u2019re more lenient are they give you some advantage for some affliction that you actually suffer from, even though I don\u2019t know if affliction is the right word but it can be harder, there\u2019s times I wish I didn\u2019t have it, why not utilize that? There\u2019s definitely a broader debate to be had about where to draw the line but, as long as there is a line that\u2019s not crossed, push it to the limit\u2026 Best of luck to you\n\nPS, without any context to what was just said, I\u2019m slightly offended, and I\u2019m not easily offended, but I have a funny feeling from this guys response that he really thinks that it means you\u2019re stupid or something or that you\u2019re somehow mentally deficient or retarded or something like that if you struggle with ADHD. Believe you may there a certain trade us, and there are times when I can concentrate for eight hours in a row where other people are burning out if I\u2019m really interested in something, I just fall into the zone, I just can\u2019t pay attention to anything else at those times.\n\nI can tell you that my IQ started in the low 140s range it moved up about eight points as an adult. That\u2019s an average in the range but still, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s defined as stupid per se even though they\u2019re definitely things even in the IQ department where I\u2019m lacking and things where I\u2019m really strong. It all depends. Also there are people who have IQs of 115 to 120\u2019s that I look up to intellectually and admire because they (based on two individuals who weren\u2019t shy) had a level of discipline and all these sort of things that I don\u2019t have sometimes when I want them so I Q means jack crap to me but I hope the presumption is not that are stupid because we have ADHD or that we should be ashamed.

That is why I want to be upfront with it. Do you think US universities would then be a better place to apply?",

Because it\u2019s hard to come in with the top grades when you have something like ADHD. Again, they might require strict documentation to prove that you have it, so if you had a test when you were six years old, they might not find that to be official\u201c but I don\u2019t know your status with regards to that and I don\u2019t know the requirements either. I also don\u2019t know if European root universities are even more lenient. I spent a good portion of my life living all over Europe and I\u2019ve got a tell you, they tend to be more forward thinking than we are so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, I would say it very much depends on the country and especially the University and you just have to research their policies. \n\nI am a fellow jack of all trades as well, and now a master of some, I think if there\u2019s one thing I could tell you that goes against the grain of some people on here it is never ever ever to be ashamed of your humanity and the struggles that are unique to you. As long as you\u2019re empathetic of other peoples struggles, screw anybody who comes at you and tries to tell you that you\u2019re \u201cless than\u201c I thought you should feel ashamed or hide.

Never hide who you are, be proud, it\u2019s a great accomplishment, legally they can\u2019t discriminate against you In America, they only caveat I would tell you is to fill things out in Europe I don\u2019t know how to put my finger to the wind on that one, that\u2019s going to be here especially because Europe is Made up of all these different countries that have completely different cultures or you can just cross right through Walton with a train switch languages three times over on a two hour train ride so, definitely feel your particular school out\u2026 But I say never be a shameful",

They only display it outward but inside they will find any excuse to not help, teach, or get out of dealing with you. They won't say it's because it's your mental issues, they will find any other excuse. Universities only care about the best students...the ones who will make the school money once they graduate. If you have a disability then you are at the bottom.",

      "text": "I am all for reducing stigma about ADHD, and if you want to share your ADHD diagnosis with whomever becomes your Ph.D. advisor, I think it's worth doing.\n\nI see three potential routes for disclosing here. The first would be to disclose once you're starting your program. You can let your advisor know something along the lines of 1) I have ADHD, 2) I'm taking steps to manage it, and 3) there are areas where my symptoms may be apparent and I wanted to give you a heads up / discuss pathways toward my success as a Ph.D. student with ADHD.\n\nThe second option is in the part of your application where, typically, prospective students are asked to explain any personal circumstances that may contextualize past academic performance, etc. You can explain that you have ADHD and (assuming it is true) that it has affected your academic performance in the past. Then, explain the steps you have taken to successfully manage your ADHD. If you go this route, it would be most effective to frame this as something that you are actively managing with some success, rather than something that feels more unresolved (e.g., \"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and that may explain my low grades\"). If you go this route, I highly recommend you have a trusted professor or mentor look through your application materials and provide feedback about the way you frame ADHD.\n\nA third option would be to disclose after you have an offer in place but before you accept it. This reduces the chance for discrimination in the admissions process but allows you to get a sense of how supportive a particular environment would be before committing to a program and advisor. For example, you could ask about what resources the university has to support students with ADHD and talk about your desire to have an advisor who is supportive of students with learning differences.\n\nThere is no one right or wrong answer. Each potential option has its strengths and downsides. Disclosing your ADHD status in your application materials presents some risk of discrimination, but also allows you filter out potential advisors who would not support a student working with ADHD. Disclosing once your get to your Ph.D. program lowers you odds of discrimination in the application process, but means you may be more likely to be with an advisor who is less supportive. Ultimately, you have to decide on the route that is best for you. Best wishes with your application process.",

      "text": "As a non European who did an MSc in western Europe.. they are surprisingly ignorant of ADHD. The attitude here is \"you're a high performer or you aren't\". There are a lot of social systems to support those who \"aren't\", so in school and workplace people don't feel obligated to cater to the individual. \n\nI WOULD NOT recommend mentioning it in your cover letter. Focus on why you want to study X and how your past has prepared you to do great in that PhD project. \n\nHowever, I would mention it elsewhere in the application. Either as an intro, appendix, or note around where you present your grades. \n\nIf you have excellent grades, I wouldn't bring it up at all until you get to know your advisor better.",
