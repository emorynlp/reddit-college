  "text": "Hello,\n\nI have always loved science subjects academically and 12 years since passing high school i still keep an  interest in them. But due to familial pressure and lack of any sort of guidance i ended up doing bachelor's in engineering and worked in the corporates  \n\nalthough bow i am into data science field, i really want to  go back to the field that i am really interested in. I really do tike finance and corporate although i do well in them, but due to lack of interest its very stressful to me .\n\nI am going back to school now for my masters in data science, but is there any way i can change my domain to science fields from corporate finance background? Would pursuing PhD further help in any way?",

      "text": "Data science is a big field in the life sciences at the moment, particularly genomics, and they always need people. If you're doing a master's are there any options for you to do something more science that business focussed at all? Or you could try and get some volunteer experience in a lab - they'd probably love an experienced data scientist.",
