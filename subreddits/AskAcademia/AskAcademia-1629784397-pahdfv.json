  "text": "A question for those who have been in the academy for a while: is it pretty normal for academic positions, including full faculty positions, to not provide a first full paycheck until 2-3 weeks *after* your official appointment start date? Also, is it remotely normal for the appointment start date to be shifted to a later date (in my case, by a week) from what is given in the contract I signed? This was done to every new hire at my new institution, and it seems fishy to me. The original start date would have had us all getting a significant paycheck at the end of this week, but now we all get paid a tiny amount this week and don\u2019t get a full paycheck until two weeks later. And, we never signed new contracts where we agreed to this change.",

          "text": "I\u2019ve been in contact with HR and even the provost of my (relatively small) institution about it. Provost told me it is normal, and part of the reason for my post was to double check that. Both of my previous post-PhD positions actually gave me *two* months pay by the time I started teaching, so I suppose I came in with unusual expectations. However, provost\u2019s last response to me dodged my (explicit) question about the legality of changing our appointment start dates without having us sign new contracts. \n\n\nThis actually isn\u2019t coming from my institution\u2019s admin directly though- it\u2019s at the level of the university system my institution falls within. The reason given for the shift is to make our appointment start dates line up with the beginning of a pay period. Since the original dates were in the middle of the period, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten full paychecks this Friday anyhow, but it would have been enough to help a lot. Now, all we get on Friday is pay for two orientation days, which doesn\u2019t even cover my half of the September rent for the apartment I share with my SO. I\u2019m lucky that she can wait for me to pay her back.\n\nWhat may still be the fault of the admin at my institution is failing to notify us about this until last week, *after* our original appointment start dates. At this point, these are issues that I\u2019ll ultimately end up discussing with the faculty union I\u2019m joining. It\u2019s become clear I will get nowhere on my own.",

              "text": "Paying in arrears is pretty much standard for all jobs, academia included. You get paid for the work you did, not the work you might do in future. \n\nShifting the dates is iffy - especially if you've already started working. Legally they have to pay you for the time you worked. And telling you after you started definitely isn't ok. \n\nAlongside your union, you may want to consult an employment lawyer who can advise you of your rights and help you craft emails with the right language to HR. Unions are generally good but sometimes useless (especially if you're a woman). \n\nLastly, you can ask for an advance on your pay. They aren't obliged to give it to you but many places will. It does mean you then don't get paid later though.",

The \u2018moving allowances\u2019 I and other new hires get are not being paid to us until a full 30 days after our modified (not original) appointment start dates, coming with our second paychecks instead of our first ones. The main contract promises payment of those \u2018within the first month\u2019 of employment, and they decided to literally push the limit of that as much as possible. Given that they made us sign a promissory note saying that we\u2019ll repay the allowance if we leave the job in 6 months or less, it baffles me that they would insist on giving that to us at the very last minute. \n,",
