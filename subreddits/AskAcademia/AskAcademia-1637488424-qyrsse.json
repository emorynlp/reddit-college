              "text": "Well I only tried Nvivo for a short period and it didn't seem intuitive. I switched to atlas after that (I was kind weighing up the two ) and actually seems to be pretty straightforward. It was certainly quicker to dive into.  But I never mastered Nvivo fully so it's hard to give a proper comparison. \n\nThe function for making complex code searches seems  a bit uncecessarily complex (reverse polish notation rather than Boolean search ), but I presume it's just a bit more powerful, and I can more or less do what I want with it. \n\nThere are something things that could be more streamlined with less clicks (like choosing a code )  but nothing too terrible ! In a way both tools  kind of reminds me of SPSS , where to be honest the UI just isn't a well thought out as more popular software like Photoshop or word. To some extent I wonder if this is just what happens with niche software where there isn't as much development time invested. \n\nWhat I'd really like is an open source  tool that just does the basics and does them really well.  Seems like qualitative coding software development focuses a lot on adding complex features.  But I don't have much need for these. I just want to code and then run basic  queries - I'd love something that did that in the most streamlined way possible.",

First of all, we couldn't make sense of the UI, and on top of that either she or I had the program freeze when we were working together in the same room, so we had these 10 minutes restarts of our computers in the middle of things over and over.\n\nWe returned back to paper and pen + Word and Excel because it just wasn't worth the time suck.\n\nWe are now in the process of applying for a new grant, and we need to include the estimated cost for software. I will definitely look into alternatives like Atlas. (I just thought NVivo was the only go-to, like the qualitative version of SPSS/SAS.)",

I might be wrong but I think atlas offer a 30 day free trial. \n\nI've never had stability issues with atlas, and it recovers from system crashes pretty well. I've not worked on multi-coder projects though , but it seems to have a feature set for that. \n\nI learnt to uses it with my thesis , so it's hard to seperate the experience of learning to code from the experience of learning atlas. But it honestly didn't feel like a time suck to learn.  It's one of those prices of software where you really don't have to understand all the features to use it. There's definately bits I still don't understand , but these are things I don't really seem to have a need for, and not knowing them doesn't get in the way of the bits I do use.",

For instance, in Canada, Indigenous knowledge is so vast and informative but we do not validate it because according to Western scientific standards, it is immeasurable. And I am Indigenous myself so it is difficult to find this type of knowledge and practices in mainstream research that comes from an Indigenous lens and not Western practices. Just my experience :)",

Zotero), but it doesn't seem like people have put in the time to make it really great. For example, I would appreciate a feature that mitigates the \"curve of forgetting\".
