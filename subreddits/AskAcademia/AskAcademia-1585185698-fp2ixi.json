  "title:": "Celebrating my graduating seniors",
  "text": "I am teaching an undergrad class this semester, more than half of which are graduating seniors. They have been struggling to come to terms with a stolen college experience as a result of the pandemic. Many are nervous about graduating into recession and are anxious about their future (and rightly so). Do you have any suggestions for something we can do online as a group to celebrate their accomplishment and their journey through the last four years of college? If you have suggestions for tasks or fun activities (or any other thoughts on the subject), please share. \n\nI understand some may think the disappointment of not- being- able- to -have- a -usual -senior -year experience as a serious enough problem , especially when we compare this to other relatively \"bigger\" challenges in the current crisis (such as loss of life, layoffs, compromised healthcare systems, etc.) . I may not have control over other people's circumstances , but I want to do my bit to raise my students' morale.",

You went home of spring break expecting to come back and see dear friends who you've weathered the past four years with, and now you're not sure when the next time you'll see them is.\"\n\nAcknowledge their anxieties.  \"The economy is uncertain, it seems as if our whole way of life is uncertain.  But if there's one truth, it's that we need good people to do good work.  Your opportunity to change the world, even for one other person, is out there. You'll find it.\"\n\nLet them know that it's okay to have these feelings. \"I know some of you feel guilty feeling this way when the world seems faced by these other problems. It's okay to feel disappointed and anxious for yourself.\"\n\nEncourage them to grind on. \"For most of us, our duty to society is to minimize our risk of catching the virus and transmitting it. During this time, do what you can to take advantage of every minute. Do yoga, take a walk, work on those projects you've always wanted to do, read Marie Kondo and organize your socks. Make someone's day better--call one person, every day, until we get out of lockdown. Read something, every day. This is it. We have one life. There's so much we can't change or control. That makes it so much more important not to squander what we can control. *It is up to us.\"*",

              "text": "I agree, to an extent. I think hearing some kind words from professors has been helpful for me, but saying all that the first comment said would strike me as hollow and out of touch with reality.\n\nAll my peers are in serious grief right now over losing a pivotal part of their young adult lives, with no guarantee of a secure future. I think that my professors who have handled this best have done the following:\n\n- They didn't mince words. This sucks. This is really, really terrible. Don't say it's a challenge, a difficulty, a bump in the road. I know fellow students who are homeless, who are going back to abusive families, whose visas are going to be revoked, etc. Saying that this is a little bit tough sounds patronizing to us, as well as uninformed.\n- Instead of starting off with advice, they asked me how I was, if I was okay at home, how my family was, how I was feeling, so on. One professor of mine asked us to, if we were comfortable, write her a brief 'oral history' about how we feel right now, for her own knowledge. She asked us what we've lost, what we're angry about, and what we're thinking about. I thought that was nice, and used it as a space to basically dump out all my feelings. Another professor had a Zoom call with my class and let us use a whole lesson to talk about how we wanted to move forward and how we were feeling. We showed each other our pets and our homes and talked about how reading the news was depressing and scary. She gave us some good tips, helped us laugh a little, and sent us some friendly emails after it was over.\n\nI promise you, OP, if you write an email that's filled with platitudes and distancing, your students are either not going to read it or are going to read it and be pissed. We're humans, and we all have relationships to one another. Be authentic. Be kind. Don't tell people to find the silver lining, because for many of us, there is none. Don't tell us to make the most of our 'free time,' because a lot of us are fighting depression and isolation. Yes, if you want to share things that have helped you, that's fine, but you have to make sure it doesn't come off as preachy. Instead of saying \"make the most of your time\" or \"go outside every day, call someone every day,\" you could say \"I've been finding that, for me, sewing has been a really nice way to take my mind off things for a little while, and I'd be happy to send you all some templates if any of you are interested,\" or \"I thought this podcast was pretty funny and I listened to it while I took a walk outside, maybe it'd help you too.\"\n\nI didn't intend this to be a wall of text, and I'm sorry if I seem rude. What I'm really trying to say is, I know you're all well-meaning, and I want to tell you how to make that clear to your students, instead of seeming impersonal. This is my experience, I hope it helps.\n\nEdited to add: OP, and everyone else in this thread, I just want to thank you all for being so considerate and trying to do right by your students. It really is appreciated.",

Even just little things, like attaching a photo of a pet to an otherwise formal email, or emailing students individually instead of as a group, can make all the difference.\n\nI think people are really craving emotional intimacy right now, and so any sort of distance stings much more than it normally would. I wouldn't be upset over a formal email normally, but during times like these, from a professor I've spent several months studying with and getting to know? Yeah, it hurts. We often talk in school about building relationships with your professors, especially when you want to work with them or network via them, so when that effort and interest isn't reciprocated, it feels kind of like a betrayal.\n\nI think the flip side of this is, if you want to know how your students are, you have to lead by example. Some of my emails from my professors have just started off with them describing what they did that day, and then getting down to class-related things, but that first little note really helps to relax your students and make them more comfortable with sharing about themselves.\n\nI don't think you need to overthink it; rather, try to think about how you might chat with a student before a lecture or during office hours, or maybe just pretend like you're talking to a friend for a paragraph or two. A good friend to whom you might say \"this is a complete clusterf**k and I'm as baffled and confused as you are,\" not a polite acquaintance!",

Your point about checking in and asking how people are doing is good and acknowledging that this isn't easy for anyone is noted.\n\nI guess I would ask people (especially students) to keep in mind that if people are well-meaning, don't be overly cynical if their words don't say exactly say it how you want to hear it.  \"I know this isn't how you thought the year would end,\" and \"this sucks\" aren't that far apart in context if they are genuine.  Communications to students are also a touchy issue...most junior faculty and TAs often feel they can't say exactly what they want to say while observing professional boundaries and expectations of decorum.  If I could use my own unvarnished voice, I'd absolutely open the email to students with, \"This fucking blows\" but I can't.",

I think I may be biased in that I've had several professors with whom I do have a relationship where they're comfortable being very unvarnished, and so I tend to expect that now from other professors. As I said in another comment, I also think that this is a time where any sort of perceived distance from a professor can seem much colder than it would normally. Either way, I'm glad that everyone in this thread is trying to think about how they can communicate how they're feeling in a way that's both comfortable for them and also effective.",

Of course, we can send a personal note to students (and I do as appropriate) but most messages sent to students need to be substantially the same (even if emailed individually).\n\nI agree that the distance and professional decorum can be perceived as a negative, but other students will view any perceived breaches in professional standards very negatively. There are also really well-documented biases against female and minority faculty in terms of teaching evaluations, command of the room, etc. Things that students respond well to from, say, a white male  (\"Call me by my first name\") can be seen as highly unprofessional when non-white, non-male professors do the same (e.g. [https://tcf.org/content/commentary/student-evaluations-skewed-women-minority-professors/?agreed=1](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/student-evaluations-skewed-women-minority-professors/?agreed=1)).  I can see many faculty really hesitating to show pictures of their cats or kids because it could undermine their credibility and hurt their teaching evaluations (which are critical for us). As with so many things, a lot of actions on the faculty side are limited by the worst 5% of students...the ones who send abusive emails, who lodge bogus complaints, etc etc. Unfortunately, this ties our hands a bit and prevents us from interacting with most students the way we'd like to.",

This discussion is helping me be more empathetic with my professors who've been writing to me in many different styles.\n\nYou're absolutely right that formality is a huge deal in academia, and that non-white, non-male professors are at a disadvantage; in fact, right before school ended, my sociolinguistics class did a whole unit on politeness, and one of our topics was professionalism and email writing and how they intersect with identity. I should know better than to be so prescriptive, so thank you for reminding me to be aware of that as well.\n\nI also come from a very small liberal arts school, and in writing my first response, I completely ignored the existence of larger schools with class sizes bigger than 20 people!

Even though I have an offer from a company to join them in June but I am still skeptical about this whole issue and don't know whether we will be able to join at all. But I understand that its life and we gotta stay strong to fight this off. I believe if I can come out of this situation mentally then I can come out of anything. I try to see light at the end of the tunnel. Explaining undergrad students might be a little tough but they will understand.",

She said it was because she remembers taking her last final, turning it in, walking out to her car, and college being over, and that\u2019s it. She then went on to say a few nice things about those she knew well. Wish I remembered her name to give credit where it\u2019s due. When it\u2019s my turn to teach I will be stealing this idea.",

      "text": "It might be super simple, but how about hosting an online happy-hour or social event? I was invited to join a new research group this week, and we started with an evening zoom meeting. Everyone had some sort of beverage - alcoholic or not - and we all toasted each other virtually and everyone talked a little bit about what their lives are like now and how their day was. Maybe with seniors it would be a good chance to let each of them have a chance to talk about what their last semester has turned into, what they're planning to do next, what challenges they're each facing, etc. It would depend on your students and your relationships with them, of course. I found our online happy hour to be a lot more satisfying than I expected, so it might work out for your students. They might at least recognize it as a gesture that you hear them and care about what they're going through.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I find it so frustrating how many posts and comments I've seen and heard that people should quit complaining and just be grateful - \"At least students aren't be drafted instead of having of their senior year!\" \"You might be working 18-hour days now, but you should just be grateful you have a job!\" \"Your wedding might have been cancelled, but you should just be happy you have a safe place to go home to!\" I think that practicing gratitude is incredibly important and we should remember to be grateful, but that doesn't mean we don't also have room to remember that all of this *does* suck. The \"get over it, it could be worse!\" attitude is so damaging, especially in a global scenario where everyone has a reason to grieve, to be anxious, and to feel down. I think your students will really appreciate a real, personal opportunity to see that their professor cares about the things that are hard for them right now.",
