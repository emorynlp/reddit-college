  "title:": "Practical aspects for Europeans applying for postdoc/faculty positions in the US",
  "text": " I am contemplating applying for postdoc positions in the social and biomedical sciences in the US in a couple of years. Specifically, either sociology, public health, or epidemiology. I am uncertain of the specific steps involved and the order of the administrative documentation. I hope this is the right forum and would be happy for input.\n\nSpecifically, I am uncertain about:\n\n1. Visa category?\n2. How to apply for postdocs?\n3. The order of all administrative documents involved; do you first apply for a visa or postdoc?\n4. Am I missing other requirements?\n\nI am not sure whether it matters, but I can add that I am a Norwegian citizen. I would first apply for a postdoc, so the move would be temporary, however, I may apply for faculty positions at a later point if I continue with a postdoc in Norway. I guess permanent positions sets off additional requirements as the move would be more indefinite compared to postdocs. Comments regarding these requirements would be appreciated for a more comprehensive assessment of options, and I believe it could benefit others interested in the same topic.",

      "text": "1. H1B and J1 are the most common VISAs for postdocs in the US. H1B is work-related, whereas J1 is considered a temporary visitor (Ie, not leading to being a permanent resident in the USA).  J1 is often easier/cheaper to get, but often includes the Home Residency Requirement. This can be waived later with the right paperwork, but can be a hassle. Each is \\~3 years to start, and can be easily extended.   \n*-tl;dr - Go for the H1B if possible.*\n2. Websites like Nature Jobs are useful for this. Also reaching out to PIs individually to inquire about availability in their labs. Have your CV ready, and some idea of research projects doesn't hurt.\n3. Have the job lined up before going through the VISA process. Makes life easier as you can connect with Immigration services at the university. \n4. Up-to-date passport, have your PhD/other schooling/transcripts accredited, etc. Mental preparation for the crazy politics and health issues that is the US.",
