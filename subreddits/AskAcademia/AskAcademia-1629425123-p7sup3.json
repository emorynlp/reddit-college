  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI study MBA, we have 5 semesters in this program, 4 of which are normal semesters which includes classes, homework, midterm exams etc. and the last one has some classes but also has the thesis writing.\n\nRight now I\u2019m approaching the final semester where I write my thesis and I\u2019m so nervous, I still haven\u2019t contacted my supervisor yet because the semester hasn\u2019t started yet, so please forgive me if my questions sound so basic:\n\n- I had a topic in mind but I don\u2019t know if I can finish my thesis in only one semester, is it possible to finish in 3 months? \n\n- What is the level language or wording the thesis is supposed to be? Is there any book/manual where I can see the preferable method? \n\n- If you have been in a similar program with a similar structure, what was your routine? How long were you writing each day? Did you found it hard to keep your grades up in the other classes while writing your thesis?",

If there is work you can do ahead of time, do it. Questionnaires can have draft versions already written, you can do reading etc. \n\n> What is the level language or wording the thesis is supposed to be? Is there any book/manual where I can see the preferable method? \n\nClear, formal writing. Avoid contractions (*isn't*, *haven't* etc). Avoid modifiers like *incredibly*, or *amazingly* although things like *interestingly* and *surprisingly* can be used in moderation. Humour should be kept to a minimum. Don't try to shock and amaze - it's not clickbait. \n\nWhat do you want to know? What do other people say? What does your evidence say? What conclusions can you come to?  - that's the basic structure you'll follow, although some parts will be multiple chapters. \n\nHonestly, just try to sound like things you've read on the topic. It's fairly normal to write a first draft and then delete bits out of it and that's fine. Writers waffle - editors remove waffle. \n\n> How long were you writing each day? \n\nEveryone is different. I'm a \"hammer it out over the weekends\" person. Some people can do little and often. \n\n> Did you found it hard to keep your grades up in the other classes while writing your thesis?\n\nNo, actually. Time management is important in business and in academia, so if you have deadlines that are close together you just need to prioritize or do bits of all of them at once.\n\nGood luck with it all!",
