  "title:": "How does teaching high school compare to teaching at unranked SLAC?",
  "text": "Currently teaching high school and thinking about going back to grad school to ultimately teach college. I know the job market is rough in humanities and assume I\u2019ll end up at an unranked SLAC even coming from, let\u2018s say, a top 20 graduate program.\n\nI\u2018m curious about how the quality of students at these schools compares to the average high school student. I\u2019m thinking that they\u2019re about the same, since an average high school student would generally end up at an average undergrad. And unfortunately I feel that many of my average students don\u2019t have the maturity, discipline, or skills for college even by the end of HS.\n\nDo you find yourself often needing to employ high school-like pedagogy and techniques? e.g. hand-holding, graphic organizers, exam retakes, throwing kids out of class due to disruption, curtailing constant talking and phone use, etc?",

      "text": "Teaching at a shitty SLAC may be a poor decision for reasons you haven\u2019t considered. Because of the declining birth rates, especially after the 2008 recession, college enrollment is actually projected to go downwards over the next decade. Obviously, schools like Amherst, Williams, Colby, etc. will not face a big problem, since they\u2019ll always be sought-after, competitive schools. However, the lower tier schools will literally run out of students to admit, and many of them will close down. This process has already started, actually, and the 2008 kids aren\u2019t even college-aged yet. So you may be able to get your PhD or whatever, and you may even land that job at Bumfuck College, but there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t be able to keep it. Just a thought. Best of luck.",

I would assume that you won't get a full-time job right away, and that you'll most likely have to adjunct, given just how bad the market for humanities Ph.D.s is. Even if you come out of a top 20 school.  Your top 20 school isn't training you to be a teacher, anyway. They're training you to be an academic.\n\nIf you really want to \"just teach,\" you'll be better off getting a master's degree and considering community college.  Your odds might be slightly better.\n\nEither way, it's a crapshoot, and going to the best school is in no way a guarantee that you'll land any kind of job at a 4-year institution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo your other questions, I've had to go as far as banning cell phones and computers from the classroom.  And students **still** use them.  Sadly, the American college student looks very much like the American High School student. I've taught at large state schools and small private SLACs and honestly, *in general*, there's no real difference in the quality of students overall.  Everywhere has their all-stars, their C-is-a-degree floaters, and those who really shouldn't be in college at all. YMMV.",

There's still so much of an attitude that it's \"lesser than\" that you could find yourself easily dropped from long lists (which is to say nothing of the fact that it's a different skill set and unfair to so many CC students who deserve faculty who are committed to them and their context).",

We're in a liberal state with a strong teacher's union and good teacher benefits. I'm also at a unionized campus.\n\nRight now, I make significantly more than my partner, but not a LOT more. My salary is like 30% higher than his (and I have been at my job for 8 years, while he has been at his for only 2). Yes, I can get grants funded for summer salary and significantly increase my salary right now, but grants are very hard to get and I have a lab and grad students to keep funded, meaning my personal summer salary is often at the end of my list of funding priorities.\n\nThe big difference is my partner's benefits: he will have a state funded pension when he retires, which is well-funded and stable, while I just have a 401k and whatever personal contributions I can make. His tenure is easy to get (just based on amount of time) and he'll get a salary bump when he finishes his master's.\n\nAnother person said this as well, but really think about just moving to a state that has better teacher benefits / support. With what you propose, you're not looking at a significantly better salary, you're looking at significantly *worse* job prospects, and working on a PhD you'd be spending years earning *nothing* and losing what are likely really good retirement benefits from being a teacher.\n\nEdit: clarification",

Are you willing to move around every couple years to do this? \n\nI know you are asking about the quality of students, but I guess I would just hate you to leave a steady job and find yourself disappointed. Many adjunct jobs don't even require a PhD anymore and are hiring Masters students or those with x graduate credits, or even those still in grad school. So you could always see if doing a part time grad degree is possible, or maybe even see if you can shadow a SLAC instructor and see how they teach? I think there are other ways to get a feel of if this is the right kind of job for you before jumping into a grad program. Just my thoughts though!",

      "text": "Everyone else has spoken to the shit job prospects, so I won\u2019t add to that. But in terms of actual teaching, in high school, students are not actually less mature than a freshman or sophomore in college, but their immaturity is more of your problem because they are legally children and you\u2019re responsible for their general welfare. I taught hs for one year after grad school and that was one of the biggest issues for me\u2014 I just wasn\u2019t used to being responsible for my students. There were little issues, like my students having to ask to use the bathroom which feels very creepy to me, and then bigger issues, like going on a field trip and having to walk individual students to their rides so they don\u2019t run away or get kidnapped. I had never heard the phrase \u201cduty of care,\u201d and I didn\u2019t know anything about classroom management (which maybe answers your question about how often you have to employ high school-level pedagogical techniques in college\u2014not often). That was a weird learning curve and something I would never like to go back to. \n\nThat being said, high school students are more fun, and you get to know them a bit better as people, but unless you have an exceptional student, they don\u2019t have the exposure or skillset to have really interesting ideas (this can be rare at the college level too, just to be clear). Because of this, I prefer teaching adults, but I really enjoyed working with high school students once I figured out what the fuck I was doing. \n\nYou would also have a considerable leg up as a former hs teacher, as most grad students never actually learn any real pedagogical skills. I was blown away by how little I knew about teaching compared to my colleagues, and I actually had gone out of my way to take education courses as a TA. I was fortunate to have a really collaborative environment (which is not emphasized much in the humanities in higher Ed), so I learned a ton, but I think the transition is more challenging the way I did it\u2014i.e. it\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d in many respects to go from teaching high school to college than the other way around.",
