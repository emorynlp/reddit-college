      "text": "They don't have to be mutually exclusive. Infact they can be complementary. A good paper increase the chances of getting better scholarships, student grants or extensions to an existing grant. Conversely, if a student has a grant/scholarship, they don't have to worry about managing finances, and can therefore concentrate on their work, which in turn can result in quality output.\n\nEdit: Sorry i didn't read the description, just the title.\n\nI don't recall any Journals giving awards to the papers. Best you can hope for is getting your work published as a featured paper, or in the best case scenario, get your paper featured on the cover of the journal.\n\nYou usually receive awards if you present your work at conferences or colloquiums. And those, sorry to break it to you do not carry much weight. They maybe a little useful in the long run when you're applying for a job or if you've gotten an academic job, they may help to fast track the tenure process. But as a student they're not of much consequence other than acknowledgement of your good presentation skills.\n\nAwards at the conferences are adjudged on various factors, and not just the content of the presentation, including but not limited to the presentation skill, relevance to the broader theme of the conference etc. For example my precious work was on pattern recognition, and i was working on OCR for Perso-Arabic script. I presented my work at an IEEE International conference, and it was awarded best paper. I was a bit surprised myself, because i had seen other works that were much more complex. So I asked one of the judges.. Why me?\nHe said your work was more in line with the theme of the conference. It turns out the theme of that year's conference was \"cultural adaptation and technology\". So my work may not have been necessarily the best, but it best encompassed the broader theme of the conference.\n\nThe point is conference awards are adjudged based on various factors and not just the quality of the work, that's why these awards don't carry much weight in academic circles. But that doesn't mean they're entirely useless. These awards are well received in corporate sector, if you choose to go that way after your PhD.",

          "text": "Thanks for the detailed response! This gives me a lot to chew on. If you don't mind talking further about a few points, it might give me some further clarity. From what you said, it sounds like awards can help with getting hired and promoted, which sounds to me to be quite a boon. Or do things not work this way?\n\nI'm surprised to hear that the awards are received well in the corporate sector. Could you please expand on this point? Is it because the awards set you apart or is it because people in corporate put more weight on such symbols?\n\nYou spoke in depth about the impact of paper awards, and it was all very insightful. It makes me curious about the equivalent scholarships side too. ...Do scholarships count for anything in the long run besides helping with finances during grad school?\n\nThanks!",

Could you please expand on this point? Is it because the awards set you apart or is it because people in corporate put more weight on such symbols?\n\nI'm not in the corporate sector, therefore i can not comment on something i don't know about. But my understanding is that PR is a major part of the corporate work engine, and having member with medals and stuff is a good PR opportunity. \n\n\"meet our team, Ms. Karen, PhD (gold medalist)\" sounds better than \"Karen\". \n\nAnother reason maybe that the HR in a corporate sector may not be privy to the nuances of academia, and therefore put higher value on these awards. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe someone familiar with the corporate culture can shed some light on it. \n\n>Do scholarships count for anything in the long run besides helping with finances during grad school?\n\nUsually there are limited number of scholarships/grants available and thus a serious competition to get one. The applications go through multiple stages of vigorous scrutiny and only a handful of applicants qualify for the fellowship - ergo cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. And if you are among those handful, you have stamped your mark as the best of the lot. And this translates into recognition of the recipient's academic prowess.",

I'm not saying they're not important but by their very nature they are for relatively small accomplishments so don't carry the kind of weight a senior prize does. They're good for demonstrating your talent and providing tangible evidence of your achievements but also tend to lose value as you step up to the next level eg a PhD prize of some description is helpful for getting a postdoc but less so after that. Not valueless but less helpful than in getting the postdoc.",
