      "text": "Not being funny, but undergrads are not really taught how to write for publication. It is highly likely it is therefore possible to cut down rather than split into two (as I suspect it really doesn\u2019t feel like it at the moment).\n\nTips:\n1. What is the exact hypothesis/conclusion? Work back from there to your intro. Eliminate anything that doesn\u2019t fall on that critical path. This should remove huge swathes.\n2. You probsbly don\u2019t need as much explanation as you gave for thesis. You have to prove you know stuff in the thesis, in a paper you can simply assert a statement and cite the papers that prove it.\n3. Most students\u2019 stuff I read is waffly. It takes years to get good at writing concisely, and even then it takes ages and multiple rewrites. Rewrite and rewrite, you will see word count come down.\n4. Best tip I can recommend for style and readability as well as reducing word count: read it aloud. If it doesn\u2019t sound right when saying it, it probably doesn\u2019t read right either. Again, through this process you will identify sections where you\u2019ve repeated yourself, or you\u2019ve waffled on without making a point. Delete or sharpen up those bits; word count comes down.\n\nHope that helps :-)",
