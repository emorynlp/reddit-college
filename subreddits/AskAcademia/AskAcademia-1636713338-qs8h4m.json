  "title:": "Two-body problem. Is it acceptable and helpful for my future advisor to help with the possible recruiting of my partner (in a different department)?",
  "text": "I am a graduating Ph.D. student and have a postdoc offer from an institution. At the same time my partner is very passionate partner about wanting to return to academia and do a PhD. Unfortunately, I had to look for jobs and soon make a decision before she can even apply to schools.\n\nMy prospective advisor is quite passionate about wanting to recruit me and has offered to look into the situation for my partner and see if they can be of any help. My partner would be applying among other places at the same institution but different departments.\n\nI know academia has been understanding with the two-body problem but the timing asynchrony now is a bit unconventional. We are not applying and deciding at the same time. So given that I have to make a decision independently of my partner, my main concern is around how interfering might negatively or positively affect her application. The main question is if it is going to look bad to their prospective PI if the inner workings of that institution somehow try to account for our two-body problem or if it might be helpful (without fully violating the meritocracy of the evaluation process)?",

      "text": "This is an unusual situation in a few ways, which makes it hard to know how it will go. However, I think having your advisor vouch for your partner might be somewhat helpful. Most of the time, the grad applicant pool has a few clear admits, a large number of clear rejects, and a fairly large number of applicants who are acceptable. The committee then has to decide, largely arbitrarily, who out of that third group to take. If your partner ends up in this third group, and they know that your partner will attend if accepted, they may accept her just because the certainty makes their job easier. I also don\u2019t think it will look bad to your partner\u2019s prospective PI. But there\u2019s certainly no guarantee that your partner will get in. I would ask your advisor exactly what he/she plans to do to help your partner, and whether he/she knows anyone in that department.",

Especially given our/my low leverage status, both in terms of job position and the fact that I have to form my decision right now. But also for the sake of being reasonable. I think the best-case scenario would be something like just avoid a clear reject due to some arbitrary threshold that usually committees have to enforce for minimizing the size of the pool of applicants",

About a year in to her job, when she knew the place but didn't \"know\",s he told me she was shocked at how many couples there were and her plans to instigate a policy to prevent people starting here and their partner joining shortly after. I nearly laughed in her face. That was 3 years ago. No sign of the policy. \n\nI know in the US finding a job for a partner is sometimes explicitly part of the package. In the UK you can't generally do that, but organisations are sympathetic and often when a suitable job comes up the partner will have to apply but they're in a good position. I will say we have actually dismissed someone in the past for rigging a job so that it was graded higher than needed and put in such specific requirements only their wife met the criteria. So it's not a free for all. You have to follow the rules.",

But, more likely there are faculty that would appreciate a colleague directly vouching for someone to aid in the selection process.\n\nI did at post-doc at a medical center and asked my advisor to help my spouse with a clinical internship.  He set up some meetings and evidently someone told my spouse directly, don't think you are getting special treatment just because you know Dr. XXX.  She went elsewhere because of that interaction, but I later found out that person was just particularly prickly and that everyone else really liked her and she would have had the position.\n\nOverall, though, I think the benefits outweigh the risks.

      "text": "This depends on whether your partner is looking for a postdoc or job, in which case your PI can help you identify opportunities and informational interviews, or whether she is looking for admission to a graduate school program in which case you're asking for her to have priority over someone else that would otherwise be in that slot. It is appropriate for you to ask your PI about helping to identify jobs or postdocs to which she could apply if they are in the same or a related field, but it would raise eyebrows if you're asking to be pushed towards the front of the line for admissions, and it will be difficult for them to do so if the field is different. Also, in general people are more willing and also more able to address two-body problems if the partner is a spouse rather than a partner. I have been in this situation before, from the professor side, and prospective postdocs have asked for guidance for their spouse for applying to grad school and jobs, but not to help get them accepted, to which I would have said absolutely not. If someone from another department asked us to take a special look at a graduate application because of their prospective postdoc's spousal situation, we would definitely ignore it and it would look negative on that prof for asking us to give them special treatment. For context, our acceptance rate is extremely low. If your spouse is interested in a program with high acceptance rates, things might be different. You can talk to your PI but tread carefully.",

          "text": ">f someone from another department asked us to take a special look at a graduate application because of their prospective postdoc's spousal situation, we would definitely ignore it and it would look negative on that prof for asking us to give them special treatment.\n\nThanks for the feedback! We are on a spousal kind of situation. It's good to know the diversity of approaches that institutions could take and I agree with you on many fronts.\n\nTo justify the reason I am considering this: \\[others have pointed this out\\] the evaluation process doesn't only have to do with an applicants skills but also the possibility that the applicant will utilize the offer the institution will potentially make. Universities want to minimize opportunity cost. Knowing that an applicant is likely to come, probably marks them higher in terms of aggregate evaluation points. This shouldn't change the merit-based evaluation part, but should it favor such an applicant? I think yes.\n\nI believe merit is excluded from big part of the evaluation process. Institutions utilize heuristics and strict cutoffs that have zero predictiveness for actual success just for the sake of simplifying the decision process. I think we have seen online all those motivational anecdotes or stories of Boltzman, Einstein or Mendel being rejected for stupid (today) reasons. Not claiming that my partner is Einstein, but we shouldn't also claim applicant evaluation line is ideal. To me it looks more like the first round of squid games. The cutoffs are arbitrary and doing what you can to survive this part is quite reasonable. Again especially in the context of considering that the payoff keeping a family together. Which is at the best interest for both the family and the institution\n\nI don't disagree though that entering special favor kind of territory is not acceptable",
