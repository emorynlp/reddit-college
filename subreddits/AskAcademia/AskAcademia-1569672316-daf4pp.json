  "text": "I'm referring to a growing trend where universities are churning graduates without any regard for jobs or educational achievement. Equally frightening is this over-reliance on International students, solely for the money they can charge them. \n\n\nIt feels thats universities have stopped becoming higher education centres and are profit generating businesses. \n\n\nDo you agree and if so which country are you referencing?",

United States.\n\nOn the one hand, academic ideals were perhaps a bit too idealistic; after all, somebody does have to pay to keep universities running. \n\nAs I see it (which may not be especially well) there are 3 problems. \n\n1. Students who just want jobs and don't care about learning. They just want to pay for a certificate.\n\n2. Administration should not be separate from faculty. Some admin is necessary, but when people talk about a university, they often mean the administration.... They should mean the faculty and students but the power has been taken (and perhaps given) away from them. Students should take more responsibility for things like housing, while faculty, the same people who teach, should be making many of the decisions presidents or provosts do. \n\n3. State governments who don't properly fund institutions who then have to take business like approaches to keep the lights on.",

Most of my cohort went to college and surprise! no jobs. Some went and got basic jobs to lick their wounds and pay back debt. Some went to trade school, which was for some reason stigmatized despite being the good jobs we were seeking in the first place. Some, like me, went on to graduate school. Through hard work, I don't have any student loan debt, which is good because every business in my state that isn't an academic institution is terrified of hiring a Ph.D. and the schools don't want me because I'm from this state.",

I'm in a low-income state where most people make less than $40k per year and people with Ph.D. degrees are considered to be philanthropically rich in general, mostly because the vast majority of those that live here never encounter someone with an advanced degree. I'm in the USA, Canada may be different.  \n\n\nFor the second point, I've talked to about 4 universities in the state, public and private. All of them expressed that they prefer hiring professors from other states or countries because there's a blanket belief that all universities in the state are teaching basically the same things and they want new ideas. I've known exactly two professors total that were hired in the same state in which they were educated. Both were considered exceedingly lucky and it was noted that they did post-docs in other states or countries, so the university felt they might still have new ideas. This mentality even held true for a university with almost no publishing/research pressure on its faculty.   \n\n\nAs someone that went to graduate school for personal reasons, I would HIGHLY encourage you to shadow people in your desired field before ever even applying to graduate school. Find out the dirt, the nitty-gritty, the nasty side of whatever it is you think you want to do. I thought I wanted to be a professor, but it turns out that most professors (at least in my field of study) spend 90% of their either terrorizing students for data or writing the grants in which they want to use said data. The funding rate, last time I checked, was around 4%. I'm not a grant-writer and that isn't the career I wanted, so now I'm working a low-paying state job until I find something local that pays better. I'm location bound for family reasons and not willing to move states for a post-doc position to extort me or for a job that only provides monetary benefits.",

I saw how well this can work during a recent controversy that required authoritative criticism of the administration. Student criticism was too easily dismissed, given 1) they have no significant role in university governance and 2) a quarter of them leave every year. Staff are loathe to air criticism publicly, given the perceived precariousness of university employment. (There's a huge variation across schools on that point.) So the faculty become the \"guardians of the mission\", but unfortunately I've only seen that at times of crisis.\n\nIt was interesting reading the minutes of the most recent all-faculty meeting. There was this sudden realization that they shouldn't be delegating power to deans, provosts, and presidents, that the first and last word needs to come from the faculty body, especially on the question of what standards are set for who the school accepts money from and whether it's acceptable to them that those standards might mean a scaling back of ambitions, financial aid, etc.",

But seriously, I don't have the money to waste. I had to drop out twice because I couldn't get a student loan without a cosigner for so long. I was even denied a third time before what was supposed to be the final year. But for once in my life, I was able to get the hours at the summer job I picked up to work out with school. I didn't have night classes available, so I had to quit the jobs I picked up when I was forced to stop school before. But I was finally able to brute force my way through with a job while in school. I am still bitter and spiteful from what I had to go through last year because of that. I nearly killed myself on my commute from the sleep deprivation! It's taken me 8 and a half years to finish this goddamn degree because of that (even with 2 years of community college and transferring to the local state school). I don't have the time or money to care about learning topics completely unrelated to my degree. Anthropology and music history are completely worthless to me. It's useful to some people (I'm not saying the entire field is worthless, as it is useful for stuff other people care about), but not for me. And they cost me time and money, so I get negative use.\n\nNow, I don't hate learning. I generally like my classes for my major (mechanical engineering). I took quantum physics for fun because I had a choice of linear algebra or quantum physics and I already did linear algebra in community college (it didn't transfer over though). I'm even taking relativity for fun this semester, and taking 18 credit hours for my last semester despite only needing 9 to graduate, because I figured the extra 400 level classes would be useful (and since I don't hate my major, I do have some interest in them anyway. Except HVAC. But I don't have to take HVAC). If I can get straight A's this semester and the extra classes contribute to my GPA, I should even be able to finish with a 3.7 GPA.\n\nIt doesn't help that my generation is basically told that we have to go to college or we'll be stuck with crap jobs. I did those crap jobs to build up credit history and help pay for school. Have you ever worked in a factory on a hot humid day with powdered corn syrup? There's no dehumidifier or air conditioning. That stuff gets everywhere, and it would mix with my sweat and get everything sticky. I used to go home with cocoa powder and cinnamon in my underwear. I'm not here to expand my mind. I'm here so I can stop being the loser living in their mom's house and get on with my life.",

      "text": "tldr: Holy fuck yes.\n\n(not so)Little story. I'm a PhD student at an English university (I won't get too specific, but some of you might still be able to guess where - then again, I think a lot of this is true everywhere). The UK government allowed uni's to charge up to \u00a39000 per year tuition a few years ago (while also cutting lots of government support for university). The typical amount beforehand was \u00a33k (for domestic students at least; internationals were often 1.5x higher or more). Immediately, pretty much every uni put their fees up to \u00a39k. \\[From what I understand of US universities/collages, it's only a few elite expensive ones that change anything equivalent or more, and even then very few students pay all of that top-whack themselves due to various grants and scholarships - there is still gov or scholarships in the UK, but you're not coming out of uni without a big fat debt\\] \n\nFortunately, I was in Scotland where tuition was (& is) free for long-term residents of Scotland or EU...just not England, which was hilarious. Anyway, this change happened while I was in my second year of 5 (inc. Master's). The class size when I started was about 30-35. This gradually whittled down to around 20 getting Batchelor's degrees and 5 of us getting Master's there. The year group after us was about 40 in first year, and the one after that started with 70. I heard the lecturers worrying how they were going to accommodate so many students in all the practicals, and where they could possibly lecture (I think there were only 5 lecture theatres at the uni that were designed to accommodate more than 55 at once - most rooms had only \\~30 seats at most, though I guess they could've packed more chairs into some of them if they made the desks smaller). It wasn't just our department facing the massive influx.\n\nCut to my current institution, where I did some lab demonstration and marking of the first years (oh my god. the marking. If you're reading this and you still have some essay's to write, please for the love of god put some effort into it; you may only have to write one, we have to mark a hundred and try to keep our faith in the future of humanity intact - also, if they give you a guide on how to write an essay; ffs read it). I therefore had contact with all 200 new students in my department. My current uni is bigger than my old one, but not THAT much bigger, so most departments were bursting at the seams. It was so full, the uni decided to move the start times to half past the hour; allowing them to start at 8:30 & finish at 5:30. Literally no one like this. Except possibly the bean counters who could now get maximal utility out of their lectures ... oh, I don't believe they saw a pay increase commensurate with these longer hours by the way. Couple all this with the already stressful conditions many academics face nowadays, and it's hardly surprising that it's been getting quite fraught the last few years. I've been here 3 years, every year's new intake has been about 200 to my department alone. They are franticly trying to build more space for everything.\n\nMeanwhile, my uni was in the news for one of the largest payouts to a retiring vice-chancellor ever (equivalent to around 93 student's tuition that year) on top of his pension. One day I was bored of analysing my own data, so I spent a harrowing afternoon looking up all the properties the uni had available for rent (the uni, or it's subsidiaries, none of the many private companies parasitising off the students' housing needs). I worked out that they had a turnover of around \u00a325 Million a year, just in rent. They are currently building more student housing. I later looked up the uni's publicly available accounting document; the last financial year had a turnover of \u00a3400M, and a profit of \u00a340M (even after all the building work across multiple campuses and paying massive bonuses to top staff I've never seen). Despite this, the finance department are busily bullying the academic staff into cutting costs while delivering better lectures and bringing in even more grant money (bit more difficult what with Brexit looming over our heads), and they are not-so-quietly threatening to close either the physics or engineering department (physics has been struggling to meet their student recruitment targets, so they fined them...no, I don't know how an institution can fine itself for not getting enough money either - BUT - Engineering, despite getting more students in and exceeding their targets, is more expensive to run per student and the building is currently having the asbestos removed...again, so it's still a toss up). That's not an empty threat either; they've closed a department before (and NOW some of you know exactly where I'm at). What we can be fairly confident in is that the business school is safe. All their students need is Excel, and that may go some way towards explaining why they get all the new comfy chairs and plush carpets.\n\nOne last example, because I think it is particularly germane: In order to charge \u00a39k/year, the universities must demonstrate to the government that they are 'committed' to outreach to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. As part of my PhD program I am required to carry out a certain number of hours of outreach (I'm not complaining, it's mostly pretty fun, but that it was a requirement was confusing to me until I found out the finial incentive). I have therefore met many people from the uni's outreach team, and every single one of them when I 'sarcastically' suggest 'Maybe not charging them nine grand a year would encourage these students to come here,' they all (unironically) agree with me. They know exactly what is needed, but whenever they propose grants for disadvantaged local students, or similar, it is immediately shot down as too expensive. It's all especially fervent in STEM, where there is a special box you get to tick if your outreach event would encourage young girls to come to you (and yea, it really does sound that creepy in the meetings too) - it's all pretty ineffectual though, because to get science students at all, they need to take the science classes at school; so really we'd need to target children before they're 11 (after this pupils in the UK pick their subjects for high school, and if you don't pick sciences then, most schools won't let you take it later \\[because they're worried you'll drag their average marks down\\]). Despite this, most of our outreach is targeted at high schools and specifically 16-18 year olds (because that yields more immediate results in student uptake). I was involved in a multi-university effort in this vain, so I know it's not a unique issue to us. All of this activity, which is good as far as it goes, could be massively improved by the university as a whole having a genuine desire to educate rather than primarily be to make money. \n\nOh, did I forget to mention they're all registered charities?\n\nI could go on about how the profit-driven attitude provides some very perverse incentives for everyone, or specifically talk about how much they are courting Chinese students obsessively (I am of course happy we're educating the world, but they are targeting China more than the the non-European world combined, and it's nakedly about money), and I won't go into too much detail about the companies (who have no internal training programs) I've heard complain graduates don't have the exact specific skills they need, but sufficed to say; I am getting my doctorate and fucking off to be unemployable somewhere else.",

If they cannot rely on public funds they must rely on donations, asset management and look to their students as sources of income. They have to essentially operate as hybrid businesses/charities if they wish to continue existing. Ultimately universities can remain sites of debate and education if the general public wishes them to be so. Politically I'd say at the the trend is against that\n\nI will say though that many western universities, for all their business minded characteristics, are still nonetheless critical sites of education. If you want to compare, look at what passes for university education in countries such as India. Bad as things are with the Americas, Brits or Australians, they could be much much worse. A college student still retains a much higher chance of accessing diverse opportunities if they graduate from a mid-tier American university in contrast to even a top tier Indian university.",

He was not afraid to tell it like it was and said that one of his main functions on the board was to wine and dine alums to get them to increase donations postmortem (i.e. in their wills). And....he got paid over 500,000 a year to do that (in addition to the perks of the fancy office, designated parking spot, etc.). \n\nHe talked about how much football and basketball coaches make, and how sports directly impacts admissions (which he supported with institutional historical data).  \n\nHe talked about how he was the ONLY member on the board with a background in education.  All the others were businessmen, lawyers, finance people, etc. Given how much power the board has, and the fact that it was run by a bunch of businessmen, it made total sense that the university essentially is a business.  Just instead of making stockholders rich, the money is used to increase salaries of higher admins, expand the campus in some way, or increase endowments for future endeavors.",

As an example, anthropology is no longer classified as a science in US. The field has been taken over by folks who want to use the subject for social change.

To refer to \"business-minded\" as \"churning graduates without any regard for jobs or educational achievement\" is a really inaccurate picture of how successful and effective businesses work. It's a good picture of bad businesses, however. \n\nBackground: I did a sabbatical in 2017-2018 with a business -- global corporation, traded on the NYSE -- and I was shocked at how great it was. The workplace culture valued creativity, hard work, and intellectual achievement. Everyone was valued. There were no politics, no drama, no BS. Good ideas were welcome and went from discussion to prototyping within weeks (instead of months or years in academia). Yes, the bottom line was shareholder value and making money. But this place really cared about the means by which this was achieved and the people who made it happen, from bottom of the org chart all the way to the top. It was most certainly not mindlessly pumping out product with no regard for quality or process. \n\nI've learned that there are a _lot_ of companies out there like this. Also lots of companies that are terrible. But also lots of universities that are terrible -- and even the universities that aren't terrible wouldn't be killed by looking at businesses and asking what they do that really works, and how the effective practices could be forked into something that works for academia. \n\nSo in the sense of the company I worked for being innovative, creative, and caring toward its people, I'd say that universities are not nearly business minded _enough_.\n\nMore here: https://rtalbert.org/sabbatical-lessons-part-4/",
