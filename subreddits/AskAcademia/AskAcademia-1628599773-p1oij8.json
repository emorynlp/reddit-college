  "text": "Every time I get comments on a paper draft from collaborators, I feel nauseated.  The comments have never been harsh, yet I always feel like they'll see whatever issues the paper has as evidence that I'm an idiot.  As a result, it takes me longer to edit papers, because I get so anxious when reading their comments.  Any ideas on how to deal with this anxiety?\n\n (This is not about my collaborators, who have all been kind and supportive.)",

      "text": "One of the pieces of advice I received early on was to do a first read of feedback where you let your emotions have their day.  Read and be upset/anxious/angry/whatever.  Then, put it down and walk away for a day or two.  Give yourself the space to have whatever feelings you have about the feedback.  Then, after the initial flood of emotional response has died down, go back and read for the actual stuff you can do something about.  This has helped me with comments from colleagues and collaborators, but also from reviewers and editors, too.\n\nCollaborator-wise, I also get a lot of value in reviewing and revising their work, too.  Then, I can use my CBT skills to reframe my negative thoughts about myself with the recognition that everyone has things to work on and improve, and I don't think they're idiots or whatever because I have suggestions for their work, so they likely don't for me, either.  \n\nIf you haven't checked out therapy, it may be worth a shot. Or a workbook for dealing with anxiety.  A quick 4-5 sessions with a solution-focused brief therapist or somone who does CBT/DBT would likely work well for you.",

          "text": "Amazing recommendations in this (and all other) comments. \n\nLet me add a few more points. Part of our professional orientation is distancing yourself as a person from your work. You will get reviews, including very crudely written ones. You just need to take a look at them as \u201cdirections to move forward\u201d as opposed to a judgement on how smart you are. This is kinda like having calluses in manual labor. When you describe the situation, it is a little bit weird. But they help you in your day-to-day job.\n\nSomeone else already mentioned age. There is also a gender & race component. You are in academia, you have a degree or two. You don\u2019t need to prove your intelligence (or anything) to anyone\u2026",

Peer-reviews or even feedback from collaborators are key towards publishing good and credible work. Even great scholars receive desk rejections. Also, publication is a huge maze. Do not take the comments on your work as a personal attack to you. I find it very useful to not respond to feedback on the first day of me receiving it. I usually read it for a day or two and then leave it for about a week or so before I pick the work back up. It really helps me to view the feedback in a more objective way.",

Practice helps, and I mean years of it, to really appreciate that the feedback is not about you but strictly what is written in the draft. As you develop as a writer, you will also get better at spotting the \"easy stuff\" yourself. It helps to separate yourself from your work, enough so that you can look at it as if you are one of your collaborators. I still go through drafts thinking \"what would my PhD supervisor say?\".\n\nPersonally, I don't associate mistakes in a student's writing with a lack of potential of who they could be, but I appreciate that may not be how it comes across from the eyes of the person getting the feedback.\n\nIt's helpful to talk about the feedback with your collaborators if you can. This can emphasize that everyone is on the same page to produce the best work possible, and can resolve any uncertainties to ensure that any issues can be resolved on the first attempt without having the embarrassment of being highlighted repeatedly.",

Peer review is the very foundation of what we do, whether the feedback is from co-authors of a paper or anonymous reviewers for a journal or grant reviewers they can sometimes be incredibly harsh. But the important thing to remember is that these are criticisms of the work, and not of you, and in the case of co-authors they all just want to improve the work and make it better. Everyone gets negative feedback though, it's not a reflection of your intelligence or even your abilities. Usually people will try to be as harsh as possible early on to ensure that the work has been thoroughly critically reviewed, which makes for a better paper.",

      "text": "I assume you are a more junior member in the team, please disregard everything below if not. I usually edit \\*a lot\\* in each draft I receive -- that is just a part of the process, but it is also a necessary part of the process for the junior members but also to produce a high-quality paper that has a chance to succeed in a high impact journal.\n\nI know that this can be quite painful for junior researchers (especially PhDs, but also post docs). I therefore tell them \\*before they send me anything\\* that (1) they will get the paper back with lots of changes and that is just how it is because they don't know yet how to best frame things in terms of scientific writing, and (2) that they should therefore not spend too much time on the first draft they send. I tell them the first draft should be rough. It is there to have a basis to get started from, and its purpose is to be re-written and shaped by everyone involved. The first draft should therefore be quick -- it should not be good. \n\nThe massive number of corrections I make are never an indication of thinking the other person is an idiot -- otherwise everyone would be an idiot. I never had a case that I have received a manuscript that required only few changes from junior team members, unless they worked with me for ages and have fully internalized how the manuscript should look. And that is how it should be -- as a junior member, you don't know all that is required yet, and you don't know all the tricks of the trade of how to get the paper message across well. And this is hard to teach in any other way other than just receiving corrections over and over. \n\nThe biggest problems I had were with junior members who did not accept that this is part of the process. They would spend ages fretting over the first draft, start writing the same paragraphs over and over again, over thinking each and every aspect of it, because they want to receive it back with little changes. This hurts more than it helps: it really slows down the process and they still receive lots of changes -- because they are not there yet that they have the best feeling for how a good paper will look. Such drafts are also really cumbersome and overwritten.\n\nIn a nutshell: do not worry about edits you receive. This is the job of the senior authors and their way of giving input (and their contribution to deserve the authorship). Your job is only to produce a workable draft that can serve as a springboard for an excellent paper. it is not expected that the draft is excellent yet, and to expect it to be means undermining the whole process.",

Same as reviewing papers.\n\nBut in your case I agree that you should try to find out what the deeper issues at work are; a certain level of anxiety is definitely normal, because you are putting yourself on the line with your writing, and receiving criticism - as constructive and friendly as it may be - is never really that easy. And yes, we're supposed to separate people and work, but, this is stuff you wrote, and having it critically examined is just something one has to learn to deal with. It gets better over time :)",

So you don\u2019t need to worry about people feel you are stupid :p",

      "text": "I agree with all the comments here. I am not a senior researcher, but I've helped many of my friends write their application essays for grad school. \n\nI go hard on these because I want my friends to succeed and believe in them. I don't believe they are idiots at all. A lot of times they don't know the formats grad schools expect, have trouble putting thoughts to paper, have very little experience writing, etc. After several corrections, most get into the program they want. I also wanted very thorough criticisms of my writing when I was applying.\n\nI only one time was very frustrated with the essays I received. In fact, this guy kept sending me very poorly worded essays, correction after correction. His essays kept containing half baked woo ideas, despite my advice and expertise in the area. I finally had to give him a hard no on me helping him out for future writing. \n\nIf your collaborators have decided to work with you, they see value in your work and are trying to improve that value. \n\nI am currently working on my thesis, and do feel a certain amount of anxiety upon getting corrections. However, I know that if I had gotten that feedback a few months ago in the midst of my depression and before I started going to therapy, they would have crushed me, and I absolutely would have used them as evidence of me being a stupid fraud. Now I reframe my thinking to: corrections help me become a better writer and researcher and is part of the learning process. I am also trying to incorporate the corrections into later chapters I write to prove to myself and my advisor that I am a good researcher. \n\nI have thanked my advisor for being so detailed and in depth because I have looked at previous writing that did not go through that detail, and I cringe at how bad it is. \n\nChin up! And take a moment to examine that anxiety.",

This is people helping you. Have you ever tried reviewing someone else's work (in a field you're knowledgeable in)? When you see all the things missing, and wrong in it (because you have a much \"fresher view\" of the thing), what would you rather do... just node and say yeah this is wonderful (which'd probably cause them failure later on) or correct them by saying this is wrong, you missed this this this and this.  \n\n\nI know you'd like (we all probably would like) to hear the occasional \"... but over all you're heading in the right direction\", but that is kinda not necessary -- if someone already has \"bad things\" to say about your work, then it means your work is good enough for them to take it seriously... no?",
