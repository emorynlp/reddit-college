It's far healthier to balance work with a social life. \n\nThat said, it's normal enough if you don't find anyone you connect with or if you don't prioritize dating while you're a student. Just \n... Don't say no/never.\n\nYour current work habits seem aimed at mental health burnout.",

Most of the PhD students I know have partners, and many of these relationships (including mine) don't precede grad school. I also know several people who are dating around or in very new relationships, so that's not impossible either. People even get married and have kids while being PhD students. I don't think it's necessary or healthy to put your whole life on hold for grad school, personally if I was in an environment THAT demanding I would burn out really fast.",

I\u2019m not ever advocating intellectual snobbery, but it\u2019s more that you have a shared experience having both survived the trauma that is grad school.",

      "text": "It\u2019s common in my experience. For one, there\u2019s the fact that there\u2019s often little time to meet people or dedicate to a relationship while in grad school. There\u2019s also the fact that many universities aren\u2019t located in populous areas and romantic options are often pretty limited (god help you if you\u2019re queer in a smaller university town). But the big one in my mind is that if you date you\u2019re most likely to date another grad student, and that generates a whole host of problems, such as one of you likely needing to sacrifice their academic career if you want to stay together. So there are a lot of reasons why grad students stay single, either voluntarily or not.",

              "text": "That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s worse if you\u2019re both academics. If your partner is, say, a nurse or a K-12 teacher, they\u2019re much more likely to find work wherever you go. If you get a job at a university and your partner fails to get a job there as well, which is very likely, then either they\u2019re getting a non-academic job and shifting their career path or you\u2019re both going to do long distance for likely several years. \n\nAcademia is already extremely inflexible when it comes to where you live, and like you said it\u2019s already hard even if only one of you is an academic. Having two people who are both bound by very tight and likely competing constraints just exacerbates things. Though other careers can have the same problems if the jobs are concentrated in specific geographic areas. For instance, I have a friend whose wife needs to be in the DC area for her career, and this is non-negotiable. The likelihood my friend get a job in academia in that area specifically is pretty much zero.\n\nWith some careers the problem isn\u2019t just that your partner will struggle to find work in their chosen career. It\u2019s that there aren\u2019t any jobs at all to be had where you both end up. And that leads to a big sacrifice on their end. And in my experience, it\u2019s one many partners realize they aren\u2019t willing to make when the time comes. Both of you being in academia makes that one-sided sacrifice not just likely but more or less inevitable.",

I ended up getting serious with someone non mobile when I was a postdoc when I could really evaluate what I want in life. But we are more than academia.
