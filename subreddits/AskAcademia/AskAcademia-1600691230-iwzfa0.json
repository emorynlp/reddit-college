  "title:": "Help! My advisor put me in acknowledgment not co authorship.",
  "text": "I finished my Masters this year. It was the worst memory in my life due to a conflict with my advisor. Anyway he got asked to conduct a simulation of our group model for the analysis of ensemble models. He told me to work on this project for co-authorship last year. The paper just published early this month and when I see it i was in acknowledgment not co authorship. Instead he is in co authorship.\n\nThe project is for us to conduct computer simulations and submit its results for their analysis of different model results. I did all the simulations from the beginning to the end. I feel very unfair and confused. What should the difference of co-authorship and acknowledgment be in this case? What should I do? Any help will be very appreciated.",

      "text": "That is unfortunate.  The difference between co-authorship and acknowledgment is significant, and it includes whether or not you can list the paper on your resume.  If your advisor promised you co-authorship, then it sounds like he should have at least discussed it with you before changing it.  Without a lot more information about your work and the paper it is not possible to say whether his decision was inappropriate or not.  If you are at a US university, there will be a Research Integrity Officer to whom you can report these kinds of issues.  I am that person for my university.  Once you have reported it, they will investigate and determine an appropriate outcome.",

These usually play out in one of two ways. \n\nFirst scenario: the student was simply wrong (most common) about the perceived fault of the supervisor. The committee deciding over the complaint ruled that the student had no foot to stand on. Outcome: supervisor hates student, faculty perceive student as problem maker, student can't find a job anywhere because ours is a small field and everyone knows everyone.\n\nSecond scenario: the student was in the right. The committe deciding over the complaint rules that the student is correct. Advisor receives a slap in the wrist as they can't be fired unless they commit an actual crime. Faculty is divided between those who still think student was wrong, those who think student was right and those who don't care. But the student needs to find a new supervisor, start their project over. Alternatively, the student is done with their project but can't effectively receive a letter of recommendation from their advisor, and friends of the advisor will side with the advisor, meaning the chances of a job for the student are greatly diminished.\n\nWhat exactly was gained in either scenario by the student? The best course of action is **always** to go above and beyond to resolve the issues with the advisor directly.\n\nThis isn't fair, it's not good, and it is not healthy. Maybe if enough people started filing complaints against abusive faculty members things would change. However, right now, if you file a complaint as a student against your supervisor, 99 out of 100 times you'll be worse off for it.",

At best a retraction since the authors violated guidelines.\n\n>  As for the former advisor\u2019s crossness, that\u2019s a poor reason not to report suspected misconduct (of any kind).\n\nSadly, advisors hold a lot of power over students. If OP is going into the industry, then that's fine, they can write to the journal editor and the article might be retracted. If OP wants to stay in academia, how do you suggest they get a good letter of recommendation? what will happen if people in the hiring committee of some future job know about this incident and are friends with OP's advisor?\n\nThese situations suck and are extremely unfair, but they rarely work out for the victims, specially if there isn't some clear-cut, demonstrable misconduct at play (say sexual harassment with witnesses).",

If they don't fight, they'll be bitter about it for the rest of their life, and it will lead to them burning out of academia some 10 years earlier than it would have happened \"normally\".\n\nSo the only reason not to fight is if you secretly believe that it's better for them not to stay in academia. Which may be true, if it is indeed the case that academia is a place where you don't fight back when slighted. A bit of a circular logic here. A place that is so unjust that there's no point in fighting for justice is not worth fighting for :)\n\nBut I'm an optimist!",

You need to have done work worthy of authorship.

This really needs to be determined by people in your field looking at the actual paper. Find someone you trust.\n\n2. You need receipts. You need something written promising authorship. This is not worth he said she saiding. Acknowledgement is not worth anything on the job market, but it should actually help while applying for PhD.\n\nObviously the route I'm discussing is scorched earth, so proceed with caution.",

      "text": "Many journals these days have specific posted policies about what qualifies someone for co authorship, and it\u2019s not always what you would think.  Your first step should be to go to the publisher\u2019s web site and look for this.  Once you know what the requirements are, pull together any evidence you can find \\*before\\* you do anything else. Make copies of emails, paper draft comments, lab journals, etc. This is going to be tricky since it sounds like you were not involved at all in drafting the paper, so you want to be absolutely certain of the journal requirements before you try to make this case.\n\nThen depending on your relationship with this person, you either go to them with \u201cI looked at the authorship requirements, I meet them, how do we get the journal to update this?\u201d or you start outside your lab. The research integrity officer or student ombudsperson at your university is a good place to start, but some universities have specific authorship policies and may have some designated person to talk with.  These people can help assess your authorship claim and help you figure out how to address it, if they agree you should have had authorship. \n\nThis likely will blow up any remaining relationship you have with this person, so I really recommend talking to the RIO/ombuds first, and securing anything you have copies of and access to, before you say anything to your advisor.",
