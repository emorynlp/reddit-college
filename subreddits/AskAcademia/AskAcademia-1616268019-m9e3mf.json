  "title:": "Advisor/PI is gaslighting me and ignoring me, what should I do? [STEM]",
  "text": "I apologize in advance for the long post. I'm at the verge of nervous breakdown. There are only 5 weeks left until the deadline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a masters student. My advisor is also my PI and head of the department. I felt like we had a good relationship. We worked together several days a week for 1 whole year. Then the pandemic came and they suddendly stopped replying to my emails. Just before it all started, they promised to get back to me when results come back from another institution. Never heard back. I was supposed to be done with the project in summer 2020.\n\nI emailed them several times, stating my concern about the deadline. Weeks went on, I didn't manage to get in contact. The unis opened for 1 on 1 consultations. When any of the other students went in there, they always reminded my advisor of me and they always said they'd get back to me. I became so unmotivated and filled with anxiety that I gave up. I went there in person in July with someone who managed to schedule a meeting. They denied ever getting any emails from me. I extended my program for a year and it took a huge toll on my mental health.\n\nNext academic year began and I went through some health issues. My advisor appeared to be very sympathetic and said I should get it sorted out and email them once the review part of my thesis is done. The the pandemic blew out again, my doctors appointments were moved a few months later, I had other medical issues and was assaulted, which took me time to deal with. I started writing as soon as I felt strong enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fast forward to now, 2021:**\n\n2 months later, I emailed my PI again. Nothing. I tried to call their office but since the uni is closed now, I'm not sure if they're even there. Finally I managed to get them on the phone a week later and they were very upset with me. I asked them how will we proceed further, especially since they have all the results of my experiments and refused to give them to me last summer, insisting I have to show them the whole review part first. They replied that I can do whatever but I won't make it because there's too little time and since the uni's closed, there's no way they can help me - meaning if I can't be there in person, we won't discuss anything and I can't progress. They also said I should extend my program for another year (and pay the tuition of course). They claimed I haven't contacted them during the past year at all. They don't remember I was in their office or that we talked about my health issues, that they appeared to be so understanding of. I was completely shocked and cried for 3 days straight. I don't understand any of this. I asked them to please cooperate and try together. They agreed that I should send them the review. So I did and still nothing. \n\nI just wanna lay down now, cry and not exist. I worked so hard to get into a good PhD program. The dean offered me a PhD program over the years, twice. I did a lot of extra work and engaged with the department. I found an internship at a prestigious institute. I'm at fault that I didn't try to get my advisor on the phone earlier. I'm at fault that I didn't email them more often. I'm also at fault that I started this late, although I truly believe I'd make it if I had more encouragement. Since they told me to contact them once my whole review is done, that's what I planned to do. Now they acts like none of this happened and claim they never said those things. \n\nI always liked my advisor/PI, I'm so disappointed. I don't wanna report it because they have all my results. Also they're one of the two people who will be evaluating my thesis and there's a big emphasis on cooperation from the student. I'm so scared. There are only 5 weeks left at this point. I'd very much like to solve this peacefully. I don't know who to talk to. I thought about contacting someone else from the department but there's a good chance it would eventually get to the PI and I'd get in trouble. Technically the only person \"above\" the head of the department at uni is the dean, who appears to be very nice but I have no idea who would he side with. I kind of have a feeling he'd share my complaint with my advisor. All I want at this point is to finish, I don't even care about grad school anymore. I don't know what to do. I hate myself for not seeing this coming after what happened last year. I was stupidly naive to believe it will be different this time.  \n\n\nWhat should I do? I don't even feel I have a right to complain since I didn't try hard enough. I regret starting late but I was such a mess mentally before I started because of the assault, which I can't even tell anyone. I truly believe I'd make it in time if we cooperated, many students before me have made it in 4 weeks or so. The stress is killing my productivity though.",

I didn't show the emails to them because I didn't have the opportunity to physically do so but I mentioned them twice, when we actually talked. The first time my PI said there was a technical issue and they just got the email the day I came into the office (1 month after sending my last email then). This last time on the phone they said they opened my email just minutes ago. Based on the reaction in both cases, it was clear they had no idea what was in those emails. It's like they don't consider email a legit way of communication, which is just strange and makes me feel like a fool. Like I sent **just** an email. I checked the address now to be sure and it's the right one sadly.",

But try other ways to communicate what you need for your PhD, now that you know email is not a good channel. All your problems are stemming from only using email. Maybe they accidentally blocked you. It just takes one slipped click. Maybe their email server marks your emails as spam. Maybe your email associated in their contact list as \"Car Salesperson\" and they ignore all the emails. Maybe they have a weird gmail forwarding rule. Maybe their email program autoclassifies your emails in a folder that is hidden. Who knows, but after a few failed emails I would try a new approach.\n\nLet me try to see the timeline:\n\n1) good working relationship. then during pandemic, you send all your communications via email\n\n2) year 2020: all your emails don't get a response, causing you major problems\n\n3) they say they didn't get your emails\n\n4) year 2021: you email your PI again, and again, your emails don't get a response, again causing major problems\n\n5) you call them and clear the air. they say they didn't get your emails\n\n6) now again, you email your PI and don't get a response\n\nWhat are you doing?

Faculty members aren't required to be in offices and my advisor strictly forbade me to come personally. \n\nI emailed the dean (without context) asking whether that's true or not, as the rule of students on campus is not very clear.

I'd suggest firstly talking to your uni's student wellbeing services, and telling them everything (by default - I can't speak to your situation and it's your choice of course, but *usually* I believe you're best off being open with them). They're mostly for taking care of your health, which is the most important thing, but they may also be able to advise concretely on next steps as well. In any case there must be some kind of complaints procedure they can tell you about or that you can find online (I'm assuming, this may vary by country) - you could look that up in advance, just to know it's there, but I'd not wait long to talk to someone on that trajectory. At this point my guess would be that it's safer to take a formal complaints route than to hope your supervisor starts behaving better. If you don't get support from the university, in your case I think you could consider legal options (the first step there is also: you can just talk to someone and get informed), but I highly doubt the uni'll let it get that far.\n\nIf it's a helpful thought - you're not just doing it for yourself; even if you don't get a satisfactory result, the next student is going to have a much stronger position if that supervisor does the same thing again. I more or less got my PhD thanks to someone a year or two ahead of me complaining about our PI's behaviour which was also blocking my progress and stressing me out massively (and we both got the PhD, by the way; it's bad for a university to lose grad students so they're going to look for solutions, even if the individual PI is being an ass). If you go into a complaints procedure and your PI does something extremely stupid like witholding results in retaliation, any even slightly sane Dean is going to come down on them like a ton of bricks. That kind of thing won't really be your problem to solve at that point.\n\nGood luck in any case, and try to keep in mind that there are a lot of paths forward; many people I know have had similar problems in their careers and had to flow past or through one way or another, but ended up fine.",

      "text": "You totally have the right to be stressed as this is a very tough situation both emotionally and mentally! 5 weeks is a doable time, though it is not at all generous. I would personally suggest reaching out to your advisor/PI one more time, and if you don't hear back for a couple days, then take it to your department head or advisor (if you have one) and maybe seek council there. I think with such limited time, it's important that you put your work and yourself first. If the lack of communication is going to hinder you from everything you worked for, then it doesn't matter how much you like/appreciate your advisor/PI. For some reason, it seems like they are unwilling to work with you (maybe the circumstances, idk) and you should not feel stressed over something you cannot control. Take the matter into your own hands and be confident in your actions! If you have evidence of interacting with ur advisor/PI I'm, sure someone higher up within the deparment can help you out.",

My department is very small and so talking to the department chair always felt like it'll come back to bite me, but going to this office ensured that won't happen since its a confidential resource. Try to see if such a service exists and voice your concerns there, if all else fails!",

      "text": "Escalate this immediately. As high as you can. Bring copies of all correspondence and records/logs of all phone calls you have made to the meeting. If you have supportive parents who are good at handling people, get them involved (a student with a knowledgeable familial backbone makes people more afraid\u2014when you\u2019re out there surviving totally on your own, you\u2019re easier fish food). If you\u2019re close to any other faculty members, seek them out and explain the situation. Ask for assistance or for them to speak to your character when/if the time comes. I seriously hope this works out.\n\nPS you\u2019ve learned two important lessons for the future: first, never let anyone have the only copy of all of your experimental data\u2014ever. Second, never ever let someone blow you off again for this long\u2014escalate sooner. Always always. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Essentially what\u2019s happening right now. So you have nothing to lose by forcing things along next time.",

I consulted the \"not sharing data\" policy with two other academics from our faculty a while ago and they both acted like it was normal, so I didn't think much of it. I'm starting to doubt if the data still even exists anymore and maybe that's why the advisor is avoiding me. But let's not go there yet. \n\nThank you for the encouragement. I'll do my best!",
