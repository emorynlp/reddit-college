  "title:": "Advice for Preparing for a Professional Doctorate/PhD for Industry?",
  "text": "I've graduated with my Master's in Physics about 5 years ago and currently work in civil engineering. I knew from the start that I didn't want to go into academia, but would rather work either in private industry or for the government. \n\nLately' I've been very interested in quantum computing, and would like to change careers into that field. However, the industry if fairly young and most positions require a doctorate degree. I'd like to pursue either a PhD in Engineering or Quantum Computing or, ideally, a professional doctorate like a Doctor of Engineering since I intend to keep working though my studies and a professional doctorate would lend itself more to my career aspirations.\n\nCan I ask you all for advice on pursuing a doctorate specifically to work in industry? What can I do to prepare to apply in 2023? Does anyone have experience in a professional doctorate program like a Doctor or Engineering or know someone who has that degree or one similar?",

      "text": "If you intend to keep working through your studies, you should seriously think through the cons of what you're proposing to do. \n\nFirst off, you probably won't be eligible to be paid a stipend.  Fair enough, you'll be earning your money through your work, but it's worth noting.\n\nSecond, how many hours per week do you expect to be working, and how many doing the PhD?  A PhD is a full-time job, so you can scale to get a rough idea of the length.  If you are going to do the PhD half-time and live in a country where a 4 year PhD is normal, are you prepared to spend 8 years doing the PhD?  \n\nIt may take even longer, because you'll create inefficiencies by being half-time: for example, you'll have twice as much literature published during your degree, and you still have to be up to date on all of it.  You may still be required to attend every meeting of your research group, and this will take (relatively) twice as much of your time compared to your full-time colleagues.  Half-time also increases the odds that experiments that you did at the start may be obsolete or scooped by the time you get around to publishing them.\n\nThird, all of the above will make it more difficult to find a supervisor.  There will be a number of supervisors who simply won't be willing to commit to supervising someone who isn't committing full-time, or who aren't prepared to sign on for an 8(ish) year long committment.  \n\nAnd a last point, if you plan to keep working throughout, does that mean you're geographically tied to a single location?  That's a very non-ideal condition for a PhD applicant, especially one who's looking for a particular topic and to be part-time, unless you already live in a city with multiple universities doing research in this field.",
