I'm currently in a depressed state, but what helped me earlier was cognitive behavioral therapy. \nIt's tough cause you are surrounded by so many smart people. But you would not be where you are today if you were not smart. Ask yourself. Everything that you have done, is that just luck? That's very unlikely. Chat with fellow academics about it. You'll see that a lot of people have it.",

There will always be those types to crush it because their personality won't allow any less. Then theres the rest of us. Just keep pushing and put it out of your mind.",

Based on anonymous feedback from the audience, this seems to be very prevalent.\nGiven that it sometimes goes hand in hand with darker stuff such as depression and anxiety, it's important to deal with it. The best advice seems to be to talk about it, with students, colleagues and possibly faculty.",

I know when studying in my school's library I used to think about how I am still learning and not prepared to put the material together in a setting where people turn to me or rely on me. This was a few years ago, now I feel more confident that I can solve something or take care of things without pretending I am a \"fake\" to people. More specifically, if I don't think I can take care of something, I do not plan on being able to initially. Kind of part of knowing my own boundaries and what I am capable of. Obviously expanding them is the goal, but that is different for everyone.",
