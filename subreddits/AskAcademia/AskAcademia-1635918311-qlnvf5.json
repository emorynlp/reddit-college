      "text": "If students say nice things about the faculty member, it gives the department and chair something else to mention in their letter to the higher-level committees. It\u2019s not make or break. But it can be one more arrow in the quiver, so it\u2019s nice to have. I know that comments from my grad students when I was nominated for a teaching award were mentioned favorably in my letters when I went up.",
