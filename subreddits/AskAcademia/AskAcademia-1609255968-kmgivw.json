  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am a 26M graduate student who earned my terminal Master's this month with a thesis. Currently, I am enrolled in a PhD institution and will begin my second semester this January. A struggle I am trying to officially reconcile is explaining what I achieved to my parents in a manner that shows them \"why it matters.\" Unfortunately, it is not enough to say to them that I am \"making progress\" despite the nature of graduate school and graduate programs in general being giant time sinks in a lot of ways even if there is no tangible outcome (i.e., something to put on a CV, pay increase, etc.). A lot of it comes from \"why would an employer would care? Who is hiring you?\" etc. Also, my Master's cohort is brought up sometimes as a way to ask, \"Are you doing *better* than them?\" or anything else to allude that I am in a much better position than they are professionally (sometimes personally, like the sorts of partners they have). I should state that my parents have mentioned on multiple occasions they are proud of me. My siblings confirmed my parents are being honest because they state that to others when I am not around. However, it is essentially bragging because they would state I am taking \"the most advanced stats of all time\" or anything of the sort when I took the first level of stats at my current PhD program.\n\nThis gets even worse when my research interests are brought up. Contrary to my username that Reddit made, I am actually in an applied experimental science field. Anytime I bring it up, there is a constant struggle to explain why it matters. Similar to the \"making progress\" problem with my own goals I mentioned in the previous paragraph, they do not see why science as a self-correcting process matters, which parallels why self-correcting myself (by making goal progress) matters. Anytime I bring that up (particularly for theoretical work), its can be things such as \"I don't get it. If it (the theories) were true, just put it down and roll with it. There's no need to update or re-test it.\" Worst case, it's \"I could've told you that.\"\n\nFor some demographic information about my parents: 1.) Neither of them earned a college degree (this makes me a first generation college graduate and the second to earn a graduate degree because my sibling got a non-thesis Master's in one year for accounting). 2.) They are business minded folks and seem to apply that to just about everything, even when it does not translate (assimilation over accommodation). I am VERY worried about this after I am done with my program in four years and what they will think about the job I'll earn (if any). 3.) Growing up, my parents always got excited and would mention my academic and tabletop gaming accomplishments to others (I placed in the top 100 global rankings for a competitive TCG over numerous seasons but I won't mention it by name). The third point in particular was something I needed to \"unlearn\" during my undergraduate days because I realized that I needed to worry about self-improvement and self-progress over getting a leg up on others. I do fall into those old habits sometimes, which unfortunately manifests itself as Imposter's Syndrome and is perhaps the biggest reason why the questions they ask in the first paragraph annoy me (because its almost like they're asking me to create Imposter's Syndrome).\n\nHow do y'all recommend I approach discussion of my academic responsibilities, accomplishments, and prospects in the near future? Thank you.\n\nEdit: I see some folks throwing my age back at me in order to state I should not care about what they think period. I have my boundaries with them regarding what I listen and do not listen to. This situation is certainly the latter. However, I want some sort of rapport with my parents by problem solving this issue as much as I can. So far, it sounds like there is not much I can do and that's fine because I re-work my boundaries with them.\n\nEdit 2: I noticed some folks have the impression I am trying to get approval from my parents or am trying to convince them to value what I've done up to this point. This is not the case but I can see how my post may come across that way. I just wanted to figure out a way to problem solve this that is the most helpful to me. I realize fishing for approval from anyone (parents, peers, etc.) is not the way to resolve these kinds of issues, especially at the graduate level.\n\nFinal Edit: This really blew up! Thank you to the folks that answered my question without making any unnecessary assumptions about my intentions and/or imposing what should be done based on my age. A big thank you also goes to those who shared their stories. I'm glad I'm not alone in with this issue and I also hope that the comments which answered my question can help you all as well. I know I've replied to 2 folks already but I just want to mention that I read every comment as they came in.",

They literally have no idea what they're talking about, which, I would say, is the gist of the problem; they can't relate to you. My guess is that they were brought up in a period in which high-paying jobs were everywhere and did not require any advanced degree, contrary to today's socio-economic situation, which is a second reason as to why they're not able to relate to you or your achievements.\n\nThe fact that they are bragging about what you are doing whilst constantly talking down your achievements is honestly pathetic, but I think it's somewhat of a trend with parents without college / advanced degrees whose children are enrolled in Ph.Ds.\n\nI don't think you have many options. You either completely cut them for this type of discussion (you're 26, I think you're perfectly allowed to not talk about a topic with them) or try and have a comprehensive discussion with them that'll allow them to understand the difficulty of being a Ph.D candidate.",

      "text": "I have this problem with my family and I\u2019ve yet to find a perfect fix.  I did sit my mother and brother down and explained how academia works in my field during my PhD (I.e. expected job progression and timeline, the current job crash and it\u2019s implications on that timeline, the fact that I cannot restrict my job search geographically). It was a difficult conversation as they had engrained ideas about how the job search goes - my dad in particular still believes that my alma mater should want to hire me since they sunk so much time and training into me and refuses to believe me that it is the complete opposite situation.  But it did help them understand what I\u2019m talking about in casual conversation about my work. \n\nHowever, I still have to tell them when my accomplishments are big deals, and that sucks.  They get so excited over my publishing papers, and will post across social media about it, but when I win a prestige grant or land a long-term postdoc position just out of my PhD (both of which happened this year amazingly) they just don\u2019t get that it\u2019s a big accomplishment cuz compared to tenure (which is what they know from TV) it\u2019s small beans.  \n\nI had to describe my defense as equivalent to my brothers wedding to get them to attend.  My therapist and I talk a lot about how disconnected I am from my family because of my career in academia.\n\nEdit: wanted to add that I think switching from calling myself a PhD student/Postdoc to a Scientist helped a lot.  If there\u2019s a more common term for what you study then use it.",

It sucks, but I do want to have a relationship with them, and a good one if possible, and I've discovered the way to do that is just accept that there's some things they won't understand and that it depressed me to talk about with them. So I don't, and I get praise and validation for those accomplishments from others (and of course myself, which is most important, though easier said than done).",

      "text": "From point #3 I dare say you're talking about MTG, but thats not the point here.\n\nSo, it is difficult to explain \"why\" we, applied scientists (I'm a chemist, former engineer), matter to the general public, outside of academia. I will try to come up with an example.\n\nLet us assume that your parents grew up without internet or computers. Then computers became popular, the internet was removing barriers, knowledge was being shared faster than ever before. This is common knowledge nowadays, as I bet both your parents have smartphones, e-mails and likely a company website. I also doubt all of the money is dealt on paper, calculator and abacus, everything is in digital form. Printers are also going to be common, and they probably have used Fax before.\n\nEverything that I just described came \"out of nowhere\" in the past 50 or 60 years or so. Why? Theory and experiments. Computing was invented, then mechanical computers, then we started to grasp what we could do with it. So, we have some basic knowledge, so let's try doing X and Y in order to see if we can come with up with something new and/or improve an already existing technology - This is applied science, in the broadest of sense. Is there a problem or question unanswered? Let's tackle it and see what comes of it. This is how we get better batteries for laptops and smartphones, new medicine, medical treatments, more safety in transportation, etc. \n\nYour parents are \"practical, hands-on\" people, from your description. Talk in their language - cars, planes, smartphone and laptop batteries, medicine, etc. Those are all common words that everybody is familiar enough to understand. Who wouldn't want a car that is safer, or a laptop with a battery that could last for 12 hours with half the normal weight? You can point to them that, while you are not \" The \" person creating the next generation of \"insert technology X here\", you are giving your contribution to it. A house can be built brick by brick by a single person, but hardly a technology will be completely developed by a single person.\n\nHope I have helped with this wall of text, best wishes.",

Most of the questions at my defense were about the practical real-world implications of my research when it was really a systematic approach to solve a few particular, focused questions.

      "text": "They're your parents, and it sounds like you want to have a good relationship with them, and would like them to at least validate your choices -- after all, your choices to go into academia and conduct research are indicative of who you are as a person. I get that, and I think the way you're dealing with it is actually pretty healthy. Kudos. (Also kudos to you for recognizing that we have to unlearn a lot of the \"graduated in the top 10%!\" and other similar ways of measuring academic achievement in order to be healthy. It's hard but it's doable.)\n\nThis whole thing is a great exercise for your future career, inside or outside academia, and working with media. Learn how to promote yourself in a healthy way. Learn how to promote science and why you deserve money. It's not comfortable, but like a well-written lit review, is a necessary skill.\n\nI totally understand how it could be difficult to explain the point you're at in your studies to people who have spent their professional lives looking at things in terms of months or quarters, or a year (maybe YoY) at most. But they probably had to grow and show that they were ready to move on to the next part of their business careers. I don't know their stories, but I can bet they didn't start out by just starting a business with money that appeared out of thin air. They had to prove to people that they could manage a store, or that their business idea was good enough for a loan. Essentially that's what you're doing right now -- proving to people that you can do this work, and learning every day and getting better at it. And you're being paid for it! Just like they got paid for their work, where they were progressing every day, too. Think of it in those terms. They're all steps toward a goal. While the goals don't mirror each other, you can probably find a way to describe it like this. Maybe that could help?\n\nIs there a good example in your field of how science has shown us something we knew instinctively to be true, but that now that we \\*know,\\* it opens up a whole new world of possibilities? Or when by testing a well-worn theory, we actually found out something we didn't know before? I live in the social sciences, so this is always a struggle for me, too -- I hear \"I could have told you that!\" or \"that's too fuzzy for me (subtext: not real science),\" from my own mother, an engineer. Showing them some of the crazy things we found out because we kept poking at an idea, and how we all benefitted, could be a way to win them over to this slow-moving incremental world : )\n\nAnd a thumbs up to the idea from u/bjos144 for assuaging your parents' fears: where do people in your program get placed for postdocs or jobs? A simple \"Don't worry, mom, everyone who graduated last year got a job,\" and \"We have great contacts at (company) and (school) and (organization) and they like hiring our graduates,\" could go a long way. You're not responsible if they want to go and tell their friends you \"Could get hired XXXXX\" because that's in their operating system; they just want to know you're going to have a better life than they did. It's clear that they love you, and they are proud of you -- but they're just worried about you because they don't fully understand what's happening. (Unfortunately, I have no idea how to talk them off the \"are you doing better than everyone else\" ledge, because it's clear they're drawing apples to broccoli conclusions there.)\n\nWishing you the best.",

      "text": "On one hand, give up. You're in a world now that is completely alien to them. They will *never* be able to relate to your work or why you think it's important. This is what they don't tell you about being 1st generation: it's terribly lonely. You're forever isolated by the experience from your family. \n\nInstead, build common interests with them that don't focus on work. Learn to bake and share recipes with your Dad (an interest in old family recipes has served me well). Talk to your Mom about relatives, family history, or anything else she might be interested in. But don't expect them to understand even remotely what you're doing-- it took you over five years to understand it, and it was explained to you by professionals with way more experience than you have under your belt. \n\nPart of the problem is one of communication, I think. This process isn't just about doing, it's also about becoming. It's reshaping yourself to interact with the world in a way that is really alien to most people. Some of us reshape a little, some a lot, but no one who hasn't been through the experience can really understand it. And even many of those who have been through it *still* can't relate to others who have, because their experiences/disciplines are so different. \n\nNow, on the other hand, I have found it *incredibly useful* to try to reframe what I'm working on in such a way that a family member (who is usually a tolerant listener, at least for the first five minutes) can follow what I'm doing. Usually it begins with, \"here's why this question is important,\" or \"here's why people think this is an important thing to do.\" Then there's some analogy that provides a point of reference (in my case, usually something about movement and real-world objects) through which I can try to explain how I'm addressing the question. This rarely has a big payoff for me, and I'm not sure that it helps them understand what I'm doing. But they do understand that I'm doing *something*, that I think it's important, and that other people do, too. \n\nFor example, \"why are you running this experiment again?\"\n\n\"Well, because sometimes there are little differences, and those differences can help me and my colleagues understand where our explanation doesn't quite fit right. It's a lot like refining a cake recipe: you can just bake the same thing, over and over. Sure, it works fine; but you know it's just not quite right. Maybe not enough chocolate. Maybe it's the vanilla extract. So you try and try to get it closer to how it should be-- like Gran's cake. You run the experiment again and again. And one day you figure it out: it's coffee. She put coffee in the mix. Then you write it down on Facebook so everyone knows, and you're on to the next thing, because the cake is closer, but it's still not right.\"\n\nIt's a vastly oversimplified example, but I have a lot of conversations like these. Every once in a while it really helps me to clarify a sticking point in my chain of reasoning!",
