  "title:": "Should I include freelance tutoring on my CV for a masters application?",
  "text": "I don\u2019t think this is for the graduate applications subreddit because it has to do with my CV.\n\nI\u2019m working on finalizing my CV, which I will be including in my applications for masters programs. Last fall I tutored freelance for SPAN 101, and I\u2019m currently applying for Spanish masters programs, so that tutoring experience would be an asset if I apply for a TA position in the future. \n\nSince this tutoring experience wasn\u2019t affiliated with the university, should I even include it on my CV? I don\u2019t want to be misleading in my application. I didn\u2019t work with a professor or team to document students\u2019 success. It was just freelance work.",

      "text": "Yes. \n\nI have read CV:s that included totally irrelevant stuff (like what they were up to as a child), but as long as it has something to do with your application, more is often better. It sometimes comes to a point, though, where a huge amount of non-significant stuff overshadows the important points. As long as you don't do that, you should be good.",

Since I\u2019m a recent grad (sorta, since I\u2019m class of 2020), I\u2019m keeping my CV to one page.\n\nSince it was freelance, do you think it should go under my Work Experience (which has my internships and such) or in its own Teaching Experience heading? If I had been affiliated with the university, I\u2019d put it under Teaching Experience no questions asked.",

(I got bored and went to Reddit to wake me up.)\n\nThey all exaggerated things to make for a better fit for the position they are applying for. I suggest you do the same. It is all part of the \"game\" and everyone involved knows this. If you think you lack in teaching experience, I would label your freelance work as such.\n\nOne way of thinking is that you want to help people out who want to hire you without getting sued by those who didn't get the job. Any objective \"proof\" or data that you can throw in there may be helpful.",

I feel really weird about saying I have teaching experience when I feel like I more or less have \u201cclarifying instructions\u201d experience. But you\u2019ve got a point. Tho I feel more comfortable just putting it under work experience for the time being. I\u2019ll reach out to my recommenders and see what they think.\n\nGood luck with what you\u2019re working on! And thanks for the tips :)",

                      "text": "I'm going to caution you about that advice. There is a line between \"I don't exactly have the right experience, but I've done this thing which provides me with relevant skills and I believe will allow me to do X\" and \"I've done the thing you say you need experience for\". Reviewers aren't stupid and as the comment above pointed out they know when people are exaggerating. When someone decides you're exaggerating the thought process usually goes one of two ways. The first is you're less than honest and chancing it. The second is you don't understand what the job actually entails. \n\nI personally wouldn't take an application forward where I think someone is exaggerating and I see lots of applications where it's clear someone is being honest about their skills. I don't believe you need to \"play the game\" or be dishonest about your experience, but you do have to be smart if you're trying to step up. If teaching experience were required for the job I would list the freelance work in your employment section and then highlight it in the application showing you have some experience but you know what's needed for the position. However, as it's a master's I can't see that you need to get into it in that level of detail. Just list it.",
