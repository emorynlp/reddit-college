  "text": "I finally hit my breaking point today and screamed out of my office a book rep that:\n\n1. Comes every fucking semester\n\n2. As me the same questions every time\n\n3. Gets the same answers every time\n\n4. Then sends emails trying to push products that I have already told him I'm not interested in\n\n5. Wants my students to spend more money that they don't have for resources that wouldn't help them do any better in class, but would contribute to a higher debt load. \n\nI'm hoping he finally got the hint today. WHEN I WANT SOMETHING I WILL FUCKING CONTACT YOU. YOU LEAVE ME 400 BUSINESS CARDS AND EMAILS. I KNOW WHERE TO FUCKING FIND YOU WHEN I NEED SOMETHING. \n\nAm I alone here?",

A few of my colleagues now have a texting system in place to alert others to the presence of reps on campus so we can pretend not to be in. ",
