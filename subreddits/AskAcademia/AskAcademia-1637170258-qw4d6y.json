  "text": "Hi guys. I'm a researcher from outside of England who will be conducting a sur-vey in England regarding plastics and climate change. I need some help with two demographic questions very specific to English systems of education and political ideology. I'm not sure if the options I include are adequate:\n\n1. What is your highest level of educational attainment:  \n\\- No finished education  \n\\- O-Level GCSE or Similar  \n\\- A-level or similar  \n\\- Bachelors degree or similar  \n\\- Postgraduate degree or similar\n2. Where do you place yourself in the political left-wing / right-wing spectrum?  \n\\- Left  \n\\- Center left  \n\\- Center / moderate  \n\\- Center right  \n\\- Right\n\nFor the first one, English education system is so weird. I looked up other surveys and these were the best options I could find. Would you guys agree? Same for the second one. I'm also asking \"what political party will you most likely vote for in the next election\", by the way.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, take caree yeaaaaaaaa!!",

      "text": "Those questions look fine although you need someone to check your spelling and grammar. As a first point survey is one word, there's no hyphen. \n\nI'm not sure what you think is weird about the English education system, all education systems have their vagaries. England has qualifications at 16 and 18 and then standard university degrees. Is that so different from the rest of the world? If you need additional advice on English education, I'm sure people here could help.",
