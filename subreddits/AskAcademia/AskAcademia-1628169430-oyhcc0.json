  "title:": "Will higher education continue to so intertwine research and teaching? Should it?",
  "text": "I'm staff in student affairs, and have been for a few years now, and in that time I've worked at a large public R1 institution, a small private liberal arts university, and a third university somewhere in the middle. There are obvious differences, but I've picked up on a few themes, triggering the question.\n\nI see the oft-mentioned \"divide\" between student affairs and academia, the divide between science and humanities, mounting teaching workloads pushed on faculty at the expense of research, teaching responsibilities passed off on underpaid adjuncts, administrative pressure on faculty to be more productive in research, and pressure on uninterested students to pursue research. I'm reading more and more about the origin of research universities, and while that origin makes sense, does it still?\n\nI realize that my breadth of experience is too limited to suggest an answer. But it seems like in the last few years at least, there is a growing divide between the teaching and research where one seems to be at odds with the other. I hear teaching & student affairs at odds with research and discovery more frequently - or maybe I just notice it more.\n\nThoughts? Opinions? Criticisms?",

I would go nuts. Even though my experience has been limited to R1/Ivy schools, I love teaching and recognize that it's very beneficial to my research. I'm in the humanities and teach a mix of core courses and seminars related to my research. The core courses keep me connected to the roots of my discipline, make sure I'm reading widely, etc. Not all students in these classes are majors, so they bring outside perspectives to bear on issues at the heart of the discipline. They always keep me thinking about interdisciplinary connections. But just on a basic level, these classes are a great break from the tunnel vision of research and they remind me why I got into my field. \n\nIn my seminars, I get to test-drive ideas for my research or open new paths for future research. Every other year or so I'll propose a seminar on a new topic that's caught my eye  and use the teaching as an excuse to master the bibliography. Then I get a couple of articles out of it.  \n\nOn top of it all, contact with students just keeps me sane. I've met full time researchers from places like the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton and a lot of them were burnt-out and miserable or had lost a couple screws along the way.",

      "text": "I think of research and teaching as two sides of the same coin. Our teaching should expose students to state of the art research via reading primary literature or even by incorporating research experience in the classroom. The point isn't to know any particular fact, it's to develop an intellectual framework in which students can understand and solve challenges in their field. Our research should involve students and allow them to deepen their understanding of the world. Confronting a problem and having to solve it yourself is immensely valuable. So I think they should be intertwined. \n\nThe problem here (I'm US-based) is that inflation-adjusted higher ed budgets in most states have either been stable or have fallen dramatically over the past two decades. My state is a middle-level cut state, having lost about 25% of state appropriations. And so tuition goes up. And so faculty get pressured to bring in external money. And so adjuncts are hired since they can be paid less and don't require start up. And so schools hire more middle managers who have no classroom experience to find ways to increase revenue or \"decrease waste\". And so they decrease funding to humanities in order to build new, shiny facilities for STEM to attract more NSF/NIH/DARPA/NOAA/DOE funds.\n\nThe problem is not that research and teaching are at odds. The problem is that as a society, we've fiscally abandoned both.",

      "text": "In my opinion (mind you, I also come from a country where non-research universities aren't a thing, and people would be absolutely shocked to know that such a thing exists) research makes me a better (and up to date) teacher, and teaching makes me aware of all the things I am not so knowledgeable about. This in turn helps me being a better researcher. I think the two are osmotic and can't be divided, and that in a sense this is the essence of being university professors.",
