  "text": "Would love to hear some stories of those taking a slow road to completion.\n\nStarted cheffing at 16, travelled the world and had a bad health incident at age 23. Started uni (Bachelors in Health Science) at 24, I'm 28 now and really need a lil break. While I feel extremely grateful for how little I've been personally affected by COVID, it really changed how uni was delivered due to almost 90% of my classes moving online (in a 50/50 theory/clinic degree).\n\nI've beaten myself up so much about having a break because I'm terrified I won't go back. But at this point my brain is fried, I have a headache all the time, and I look at a piece of assessment and cry. The passion to finish the degree is still there, but the cup is full. \n\nPlease ease my woes and tell me your long-term success stories... or not-so-successful stories? All welcome.",

      "text": "I started university in 2003. Completed 3/4 of a Bachelor of Science in Maths and Stats before leaving uni after 2005 and getting a job and working for 6 years in finance in various cities. In 2011 I got sick of finance and returned to uni, completed my BSc in Maths, added a Physics major, decided to also do a Bachelor of Arts, for which I majored in Philosophy and minored in Media Studies. I then did Honours in Physics, and started my PhD in Physics. But then I stopped the PhD halfway through and got a job teaching physics at the same university.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long journey, and I\u2019m not done yet.",

      "text": "I spent years hopping around to different places for work and picking up a class here and there. Lots of things didn\u2019t transfer and it often felt like a waste of time (although I picked up valuable knowledge along the way that at minimum enriched my life intellectually). \n\nAfter 7 years active duty Air Force I finally went back to school full time at 32, and still needed 3 years to finish my bachelors. I did have GI bill to help financially, so I didn\u2019t need to work much to get by. You might not have that luxury, so give yourself some slack. \n\nIf you need a rest, I totally get it. I would just advise you to consider taking one class per semester for awhile. Anytime I\u2019ve taken a break from school it has been very hard to go back, so keeping yourself in the learning frame of mind is helpful. That way you also don\u2019t have to jump through the hoops of admission again. \n\nUniversity is hard work, but I\u2019m really glad I persevered, finally got my degree, and went to graduate school. The knowledge I\u2019ve gained has been very enriching, and I love my career field (even if it\u2019s hard to find work at times). \n\nFor sure take care of your mental health first, and take a break if you need to, but don\u2019t abandon hope of reaching your goals. I wish you all the best.",

      "text": "Where I am from ( Germany) bachelor  is 6 semesters ( three years) and there is little to no wiggle room to move things or do them later you are basically forced to finish in the time frame. I always disliked that because I think we are grown ups and no longer at school some people have responsibilities outside university or have to work and would welcome flexibility. Depending on subject you can then proceed 2 years of master and then either finish or do PhD. I did it all in one go no breaks because I wanted to get it done. Also the \u201colder\u201d you get the less attractive you are on the job market as recent graduate. Non the less if you reached a breaking point rather take a break.",

      "text": "I started at state college in 2015, I plan on graduating summer 2022 with my bachelors in biomedical science. I had to take a few semesters off to help my family run their business, in addition to my own hardships between failing classes and losing aid. I worked at a small chain restaurant for 5 years and was furloughed due to covid. The following semester I transferred to university my credits were counted differently and they canceled my financial aid. I had to pay my tuition out of my savings. Just remember it is not a race, there\u2019s no gold star for finishing in 4 years. Matter of fact the only people I\u2019ve seen finish college in 4 years are students who had major support from family or experienced friends who have guidance and or well off with financial means. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, you are your worst critic. You\u2019re smart and have the willingness that many people would kill to have. Whenever I take a test and fail, I cry but then I have to sit back and realize how far I\u2019ve come. We are crawling toward the finish line. We can do it!",
