  "title:": "PhD Interview on Friday - Mental Health",
  "text": "Hey!\n\nOn Friday I will be having an interview regarding a phd in humanities (in Germany) - with a focus on late medieval and early modern literature. For a week now, I have already been preparing for the interview, recapping my academic work and deepening my knowledge regarding the topic. \n\nI would also like to ask some questions at the end of the interview - I think I will have 5 minutes for that. I would like to ask if the professors have had any experience in supervising research assistants with mental illnesses; since I myself suffer from depression, anxiety disorder and Pure OCD. However, I am afraid that it might scare off the interviewing professors, even though it is a very important topic for me. This is an unique opportunity and I don't want to screw it up....",

      "text": "I can understand why you might be reluctant to ask this question. You might choose to wait and see if you actually get an offer from this program. If you do, the professors you'd be working with should be very open to you asking more questions of them at that point as you discern whether or not to accept this offer.",

      "text": "I understand why you are hesitant; a question like that could impact your chances of being hired. If these professors are going to be the actual supervisors for the phd project you are applying for, I would instead ask something more concrete that you would need from them keeping your mental health in mind. For example, if you know you need deadlines and a clear structure to be able to function, ask a question about the planning for the project (and see whether they answer that by shrugging shoulders or being super detailed and with lots of deadlines). In other words: identify your key needs to be healthy/productive and find a way to ask about those topics. In the end, the most important thing is whether their supervision style would align with your needs, more than them having experience with supervising others with mental health issues.\n\nOutside of the interview, I would look up which mental health services the university has available to (phd) students and employees. Some have a student psychologist or workshops etc. This gives a good idea of whether mental health issues among phds are on the institution's radar.\n\nGood luck!",
