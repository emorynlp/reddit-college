  "title:": "Giving up on a paper and losing authorship",
  "text": "I wrote a paper which I quite disliked. It was rejected by top venues, and second wrung venues and I didn't really ever want to look at it again since it was really, genuinely, quite boring / not much of a contribution. The research methods are solid, but the findings are basically as novel as saying \"water is probably wet, but we could be wrong.\"\n\nI told this to one of my co-authors. They took the paper and submitted it to another journal and put themselves down as first author, despite not changing a word of it. Somehow, the journal was desperate enough to accept it.\n\nDespite the paper being a bit of a disaster, I'm a little miffed that I wrote every word of the paper, designed and ran all of the experiments, and saw it through two rounds of peer review, but I'm not first author. Instead, an academic from a different institution who did nothing other than \"supervise\" me / reply to a few emails is.  \n\nDue to funding relationships (we collaborate on grants the other institution 'owns' which are critical to our own lab's operations), it would probably hurt my PI to raise a stink about this. I work in industry now and there's no meaningful career benefit to having yet another first author publication from my PhD.  Meanwhile, it probably really helps the academic who took my paper.\n\nShould I just let it go? It feels like a moral injustice, but not a hill worth dying on. Perhaps they're in the right and this is accepted practice for abandoned papers? It just feels like plagiarism to claim to have written a paper that you didn't. I am still on there as second author, but in our field that typically implies that you contributed very little.",

      "text": "I think it was inappropriate for them to do it without and an explicit conversation about authorship order, and you should have been given the opportunity to sign off on the resubmission. Without knowing how the conversation about 'abandoning' the paper went, it's hard to judge whether it was reasonable/an honest mistake/malicious.\n\nThat said, I think the issue of whether your or they are entitled to the first author position is kind of a grey area. If a first author no longer wants to work on/take responsibility for a paper, then your options as a co-author are:\n\n1. Abandon the paper altogether\n2. Assume responsibility for resubmitting/revising (if needed) the paper and take the first author position\n3. Assume responsibility for resubmitting/revising (if needed) the paper and keep the same author position.\n\nIf a middle author ends up putting a lot of work in to a revision (e.g. responding to reviewers), it can lead to unfairness/resentment at the end of the process when someone has put in a lot of work for relatively little credit. In hindsight I can understand that it's frustrating if it didn't involve much work on their part, but you don't know that in advance (reviewers could ask for major revisions etc.). If you truly \"abandoned\" the paper, then I don't think it's inappropriate for a co-author to propose that they pick it up on the condition that they become first author, but that should have been agreed upon.",
