  "title:": "Reaching out to professors for thesis advisory",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an incoming masters student (STEM - Computer Science) at a US university. I reached out to a professor regarding working under his guidance as a thesis advisor. Though the professor has told me that there's no funding and that I'll have to arrange for funding myself, he's also told me that I could join the group and I have to reach out for a discussion in August (my program starts in September). I'll be an international student with no scholarship, so a funding of any kind would help me cover up financial costs. However, my research interests clearly align with the professor's. I have two queries:\n\n1) Would reaching out to other professors to get funding hamper my \"reputation\" in the long run? I do understand that professors might discuss with each other about their students, so it might happen that my name ends up in the conversation if I decide to work with some other professor.\n\n2) What do professors mean when they want to discuss? Will it be some form of interview or assessment, do they want to discuss about their research and funding, or both?\n\nThank you for your help!",

      "text": "1. Professors fully expect you to reach out to other professors at the same time and \"shop around\" a bit. However, they also expect you to be upfront if you choose to work with someone else instead of ghosting, especially if you have a decent amount of engagement first. \n2. Most professors are looking to discuss project ideas and mutual expectations. \n\nIt's a bit of an adjustment, but you have to realize going forward that interviews or anything of the like are a two-way street. You're not obligated to work with any given professor who has a project to offer. It's fine---expected, really---for you to have things you screen for when meeting a professor, too, including features like advising style, seniority, and so on.",

I just do not want to have an awkward start at the university even though I'm not working with that professor.",
