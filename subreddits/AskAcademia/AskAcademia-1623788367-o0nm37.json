  "title:": "I feel like such a failure in academia",
  "text": "Sorry for this post. I have nowhere else to turn to. To be clear, there are many things that I love in academia.\n\nI got my PhD about four years ago. I have yet to publish anything. I couldn't secure a TT-track job (duh) or post-doc (duh) so I work as a university staff member making around 50k a year. I sometimes adjunct, and I am pretty good in the classroom for the most part. I just have a problem burning out, but I have been getting better.\n\nI keep getting rejections left and right. I know it's part of the game, but it's pretty bad. For example, I tried to publish one paper from my dissertation. This topic has been getting published. So now, many of the critiques from reviewers are how the paper does not contribute to anything theoretically. However researchers keep publishing on the topic. I am running out of independent and dependent variables to tweak. I have no idea how else to reframe the paper.\n\nIn my last rejection, I originally was really excited because I had a small paper accepted in an open sourced, non-academic journal. But then, at the final hour, they decided to cut it because of \"space.\" At this point, I got so damn annoyed and emailed them back telling them to give me a serious and real answer. They said readers did not think my paper contributes to policy. (This is a project that I hope to continue, however). This makes me feel a bit gutted, because I would really like to move to researching policy.\n\nNumerous abstract rejections, grant rejects, etc. Worse still, I don't have any connections and my dissertation chair left the county and just ghosted everyone. I have no co-authors. (I used to have one, but I suspected said co-author was plagiarizing so I cut this connection).\n\nAt the risk of sounding petty and jealous (I am, don't worry), I see people with zero publications get TT-track positions. I honestly thought, given the nature of academia, this would be impossible.\n\nOn the one hand, I'm grateful I have a university staff position, and I get to live where I want to live (atm) and I don't have the pressure to publish or perish. On the other hand, it still sucks.\n\nI will say that, even since I was very young, I get a lot of complements on my presentation and oral speaking skills, so maybe my writing and framing just suck big time.\n\n**EDIT: Wow! Thank you all for the replies and the support. I know this will help others as well!**",

      "text": "I don't think you are a failure. I think you do not have the support you need to succeed in academia. I would have been absolutely lost without the support I had from my advisor and others to navigate the publication and job application processes.\n\nFour years out, I think the unfortunate truth is that it is unlikely that things are going to significantly change. Your former advisor is not likely to become suddenly present and supportive. It's hard to imagine a postdoc or a tenure-track opening go to someone four years out of a Ph.D. program with no publications. And in the event that you were able to secure a position like a one-year non-tenure track lecturer position somewhere else, I'd encourage you to think hard about whether you'd want to jeopardize the employment stability you have right now to chase this.\n\nYou're right, this does suck. In many disciplines, there are simply far more people who earn degrees than there are faculty positions available. It's not that you did anything wrong. It's that the system is not designed for everyone to achieve that goal. If you like the work you do now, consider it successful that you are gainfully employed doing something you enjoy. If you don't like what you do now, then consider searching for other positions that you might be interested in more. You can have a successful and fulfilling career. It's just might be a bit different than what you had initially envisioned.",

I don't want to trivialize it, but across the academic success spectrum this attitude is common, so don't feel like a failure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know your field, but lots of rejections on what we consider good papers can happen and really drain one's will to keep going. If you really believe in the paper, maybe look at other similar papers for analyses to replicate to ask similar questions about the data set. This is something I do in genomics sometimes, and can really help some reviewers connect to the paper more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of people getting TT jobs with little to no publications, that depends on field/reputation/networking. In my field, often the little to no publication TT hires at R1/R2 institutions is due to it being an internal hire in the subfield that school wants to expand in. Does not feel good to lose those searches, but after a few years of seeing them I eventually just started thinking of them as jobs I wasn't going to get anyway. This isn't to say your field or experience is certainly the same, but chances are it is something similarly out of your control at play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have a good university position with teaching occasionally, consider whether you are comfortable teaching full time and to lean into that, especially if your oral/presentaion skills are perhaps better than your research (not trying to assume, but just spouting ideas related to your last paragraph).",

Trying to figure things out on your own as a newly minted PhD is damn near impossible. There are field-specific expectations  for publications and grant applications that an experienced insider can help you learn and apply to your own work. \n\nFor example, I had been applying for NIH grants for years without success until I finally partnered with a more experienced colleague who was willing to share their funded grant application materials and co-author a proposal with me. It turns out that my ideas didn\u2019t suck, but the way that I was framing my specific aims and research strategy was slightly off the mark.",

You said your presentation skills are good, and so are your classes. THIS IS NOT A SMALL FEAT. Like, not at all. So many academics suck as professors. Although it's not very valued by many academics, teaching is a huge part of why I pursue this career and go through rejection, losses, etc.. So, if you feel like you're losing your chance at being a hugely successful \"academic reseacher\", remember that you are good at teaching. This is a talent (and you can improve your skills).

      "text": "You're not a failure, lets get that cleared up; however, there are some approaches that are concerning. \n\nHaving no co-authors is a major red flag, especially since PhD committees should contain multiple members who should support you. With that being said, you're still a novice to having your doctoral degree. TT job rejections and grant rejections are par for the course, don't be discouraged by that........lord knows it takes 500 attempts to get 1 of these (exaggeration, but partially true). \n\nNumerous abstract rejections is concerning, as while they aren't automatic acceptances, they are fairly easy to come by. With the aforementioned lack of support from senior faculty/researchers, I think a big issue is writing/writing quality. WE ALL SUCK AT WRITING, but being new to the arena, you NEED senior guidance. While your chair may have ghosted the world, you still work at a university and still should have connections with your committee. There are resources all around you, and you need to reach out to them. You state that papers are being published on your topic, yet you keep getting rejected, sounds like you're either 1) not targeting the correct journals, 2) you're not selling your research appropriately, 3) your writing isn't up to their standard.  All 3 issues can be resolved by someone with experience. Once again, its not your fault, its the process. I am in my post-doc and I continuously find myself sucking at those same 3 things, even tenured faculty will find themselves sucking at those things from time to time, its all part of the job. \n\nRemember, while a PhD is a terminal degree, its just the first step into your career. Trust me, you have SO much to learn. Reach out to senior faculty in your department, reach out to your committee, and get some guidance and support. I know they'll be happy to help :)",

Nowadays hiring in the academic industry is very heartless and you need to display attributes of a Prof before you can even be considered for a tenure-track.

      "text": "You're not a failure. Let me guess - your PhD advisor and/or others in your PhD program pushed the idea that you're a failure if you don't get a tenure track job, or maybe they told you that you're not \"dedicated\" enough to academia if you pursue any of your interests outside of your PhD. My spouse's toxic PhD program was like that. It's all bullshit.\n\nMy spouse has an academic job - he's a Visiting Assistant Professor. He has a number of publications under his belt. He has presented at several conferences. Yet he makes roughly the same amount of money as you do, $50,000 a year. And when his contract ends, he will have to find a new job (likely in a different state), while it sounds like your position is more long term and secure.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, most people with PhDs never get tenure track jobs. Even academics who did everything \"right\" and publish in all the \"right\" places often dont get tenure track jobs, because [only about a quarter of university faculty jobs are tenure or tenure track](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/12/about-three-quarters-all-faculty-positions-are-tenure-track-according-new-aaup). When there are literally hundreds of applicants for every tenure track opening, even if only half of those applicants are well-qualified for each role, that's still a lot of qualified, talented, and hard-working people who will never get the chance to pursue tenure.\n\nPerhaps it's time to ask yourself why you want a tenure track academic job so badly, and start thinking of alternative ways to define success for yourself. For example, if you want an academic job because you love to teach, perhaps instead you could continue adjuncting as a side gig, get qualified to teach high school, or volunteer as a tutor in your local community. If you love research, perhaps you could consider applying for research-oriented industry jobs, or pursuing research as a hobby.\n\nIf it's prestige and fancy academic titles that you're trying for, I think you're going to find yourself disappointed even if you achieve them. It takes much more than just a job or title to achieve happiness and personal fulfillment, and there are plenty of people out there working what they thought would be their dream jobs, yet they're still miserable. A job is an important aspect of your life, but it shouldn't be the only aspect. Your job is not your identity.\n\nAnd please keep in mind that no one is going to come and take your PhD away if you have a career outside academia. A PhD is still an achievement, even you end up in an unrelated career field. Plus, the writing, teaching, research, and other intangible skills that you picked up during your PhD pursuit will likely serve you well in a wide variety of career paths. Whatever you end up doing, please don't ever feel like you're \"wasting\" your PhD. Let me repeat: you're not a failure!",

          "text": "Thank you. Yeah, you're right. It's crazy how academia has turned out. An old professor likened it to the structure of a Wal-Mart.,where many of the employees are just adjuncts being exploited and a few at the top reaping the benefits. But even now, it's gotten so much worse. I'm even seeing people with tenure getting fired, and schools straight up closing.",

We are on different trajectories in our lives and some are harder than others - I wonder if taking a good break, if you can afford it, will be helpful for clearing your mind and thinking about next steps? \n\nA professor once told me that she got into academia serendipitously, and I find that word so fitting for many of the circumstances that academics face. The professor teaches Yoga on weekends, and another quit to become a full-time artist. \n\nDepending on your area of research, you can always go and venture into other careers, take a step back and think about what habits to build to facilitate going towards another direction. \n\nThe measures of success in academia like \"publish or perish\" mean little to the past generation and to the outside world. How you contribute to the community, whether that's through non-conventional methods like publishing on Medium, or sharing your knowledge through teaching as you are already doing, are immensely successful by all measures. \n\nBe well, my friend!",
