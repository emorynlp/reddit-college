  "title:": "Suddenly getting zero requests to review journal articles",
  "text": "Last year I was getting at least 2 requests to review journal articles a month. I don't think I ever turned one down and I tried to be thorough in my reviews. This year, it has trickled down to nothing-- I haven't gotten asked since sometime in Feb/March and I'm wondering what the deal is. Not that I really mind.. it's sort of nice not to always have a paper to review, but it feels nice to be asked. Anybody have any insight as to why my requests have disappeared? I'm sitting here wondering if I did such a terrible job that they stopped asking?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: because this seems to be a point of confusion, I am not complaining about not having the work to do, just concerned about the reason why!",

              "text": "Like others said, 4 months isn't really long to wait, could be natural ebb and flow. But if you're not getting requests from your regular journals by eg the end of the year, then yes it might be due to something about the reviews you were returning. Likely not, but it happens. \n\nAs someone with editorial roles, the most common issue I see with early career reviewers is that they get a bit too hung up on details that matter much less than the major things we're looking for - in my field that's an assessment on whether the paper uses appropriate analysis and methodology, accuracy, timeliness etc - and are returning reviews that are more appropriate to journal club (usually getting stuck on details that come down to reasonable academic choice). Sometimes it's also because they get too invested in being right, and don't back down when appropriate. But mostly it's the former - well meant reviews that just miss the mark a tiny bit and suggest the reviewer just needs a touch more time in the field. \n\nIt's very likely that this is not what's happening here, because it's still very early days. Hang tight to the end of the year, but if the regular journals still aren't asking by then, then at that point, yes it might be your reviews. And if they happens, then when you get a new request from another journal, you'll have a chance to consider your style afresh. It's not a big deal if so - just part of growing into a new role that none of us are formally trained for. Best of luck.",

      "text": "The (Elsevier) journal I am an Editor for has a submission system.  From my side it will suggest about 100 potential referees based on title (as far as I can see) and I think keywords.  I will then try and match good potential referees based on selections from that list.  I can see total publications and h-index, and can mine down for further details if I need to.  All this is driven by Scopus as the underlying database.  I do get a couple of additional bits of information.  Policy now likes to spread invites across experience and gender where possible.\n\nSo, lets say for example my journal does \"insects\".  If you have published papers on, say \"bees\" and I get a submitted manuscript ion bees, chances are you will hit my radar.  If I do not get an submission on \"bees\", chances are you will not.\n\nThe second side is that covid-19 has distorted the normal work load.  Submissions on covid-19 can fit in my journal profile, so my journal has been SWAMPED with submissions.  95% of submissions are covid-19 related.  Anybody who has any possible link to covid is writing in that area.  We do not get submissions at this point on say, Alzheimer's, or Rheumatism.  Reviewers who are qualified to do covid papers are limited, and they are hammered with requests.  I might be asking 40 or 50 people to find a review panel of TWO.  \n\nSo, enjoy your down time.  I expect submissions in other areas will pick up eventually.  And just be thankful that bees do not transmit covid-19.",
