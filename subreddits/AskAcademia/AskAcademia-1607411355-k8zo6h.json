  "title:": "Is this postdoc killing me? What should I do?",
  "text": "It's 7am. I woke up two hours ago, my heart going a hundred miles per hour. Seven hours ago, at midnight, I left the lab, got home, ate a disgusting takeout meal, and went to bed.\n\nIt wasn't like this before this year. I was a happy scientist. There were more productive scientists than me, and that was fine as far as I was concerned. My work was creative. I read broadly, within my field but often outside it. I came up with new methods all the time, some of which worked, some of which didn't. And I kept reasonable hours, and my after hours were my after hours. At home I cooked delicious meals and baked pies. I lifted weights and exercised regularly. I had interests, friends. I got stoned and went to museums. I slept like a baby. I felt that if I got to stay in academia, great; if I didn't, also great. Did I publish at the speed of others? No. But I had a high impact paper, of which I'm very proud, and I think is a consequence of me approaching science as a joy and creative effort, as opposed to a grind. In short, I was fulfilled, and felt like I was my own master.\n\nSometime after quarantine ended here, things changed. The sympathy we had all received for this shit year ended, and our PI seemed to demand repayment plus interest. Other postdocs who were similar to me, left for industry. The newer students and postdocs essentially sleep in the lab. During our last group meeting one postdoc asked for permission to have lab access to work until 4am. We have a sign-in sheet to see who's still in the lab, and when I leave at midnight, I see their names. I wake up to dozens of Slack and WhatsApp messages. They never stop. In other words, the PhDs and postdocs discipline each other, egg each other on to work later and later. And yet, despite working like a dog, I received a passive-aggressive email from my PI about how more was expected of me. It was suggested that funding may or may not be extended, depending on how productive I am. It was suggested that me taking holidays this year will be an inconvenience, as my collaborator does not plan on taking any. \n\nAny joy I felt in science is gone. The work I do is rote and mechanical and uninspired, but I am being \"productive.\" There is no science here, not really, and I feel I am only contributing to introducing noise into the system... more miscellanea that will only lead to more publications from other groups. Scientists gazing into their omphalous. Despite the supposed prestige of this lab and institution, I feel my coworkers and PI are idiots. I remember the PIs and PhD students at my former institution, which was far less prestigious and hoity-toity, being much more curious and intelligent. The ones I used to work with here, who have left for industry, as well. My current colleagues seem completely uninterested in scientific questions, in how things work. They love meetings. They love applying for and getting fellowships.  They love \"producing results,\" like it's some kind of gross quantifiable product like potatoes or widgets. They love conferences, but not the fun parts like traveling and free drinks and conversation\u2014They love saying \"Hi Dr. So-and-so, really amazing work. Have you thought of...\"  Anyway, I don't want to linger on this point any longer. The state of scientific research is a contentious topic, and frankly one that I would like to not think about anymore than I already do.\n\nAnd I can do that by leaving this postdoc, academia, and research as a whole. But I am more afraid that this period will cause me permanent damage, psychologically and physically. I feel anxious all the time and can't relax, and I have not felt this way before. I can work all day, all weekend, and still feel guilty for not working on my one hour off. I feel tired and angry all the time. I had so many hobbies. I read, I wrote, I composed, I painted, I built things, I gardened... All past tense. It's a lack of time, but also, a lack of *desire* to do anything other than work, sleep, stuff my face, and masturbate. I don't have the energy and my brain is dead. I try to watch a movie, but my eyes are focused two inches behind the screen, and I am thinking about work. I'm not, as I used to do, thinking about physics. I'm thinking about *work*\u2014It's just stupid, \"Gotta do this before Tuesday. Need to finish that by Wednesday. Thursday is going to be so busy,\" etc.\n\nIn short, they broke me... Or they're breaking me, I can't tell. I'm probably losing hair. Often, the only thoughts that put me to sleep are those of suicide. When things get real bad I call a hotline, but it's not like there's a great mystery as to why I'm feeling like a shit. There's a very obvious, very material reason why not existing seems preferable to existing right now. Other nights I indulge in healthier fantasies, like a life of crime or becoming a professional beach bum. Anyway, I know these periods can actually stay with a person for a long time and do permanent damage. I've seen this kind of thing break other people, and I don't want it to break me, but I'm not sure what to do. I love who I am\u2014or perhaps, used to be\u2014and don't want to lose that.\n\nSo I am looking for advice or commiseration or anything...",

      "text": "I will forever beat the drum that scientists need to work less and develop some class consciousness. This is exactly what I mean. Really, you need to just fucking stop it. No meetings, no discussions, just stop it. Work 9-5 and be *hard* on yourself about that. What\u2019s the fucking worst thing that will really happen? Maybe this psycho doesn\u2019t renew your contract. Oh no, heaven forbid, you don\u2019t get to work with this guy for *another* 3 years? Jesus Christ, please give yourself a shake. Your time is *valuable*. You are not in some Bangladeshi factory, you won\u2019t be beaten or insta-fired if you decide to work human hours. \n\nLet me tell you this: whatever scary thing you are afraid will happen if you start acting like a normal person, it\u2019s not worse than what will happen if you keep this up. I lost two years of my life to a mental breakdown in the middle of my first attempt at a PhD that I ended up quitting on the worst possible of terms. If I could go back in time I\u2019d beat myself senseless until I agreed to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid! You don\u2019t have to do this, you have agency. I will never side with these exploitative scumbags but at a certain point it is on you for letting yourself be completely steamrolled without standing up for your own fucking interests, because of what, peer pressure?\n\nJoin a club that starts at 6. Maybe a martial art, something that lasts more than an hour. Get a dog. Get a hobby and hold yourself to doing it. Do not set up experiments that will keep you past 5 or on the weekends. Become one of those obsessive clock watchers. Embody Stanley from The Office. *Nothing will fucking happen.*\n\nYour PI might say they are concerned. They might say they are disappointed in you, they might give you a lecture about how science must be your hobby and vocation rather than a job. They are your enemy, ignore them. If you step back and think about it, it\u2019s a bit laughable that you are honestly considering not availing yourself of your legal right to holidays because your PI said it would be \u201cinconvenient\u201d. At that point you\u2019re just letting yourself get dommed by your literal class enemy.\n\nYou should know something that is basically a universal rule in work: The more you give, the more they take. You keep working like a slave, they will keep expecting that output and be disappointed when you falter. What you need to do now is *recalibrate their expectations* by simply stopping. No work after 5! And that includes emails. \n\nI insist that you develop a life and personality outside the lab. There are libraries filled with books that you may never read, how can you tolerate it? How can you tolerate staring a lab/computer when there is so much to experience in this world? And it\u2019s yours to experience if you get a grip. Stop underestimating your value and your leverage because your coworkers do. Stop being so affected by your boss saying the kinds of things bosses always say. Step off the hamster wheel, and stop believing the bullshit.  Science is a job, not a calling. If someone out there has a comfortable life with secure employment and maybe a nice traditional nuclear family with a traditional housewife cooking and cleaning at home, so that they can consider science a \u201chobby\u201d or a \u201cpassion\u201d that\u2019s nice for them. The rest of us are being exploited by them breaking our bodies and spirits to help them solve their little intellectual puzzles and pad their trophy shelf. \n\nJust stop now, it\u2019s on you and no one else at this point.",

I'm in the UK, and I stood on the picket line every day of the strike, until the very last day when COVID hit us. So in a way, I do have class consciousness. But I guess I got weak, and they got to me.\n\nIn a way, it's been a very educational experience, because it seemed so easy to me: Just go home and do something else. Just stop at 5. I was the guy giving the speech you're giving now to my coworkers! And I still totally agree with it; every last bit. But now I see in a very visceral way how intimidation, fear, and work culture works. And because COVID largely destroyed many of the things I did do outside work, such as sports, socializing, face-to-face union meetings, it became so much easier for work to take over the rest of it.",

              "text": "It's good you have that side to you, that already puts you ahead of like 80% of scientists lol.\n\nHere's what I'll say. You said elsewhere in the thread that you see this as a collective action problem. It isn't really. You are not at risk of being fired, in which case it absolutely would be, but it isn't.\n\nAll that will happen if you take the path I suggested is that you are unlikely to get the chance of being a high flier. You might get a lukewarm LOR, you might not get that big paper, and you might not get that fellowship. But so what? This is kind of what I mean by drinking the Kool-Aid. One very easily gets sucked into the incentive structure of chasing papers and glory for yourself because you want to be a hotshot. At a certain point you do need to make a choice: do you keep chasing the big papers and the gilded fellowships, or do you say \"No, it's just not worth it anymore.\"?\n\nYou can absolutely be a scientist who works 9-5. Plenty of people manage it just fine. Maybe not indefinitely if you are committed to staying in academia. But are you really so desperate to be a PI yourself that this lifestyle is actually worth it to you? Based on your post I think not. If you are worried about the dreaded \"eternal postdoc\" problem, don't be really. Every post-doc is a chance to get new marketable skills for a semi-stable industry job. Plenty of people do that. Just keep your eyes on what recruiters are after and if you see an opportunity jump on it.\n\nI'd also echo /u/bacon_music_love \\-- maybe a computer hobby is a good idea in the COVID era. I got really into PC parts and gaming, and the pandemic never stopped me going long walks with my dog.",

One of the things that inspired me to change course was seeing how the post docs who worked 9-5 in my old lab were much more focused and productive than me during the working day. Every extra hour you work after an 8-9h day is increasing the chances that you make a mistake you\u2019ll have to spend weeks fixing, or the chances you\u2019ll be completely tired and unproductive the next day. Eventually it\u2019s not even a case of diminishing returns to working hours so much as negative returns.

The transition from an exciting 'journey' of data collection into a rampant demand for daily results can be very uninspiring.\n\nPersonally for me, I've decided that leaving academia now is the right decision. There are many other jobs out there for people who possess our skill set. Unfortunately, the requirements for this position most likely won't get better, but only worse. Especially if you can't see yourself wanting to progress and become a lecturer or PI, this job may not be worth the long-term sacrifices and pain.\n\nAnother option besides leaving academia is switching labs, which I'm sure you've already considered. The PI determines the work pace mostly, maybe find a lab which has more of a work-life balance and who value your contributions.\n\nEDIT: From the sounds of it, your PI is a dick. Any further communication with him is not worth your time. Mostly likely, he won't attempt to understand your point of view. Treating your employees with respect and having consideration for their life outside of work is something only a select number of PIs possess. I was lucky enough to have a great PI for my PhD, who was understanding and caring. I hope you find someone similar if you decide to stay in this field.",

If your overall quality of life is deteriorating so much, you should adress that as quickly as possible. You know that it is related to your professional work, so eliminate that from your life, at least temporarily, and focus on getting better until you can figure things out.  \n\nYour work is an implicit investment in your future.

If you can't do this, establish some firm boundaries for yourself.  Schedule out your day, stick to it, and don't answer work emails after hours.  If you need to, put tasks likes grocery shopping and meal prep into your schedule and treat those tasks as just as important as your lab work.  How do you organize your work tasks?  Do you write them down or keep them all in your head?  If you're doing the latter, I highly recommend writing them down as it will be one less thing your brain is trying manage.\n\nI would also have a frank conversation with your PI about what his demands are doing to his lab group.

We're told its not just a job, that everything you do in it benefits your future and so working longer and harder is just for your own benefit. In real terms however, that's bullshit, its a job that we are contracted to work 40 hrs per week and are paid relatively poorly at that. Your boss can have unrealistic expectations, but in the end you only legally owe them 40 hrs per week. \n\nIt sounds like you've already know that this can't continue on as it is. It sounds like your priorities lie elsewhere and thats perfectly fine. Live the life you want, not to someone else's expectations. It doesn't matter if your PI is disappointed in you. Aren't you disappointed in them for being a bad mentor? When did their expectations of you, start to matter more than your own expectations for yourself? I went through the same thing and recognized my priorities were focussed on a healthy balance and that continuing in academia wasn't for me. It sounds like this might be similar to how you're feeling currently. At that point I realized my PI had less of a hold over me, if I wasn't continuing in academia I needed their approval less - at worst they might give me a bad reference to industry but I could also choose not to use them as a reference. Revel in this revelation - your PIs expectations of you have nowhere as much hold over you. In industry only your skillset matters and its not like your PI can erase your skillset.  \n\nOnce I realized this, the question became why am I still doing this? Why haven't I left already? What purpose does my post-doc serve if I don't plan to continue on in academia? Does that purpose equate to a difference of 60K a year in salary? The answer for me was that I needed a paper as a sweetener for companies to hire me given the extra hurdle of them needing to support my work visa. So based on that I came up with an exit plan. Mine became publishing a paper and getting out ASAP. My goal became doing what was needed to get that paper, but also accepting I wasn't going to kill myself for it. I largely stopped working weekends and 12 hr days. It required a re-framing of my approach, I worked my ass off for those 40 hrs I was contracted to work, but I didn't feel I owed my boss more than that. If I worked overtime it was to serve my goal of getting my paper out ASAP, not to serve my PI. It was to benefit me, not someone else. As a result I felt I had more control over my life and my mood lightened. \n\nDevelop an exit plan. Can you leave straight away or do you want to publish. Recognize if your plan is to leave in the short term that you're going to need to carve time out for yourself - both for your mental health- and literally time to work on making job application. You can't do that if you're working til midnight every night! You'll get through this time! Take back control of your life!",

      "text": "I think a lot of noise is because just the eqonomy in general is a noise these days, and production is so much more noisy when all the bosses and leaders have pandemic anxiety. Their crutch is to be able to point to a high product statistic, so that's the impact we have to deal with. But changing a few ways on how you work according to this might help. Whenever possible use a dictator and then just spend the writing time spell checking and editing to produce text, and citing big parts of other people works are useful when you can't find the time to invent new things alone.\nSet up several alike, but varied experiments and document them as their own projects to make two of one whenever you can, and try to find more ways that are useful to you. Sometimes comparing two models that belong to the same genre can reveal another model that would combine the first two, and you'll have a sort of product model to follow from there that can be easily documented.\nI wish you all of the best luck!",

My joy for science has come back, although not as strongly as I now have time for hobbies. All I can think is how relieved I don't work for that PI anymore. I know the workload and environment is completely different since my experience was only grad school but I was also pushed to my limits mental healthwise. Honestly, that job isn't worth your life. I can't say how it would affect you career path, I'm sure there are are other postdoc or PIs that can chime in for that, but at the end of the day it sounds like it is making you miserable. I would get out. Sorry this is happening to you and sorry I can't be of more help. But take care of yourself because it is clear this PI will not.",

There are deadlines, there need to be papers and grants otherwise no money. This is not harassment. This is training. Imagine you are running a start up. You have to raise money to survive. You have to produce and to produce in short timelines, excellent repeatable results. No one is going to gift you their money to walk around the lab like a butterfly. If you don't deliver you just failed. Doesn't mean anything because you can get back again but still. The secret here is to learn coping mechanisms so you don't burn out AND to get desensitized to pressure. By getting desensitized to pressure you are trained to deliver under immense pressure or at least not to die if you don't but accept loss with dignity.",
