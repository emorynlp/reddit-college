  "title:": "4th Year Phd...My Advisor Was Denied Tenure...",
  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found out this morning that my advisor was denied tenure. His contract runs through May 2020, which is conceivably when I should graduate, but I have so many questions. I very firmly do NOT want to switch advisors, he's the most supportive professor I've ever met and has been helping me develop my research all 4 years of the program so he is very familiar with my work and is supportive despite my fairly controversial dissertation topic (I'm doing applied stats in a political science program). I'm his only student. I don't know what happens next...has anyone been through this? What happens now? I'm devastated. ",

And maybe your grad school faculty rep (my department had one faculty responsible for all the grad students and would handle matters like this).  When my department had this happen to one of their faculty, he had two students: a first year master's student and a fourth year PhD student.  The Masters was able to finish before he left but the PhD student had to switch pans cause she couldn't finish in time.  She ended up having to start a new project and took longer.  The sooner you figure out if you are going to push like lightening to finish before he leaves or switch advisors.  \n\nMy department has allowed outside University committee members if you had enough members from the department on your committee.  I wonder if you can switch your advisor into one if these outside advisors if he does leave before his contract is up.  Don't know if it would work.",

Disagreeing on substance, plus potential bad feelings toward the department, might be messy. ",

Find out if he's planning on staying out his contract. My advisor didn't get tenure and quit a month later (although he was secretly planning on quitting for a while, I believe) which left me in a difficult position. Your greatest ally in this situation is foreknowledge. \n\nEdit: Also, assuming you have a committee, talk to them as well. One of your committee members may end up being your new advisor (this is what my department tried to have me do), so make sure there is somebody there who is on your side and who you mutually like.

Also having the new guys name on the diss is probably better than the guy who didn't get tenure. \n\nThe bad - Dude is on a new job search. Don't expect nearly the amount of help/advice than you were getting before. You're at a point though where you should be close to finishing up. (But then, my 'expected graduation dates' moved quite a bit.) This will light a fire under your ass to make sure you finish and do it quickly. ",

I stayed behind at the school and finished my work and then they skyped into my defense. The main thing you need to figure out is if you'll have funding leading up to your defense. If your advisor can't fund you maybe your department will let you TA. Or they will let you graduate early. That is kind of what happened with me. I was actually suppose to graduate in the Spring but because my advisor left, I could only be funded for one more semester so I ended up defending in the fall and no one on my committee really gave me a hard time about it because we all knew the situation I was in. To be fair my advisor announced they were leaving and then were gone like 2 months later- it happened very quickly",

I'm in a similar situation, entire institute jumped to another uni leaving the students behind. \n \nThe bad news is, it is REALLY hard to transfer a PhD to a different school. The university which raided us was inclined to be extra generous since they basically stabbed one of their sister state-schools in the back, but they still refused to recognize our prelims and qualifiers. They would only allow few credits of research to be transfered, at best half of the coursework. They also insisted we go through the intro seminars and required fluff. IIRC they required 2/3rds of the degree be done with them, which for most of us, was almost like starting from scratch. It would have added about three+ years for me and I'm (hopefully) a few months away. Really horrible deal IMHO. \n\nIf your prof finds a new job, you should certainly ask about the specifics of transferring, but almost certainly you'll be better off finishing where you are, if you can.\n\nThe good news is, your department should be willing to go out of their way to help you meet requirements. Ours went out of their way to streamline the process, make exceptions for specific classes and other minor issues, and help us find co-chairs, short-term funding, etc. You have 14 months, now is the time to make it count. You can do it, and maybe if you like the prof, follow them for a post-doc.",
