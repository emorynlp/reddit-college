If you were supposed to read 11 books to possibly be discussed and you only read one and a half, that's not good.\n\nIf this is mostly about your paper, then try to focus on that.\n\nIt also sounds like maybe you're procrastinating a bit on reading and writing. At some point you just have to sit down and get to work.\n\nDid you set any other expectations for this meeting with the prof? If so did you meet those expectations? If so, can you try to focus on those at the meeting?",

      "text": "Do not assume that he has read your manuscript. Be prepared to clearly explain what your research is about, what you have done so far, some ideas of what you are planning to do next, and how your research contributes to the area that you are working in.\n\nIf he has assigned you 11 books, I am sure he is not expecting you to be an expert in them in a month. Try and get the general ideas of each of the books, and perhaps a reason why he might have assigned them to you (e.g., related to your work, how the books shape the research domain you are in, potential directions moving forward, etc.).",
