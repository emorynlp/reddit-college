When hiring for a TT position the departmental members of the committee are selecting someone with whom they are likely to work for the *remainder of their careers* and who might in fact become their \"boss\" some day (if it's a department with rotating chairs). I've seen a great many candidates who looked good on paper and were fine in a Skype or conference interview blow it completely on campus when they revealed all manner of qualities that made people not want to work with them-- personality, mistreatment of students or classified staff, arrogance, sexism, classism, you name it. Faculty at my school tend to get tenure and stay for decades...even with a wave of retirements in recent years our average length of service is over 15 years. Nobody wants to work with a jerk, or even with someone who you suspect may not carry their weight in service or be a good advisor or want to collaborate or who may decide to live 75 miles away and only be on campus 9-2 on M/W/F.  It's a buyers' market and the buyer is *always* going to go with the person who is most qualified *and* the best fit-- but you can't teach fit, and many academics are simply not that nice to be around.",

If someone lives 75 miles away but does what they are paid to do then how is that your business? \n\nIt depends on your campus situation, but at mine it does matter a lot: we are ~75 miles from a a major city and faculty who chose to commute are simply not available to carry their shares of the workload. It's been an issue for us for decades, but much more so in recent years as more people chose to do so. If they were in fact around to attend faculty/committee meetings in the late afternoons and were willing to teach the 800am classes we must cover it would be less of a problem-- but they are not. Most faculty are long over hearing excuses like \"my carpool leaves at 400 so I can't serve on any committees\" or \"I can't get to work before 900am so I can't teach the 800am intro sections ever.\" Not to mention the lack of participation in evening events, which on a residential campus like ours are important-- the faculty to *do* cover all of these things get bitter after a while. \n\nIt's not about sitting in an office at all-- it's about being available to do the job you were hired to do. We've had people risk tenure by not doing these things, but there's little we can do about it *after* tenure is awarded. If we were a commuter campus with faculty who were only expected to show up to teach it wouldn't be an issue, but at a residential SLAC faculty are expected to be present for all sorts of obligations beyond classes. When some do not, the burden unfairly shifts to others. There are a few long-distance commuters who do their share of the work, but most don't, so it has become a serious issue over the years.",

When 75% of the faculty do that work and the others don't, it's a problem.  Though honestly, most folks don't get too upset about those who never show up in the evenings...it's the not being there during the day that's the bigger problem, as our students are in the departments looking for faculty all the time. There's an expectation that faculty are not only advising, but teaching ILPs (independent projects), mentoring undergraduate researchers, and are simply available for their students.  \n\nThere are different expectations at different kinds of institutions. At ones like ours student contact is very high on the list, and you can't do that when you aren't on campus. I typically spend 15-20 hours a week in one-on-one or small group meetings with my students, which would be hard to do if I was only on campus a few days a week.",

Those of us who frequently chair SLAC search committees are quite aware of this bias and expressly do not want to hire people who feel that way-- we are flooded with candidates in every search, 75% of which are very well qualified, so why *wouldn't* we give preference to those who demonstrate in their file and in person that they have experience with the SLAC world, understand the model, and *want* to spend their careers in that setting?\n\nThere are up and down sides to any academic job. I set out years ago specifically to forge a career at an SLAC (which didn't thrill all of my committee members). I've served on over two dozen search committees in the years since and learned it's usually pretty easy to tell who is likely to stay and flourish in the SLAC environment, and who is not; I've seen the \"not\" happen often enough in other departments to recognize the signs.",

The worst \"slacking off\" I've witnessed by far was at two different public comprehensives where faculty only dropped in to teach and still weren't really producing much scholarship.  In any case, one would obviously need a much larger sample than either of us have to make any meaningful statements. I'm just reacting to the broad assumption that \"R1 is superior to SLAC\" that comes up all the time-- superior in some ways, sure, but not everyone wants that sort of job. And I'd argue that just as not everyone is suited for the R1 treadmill there are many who are not suited to the other types of positions out there.",

There are many people who can be successful at either, and many people who would be better at one. I certainly don't think R1s are the only places to be. In fact, many R1s have deep issues. For example, at lower-ranked R1s, there's the pressure to compete with top R1s when you can't really get students of nearly the same caliber. SLACs are definitely a nice place to be. I noticed a major dropoff in scholarship quality after the top 20 or so of them (as in, I went to lower-ranked SLACs and got an intense \"fake college to insulate rich white people\" feel). Of course, there are good and bad departments everywhere.",

Maybe that's a good thing. The largest places I've worked or consulted for have been about 6-7K students, barring the R1 where I taught while finishing my Ph.D..  There is indeed quite a range in any case. I agree that some people are suited to most, though I suspect rarely all...not many people I've ever met would be able to shift from an R1 research environment to the 5/5 teaching load of a CC. But I'm sure there are exceptions, just as I know some CC faculty who are quite productive scholars!",

I'm \\~25 years in at my SLAC and a long-time department chair: we *always* contact finalists directly and in timely fashion as soon as a contract has been signed by another candidate. That's usually within two weeks of the final on-campus interview. In our case, the provost makes the offer and the search chair makes the bad news calls (which is a drag, I've done dozens of them). But we always call and share the news personally with anyone who has been to campus.\n\nWe also send direct, personal notice to everyone who was short-listed or interviews remotely at earlier stages. The only people who get the \"Thanks, no thanks\" emails from H.R. are those in the large pool who were never really considered beyond their applications and with whom the search committee never had direct contact.\n\nIt's wrong for schools to ghost candidates.",

He can easily hop jobs. I'm more or less stuck. Sure, I could probably wrangle another offer from some University 1000 miles from here in a city I've never been to, but it would uproot my family.

      "text": "A few thoughts: \n\nIn many universities, no one is allowed to contact or engage with candidates until the final offer has been accepted.  If you were choice #2, for example, they aren't going to tell you this while they are negotiating with choice #1.  However, once the decision is made I agree that you should have been informed that the position had been filled.  Once any type of interview has been conducted I agree that candidates should be contacted with the outcome so they can move on.\n\nIn any case, try not to take it personally--you were obviously qualified or they wouldn't have invited you, but someone else who interviewed was just a better fit.  This can be for a variety of reasons (research agenda, publication history, courses you are qualified to teach, who your letters of recommendation are from, how you got along with the other faculty members, etc.)  As you see, most of these things aren't personal, so try not to take it that way. \n\nYou said that this is year #2 without an academic job.  It appears your heart is set on an R1, but may I suggest applying to universities within a different classification just to get your foot in the door in academia?  Publish like crazy while you are at the new university and then you can apply to an R1 in a few years.  I know it is more difficult to move up to an R1 when you start academia in a school in lower tier, but if you publish as if you were in an R1 you should still have a great chance (if that remains your goal--you may find you like your new university.)  Getting your foot in the door in academia gets you into (paid) conferences and other networking possibilities that you won't have if you aren't in academia at all.\n\nI hope this didn't sound like a criticism of your choices so far--just wanted to offer advice on another path to R1 than what you may have considered.  I have, in fact, seen several people do exactly what I suggested in paragraph #2.  Whatever route you take, good luck, and hang in there.",
