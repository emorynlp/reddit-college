  "text": "Although I'm not in the correct financial situation at the moment, I'm looking to perhaps take one of the 2 or 3 year part-time versions of the MA listed here: [https://www.soas.ac.uk/japankorea/programmes/majapstud/](https://www.soas.ac.uk/japankorea/programmes/majapstud/)\n\nI have spoken to them before and I meet all the requirements. They were however very unhelpful when it came to telling me how their 2 and 3 years versions of the degree are organised. Does anyone have any idea how this would work?\n\nThe content for the full-time 1 year course is the same for the part-time 2 and 3 year courses, so would there just be huge gaps between modules? Would each module get doubled or tripled in length for me? I would still need to attend classes in person, I presume module lengths must stay the same.\n\nThere are various possibilities I have come up with in my head, but I won't enumerate them here, instead I'll just see if you lovely people have any experience or knowledge about this?\n\n(Also, not sure what I should have put as the flair. I guess this one fit best.)",

      "text": "Disclaimer I haven't looked in depth at the link you sent. But the way master's courses usually work in the UK is modules last half the academic year. So say you need to do 6 modules (a, b, c, d, e, f) for the masters you'd do a, b, c in the first half of the year followed by d, e, f. For the part time course you take fewer at a time so you're still studying for the full academic year but you'd be doing maybe 2 modules followed by 1 module, summer break, 1 module followed by 2 modules, ie a and b, then d, summer break c, then e and f. And then there's the dissertation which some places allow you to break up over the time but others don't.",

      "text": "I think you are overthinking this a little, don't worry too much about it. It's like any other part-time program that you could have followed during your undergrad if you wanted. There are no separate classes for part-time students and full-time students. It would require twice the number of professors or it would just overload their professor's work. You attend the same class as full-time students, but unlike them, you will have fewer classes per semester.\n\nMaybe the university expects their students to register for the classes themselves by following the program outline and recommendations of the classes to attend and in which order, like you would do when you were in undergrad. In other words, there might not be a ''defined'' program to follow for part-time students. If that's the case, then ask the university which courses are given yearly only and which courses are critical (aka classes that are pre-requisites to attend others). You will need to organize your classes in an order that will minimize the time that you spend in your program.\n\nFor example, if you were to take 5 classes as a full-time student for the fall semester, you would only be taking 2 classes instead. Attend the classes that would be pre-requisite for those given during the winter semester and prioritize the ones who are given every year only. During the winter semester, you repeat the same strategy and try to do the classes you missed during the previous semester. Depending on the program, the program's structure can be different for every part-time student.",

      "text": "I did a masters that was offered as full time or part time (not the same uni as you). In mine the full time students attended classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The part time students attended on Tuesdays for year one and Thursdays for year two. The length of time for each module and assignments was the same for full time and part time students. From the looks of the fee structure for your course you can pick modules and attend them over two years or three. So using my course as an example you could do year one Monday only, Year two Tuesday only, year three Thursday only, OR do year one Monday and Tuesday only and year two Thursday only. I hope this makes sense! (These days of the week are for illustration purposes only.)",
