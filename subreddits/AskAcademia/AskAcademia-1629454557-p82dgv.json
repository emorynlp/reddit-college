  "text": "Hello, \n\nI had a question about how you explain what you 'do' as a researcher/ lecturer. I am an early career researcher in Ireland, and my family and friends know generally that I teach, but during the summer I have had to explain a lot about what academics do during the summer months that makes them different to teachers. There was a lot of expectation that I would be not at work for 3 months like teachers are. Just wondering if this is a common problem issue and how do you explain that this is a really important time to get work done? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot a huge issue I know, but just curious if this is a common experience. Thanks.",

You get to direct your research program without having to do all the other stuff faculty are responsible for (teaching, desperate grant writing, committees).

I've also not really seen interns who secure their own funding for 2-3 yrs. Ultimately not sure it matters too much what it's called, but I'm not sure internship is quite right.",

There are lab post docs where you work predominantly on a PI's project, there are teaching post docs where you teach, etc.\n\nI don't think a post doc is equivalent to an internship, mind you; but, I also don't think this statement applies as broadly as you might think.",

There's of course many different types of work groups, but my experience is that postdocs have a largely independent research program. They of course collaborate with the PI but the relationship is much less one of mentoring than with PhD students. The reason for why postdocs have becone such a widespread position is that many fields have grown much faster than the amount of tenured positions. Thing seems to be that increasing the number of tenure positions considerably is a big commitment in terms of resources, while the number of PhD students can increase pretty steeply without putting strain in long-term funding.",

Postdocs usually last 2-3 years (but can last up to 5) which I believe is way longer than most VAP positions? Most postdocs in my field secure their own funding, but many do so through postdoc specific grants. What others said is true as well: in my research area you need a really robust set up to do work and data collection can take years. A postdoc plugs you into an existing set up where you can get work done, otherwise you'd have to spend months and $$$ just setting things up. Finally, usually VAP's are hired to teach. Postdocs usually don't teach at all, at least in my field. More focus on research.",

This is chiefly because they alone receive representation in the media. And even at that a grossly simplified account is presented to the lay person.\n\nSo, most likely they are expecting you to pull off a Einstein at whatever it is that you are doing. Which I will not put that past you, but it is hardly the norm for even the brightest of scientists to define an entire epoch. *Even among the Nobel Prize winning category of scientists.*\n\nAnd I bet even Einstein did not expect to pull off an Einstein until he had done so.\n\n(*Edited for English*)",

Maybe that says something about my communication skills but I'm going to put it down to my project.\n\nI've been to see family/friends over the summer and lots of them will say \"have you broken up for the summer?\" and I have to explain that I don't get \"summer holidays\" anymore and I have to take annual leave. Through the week when they ask what I've been doing, I tell them I've been working and they say \"what, working a job or studying?\" and I have to try to explain that they're essentially the same thing.\n\nIt's also annoying as a PhD that lots of people expect you to still have the financial situation of an undergrad student. While some PhDs are self-funded, lots of us are provided with funding and a stipend which is a lot more generous than an undergrad student loan. I've had people make comments about \"I wonder how much her parents are having to pay for her flat\"... I'm completely financially independent!

I mean, of course they very well (better than me) know the basic contours of academic life. Teaching, research, service, and admin. But they both come from times when higher education was expanding and standards were less rigid, competition less fierce to pursue questions that they genuinely cared about in a less structured manner. They also worked their entire lives in the developing world despite obtaining their PhDs from the US. They both genuinely enjoyed their jobs and found so much satisfaction in being professors. So, there is a massive gap in how I, a US AP, understand what academic life entails and them. I feel frustrated trying to communicate with them because they do not seem to understand the tremendous stress I am under all the time, the gamification of academic publishing, the crazy job market, the dog fight that is tenure, and how I feel the imposition of bean counting metrics, and ultimately what I consider neoliberalization of academia has destroyed academia. Our conversation about this get so tense to the extent that I often refuse to even talk about work anymore.",
