The main reason is just to distinguish from other people. If your given name was really common, you wouldn't want loads of people who share that name, who also publish, to get confused with you. At least with given + father's or given + mother's, your name is less common.\n\nLuckily for me, I am the only person on Researchgate or Google Scholar with my name, so it's easy. My old office mate was from China and her name was insanely common. You'd google her name and never find her. Google her name + mathematics and also never find her. Even in our niche field, at big international conferences there might be a few of her name lmao. She hated it because people would always see her name badge and ask her about things that are nothing to do with her work.\n\nThis is cool though, you learn something new everyday!",

My hanai uncle uses his tribe\u2019s name as a last name. \n\nUsing a location as a last name or a profession is not uncommon (we see this through history worldwide).\n\nThink about all the Millers, Bakers, Smithsons you've met or read about, and you can see that this same process of making up a last name occurred in Western societies as well. Often names became more standardized as governments recognize a need to keep track of large amounts of people using individual identifiers.",
