  "text": "I was quantifying my CO2 emissions for the year. I've been responsible for about:\n\n* 1.3 tons for heat and electricity of my home.\n* 0.9 tons for transportation\n* about 1.5 tons for food and miscellanea\n* A guesstimate of 0.3 tons for the electricity that my academic pc-based job uses\n\nThat's about 4 tons of CO2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I went to 2 conferences this year (1 in the same continent, 1 with an intercontinental flight). That's about 4.5 tons of CO2. To meet a bunch of people for 4 days each. I mean... the networking I do and the things I learn are extremely important for my career. But the environmental impact is completely unjustified. It's totally against both my coscience but also logic to emit more CO2 for a 4 day thing that for heating a home for a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about it?",

      "text": "Speaking as a neuroscientist who regularly attends SFN, at least half the reason for going is to get a picture of in-progress research before it hits the journals.  The other half is to reconnect with old colleagues and network with potential new ones. \n\nThe poster sessions and talks could be replaced with online versions, so long as we can treat preliminary research online the same as we treat it at the conference. \n\nThe networking, on the other hand, is irreplaceable -- there's no other way you'll ever get this sort of group in the same place together. \n\nI've come to the conclusion that attending every year is unnecessary -- skipping at least once every three years makes more sense. Aside from that, there aren't many good solutions that don't involve the US building a world-class high speed rail network. ",

If inside US, Europe, Asia... doesn't matter. \n\nHaving a better connection even on continents that you have to fly to would also generally help. Local people could travel more economically friendly, reducing the number of flights and you could try to go for a airport further away, mixing airplane and train to minimize CO2.\n\nFor SFN next month I travel quite far, from Germany to California, direct flight.

Yep, its awful.\n\nBut the dinosau *ahem* I mean \"old guard\" are used to doing things this way, and they like doing things that way, so we won't really change until they step down and/if a massive change in culture follows.\n\nWe could accomplish everything done with conferences through electronic means but for the present, we won't because people like paid travel to big cities. Conferences will stick around at least until the higher ed bubble bursts.\n",

I'm not sure how well they've quantified how attractive this makes them to quality employees or how it improves employee wellbeing, but I'm quite confident it's a positive effect. Maybe alcohol is not the healthiest option, but universities definitely shouldn't thrive to be spartan for the professors, and spending some of the tuition on making sure the professors are happy in their jobs is not frivolous. \n\nAlcohol is not terribly environmentally damaging either, so it's a completely different category to conferences.",
