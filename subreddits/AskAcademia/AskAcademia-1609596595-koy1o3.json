  "text": "1. How much of an impact can you make?\n\n2. Are there other more important considerations, like building a viable career?\n\n3. Does academia make more of an impact than work in the private sector? What about NGOs?\n\n4. I was thinking of going into environmental science, but I'm worried that I'll end up working for a corporation just looking to reduce its taxes.\n\n5. How applicable to helping humanity are more fundamental fields like Mathematics or Physics?",

      "text": "There are strong limitations to how much as an individual/professional you can do to make the world a better place. You can theoretically do it in any field, if you do it right. We can see now with the pandemic how scientists and practitioners in the health sector can be great actors of change and improvement, or the opposite. \n\nThe pandemic has also helped people see how hard it is to be this type of scientist you want to be. Climate scientists have been subjected to the same type of scapegoating, hostility and overall quackery that the epidemiologists are now facing. \n\nIt is hard to make a difference anywhere, in the same way that you can make a difference anywhere if you work at it diligently. \n\nI used to work with environmental engineering, then transitioned to environmental sciences academia, and now I am shifting towards the science-policy interface. My general career path was always driven towards finding ways to make more of an impact.  While I think I have managed to do so at times, it can be extremely frustrating most of the time, and you are going to have to accept that this will happen. \n\nIt is a very personal choice, to know how much you want to put your career progression to the backseat when it comes to societal impact. I personally don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had to choose between the two of them until now, so I can safely say it is possible to both have a thriving career, and making a difference. You just can\u2019t expect that you will have a great impact all the time, or that you will be some type of loner super hero. Most impactful work is extremely collaborative, and most of it starts to happen once you reach a more advanced level in your career.",

          "text": "Thank you for your great reply. I have some follow-up questions, if you have the time.\n\nWhen you say you can make a difference in any field, how do you mean? Do all fields connect back to important issues such as climate, health, ecology, society and so on? Or perhaps, are there many important issues that are generally not on the radar of mainstream culture?\n\nI definitely see how this could all be very collaborative, difficult, frustrating, and take a long time. Thank you so much for laying out the difficulties involved.\n\nDo you have any advice for someone just starting out, with a year or two to think ahead before going to university? How do you pick a field? What can you do to prepare yourself to the best of your abilities for the more advanced, meaningful work, and/or maximize your impact on the way there, in whatever small contribution you can make?",

Basically everything they could have fucked up... they did fuck it up.\n\nI watched a professor of epidemiology dismiss research made by the engineering faculty (they had military grants to do NBC research for PPE, filters, simulations etc) because they were engineers, not medical researchers and recommended to NOT use masks to the government because he was not aware of any medical research that masks are useful. Because in medicine they have a hierarchy of evidence and any papers published in non-medical journals don't count.",

      "text": "Yeah, tbh. I worked/work in a do-good field, and probably my biggest pet peeve about that industry's culture is all the incompetent people who stick around because they think they're a gift to society. There's a lot of people in this field who shouldn't be in it, either because they're bad at their job, or because the daily realities of their job make them unhappy, but they persist because they like the ego boost of being considered altruistic by others. There are even people (a lot of people) who are on a straight power or ego trip, often working with vulnerable people, and those people do so much harm it sets the field back years. Not to give too much away from my background, but the insta @nowhitesaviors talks a lot about well-meaning white people who want to \"make the world a better place\" and how their adorable little ego trip fucked and continues to fuck an entire continent over.\n\nAnother relevant story I have is about a guy I used to date, who, let's say, did the kind of research that required him to work with animals every day in a lab setting, but he hated working with animals, he hated the lab setting, he hated pretty much everything to do with bench science and just wanted to be at his computer reading articles and constructing models all day. He was very smart, went to an exceptional undergrad, had several patents as an undergrad, and was accepted for his PhD with one of the best labs in the world, so he picked his research based on impact potential, which would legit have been immense - had he completed it. Instead, he was so miserable in his every day life that he floundered, fell into a debilitating depression for a number of years, and now he's a glorified lab tech somewhere. Lesson is, kids, do what you're good at, not what you want to be good at.",

      "text": "This is pure opinion and you should take it with the same medium grain of salt as all other posts here. If you are passionate about a field you stand a higher chance of sticking at it long enough to make a difference in something. But if making a difference is your only goal that might burn out before you get a chance to. Just because making a difference means a lot of work and failures along the way. My advice is find a field where the work might satisfy you on a day to day basis and then work to become extraordinary in that area. Pure and applied mathematicians change the world all the time, think back to the space race, early computing, artificial intelligence, and now algorithms for literally anything you can think of. Chemical engineers can make less harmful materials for industry and medicine, biologists can understand climate change on the ecosystem, some discover new proteins and change the way we see a system, and engineers can design/manufacture everything we take for granted.

(And no, not all documentation work is funded by tax dollars.)\n\nBy the way, language endangerment happens under force by dominant groups. The Uyghurs aren't learning Mandarin because it's neat and they want a Duolingo streak, they're doing so because language shift is a core component of cultural genocide. Furthermore, in many cases your tax dollars have gone towards foreign policy, \"missionary work\" etc. that have caused the language endangerment in the first place. So it's not necessarily the case that the \"let all the languages die\" stance is non-interventionist and fiscally conservative while \"have a shred of empathy\" is interventionist; one could easily argue for the reverse.\n\nAs for public opinion and tax dollars, you live in a country where antivaxxers, climate change denialists, the tabacco lobby and various other corporate interests have all used their dissenting opinions (which are totally legit and not shady at all) to affect how various scientific disciplines are conducted and funded. All have had disasterous effects on public health. Is an opinion valid if it has a body count?",

I'm in the same boat as you, and I'm driven by making the world a better place, EVEN if my impact is minuscule, and I can only help a single community, or save a single fish. I think it's possible to make a bigger impact (through collaborating with other people, etc), but don't let this demotivate you. What you're doing is still worthwhile.\n\nAs for 3, I can't speak for other countries, but in South Africa, NGO's have very little real power. They definitely serve a purpose and do good work, but the main impact is in policy. Academia and government. \n\nI hope this helps in some way. Let your passion drive you.",

Making the world a better place is not restricted to work that involves headline-making news about major issues of the day. Teachers, firefighters, nurses, and trash collectors can also help make the world a better place, and so can people in many other jobs. Arguably, there are jobs that make the world a worse place, and I do think it is a good idea to steer clear of these.\n\n(2) Whatever field you get into, it is likely that you will be doing similar kinds of work for decades. Being passionate and making a difference over the long term will be somewhere between very difficult and utterly miserable if it is not work that interests you. If environmental science interests you, then go for it. If it does not, then I would not suggest going into that field *solely* for the benefit to humanity.",

But I think my biggest impact is on the thousands of students who I have taught about these things and who have gone out there with that knowledge in their own jobs and lives.",

The way I see it, it's two fold: select a very on the nose field and affect policy OR select a niche field and through effort and ideas make the field relevant to the masses.\n\n2) again it's your choice, as in what you define as important.\n\n3) Ever heard of some one called Feynman ? He made great impact in popularising Physics among the masses while being a giant in Academia. Cutting edge research always arise from Academia, sure it's not as glamorous as working with an MNC and researching there, but being able to surround yourself with people seeking answers for the sake of it rather than for a paycheck (just an expression, no disrespect to industry researchers), had tremendous benefits IMO. NGO is just another non-academic endeavor as far as this classification goes, but you will be exposed to more global issues where your expertise is needed and this enabling you to ask the right questions to propel your research.\n\n4) can't help you there. Where you end up is in your hands.\n\n5) I am technology guy myself, but I would say the natural sciences and research in them are crucial for humanity. Further research and discoveries enable guys like me to think up better application of said discoveries and associated properties, which in term will benefit humanity.\n\nI will end with an example for perspective: Consider some one working on new energy efficient designs for electric motors. Something which may be geared at power generation can trigger a revolution in electric vehicles, which in turn would help reduce overall carbon footprint and a better environment. Sometimes the impact of your research comes out of the left field. Best you can do is your best in your field of choice.",

      "text": "My advice to students is always that they need to weigh what they want to do everyday by how much they'll get paid to do it.\n\nHere's my response to question 1: It's important to differentiate impact from satisfaction. If you make some product consume 5% less energy, and a million people use it, you made a pretty big impact for the environment, although most people probably won't see that impact as particularly satisfying. Poor populations often get healthier simply by getting richer - better roads, safer houses, better sanitation, and so on leads to big decreases in mortality and morbidity. Doctors have limited impact, because while the individual impact is huge, the scale is very small. The point is that a lot of big impact is boring, and a lot of satisfaction can be relatively low impact. The point is to think more about what you're really after.",

      "text": "I love this question. I wish people would ask it of themselves and others more often.\n\n>Is it a bad idea to pick a field based on where you think you can help make the world a better place the most?\n\nNo, of course not. If that's what YOU want to do, no one can say that ambition is bad to base your choices on.\n\n>How much of an impact can you make?\n\nThere's no limit to this. I guess it depends on your philosophical position on the maximum impact of single persons. \n\n>Are there other more important considerations, like building a viable career?\n\nIf you mean \"Should i focus on a viable career or helping the world\" no one can answer that for you. It's the old  \"You can't get an ought from an is\". There is no factual answer to the question of the proper way to behave. \n\nIf on the other hand you mean; \"is it more important how you build your career, than the kind of field you study?\", then the answer is yes. Your education/degree is of small value compared to those high aspirations, and it will take much more than a droning 37 hour work week commitment to follow such high aspirations.\n\nUnless you mean \"make the world a better place\" in the everyday sense of affecting the people immediately around you.\n\nIn that case i think, respectfully, you'll see a higher \"return on investment\" on simply being a good spouse, parent, neighbour, etc. \n\n>Does academia make more of an impact than work in the private sector? What about NGOs?\n\nThat's unpredictable, it depends on you and the way you intend to make change. What is the impact of Vladimir Putin vs Elon Musk vs Noam Chomsky vs Xi Jinping vs Angela Merkel? No one can answer this. You just need to decide on what you think you can accomplish within different frameworks i think.\n\nIf financial security for you and a pssible family is your first goal, then neaqrly every field of study has this problem. The question of whether you can really makea  difference is moreso about you seeing how to do it and doing it. \n\nIt's okay to use the Elon musk analogy here. Elon musk could've technically started his companies without being the kind of engineer he was, but not in the *specific way* he did. If you aspire to make a difference in environmental science, you may have to be ready to *both* have some succes in the nearterm future of your academic performance, but also keep a broader perspective and plan, of how you're going to implement the knowledge you're acquiring, whether through private enterprise like Musk, or through affecting the academic community, or going through political channels (or somethign completely different). \n\n(We can all sit and discuss the impact of Musk on the world, whether his attacks on workers rights make him net negative, but this isn't the focus of this analogy and you could have the same discussion about every person and achievement in the world, from overpopulation as a result of the Haaber-Bosch method, to the impractical utopian ideology and possibly pedophilic sleeping habits of Mahatma Ghandi)\n\nNotice though, that no matter which way, the \"degree\" is never going to be enough, and nor is it going to be the main investment you make. You need to attack the problems you wnt to solve seriously, and with planning. \n\nThis is the question i like the best:\n\n>How applicable to helping humanity are more fundamental fields like Mathematics or Physics?\n\nI'm going to answer from my own thoughts/wishes\n\nI had a similar inclination as yourself. I wanted to helpt he world at large, but having that aspiration feels like the bargain of a lottery ticket. It feels like you have such an extremely sleight chance of achieving that goal, that the bargain is crazy to take. \n\nI can't answer this strategy problem but i can give my own solution. \n\nWHen i was very young i was reading psychology and philosophy mainly. I didn't go to school for many years because although i liked those subjects, i couldn't see myself making a difference within them that i would think is important to the world. I ended up getting an interest in chemistry and math and physics later on.\n\nMy solution to the dilemma was to buy a much safer investment ticket (studying medicine) and combine that with a research aspiration that *could* end up affecting a larger amount of people (research). \n\nThe practical consideration in all of this is that i needed to be seriously interested in the field in question, simply for my organism  to function near optimally (an important part of the equation) in order to increase the chances of succes (having a positive impact on some number of people).\n\nSo in order to meet that last criteria, i've entered neuroscientific research and will try to make a difference through this. But i think one should always be very clear that doing \"other stuff\" than following the normal academic path is necessary to consider if your main ambition is \"the greatest possible good\" for most people, given your opportunities. That is, if your plan was originally to affect people in a positive way, you can't lose sight of this in the maze of academia.",

This might mean you believe you are making a difference, probably in a rather small way. Or it might mean something else. \n\nDown the list: \n\n1. You may be able to impact your small circle and your specific field if you work hard, stay with it, and have a certain amount of luck. By all means aim higher, but don't beat yourself up if you don't change the world, because most people don't. Also, academia can indeed be quite impractical. I am in medical science so I always have some relationship to \"real world\" problems, but you have to push for it if that's important to you.\n2. Depends on your values. Do you need a decent amount of money or prestige for something, or do you just want to do what you love? What do you really want besides \"making a difference\"? You are allowed to be a little selfish in your goals.\n3. This varies a lot depending on your field. I think they have different kinds of impact. \n4. Then don't work for a corporation. You may have to look harder for work that suits your values, but you are allowed to turn down jobs you find distasteful. \n5. According to my friends in those fields, barely.",
