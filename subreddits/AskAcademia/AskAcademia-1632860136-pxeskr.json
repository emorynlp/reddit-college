  "title:": "Receveid review 15 days after withdrawing submission (due to journal unresponsiveness) [update post]",
  "text": "Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/pk9fzn/journal_unresponsive_review_not_sent_back/)\n\nBasically, we did not receive any single news from a journal for more than 10 months. (Small journal from major editor). When we asked updates in the last 2 months to the editorial office, the editor, the editor via personal email, they went no contact. Zero. Both via email and editorial manager.\n\nSo we sent a withdrawal notice 15 days ago and received again no feedback. And sent the paper elsewhere.\n\nTonight we received the review. \n\nFirst question... What the actual fuck???\n\nSecond question: now what???",

      "text": "However you would normally respond to the reviews (using the journal's manuscript submission system, for example), send in a response to the reviews saying that you submitted a request to withdraw the paper on <date> and that you no longer wish to have the manuscript considered for publication at that journal.  Also state that the reason you withdrew the manuscript was the 10 months of silence, so they'll know for sure they messed up.  Continue with the process you already started at a different journal.",

      "text": "You have no obligation to respond to the review for that journal.  Its tricky as the journal incompetence means that technically you have double submitted the paper.  Personally I would just reply that you have no intention to submit a revise version, as you have previously informed them of the withdrawal of the manuscript.",
