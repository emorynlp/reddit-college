  "text": "A friend of mine has achieved his dream of becoming a fellow at our college. I'd like to get him a meaningful gift to celebrate. I was considering framing a poem.\n\nDoes anybody have a recommendation for a satisfying, celebratory, optimistic type poem or piece of writing that would be good for this scenario? Ideally something that validates the grandeur of the position.\n\nHis background is computational chemistry if that helps contextualise his sense of humour/values/knowledge.",
