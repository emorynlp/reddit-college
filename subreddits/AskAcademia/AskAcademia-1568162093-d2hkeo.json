Not making excuses, but it might be the case here (and sometimes, I know I received it, but for the life of me cannot locate it). So, in those cases, I would say so/apologise after asking again, or say sorry forgot yo already sent it, but it\u2019s hard for everyone to admit a mistake, so maybe they\u2019re sheepish with it and know they\u2019ve done it (but should still apologise).",

The only questions that require a majority of entire membership are for questions where the default is that notice is provided in advance of the vote. In those cases it is possible to approve without notice, provided you have a majority of the entire membership.\n\nThis of course assumes standard RONR 11th Ed. and that your bylaws don't specify a different procedure. It also does not apply to questions that have higher thresholds, such as bylaws amendments or motions to rescind an action previously taken.\n\nIf your bylaws mandate a majority of entire membership for approving minutes, you should hire a parliamentarian to help you revise them. I can't think of very many situations where such a requirement would make sense.\n\nEdit: sorry, I care way to much about this.",

This entailed work I didn\u2019t realize at the outset would be so consuming and stressful. In the week leading up to our vote, the dean went around to each department urging strongly that students come to a meeting where he would tell them the reasons unions are bad for universities. I got myself invited by friends I had made in each department while canvassing and basically debated the dean every day for a week - sometimes twice a day. \n\nHe hated my guts, but the vote ended up passing. \n\nTwo weeks later, I was given an award by our student government for outstanding leadership and presented a plaque on stage by the very same dean",

The guy was a more senior member of the department, the woman was more junior than me...oh and was/ is still married. On more than one of their secret rendezvous occasions, I would get drunk texted very inappropriate pictures of the two of them. I kept my mouth shut b/c as a junior person I wasn't risking the backlash of saying anything. I watched the woman (who again, was more junior) get promoted over me, get special priveledges, get a title change so that she could make more money, etc. I very bitterly watched.\n\nFinally, a student of the woman went to her and complained about a test grade.  She said she stood by all her grading decisions and wasn't going to entertain the possibility of a re-grade.  So the student went to the coodinator...the guy.  He said \"I trust her grading decisions and I am not even going to look at your test.\"  So the student filed a complaint with the department saying that they were not getting a fair shot since woman/man were obviously seeing each other, and would back each other up on anything.  In the end, the department asked the two of them to keep it more discrete, but that there was no formal policy against it. However, they did not want anyone in our professional society to know about it b/c the guy was going for a high leadership position in said national organization.\n\nI managed to get a new (still junior) job and got the hell out of there.\n\nSometime later the guy asked me for a favor (to make him an invited speaker in my session) so that he could look better for the leadership position. I said no.  He pushed back and said he could ruin my academic career by badmouthing me and making sure I never found a TT position.  I texted him one of the drunken pictures.  He's never contacted me again.",

I've been adjunct enrolled (aka, a placeholder instead of classes if you only have your thesis left) for about three semesters now because life went to hell. I was president of the graduate council for my major. One of my VPs (I beat her out for president) had never really liked me to begin with, and I had mentioned that I was going to have to push back finishing my thesis for at least an extra semester. She smugly said, \"Oh, you're not finishing on time? I would've thought you would.\"\n\nLittle did she know I was going back and forth to our state's capital for tests all semester because it was a large possibilty that I was gonna need open heart surgery (I did end up my valve repaired the following August). Let me tell you, it was so worth it to say to her \"actually, my health hasn't been the greatest. I might have to have open heart as early as this summer.\" \n\nThe look on her face when I said that? It may be petty, but after dealing with her attitude it was so satisfying to watch her face crumble and for her to frantically back peddle her way out of that mess.",

Attending lecture was necessary to get the content but they were grueling to get through. There was another student who missed class one day and asked to borrow my notes. I said fine and he did - took them, made copies, and returned them to me. But then he started missing about half of the classes. At the end of the semester he wanted to borrow ALL of my notes. Although he pressured me, I said no because the exam was a week away and I didn't want to be without my notes during that time. (And I didn't really know or trust this guy to for sure get them back to me.)\n\nThe next day I get a call in my dorm room. It's Notes Guy calling from down in the lobby. He wants me to bring my notes down and he'll photocopy them right there in the lobby and give them right back to me. I don't feel like I can reasonably say \"no\" to him, since he's made it very convenient for me. But I'm pissed that he got to skip half the boring lectures and is now benefiting from my notes and is so insistent on it.\n\nSo petty me kicks in: still alone in my dorm room, I go through my notebook and remove about 2/3 of the pages, especially the important ones. Then I bring it down for Mr. Leech to photocopy. Good luck making sense of that!",

Professor required 8+ pages of perfectly APA formatted research paper each week(mind you for a 1 c.h. class).  Each of the papers were out of 10 points and i got -14 points on one and it was explained to me that every error was -1 point(lost 3 points due to having a space where there shouldn't have been in 3 different in text cations).  The professor had 6-8 T.A.'s for his class of 30 students so he wouldn't have to do any real work.  He sat in front of the class and bragged about how he had tenure and was untouchable unless he sexually assaulted a student or the like.  Also that he had come from a more prestigious university to come teach at ours and we should feel lucky to be his students.  He decided to lecture us on what Italics was for 20 minutes with accompanying power point presentation because \"apparently some of you can't understand this simple concept\", rather than explaining the nuances of when different formatting is needed/required in citations. \n\nThe stress of the class on top of everything else I had going on caused my major depressive disorder to go from managed with medication to being catatonic and couldn't get out of bed in the morning. (Yes it was my responsibility to take care of myself, and I failed to reach out to resources to help myself when this happened etc). \n\nI dropped out and worked in a residential treatment center for dually diagnosed youth for a year.  I had to re-apply for the university and have a meeting with the Dean of the school of science to re-enroll.  When I met with the dean he was super chill and asked me about what I was going to do differently this time and how I was going to avoid the issues that had caused me to drop out.  As I was describing how I was going to avoid the pitfalls that caused me to be unsuccessful he got a concerned look on his face, and asked which professor I was talking about when i was describing the behavior of the professor.  When I told him he said that I was not the only student who have had issues with this professor but if I was willing to give him an on the record written statement of my experiences, and his abuse of department resources (seriously 1 TA per 4-5 students?), he would be \"Very appreciative\".   \n\nI was happy when I noticed that the teacher no longer worked at the university, despite having tenure.",

      "text": "A few years ago as a grad student. The department held a scholarship banquet every year to give out a couple dozen small scholarships to undergrads and grads. Donors were sometimes in attendance to meet awardees. The event was usually shockingly half-assed (common for academia but embarrassing for a theatre department), but students still came because they might get money and it was fine.\n\nOne year the folks involved decided it was not fancy enough (I agree it needed some polish) and that the way to solve it was by a) establishing a dress code and b) charging an admission fee for the event. Oh, yeah, and also getting grad students to perform without compensation. I was then head of department grad student org, and my colleagues and I carefully gathered feedback and testimony from any department grad students who wished (most con but a few pro) and then respectfully contacted the faculty to express concerns. \n\nFirst of all, undergrads at the end of the school year are simply not going to show up if all you're doing is offering the same old food but now they have to dress up for it. Second of all (and most important), charging an admission fee to be awarded scholarship money raises all sorts of perceived and real ethical concerns. Everything would be fine, I argued, if you just asked people to pay for the banquet but they could come for the award ceremony afterward for free. Simple. At the end of it all, they dropped the idea (though mostly because the faculty/staff who had the idea to begin with weren't very good at actually doing the work to realize their grand dreams.\n\nThree years later the same committee sent out a circa-1997 e-vite (this was well after 1997) to the banquet and ceremony that included the new dress code and ticket prices. No consultation, no consideration, no nothing. \n\nAnd they left the comments on the e-vite page. \n\nI responded in a Dr. Seussian long-form poem. I did it multiple times until my PhD advisor had to personally ask me to stop because they didn't know how to turn the comments off.\n\nAfter I raised a stink they agreed that people could come to the ceremony without going to/paying for the banquet and I sat right in the front row clapping for each and every awardee. \n\nI clapped loudest for all of the undergrads who were being given awards but who didn't show up to an event they had to pay and dress up for.",

      "text": "I had an oral exam in Physics coming up after this happend btw.\n\nOur professor disliked phones very much. Nothing weird about that.  I have been warned months prior to this by our professor because I was on my phone, no biggie. My mistake. It's impolite to be on your phone during a lesson which I understood. I actually find Physics interesting and I enjoyed most lessons and was eager to learn more. I almost always did my assignments and extra work. I wanted an A.\n\nDuring one of our final classes of the year, the entire class was just talking, the professor wasn't lecturing anything. They were setting dates for tests if anyone wanted to fix their grade. People who had their grade set were on their phone... nothing weird.\n\nExcept I was the only one called out. Out of everyone. To make things worse, the professor called out my style (she specifically mentioned my Dr Martens and Iron Maiden shirt I wore that day) and commented on my dyed ginger hair. She said very \"nicely\" she doesn't have anything against it, why bring it up then? Her comments made me feel awful. She continued to comment my attitude towards work, my personality and how I don't deserve an A. She did this for another 10 mins before finishing. I didn't want to continue it so I just apologised.\n\nShe gave me a B. :)\n\nTLDR : Professor didn't like me or my choice of clothing / style and gave me a lower grade.",

          "text": "When someone doesn\u2019t like you, it\u2019s super hard to convince them otherwise. Many years ago, I went on an Erasmus year abroad as part of my 1st year of uni (this was so that I could join the language degree, while having experienced the language abroad). When I returned in year 2, lesson 1 in German was to talk to your neighbour, gather some facts about them, and retell it to the class (in German) to introduce them. While gathering some info on my classmate, I noticed she had a ring and while talking, realised she was married (we were 19, 20, so still v young). So, in introducing her, I said \u2018surprisingly, she is married\u2019. The lecturer went off on one, saying how is that surprising, a lot of adults marry. So, I said yes, of course, it was just a bit more uncommon at our age... Found this super weird that she was so angry by me just telling something unremarkable about a classmate (something that was meant as a first day intro btw!!) Anyway, 2nd day, we were meant to summarise a text, and giving out the key points, the arguments for and against, etc... I tried my best when she asked me (me again!) to report to the class. As soon as I started, I knew this wasn\u2019t going well. She wanted me to use a very specific technique she had always used (with bullet points, and other techniques one wouldn\u2019t necessarily know unless you were taught by her specifically). At that point, she said, well, are you able or not to do this work? As she was aggressive, I thought wtf, I need to be assertive here... I said I am able, but not familiar with her specific technique, to which she then replied \u2018well, if you had bothered turning up to ANY of my lessons in year 1, you would know!\u2019 Ah, so that was it, she thought I had missed her classes on purpose! I tried to explain I was on an exchange year the year before and could therefore not have attended, and gained the required credits in another institution. She refused to understand and basically made my life hell for the rest if the year (failing me in that class so badly that I had to retake it twice). In the end, I never passed that module but could get my degree thanks to other classes (and even did a masters). She remains one of the most difficult and biased person I have come across and can\u2019t understand to this day what her problem was with the Erasmus scheme. At the time, it was in its infancy, but still!!",

      "text": "I was on the receiving end.    \n\n(background, my undergraduate university did numeric grades by tenths to a maximum of 4.0) In 2 years of a 4.0 GPA, I learned my lesson of why backups are important. My final paper (40% of the grade, the other 60% I had full credit in) file was corrupt and I was a couple of hours from the deadline. I sent screenshots to my professor and met with him pleading for a several hour extension for me to sort it out. Eventually, I had to go through notes and rewrite about half of it for submission the same day.     \n\nFor more background, this was a philosophy of neuroscience class, and he only liked teaching one side of the subject matter, unless presenting 1 other prominent paper which he laughed at for the entire class period. I was a challenger to this guy because I knew some of the other side of the literature. His goal in doing philosophy of neuroscience is to prove the existence of god, while mine (currently in grad school) is to know if philosophical conclusions can be drawn from neuroscience, and if philosophy can work towards grounding the subject matter of neuroscience.     \n\nThe professor marked the paper like 95%, but the final grade in the class was 3.4. After meeting with him, it was agreed that the penalty was arbitrary, but because it was a late paper (by about 6 hours), it was his prerogative to give that final grade. Later, I found out some of his minion students (those who were devoted to his teachings and never challenged his odd philosophical conclusions) submitted between 1-3 hours late and had no penalty.    \n\n(later, it became an open secret in the department that one of his minions was able to somehow pull off 4.0 grades in this professor's classes, but fail any other classes in the department).    \n\nAnother professor (never took classes with him, but knew him), in meetings with students would pull up students\u2019 transcripts on his computer and tell them there was no chance for them to ever become doctor/lawyer/academic.",
