  "title:": "I accidentally skipped my group presentation. What should I do?",
  "text": "Since this whole covid thing happened and because of the lockdowns I slowly developed a weird sleeping habit. I basically sleep in the morning now and wake up at night, probably because of staying indoors for extended periods of time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, today I had a presentation but it was in the afternoon. I was getting sleepy in the morning because that's when I usually sleep and decided ill take a nap and use my phone alarm to wake me up an hour before the presentation (it's supposed to be an online group presentation). Maybe I'm extremely unlucky idk but the alarm basically didn't go off for some reason (its a really old and shoddy phone but it's never done that before) and I basically missed the presentation. \n\nMy role in the presentation was actually just the timekeeper for my group. So I'm basically supposed to make sure that my group's presentation doesn't go over 10minutes, so it's not a big role or anything, and I'm pretty sure my group managed fine without me but still I'm worried I lost a lot of marks for it or possibly failed the assignment. \n\nI never skipped a class before this whole semester, and I did a lot of other work with my group, So I def did my fair share of work before this presentation, and this isn't the norm for me. \n\nI'm not sure what to do now. I'm gonna apologize to my group and probably email my teacher but I feel kind of embarrassed telling them the truth that I was just sleeping in the morning. I'm tempted to say that my computer stopped working and that's why I couldn't present but it feels wrong doing that haha.",
