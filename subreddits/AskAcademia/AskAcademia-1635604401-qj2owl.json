  "title:": "Academic career as a late starter?",
  "text": "I graduated from college in 2007 (history/political science) and almost immediately, my health went downhill. I'm now getting to the point where things have stabilized, but I really have nothing to show for the gap because I was unable to work/go to school/raise a family, etc. \n\nI've developed new interests in science, mostly geology, and I still feel like academia is a really good fit for me, especially as I am now disabled and unable to work in other industries because of my physical limitations. \n\nSo my question is: how feasible is an academic career for someone starting over again at my age (now 36). I would have to go back for another bachelor's and then on to graduate school, so I'd definitely be much older than others on the career path. How much will my chances be hurt by my age? \n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "\"Academia\" is a very very narrow field while geology is gaining credence and finding its way into a wide array of other disciplines. Add in some GIS or Emergency Management and there's still a ton you can do without having to repel down cliff faces or live in the wild for samples. If geology is your passion, find a way to make it your job.",

      "text": "I went back to grad school at about your age. Acceptance of age seems to vary by department, but in some places it does matter in often subtle ways. People tend to hire based on potential, and unfortunately gray hairs & wrinkles don't scream potential. Regardless, I would avoid tenure-track high-tier research university goals. \n\nIf you're mainly interested in teaching, the job market widens up considerably. You can teach community college (which often only requires a master's degree), become a lecturer at a 4-year university, or teach at a liberal arts college. I don't know what the geology job markets are like, but job availability does vary by field and college type. \n\nAlso, don't get another bachelor's degree. Figure out the most basic set of skills you need for grad school by *directly asking the program you want to get into*. Then take a few classes online or at a local college if you have to.",

The job market is already too saturated with PhDs, and jobs are dwindling every year. \n\nThe overwhelming likelihood is that you go through all of that schooling and do not find even full-time non-tenure track work in academia.",

              "text": "I agree. I\u2019m on a search committee right now. There are a total of 12 tenure track positions available in the United States for my discipline. We have over 100 applicants for ours alone. About half of them would perform satisfactorily and do a fine job - all with impressive pedigrees. The 20-25 that we will ask for supplementary materials would all likely excel in the position. The 15 or so that we conduct preliminary interviews with will have national and international recognition to some degree with very impressive CVs and will likely already be in academic positions. The 3-5 finalists we bring in will almost assuredly be world-class (literally, with an impressive international reputation/list of accolades from internationally recognized institutions and organizations), and we will only hire 1, of course. \n\nFor every 1 that is hired, a dozen others take their place in the pool. In my field, this process and the numbers are as true for R1s (where I am) as it is for PUIs and SLACs.",

      "text": "I just started a masters at 39, after a 6 year gap since graduating undergrad. Im in anthropology. So far my age doesn\u2019t seem to matter at all. In fact it will give you an advantage over the other students in some ways, because you\u2019ll have a lot more real world knowledge and probably be better at synthesizing information than them. \n\nThe most helpful thing I did was I found people who are already established in the field that acted as mentors for me. I met most of them at conferences and on Twitter.\n\nI had some gaps too. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just start doing stuff now. Like volunteering at a museum or at NPS. This will help you get some experience and start networking. Identify a supervisor who you can build a relationship with, and do good work and show them how passionate you are. Their recommendation letters will get you in. Recommendation letters might be the most important part of getting in. More important than your undergrad grades.\n\nI would also consider going to one of the national or regional conferences to try and get a feel for what is happening in the field and what your area of interest might be. There might even be networking opportunities there\u2014might be a place to find mentors. And start reading scientific articles in your field of interest ASAP. \n\nGrad schools like to see a little bit of focus \u2013 \u2013 but you don\u2019t need to know exactly what you want to do. It just helps bring out your passion a bit, and helps you develop a bit of a plan for the direction your studies might take. Don\u2019t worry about picking the wrong thing, because they probably have students change their direction all the time. The point here is to demonstrate focus\u2014that you can make a plan and pursue it.\n\nAfter you have volunteered a little bit, start looking for programs \u2013 \u2013 and you\u2019re looking for programs, not schools. Once you find a program, look for a faculty member that does work similar to what you might want to do. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same. And email them early in the process and let them know you\u2019re thinking of applying. Make it brief \u2013 \u2013 tell them a little bit about yourself, and what you\u2019ve been doing to get involved in the field, and the sort of literature you\u2019ve found interesting.\n\nGet on academic Twitter. Ask questions on #AcademicChatter. And find wherever geology Twitter is. Getting engaged, going to conferences, and networking will help you find the people who can help you figure out what your path back into academia will look like. \n\nAnd when you feel stuck, ask for help! Where there is a will there\u2019s always a way.\n\nGood luck!",
