And it wasn't like he was a hotshot at a prestigious Ivy League university.\n\nSenior member of the department where I got my MA: started teaching part-time at the university as a grad student, got hired to TT two years later because the other members of the department liked him still without having either a publication or a finished dissertation. (Note: I consider this guy one of the most original scholars in my field, and he is a legend around that department for his teaching and service, so it's not like they made a bad choice.)\n\nBack to the PhD department, more recently though still a long time ago. This guy met the then-chair at a conference as a grad student, the chair just \"gave\" (?!) him a fellowship and then convinced the rest of the faculty to turn it into a TT line. \n\nI'm sure for every story like this there's a dozen people who went through what seem like normal hiring processes to us today, but ... yeah.",

Most of us ended up picking up extra teaching for summer pay, and/or joining grants as RAs.\n\nIn theory, the concept was to give our candidates solid teaching experience to help them on the job market - not just a TA, but a real classroom teacher for 4+ semesters. But in reality, it doesn't help most graduates land jobs. It does, however, have the silent little advantage of allowing the department to get a lot of really cheap labor out of a naive/scared cohort. They're proud that they \"don't hire adjuncts,\" but it's clear why they don't have to. The students do all the grunt work.",

Don't people say there are basically zero new faculty jobs each year?\n\nPeople exaggerate. I've been on two dozen (plus) search committees, about half of those in history, at SLACs over the past 30+ years. A fancy R1 or elite school *might* get 700 apps for a position in *US history* but likely not many others. At my SLAC we tend to get 250-300 for US positions and half that for European; peer institutions in more desirable locations might see 50% more again.\n\nThere are jobs out there in History, or at least were pre-COVID. In the 2019 cycle there were 320 tenure-track positions advertised in the US (among 548 full time positions overall) according to data from the American Historical Association.  In 2018 there were just over 1,000 new history Ph.D.s awarded in the US.  So we're basically producing 3x as many Ph.D.s as there are TT opening annually, and of course many of those who are not hired immediately will remain in the market for 5-7 years so there are probably 10x as many people pursuing positions as there are openings. But it's far from zero.",

Indeed, the opposite is often true now: \"Wanted: US Historian, 20th century, with expertise in gender, race, labor, and environment. Secondary fields in history of medicine and technology a plus.\" And they'll get apps from anyone who has a glancing familiarity with any *one* of those subfields. The problem is that in many places departments are shrinking or frozen, so replacement hires are often asked to do double or triple duty. Ads tend to be using broad language but also with multiple subfields.\n\nI'd love to be on a search committee for something narrow that only got 50 applications.",

That's a different concern, of course, from the \"sell-by date\" issue which has some committee members believing that anyone who hasn't been hired into a TT position within three years of completing the Ph.D. is somehow damaged goods.

Not much since except for a few fields in high demand. The academic job market pretty much collapsed in the mid-1970s and never really recovered as once demand increased in the 1990s (more students) schools shifted to hiring adjunct/term labor instead of TT.

So now every graduate worth their salt has published a lot right out of the PhD. At least on paper. TBH, the quality of publications has gone down considerably and there are a lot of journals whose sole existence is to pad CVs out. Nobody actually reads or cites the research published in them.",

There is a lot to appreciate in the whole history of criticism in medieval/Renaissance, and there's also some things that are just...no. Old-school philologists often have a lot to say that still helps you understand things. In the case of these two women, both of them were looking at how French romances got communicated to Spain in the 13th-17th centuries via reading a whole lot of very, very long texts, many of which are only slightly different from each other. I couldn't do it today. It's not political work at all, so it lasted.",

There were apparently something like *five* jobs posted in the entire USA. And of course hundreds of candidates. I've heard similar stories from others about the mid-1970s market as well.\n\nSure, there was some measure of the old boys' network still, but certainly by the mid 70s there were highly competitive searches happening at many schools. I was on my first search committee (as a student) in the 1980s and the process looked exactly like it does today in that case, complete with 200+ applicants for a single TT line in history at an SLAC.",

They had all gotten their positions in the early 2000s and earned tenure/promotion. When I applied to positions last year before the higher ed market bottomed out due to COVID, one of the schools told me point-blank that they had over two-hundred applicants with the Ph.D. in-hand.
