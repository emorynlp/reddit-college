  "text": " So I'm applying for a Mat. Sci Ph.D. in this cycle for fall 2022. I had one professor who taught me economics and he knew me very well inside and outside of the class, and he told me once said that he would be very happy to recommend me if I decided to go to graduate school. I was wondering I can get a LOR from him and whether this can hurt my application if he is not in a relevant field.",
