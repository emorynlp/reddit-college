  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a Masters student currently working on my thesis.I need some advice from you smart and kind people on reading papers for my thesis(TL;DR at the end). I know and understand the rationale behind reading related work but I find reading a paper soul-sucking!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find most papers related to my topic cool and interesting but I have not been able to get myself to sit at a place and read a paper end to end.Reading a paper end to end once takes about 3 hours for me and normally multiple iterations(at least 3-4x) are required to understand someone else's work enough to confidently evaluate it's positives and negatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thesis supervisor expects me to have at least 20 references in my thesis which I find kinda reasonable but quite overwhelming.\n\nWhat can I do to make this process less painful and if possible little enjoyable?  \nAny tips/tricks to understand a paper faster?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy professors have always said that reading papers is a critical skill for researchers.I came back to school after working in a corporate RnD for a long time. I aspire to be a researcher in academia rather than industry as I get to focus on solutions rather than being bogged down by commercialization.\n\nBut, am also worried. Am I unfit to be researcher in academia as I dislike reading papers?  \nHow do I overcome this dislike?\n\nTL;DR: What can I do to make the process of reading papers not painful, if possible enjoyable?",

      "text": "First thing's first - you can't write anything of merit without frst understanding the context. So reading should be step 1 of anything.\n\nSecond, papers are not like books. You don't start at the beginning, then read to the end. They have different sections for a reason. Ask yourself why a re you reading a particular paper.  Is it because you just want to see what's in it? Is it because it's been recommended or heavily referenced elsewhere? Is it because you want to know how something was done? Is it because you want to double check an interpretation or quote or something?\n\nIf I'm approaching a paper for the first time without a specific goal, my approach is this:\n1. Read the abstract. If it looks useful then\n2. Check out the figures. \n\nI can then decide which other parts of the paper I need to read. \n\nIf I don't understand why they're doing something, read the intro.\nIf I don't understand how they did something, read the methods.\nIf I want to see how they interpreted their data, read the discussion and conclusions.\n\nFor 60% of papers I pick up, flipping through the abstract and figures tells me enough that I can put it aside because it's not directly relevant to the thing I'm working on at this moment in time.",

      "text": "how are you currently reading? what types of papers are these\u2014empirical/primary studies or reviews or theoretical works? i take a very different approach to each type. \n\ni am personally a very stats-y/methods-y kind of person so empirical papers are the ones i can read the fastest as it comes most \u201cnaturally\u201d to me. for these papers i usually skip or skim the intro. focus on the methods and results, and maybe the discussion (esp. where they detail their limitations and future directions). i\u2019ll go back to the intro if i need more details, but otherwise generally i do not read the intro in detail. empirical papers are very very quick for me, at most 30 min per study if i\u2019m really reading in detail, or 1 hour max if i\u2019m taking notes/compiling info into a spreadsheet. \n\nfor review papers, i\u2019ll read from start to finish. they\u2019re review papers after all! they set up the backdrop, summarise what\u2019s important/known, and may have some research gaps/limitations identified. take note of these. also take note of what seems to be the conventional/standard practice in the area, based on either what the review says explicitly, or based on skimming the studies cited by the review. i may or may not write a summary (in bullet points) on the front page. for me, review papers are not a struggle, but they do take time because it\u2019s a huge chunk of info. \n\ntheoretical works are difficult for me as i find it hard to understand abstract things. when i read a theoretical work i prefer to print it out, grab some highlighters and pens, and sit down at a table with nothing else and really focus and read through and annotate/summarise along the way. i\u2019ll also write a short summary or draw a diagram if needed on the front page. \n\nif you\u2019re someone who\u2019s good with abstract concepts and struggles with stats/methods then your approach may be the opposite of mine, but hope that helps!",

      "text": "It depends on how you are using a specific source. Some things you need to read super carefully (e.g. if you claim someone is wrong), some things you just need to gloss over quite hastily (e.g. if you just want to inform your reader that a certain type of literature exist. \"Others have studied phenomena X using method Y (Andersson, 1999; Olsen, 2010; Smith, 2020).\")\n\nI only worry about two things: Am I 100 % sure that I am not misrepresenting this piece of work? (Would the authors agree with my use of their work?) And, is it reasonably relevant to use it, or are there busloads of better and more relevant work out there?\n\nTo read effectively is a skill that takes time to develop. I spend anywhere between 2 minutes and several hours on different journal articles, depending on their use.",

      "text": "I second the tips so far about not reading a STEM-style paper like a book, but when I do have to read a whole paper (e.g. to review it for journal publication), it can still take me hours, even after years of practice. Even when I'm super interested, I get yawn attacks after a few minutes, or my mind wanders. Here are some tricks I use, in case they're helpful.\n\nFirst, I don't sit down to start on an important paper when I'm sleepy or mentally fatigued. That's a waste of time that will stretch to infinity without retaining anything.\n\nA good strategy is the pomodoro method, where you set a timer for working, then a short break, repeat. The recommended reps are 25 mins on, 5 min break, repeat x3, then a longer break. But sometimes I don't last that long, so I do 10-15 and 2 mins, or just stand up and walk a lap around the house/dept as soon as I start yawning or spacing out. \n\nSometimes I stand up for one paragraph and sit for the next. If that's impractical, I have another task handy that I can do in small chunks -- as small as deleting one listserv email or charging the colors on a graph (just once, don't get side tracked with procrasti-work) is enough to break up the yawns without forgetting what I'm reading about. \n\nEven so, I often don't finish in one sitting anyway. Sometimes I can't process all the info, or it gets me thinking about related things, and because that feels like a usually-elusive muse is striking, I follow it (and often get some good brainstorming for my own project done, which is the grander purpose of all the reading). Then I get a snack and get back to reading, or stop because forcing too much big thinking at once can have diminishing returns or result in a thinking hangover the next day (beware, this also applies to binge-writing). \n\nObviously, for me the key is to break up the process with short, easy mental or physical activities, not try to focus on the whole paper at once (if you truly need the whole paper). I'm jealous of people who seem to gobble up papers and chapters, but maybe they're just better skimmers.",
