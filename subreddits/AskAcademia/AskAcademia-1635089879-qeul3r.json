In the UK, there is mandatory reporting but I believe it only applies to much narrower range of professions (not university staff) and only in relation to children. Your supervisor has no obligation to call the police and should respect your wishes. I obviously cannot promise she wouldn't but she's not legally required to. If she does call the police, you do not have to speak to them and you will not be in trouble if you choose not to. \n\nWould contacting victim support help you? They are an independent charity who can provide advice and support. They aren't linked to the police and you don't have to have reported the crime to the police to access their services.\n\nI think we chatted a few days ago. I'm so so sorry this is happening. Please do keep coming back here if you have questions or need advice.",

Reading through your comments I can feel your despair and isolation and would really encourage you to seek support from someone/where you trust, be that a Counsellor, nurse, doctor, lecturer or from somewhere like Rape Crisis. Reaching out and being vulnerable especially when you are feeling so vulnerable and violated already can be so scary. You matter and none of this is your fault",

Thing is, your uni may not be equipped to deal with that level of crisis anyway, treat this as back up. \nAbsolutely contact the specialist rape crisis services on the phone wherever you are, they have better options insight and knowledge than anyone here on reddit and they won\u2019t force you to do anything and they can provide you with emergency menta health that\u2019s actually tailored. I\u2019m speaking from experience. \nAlso, you definitely need a looking at at the hospital if you\u2019re blacking out - and in general. Take a friend and go to a walk in sexual health clinic (theyre kinder and skilled at handling sexual assault) but your local A&E should be as well. \nRemember that whatever you do, you don\u2019t have to go to the police or press charges or anything. You just need to take care of you. But if you are given options that would preserve evidence or allow evidence in the future, and it\u2019s not excruciating to go through, I\u2019d thorougly recommend you see if you can. At worst, you leave it. At best, once your post-trauma recovery progresses you will have options. And options is what you want after what this inhumane person did to you. I am so sorry. You can get through this, make sure you priorotise your physical safety (inc health), physiological felt safety (where you sleep, where you go), then mental health, and plans and long term commitments are last. Let them slide for now, you will catch up, it will be explained later. Use your autopilot to take care of and organsie the basics, then let yourself collapse in safe company. The only thing that matters is that you give yourself space and safe environment to reel from the violation, let yourself rest in peace as the shock subdues. The more you do this the easier it will get. Sending you so much love. X",

You can take a leave of absence without giving a reason. It is your right to keep personal matters personal. It is probably good to let someone like your supervisor know that you are having a personal issue of some sought so they can be ready to help you if and when you want their help.\n\nIf you want, I could ask the people at my university (in London) if they'd be willing to talk to you even though you're not a student here.
