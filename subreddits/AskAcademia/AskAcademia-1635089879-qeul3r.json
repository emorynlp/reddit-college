In the UK, there is mandatory reporting but I believe it only applies to much narrower range of professions (not university staff) and only in relation to children. Your supervisor has no obligation to call the police and should respect your wishes. I obviously cannot promise she wouldn't but she's not legally required to. If she does call the police, you do not have to speak to them and you will not be in trouble if you choose not to. \n\nWould contacting victim support help you? They are an independent charity who can provide advice and support. They aren't linked to the police and you don't have to have reported the crime to the police to access their services.\n\nI think we chatted a few days ago. I'm so so sorry this is happening. Please do keep coming back here if you have questions or need advice.",

I\u2019m speaking from experience. \nAlso, you definitely need a looking at at the hospital if you\u2019re blacking out - and in general. Take a friend and go to a walk in sexual health clinic (theyre kinder and skilled at handling sexual assault) but your local A&E should be as well. \nRemember that whatever you do, you don\u2019t have to go to the police or press charges or anything. You just need to take care of you. But if you are given options that would preserve evidence or allow evidence in the future, and it\u2019s not excruciating to go through, I\u2019d thorougly recommend you see if you can. At worst, you leave it. At best, once your post-trauma recovery progresses you will have options. And options is what you want after what this inhumane person did to you. I am so sorry. You can get through this, make sure you priorotise your physical safety (inc health), physiological felt safety (where you sleep, where you go), then mental health, and plans and long term commitments are last. Let them slide for now, you will catch up, it will be explained later. Use your autopilot to take care of and organsie the basics, then let yourself collapse in safe company. The only thing that matters is that you give yourself space and safe environment to reel from the violation, let yourself rest in peace as the shock subdues. The more you do this the easier it will get. Sending you so much love. X",

      "text": "OP, I am so sorry this happened to you. I completely sympathise with what you are going through - last year, I was sexually assaulted by a former classmate and had to navigate through the trauma, managing my research degree, and being terrified of bumping into him again. It is horrible and I cannot emphasise enough how sorry I am for what happened to you. Somebody committed a horrific, atrocious, and truly despicable act against you and for that I hope they rot. You did nothing wrong and you deserve to treat yourself with love and respect now as you recover - please repeat that to yourself as a mantra! It is so easy to blame ourselves but we, as victims, did nothing wrong and in no way shape or form are responsible for the atrocities we endured. \n\nYou don't have to report to the police if you don't feel comfortable. You are under no obligation to so don't feel pressured to if this is not something you want. I did, and if you want any information on what that is like, please feel free to DM me and I can share my experience with you as I feel it is not talked about enough from the victim's perspective which creates a lot of fear. \n\nAs for the university: message people as soon as possible. I never told my supervisor what happened to me, I only vaguely alluded to something serious happening in an email which meant that I needed time off. I also emailed the postgraduate research administrator who talked me through my options: it is possible to suspend studies if you need to. My supervisor was wonderful and supportive; they want you to succeed and will support you as best they can whilst you recover. Your health is of course the priority. For the uni counselling service, my university had a waitlist too... but if you are able to tell them what happened, they can bump you up to the top; they should have priority spots for issues like this. \n\nMost importantly, you can access a SARC (sexual assault referral centre) for free, in complete confidentiality, and with no requirement to go to the police. You can get a medical assessment and receive information and guidance on your options and routes to recovery - I was referred to a local charity who were able to advise me and offer free counselling through them. If you do one thing at all, please do this. It's so overwhelming to find these resources yourself, so having an advisor lay everything out is so useful. \n\nThe first few months are incredibly rough so please be as gentle as possible with yourself. I know it is tempting to lock it away and forget about it, but accessing support and help is beneficial for your recovery and long-term mental health. Because I was able to put myself into therapy (which was hard as I hate talking), rest, and most importantly to love and support myself, I have been able to return to my research. \n\nReading up on how trauma impacts the brain, common reactions to rape (I froze during mine and experienced a lot of distress after that I didn't \"fight\" so reading that this was common helped me overcome the hatred I felt towards myself) including the trauma rape syndrome will help you understand your own trauma and prevent bad coping mechanisms from occurring. \n\nAgain I am so sorry for what has happened to you, please take care of yourself and love and support yourself! If you want any informal personal guidance on anything, please feel free to DM.",

It isn't your fault, please try and repeat this to yourself as much as you can going forward. The only person at fault is your rapist, not you in any way, shape or form. You did absolutely nothing wrong and know that you cannot cause the crimes that were committed against you ever.\n\nI would try and access charity services if you can, and try utilise the SARC as I did. I did find that the external support was better than what the university did provide. Have you talked to any of your family or friends or other trusted people yet? I know it can be difficult to do so but having others rally around you can be very beneficial.

                      "text": "I completely understand and you are absolutely NOT overreacting at all. Experiencing a rape is an incredibly traumatic experience and will have seriously altered your psyche. The immediate aftermath (the acute trauma stage) had me unable to function for months! Take it easy as you can and remember that this is a life-altering experience through which you do need time and patience with yourself to adjust.\n\nIt is abnormal that your university has responded so poorly to this. They should be doing better. It is a huge deal to both have a student who has experienced something so grave and receive no support and for there to be a serious security concern on campus. Universities are full of lots of unnecessary bureaucracy so I am hoping the lack of support for you right now is an accidental oversight (still abominable) and not a deliberate lack of care. I know you may not be incredibly comfortable in doing so but it could be beneficial to directly email your supervisor. You don't have to share all the details with them - I simply told mine I'd been the victim of a serious crime and they were able to help me navigate some of the university bureaucracy. \n\nA note that it could be difficult for the university to act, however, if they do not know who this student is and they may need you to at least instigate a police case in order to identify him and do something about it. The police system can be exhausting but the benefit is that if they are investigating your case and identify your attacker, a restraining order is applied - this could provide you with some comfort over the next few months if you know your attacker can legally be prosecuted for breaching the order (I found that helped me rehabilitate myself in walking around in areas he could potentially be).\n\nI know from experience that talking about what happened to you and confiding in others is so hard - you might feel like you're burdening others, that you're \"overreacting\" and that you should just be able to \"get over it\". Please trust me when I say you aren't burdening others, that you're not overreacting, and that you can't just click your fingers and forget this. You deserve the support from the systems that exist and anyone who doesn't appreciate how terrible what happened to you is an asshole.",

And I don\u2019t want her to know anyway. I haven\u2019t got anybody to tell this to. I\u2019m really isolated which is making the silence from the university so much worse",

There are Discord groups that survivors use to talk to each other for this reason and there are probably support groups in your area - I can link you to the Discord group that I found beneficial if you would like.",
