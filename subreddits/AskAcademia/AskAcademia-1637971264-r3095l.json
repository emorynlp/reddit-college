  "text": "So I was just thinking, are all PhDs all set for life when they did their research back in their grad student days/post doc days? How rare is the switching of research interest after getting the degree. For example your research interest is environmental microbiology, then after some time you wanna delve in immunology or any of the likes?",

I worked as a research scientist for a few years and worked on a few areas adjacent to my graduate work and eventually ended up doing a lot of computational optics, which led me into machine learning. Now I\u2019m working as a data scientist in the materials industry. Ostensibly I\u2019ve moved from chemical engineering (what I have my PhD in) to data science/materials science (most of my colleagues\u2019 backgrounds). Also caveat that I\u2019m not really a researcher any more, working on interesting problems, but more of an applied scientist.",

      "text": "I have personally done it between postdocs (maths) and it surprised both my supervisors and colleagues at the time. While I had initially done it out of desperation for a job, it turned out to be a great decision. My first topic was more interesting to me but the second was more on the rise and attracting a lot of funding/new job opportunities. Now I can present myself as a \"specialist\"/knowledgeable on both and it shows that I am not a one-trick pony. However, I had to learn the topic in a very short time in order to prepare for the interview and sometimes I feel that I know a bit less than people who have dedicated their careers from the very beginning for one or the other topic. That being said, I feel confident that this will dissipate with time and I am still able to work/publish on both topics. In my field, it is also not so uncommon to have people even completely switch fields (and not only topics) from physics to maths.",

If you made a name for yourself doing some specific thing X (and you need to have made a name for yourself to get a decent permanent job) then it is much easier to get funding in X, attract students in X, and find interesting problems in X. When shifts do happen, it is usually early before you have made a name, or to fields where skills from X can be used. Only rarely, do shifts to completely unrelated areas happen (and usually even then, the areas are not as unrelated as they seem on closer inspection).",
