(It is for this reason that I keep digital copies of most of my students' papers, even years later--so that I have something to go off of when a student I haven't had in class for some time asks for a letter.) It may not have as many details or examples as some of the stronger letters I write, but I can honestly say some good things about what the student learned and the quality of their work, and sometimes a student just needs a certain number of letters.",

      "text": "I have no problem with it, but I love when students remind me who they are (\"I'm the one who sat in the front row with my sister and she brought her baby once.\" - yes, I received that email and immediately remembered). I like when they send me an essay they wrote for me, complete with my comments. Also, I like when student sends unofficial transcript and an indication of why they are applying to a certain program.\n\nYou can offer to meet with the professor via zoom. Also, if you want a guaranteed great reference, remind the professor of something clever they said that stuck with you. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Echoing others, it's not a problem at all; I think that professors see this all the time. I was worried like you about (my much larger) time gap and etiquette, and two days ago emailed a professor I had in 2013 who happened to run into me in 2017, about a LOR with a well-drafted and thought-out message. I graduated in 2015 so I've been out of school for nearly 6 years besides two cc courses last Fall and a hodge-podge of related experience. She remembered me, my final paper, bumping into me later on, and accepted my request and asked for a follow-up email of pertinent information. Offering to send a detailed second email or a zoom meeting if they're willing to write for you, and allowing them to choose what works best for them is a good idea.",

Consistency (in terms of grades & career trajectory) & perseverance (in the face of adversity) mean more to me than just smooth sailing because life someone's life has been frictionless. I can promise you, with your strong grades, & with being quiet, your prof absolutely remembers you. You were one of their best, most unburdensome students, & they would likely be pleased to write you a letter. Please keep this in mind: much lower graded--& very poorly behaving--students have no worries about asking for letters. Please do ask for your letter & aim for what's in your heart.",

I asked 4 profs who I got A/A- with, one politely declined because they did not remember me, another said yes in case I needed one but advised me against using his because he didn\u2019t remember me and would use a template, and the other 2 remembered me well and agreed (only needed 2 for the program).",
