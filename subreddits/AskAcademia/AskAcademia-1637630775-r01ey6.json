  "text": "I'm in my fifth year of my Ph.D. I know OF a lot of people in my field, but there aren't really conferences for my specific subfield. I don't know how to talk to them in a way that feels normal. Do other people find this frustrating? \n\nI'm at the point where I want to build a new social media platform for academia to find ppl based on my endnote library lol",

      "text": "Cold emailing for a quick zoom chat costs almost nothing, and academics generally LOVE any attention to our respective work. \n\nTo argue the other side though, I would like to see more interdisciplinary points of connection. My PhD is in education, and I recently spent some years with engineers. I learned loads of things, and I was also struck by what was obvious in my field but not in theirs. Seems academia needs more of that and less of folks thinking their phd in X makes them qualified for ABCDEF, and G.",
