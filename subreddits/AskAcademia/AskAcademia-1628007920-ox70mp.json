  "text": " Dear academics,\n\nReddit seems to be a promising opportunity to reach interested study participants and we are exploring the possibility of using this recruitment strategy. However, there are not many papers that discuss sampling through reddit (one exception is [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439316650163](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439316650163)) and those that do mostly focus on recruitment through the subreddit r/samplesize (e.g., [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00986283211020739](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00986283211020739), [https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1356&context=pare](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1356&context=pare)), which has the explicit aim of connecting academics with people who are actively seeking to participate in online studies. We are interested in recruiting outside of this specific subreddit, perhaps through another sample of subreddits associated with specific topics/interests. Thus, we wonder if anyone who follows this reddit might have experiences with sampling via reddit (esp. with subreddits other than r/samplesize) and would be willing to share some lessons learned and/or relevant things to consider for successful sampling. \n\nSome strategies that we have in mind so far include:\n\n* Incentivize participation with an Amazon voucher lottery among all study participants\n* Focus on subreddits that may be interested in the study topic\n* Being active in answering comments and questions\n* Select the posting time carefully (as proposed here: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439316650163](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439316650163))\n\nThanks in advance for your support!",

If it is the latter, what is your take on how this may have affected the results? Why should I read this?",

As mentioned by another user below, there's key questions you'd asked anyway and which you can find supporting citations for from general social media/platform/network methodological articles.",
