  "text": "After ten years of school and four more of postdoc, a year of dozens of applications, I finally got an offer. Still waiting to hear from one more I did a campus interview with. \n\nIt's less pay than I wanted, isolated location, less startup funds, and they \"don't do tenure.\"\n\nShould I be happy? It's almost what I wanted. A lab, an office, teaching, low cost of living and a solid middle class salary. More than many will ever get.\n\nShould I feel disinfranchised? \n\nI just feel tired.",

Are they going to do massive non-renewal years in the future because of a fluctuating market? Or do they have a massive endowment/state funds they can fall back on?",

The main difference, in both the UK and Australia, is that passing tenure is usually much more simple than getting tenure.

Ultimately, there's far less job insecurity among early-mid career academics.  Late career has slightly less, but really that just means you're expected to keep doing the job you're employed to do.  \n\nI wouldn't swap it for the tenure system and can't think of many people who would.",

Are they able to retain faculty for long, or is everyone always looking for a path out? Hopefully the second interview will pan out...I wish none of us had to even consider schools that \"don't do tenure\" and that's the primary reason academics are willing  to accept shitty compensation-- job security.",

The longer you stay in a bad school, the harder it is to find a new job. And with the kind of employment law we have in the US (assuming that this school is in the US), tenure is necessary. There are countries where it is not necessary, but not in the US. So don't go to this school, it is a trap. The only reason to go to a place like that is if it increases your chances of leaving for a better place in 1-2 years, which is not likely to be the case, based on your description.",
