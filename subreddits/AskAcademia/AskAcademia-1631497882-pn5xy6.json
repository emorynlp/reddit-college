Could end up in academia where pubs matter greatly or that may not work out and my dissertation pubs could be irrelevant (I have some severe geographical limitations due to family situation). I am totally at peace with my situation and where I\u2019ll land.\n\nWhen I asked faculty members to join on my dissertation essays as 2nd/3rd author (standard in my field and dept) I feel a very clear, albeit implied bargain and commitment was established.  \u201cIn exchange for your helping me craft this and get it across the finish line, you will receive authorship which is valuable not only as a pub but as a demonstrable metric of your efforts at mentorship.\u201d I have experienced this as a very fair bargain and have received countless hours of help and advice, as I\u2019d expect to receive from any second author.  If the first author flakes out and abandons the project, it is pretty disrespectful of the time and effort committed to date by the other authors.\n\nI understand OP is no longer in academia.  However, they received considerable benefits up front (potentially this work was essential to their dissertation, being deemed qualified to graduate, or relevant to reference letters etc).  It\u2019s pretty disrespectful to not at least propose a way to get this across the line.  Now, if the reviewers want a) another study, b) complete rework, c) high risk revision then maybe the appropriate course is to bring in another grad student to get this across the line.  And of course, upon a reasonable number of rejections (1-2 As, 1-2 A-, 1-2 B journals) its fair to call it dead.  But if you\u2019re at R&R at a good journal, you\u2019re on the hook for revisions IMO.  It\u2019s also disrespectful to the reviewers\u2019 time.\n\nThink of it this way: might you ever want something from this prof EVER again.  I personally have reached back to professors I hadn\u2019t worked with in 10+ years and I\u2019m still a PhD student.  The rest of your career is a long time.  Consider the value of preserving this relationship.\n\nIs it a rule? No. Could you \u201cget in trouble\u201d? No.  But you know what they say about \"what goes around\" (it comes around) and about karma (it\u2019s a bitch).",

The consequences are likely reputational damage because of a perceived violation of the implicit agreement.\n\nOP hasn't given us any idea of the scope of the changes requested.  I've had revisions take many months with new work/analysis or a couple afternoons for more straightforward revisions.  If there's a big ask, note that I specifically state someone being compensated (e.g., another grad student) should be brought on as an author.\n\nHowever, if the changes requested are something that could be knocked out in a couple weekends, that seems like a reasonable price to pay to preserve this professional relationship.  The world is small and a professional network who you trust and who trust you is very valuable.  If OP wants to burn it down, go for it. I've been in and out of academia and put time into papers after I had graduated; years later I needed a letter of rec and was pretty glad I hadn't burned that relationship (didn't plan to do a PhD).\n\nI get this argument that this is \"free work\" and sure, that makes sense.  I wouldn't put many hours into it. I treat academia as a job and my time is my time.  Feel free to call me brainwashed (as you implied and called another respondent)...maybe not the best way to proceed with the discussion but I digress.\n\nThe reality is that if the implicit bargain didn't exist, PhD students would either a) not be allowed to graduate until papers were in press or b) wouldn't get authorship for RA work.",

I noted, and think I allow for, a range of responses from OP based on the workload.  Have they even \\*responded\\* to the PI?  We don't know. Many people (myself included) like what they're doing. One of my coauthors is in industry and just does research for fun and to stay current in the field. PI might be under the (not ridiculous) assumption that OP really wants to see their paper published.  \n\nIf this submission was a requirement to graduate, then OP should be glad their institution allows graduation before papers are published which is all the more reason to do the revisions. Pay back the people who did it before you (getting papers across the line after graduation) by paying it forward and keeping the requirement as is.  If the submission was NOT a requirement to graduate in any way, they shouldn't have submitted it if they didn't intend to finish it (as a reviewer, I'd be pissed that they just burned my time like that).\n\nSubmitting a paper to a journal is different than other types of work. It has similarities, sure, and it's real work.  But there are differences.  I've done work for an employer to finish a project after I left--under a lucrative consulting agreement. And I finished a paper with coauthors after graduation because it was the right thing to do, and that professional relationship was retained.\n\nThe ball is in OP's court to preserve the relationship.  If the professor has been exploitative, then OP is welcome to burn the prof, refuse to take a call later, provide a reference, etc.  The relationship is likely much more valuable to OP (PhD Advisor) than to the PI (one of presumably many advisees).",

My advisor always said that it felt like each of his graduate students takes a small piece of his soul with them when they graduate. My point is that completing the revisions and resubmitting could be a nice way to reciprocate the trust and effort that your advisor showed you when they took a chance to bring you into their research group. Otherwise, I would do everything you can to make sure your advisor had what they need to complete the revisions themselves.",

In a nutshell, you can expect that your co-authors make an actual contribution to the work. But you cannot expect that they do specific stuff that you ask them to do (like in this case, carry the paper over the finishing line).\n\nIf you're not satisfied with their level of contribution, whatever it is, you are free to not coauthor with them anymore. People might even generally work towards a reasonable level of contribution because they want to keep the collaboration for the future. But that doesn't apply to OP's case.\n\n> If much effort is required, then another person [...] should be brought in to get it across the line.\n\nAbout this point we agree then. The tricky part is where to draw the line between \"acceptable effort\" and \"too much effort\".",

Admittedly, that's a shaky assumption to make. Some revisions are intensive, and if OP wanted to clarify that the revisions required mean that he'd need to completely run a new set of experiments that would take months of work, he'd need equipment he no longer has access to, etc., then I'd happily give different advice. My experience though is that people who don't want to do something are generally extremely forthcoming with any reasons why they shouldn't be expected to do it.\n\nAnd I don't really believe in karma. The truth is that OP can almost certainly go through life disappointing people and never face any practical consequences for it. I cannot express my disagreement strongly enough with the idea that he shouldn't feel responsible for that. Being a good person is perfectly defined by what you do when all the consequences of your choices fall on other people. The idea that I can just do whatever is convenient for me, and then be **right** in feeling no responsibility for how it makes other people feel is downright sociopathic.",

You're not paid the way a normal worker is paid. You're paid a lot less because it's really an apprenticeship, and part of what you're getting is training, mentoring, etc. I don't think money is even relevant here. It comes down to this: you have the ability to, with what is likely not very much effort on your part, help out someone who probably did quite a lot to help you as well. I don't need a lot more specifics to say you should try to do that. Again, surely there are limits. You shouldn't feel obligated to spend 200 hours of work completely revamping your experimental setup. You shouldn't feel oblgated to come by after work three days a week to supervise his new students. It doesn't seem to me like what's being asked is remotely close to that. I think you *should* feel obligated to spend a few hours of your time to help a person out who presumably was important in helping you get where you are.

It's all about clarity and trust.\n\nIt never happened to me that a student refused to finish a paper after graduating.

But my ex-students can be trusted \u2013 and that's the key point here.\n\nI wouldn't be able to keep these former students \"hostage\" even if I wanted. I have zero leverage. They have a job in a different country. The \"hostage\" rhetoric of \"free labor\" makes no sense here - if they didn't want to finish the work, they could tell me explicitly, and there would be nothing I could do. I would be disappointed though, because of the trust relationship I had with them.\n\nThe logic that the papers are \"for the PI\" is wrong and indefensible. I do hope PhD students who want to embark in this adventure understand it before starting. A professor doesn't need yet another paper, especially when they're established. But the hours spent mentoring, supervising, and offering help could have been spent better, if the outcome is a paper that ends up in nothing. Again, it's a question of trust and mutual collaboration.\n\nIf you're a PhD student and find yourself in a toxic environment, as your tone suggests, have a conversation with your supervisor and consider leaving for better places.",

This is not what phd students sign up for, the offer students get at the beginning (inclusive of terms and conditions) defines the conditions to graduate very differently. That means you would be holding someone hostage. Moreover, the review process can drag on for many months through no fault of the student and it can be very uncertain.

That's what I have always done, and will continue to do.\n\nOne final note. The sentence\n\n>if you weren't getting *your* accepted papers after students graduate\n\nis questionable and hints at a toxic relationship with the research environment. It's not \"my\" paper. I don't need yet another paper \u2013 but the student does. If a student finishes their PhD with little to show, it's a loss primarily for them, not for the professor.",

There is just no way around that randomness. If the paper has merit, it will be accepted within 2 years whatever happens. Within 6 months? It is much less likely. Perhaps the one way out for the student is to stop working on any new experiments after say 2 years and just wait for everything to be accepted by the end of the 4th year so they know they will be able to graduate in time (you can scale the numbers as appropriate if not based in Europe). But that would not be very productive, would it.\n\nI did not assume 2. In my opinion it is irrelevant if you warn them if in the end they are subject to uncertainty in the review process.\n\nIf the student goes to industry to work in an unrelated field than no, they do not need that paper.

Journals and conferences in my field are usually accepted within 6 to 12 months, unless something special happens. So planning 12-18 months ahead is reasonable in most cases. However, I do agree it's undesirable. That's the reason why I don't require acceptance to finish, but only submission.\n\nI also hope I'll never find myself with a student who \"doesn't need the paper\". The very concept is upsetting to me, to be honest. I spend about 5-10 hours per week per PhD student, mentoring and working with them (I write code and parts of the paper). If a student who left told me \"I don't need the paper, bye\" I would be very disappointed.\n\nBut then again \u2013 if a student told me in advance \"after I graduate, I won't be able to work on any paper\", I'd use the 12-18 months to onboard a new student, and ask the old one to mentor them. Planning goes a long way in establishing relaxed and productive environments.",

OP isn't \"ditching them\" by not having the time and energy to write up a paper for the benefit of advancing their PI's career.\n\nI'm not saying you have to treat everything as transactional. Even if OP doesn't write the paper this doesn't mean he can't still maintain a friendly relationship with the PI - if the PI is really someone who cares for OP outside of the pure transaction of career benefits then they should be understanding of OPs choice and position.\n\nTheir mentor \"may have different needs\"?? Give me a break. This is a senior researcher who already must have plenty of publications under their belt pressuring a younger person who may be trying to find their way in their own career. There is much more risk in this being harmful to OP, whereas it's basically a mild inconvenience for the PI, who we might add was \"hands off\" so we don't even know their involvement with the project. OP has just started a new job and likely wants to make a good first impression and learn about their new field.\n\nI'm also not saying that OP shouldn't do the paper - in another comment I've given reasons why it might be a good idea. But framing this as some great betrayal that should sour their relationship permanently is off the rails. If anything the mere suggestion that it might do so is the more \"transactional\" view. PIs that care about their students don't exploit them for their own gain and then cut off the relationship when the student doesn't have the mental energy to complete an extracurricular project.\n\nEdit: also I noticed another detail in your comment that's made me angry. *You have no clue how long the revisions might take.* For all you know OP might have to run more experiments or prove more theorems to satisfy the reviewers. But even if it is just a few hours spread over a month, not everyone has the bandwidth to do that. Because it's never just a few hours in isolation. There are transition costs in moving from one mentally taxing task to another. The are missed opportunities in relaxing/destressing/socialising. We don't know how OP feels, maybe they're not proud of the work or simply uninterested, but what we do know is that OP clearly says that they don't want to and they don't have the time. \n\nFor all we know the PI should look back in the years to come and wish they had treated OP better.

I obtained a fulltime job in industry (consulting) earlier this year before I completed my PhD, and am trying to publish four of my PhD chapters as papers. I thought it would be easy with the stable job, but turns out working for a solid 7.5+ hours a day (with billable hours I might add) is so tiring. Especially knowing how difficult my co-authors are; those free weeknights and weekends will bleed into literally any down time I will have and the burn out is already so persistent. \n\nBut I don't want to let my supervisor, co-authors, funding bodies, science in general and most importantly, myself, down. I made promises to them, to myself, to publish, and I want to keep them. Or I will always have that nagging guilt. \n\nIf I were you; I feel that professionally and morally, finishing the paper is a good thing to do, even if it is no longer necessary career-wise. Especially since you have already submitted it. However, I will add that you don't technically 'owe' yourself to anyone, and that having boundaries regarding downtime and retaining ownership of hard work is also important given your current job, which has its own demands.\n\nThis is the most conflicted I have felt in the academic subreddit. I am at a tug of war with myself on this. Even after publishing my first paper, which affirmed my choice to move to industry, I knew this problem would blight me. I feel like I'm publishing and perishing at the same time.",

The main question for me is who is the corresponding author? If it\u2019s the PI then it\u2019s up to them to sort out any revisions, either delegate it to one of their other grad students or do it themselves. If OP is corresponding author then they should do it but I doubt that\u2019s the case.",

If it needs some new data or experiment or substantial rewriting which would take up days of your time, then a present student of the PI may be asked to finish the work and become a co-author. You did most of the work already, which is doing the actual research and writing the paper; revising it should be much less difficult than the initial work it took, right?\n\nFurther, you may think you don't need this paper and don't need your PI anymore, but no one knows about the future. After many years, you may need your PI for some help, or be in a situation where one extra paper would do wonders for a CV, or even need to refer a colleague to the PI for some favour. At that time (if ever), he will remember your refusal (and rightfully so). Apart from the PI, his present colleagues will also probably be made privy to this incident (professors are humans too and they gossip as much, if not more often, than us grad students).\n\nIn summary, it's a typical risk vs reward choice which we often come across in life.
