  "text": "Hi all, I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this.\n\nI'm a 21 year old undergrad graduating this semester, and working towards a master's degree during my gap year while applying for MD/PhD programs. I have been in the same lab for 2.5 years during my undergrad career and absolutely fell in love with research, and my master's is a research-focused thesis-based program as well, I'm really excited to get started. \n\nI've seen quite a few posts on here from PhD students, incredibly stressed out and looking to leave their PhD programs, which does make me hesitate a little bit. What am I missing? Was it just not for you? Does it depend on your PI/mentor and the lab in which you complete your PhD? Are there things you wish you knew before you started? I would really love to be a physician researcher, however I don't want to spend the extra time working towards a PhD if it's going to take a significant toll on my mental and physical health and if I could do the same thing with only an MD. Any words of wisdom?",

In industry typically you will never have one person with that much control over your work. In academia, it is so hard to escape a toxic PI. \n\nI have first author pubs, an impressive list of jobs, I've been a TA for over 4 semesters, won an outside scholarship, and get invited to present at industry conferences.\n\nI also was offered a post doc position at my advisors alma mater without his help at ALL. \n\nHe still writes that I am \"significantly behind\" with regard to my research on my annual review form because I haven't published a paper in his favorite venue. He also won't furnish me a reference letter after 4 years of busting my butt in his lab. \n\nI know that my experience may be unique but a toxic PI can destroy you. You want to work for someone who is tough but fair and ultimately supportive. Also, I had to get comfortable with teaching myself EVERYTHING. You have to be willing to fail big for a PhD.",

      "text": "You cannot \"do the same with only an MD\". If you want to be a physician researcher in basic or translational research, then you need to get research training at some point. In the old days, MD training was much cheaper and research training was obtained through long postdocs/fellowship periods after med school (which pays very little compared an attending's salary). These days, med school is much more expensive, so going into research after a MD is rather rare, even with the NIH loan repayment program offers. A MD/PhD program that covers med school tuition and fees is definitely helpful. \n\nCompared to MD training, which has a beginning and an end and you are a paying customer, PhD in biomedical sciences feels more like a job/apprenticeship, where you're being paid, you have an advisor/boss/mentor, no defined timeline, and you need to produce results to graduate. There are lots of factors beyond your control that can all completely throw off  your plans. \n\nFor pure PhD students, there is the added stress of the job market in academia. This affects physician researchers as well, but you will have the fallback of a MD as backup, so it's less dire.",

To clarify, you could be involved in research in the same capacity with a MD if you pursue a postdoc after residency. You simply have to invest in research training/publication building time at some point in time, while the PhD title is not important. Having the publication record and mentoring/connection is. \n\nThe issue is that postdocs are poorly compensated for their time, so I'm not sure you'd want to be paying med school tuition yourself if you want to pursue research. Alternatively, you can try applying to a PSTP/research-track type of residency after medical school with just MD, but then again, they look for first author publications and evidence of research training.",

Having PhD next to your name simply isn't a hard requirement for a professorship in medicine like it is for basically any other field. Obviously you still need to do research, but contrary to what your post implies, post residency research fellowships still exist (or did 10 years ago, I guess it's not impossible that they've disappeared since). I don't doubt that they've gotten more rare, but they still exist. My sister actually took exactly that  path and is now tenured at a top school.",

So I've picked this up before going to school, but I feel like I've always had to apply this knowledge.\n\nMy experience in undergrad, PhD professors seemed so knowledgable in the subject (which they are) that it almost seemed intimidating to question their logic. Especially being an undergrad in a lab, you feel like  they just always know more and it sometimes feel like you just listen to orders without really having a full grasp of why you do whatever assay. But after working with a couple other PhDs at companies and now entering grad school, I realized how clueless everyone is! And no that's not a bad thing. It's just when you're doing research, you're doing something no one has ever looked into before. So if you have a reasonable hypothesis, then you'd be surprised on how easy it is to defend yourself when you're not just a \"yes man\" blindly following your PIs orders. I've grown to be more confident in advocating for myself and make sure my own ideas are heard.\n\nI guess in addition, career advice too. Everyone has different career paths and have ended up in similar positions, so be very careful with people that say \"this is exactly what you have to do to be successful, because this is what worked for me\". It's actually one of my peeves when people do that.\n\nTo clarify: obviously be open to listen to any career advice. But it's more beneficial to learn from a diverse set of experiences, and you'll see that every experience is different. So take them for what they are to develop your own path",

      "text": "Hey there! Let me first begin by stating that I love science. I mean with a capital L kinda love (since 6th grade). I was fascinated by astrophysics and biology. As biology (secrets of life) was more mysterious for me, I chose that. I will elaborate on the gruesome failed reciprocity of the love I have for science in a moment. \n\nI submitted my thesis this January working in neuroscience at a Med School overseas (if ranking matters to put a gaze on expectations; it\u2019s in top25 for the subject of medicine and within top15 in overall for the university). I finished in four years (6 months of shitty lab rotation + 3 years of actual work on two big projects + 6 months of writing paper/thesis) and that took a lot of personal sacrifices. It\u2019s not my home country first so social life has been pretty much non-existent (when you have experiments to do and troubleshoot by yourself; you can\u2019t meet people to chat about life!). Within two years my parter left me as I couldn\u2019t give her enough time (long-distance issues; legit blame on work priority>relationship). So let\u2019s forget about personal life.\n\nI have worked every single day in the lab out of love for science. If I am in the country; I will be found in the lab. I worked middays to midnights everyday (~12hr). I felt more comfortable in the lab than at my residence. I know it might sound cynical but solving scientific puzzles has been my childhood dream. It was out of passion rather than work. I was in the lab on the weekends due to the love for science; not because my PI told me to do something or I was behind on my deadlines. \n\nMy PI is the best boss ever (not kidding; extremely rare, but true). He has always embraced my sci-fi theories and supported to find answers to support my theories. I have been fortunate to have a boss like him. Despite my boss being the most supportive of me and me thoroughly enjoying science; I have been in an abusive scientific relationship (if I may call that)! I have loved it and it has not loved me back. Science is built on a lot of failures and I have embraced all of them as they have been learning experiences. But it\u2019s human to feel resentment and frustration at a lot of times. It\u2019s like always living at the bleeding edge of euphoria. Successes and failures. \n\nHaving said all of this; PhD has been a big and substantial journey for me that changed a lot of personality and professional traits (for the better or the worse). Makes you more resilient and patient. Makes you more in control of the ideas floating around you. It\u2019s like gaining an asset you can\u2019t lose. Gaining people management, time management, problem solving skills. It gets drilled down into your skull at every inch. Let\u2019s say you come to a big problem in the future that you haven\u2019t solved before (Scientific; administrative; whatever); you will find a solution for that. That\u2019s what having a PhD means. At least it rings true for STEM fields I hope.\n\nAll the best! It has to be an inner calling, remember that. It\u2019s about the passion; the suffering will be manageable.",

      "text": "late to this topic.  but wanted to chime in because this is an important topic.\n\nFor context, I am a physician scientist (MD/PhD), trained in a top MSTP program in the bay area, did residency, fellowship, and postdoc at a harvard hospital in Boston.   I have first author publications in top tier journals in my field (nature and nature sub-journals)\n\nI am also 39 years old, and finally about to start my own lab.  While I truly believe this is what i was meant to do, the work is very stressful and achieving a work-life balance in academia is nearly impossible.  The pay is also much lower in academia than in private practice or in pharma.\n\nyou'll hear a lot of different advice and opinions from people who have done grad school and/or med school.   here's my advice.  You should only seriously consider a career in academic medicine (i.e.becoming  physician-scientist who runs a lab) if there is no other career choice that makes you happy.\n\nThis may sound a little drastic, but I think it's a very practical way to think about this caeer.  If there's another career path where you can be happy,  than pursuing a physician-scientists career is NOT worth the opportunity cost as people have outlined on this thread.\n\nCould you be just as happy seeing patients?  if so, get a MD and don't do a PhD\n\nCould you be just as happy running clinical trials? If so, get a MD and don't get a PhD\n\nCould you be just as happy not seeing patients?  If so, dont' get a MD.\n\nFor me, this is what've always wanted since I first learned such a career exists.  However, there are serious challenges facing physician scientists these days (funding, lack of institutional support, family demands, etc) that you should be 100% sure that this is what you want before committing more than 8 years of your life just to get started on this path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncheers!",
