  "title:": "What is the perception of Universities and Guides about prospecting PhD candidate who have already quit a PhD?",
  "text": "So I have recently joined a PhD cource and I have to say, I'm absolutely happy with everything, especially my work but unfortunately my guide is an absolute asshat.\n\nHe is unprofessional, cheap, borderline discriminatory. No one has finished a PhD under him in less than 5 years, which I know isn't necessarily a bad thing. Whats bad is the reason they don't leave. He won't let them go. He wants more papers, so he slows down the PhD process side tracking PhDs and stuff like that.\n\nEveryone is an errand boy to him, doing his academic chores.\nHe has accused one of my colleagues of stealing \u20b960 (less than $1) because a good bill from a field work was corrected by hand (which is VERY common here). And this person is working since the last 6 months with so Salary/stipend and is spending a lot from their only pocket for the research work. \n\nSo I'm just 45-50 days in and I want to quit before I get stuck.\nAnd my University has a shitty rule: quit in the middle and pay back all the money recived from fellowship.  So sooner the better.\n\n\nBut will this look bad on me when I apply for another PhD elsewhere? Will this reflect as something negative on my part?\n\nOne could easily say \"he was too weak to handle this work environment\" and hide the reality.\n\nSo what are my chances at a good PhD (especially in Europe) if I heve previously quit a PhD?\n\n\nEdit: sorry for the rent, I'm just a little frustrated.",

The field ended up being completely different than was advertised, I wasn't getting the training I was meant to, and was generally really unhappy.\nI managed to find a lab job covering someone's maternity leave which tied me over whilst I was applying for other PhD positions (my field is biomedical sciences). I ended up getting two interviews and was successful with one, funnily enough at the same university I had previously left, but in a completely different group. \nFast forward 8 years I'm now a postdoc in the same university, having finished that PhD about 4 years ago.\n\nI chose to include the fact that I'd started a PhD and quit on my CV, it gave me a chance to own the story in my interviews. When asked about it I stated that it dawned on me that it wasn't right for me, and that I've been very careful about where I applied to and did the full research into the group and institute ahead of time (which you've gotta do!!). Don't feel you need to be as upfront as I was, but I would be prepared for an answer if you're asked about it.\n\nObviously, I'm not saying it's always going to work out 100% of the time, but I think the more important thing is filling any potential gaps in your CV with work or experiences which will help you in your prospective field. For me, this was the temporary job working in a lab for 6 months, it may be different for you. It's about showing how you pick yourself up from this and grow, rather than letting it define you.\n\nHope that helps a bit.",
