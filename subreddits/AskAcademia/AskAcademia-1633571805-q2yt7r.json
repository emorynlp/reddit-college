  "text": "Hi I am applying for PhD programs in the US primarily in Sociology but also looking at Political Science and Anthropology. A number of top programs have made the GRE optional but I took the GRE over the summer and got a subpar score 308. I am wondering a) whether I should submit my GRE scores b) retake the GRE. I have a decent GPA and couple of strong research projects under my belt but I am confused about the GRE\n\nAny advice would be highly appreciated",

Some schools have strict cutoffs, so obviously send for those that require it, but no reason to send something weaker when you don\u2019t have to. (I\u2019m a Soc PhD student.)",

If they require it, there\u2019s nothing you can do, really. Your list is very selective but a strong profile can overcome a lower GRE. You certainly make it above any hard cutoffs for schools that require the scores. (Hard cutoffs tend to be 150/150.) I wouldn\u2019t worry about it being prohibitive for UCLA and Berkeley, even though it will be below their averages. Penn and Princeton will be more difficult, especially Penn given the quant focus there last I checked. Make sure your writing sample is strong and they\u2019ll stop caring about verbal. I think your biggest problem would be if you\u2019re pitching yourself as a quant researcher here. If so, the quant score is a bit worrisome. But I assume given Berkeley that you\u2019re qualitative or mixed methods?",
