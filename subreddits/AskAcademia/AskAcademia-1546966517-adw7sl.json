  "title:": "Update: \"A PhD program posted the wrong deadline on their website. They won't consider my application after I missed the true deadline. Do I have options?\"",
  "text": "\\*\\*Update to previous post regarding a program that had posted the wrong PhD application deadline: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/a7d269/a\\_phd\\_program\\_posted\\_the\\_wrong\\_deadline\\_on\\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/a7d269/a_phd_program_posted_the_wrong_deadline_on_their/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing from you all and talking with a mentor, I ended up sending my application materials to the two faculty members I was applying to work with, explaining my situation, and asking for their help. It appeared to work at first--a professor responded sympathetically and said he would do what he could, as I must not have been the only applicant to miss the deadline. The head of the graduate college (who had been ignoring all emails until this point) then got in touch with me to apologize for being out of the country and that he would make a decision after the holidays. So, I was hopeful someone was working on my behalf behind the scenes.\n\nBut I got the final word a few days ago: the university says they have to treat the true deadline as final, and won't accept my application. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement, especially since this was my top program and applying to others without being considered at my top choice feels a little empty at this point. But I'm tired of fighting it. Hard not to feel completely turned off by academia after all this, too, so also considering applying to other jobs.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to thank everyone for their responses and advice. Here's to new things in the new year...!",

Because of the nature of my field at the time, reading research statements or talking with people directly were essential to figuring out someone's interests (recent publications were useless, and past work was hit-and-miss at best, to gauge current/future work). I came across a department that interested me but had a chronically out-of-date website \u2013\u2013\u00a0most recent research statements were \\~4 years old, some older, faculty who had since retired were still listed as active, etc. \n\nI emailed a few professors in my sub-field with whom I thought my interests would align, and I emailed a handful of administrative folks with the college and department about the website issues. And then I followed-up. And then followed-up again with the department administrator. \n\nOf the nearly 20 programs I contacted, this was the only place from which I couldn't get a reply. It was also the only place with a website in such a state of disrepair. While I had talked to one or more professors from a dozen other places over the phone, I could find no evidence that anyone was alive at this place. \n\nAt that point, I stepped back and asked \"does this seem like a place that I would want to be a student?\", and then I promptly crossed the program off my list.",

Without more details, it's hard to say who fucked up. And the Program might, legitimately, not be able to do anything about it. I never understood Franz Kafka until I did two things: got a visa in a foreign country and tried to change policies at the university level. Bureaucratic tape is everywhere.\n\nThat said, you might not want to go somewhere where the adminsitrative channels are so convoluted.
