  "text": "I'm 34 and I've got 8 first author papers out (out of the others with my name of it there are at least another 5 where I contributed also to writing quite a bit). Therefore I hoped that I learned to write decently enough. However, I know I'm not particularly good and, until I was in high school, I always had super-low marks in writing (4 or 5 out of 10, with 6 the passing vote).\n\nNow, I've been tasked to do a job (and to write a paper about it) that I don't believe much in. So I keep asking my colleague (same \"level\" but life scientist instead of physical scientist) what she and the PI would like to have written in the paper.\n\nToday, I asked this colleague if I could have feedback on my work. And... she basically told me (in a positive way, she was trying to help me not to criticize me) to rewrite it from scratch. \"Just copy the methods from the previous papers so that it finally follows a logical structure, and I'll take care about modifying the text to a publishable form\". \n\nI'm lost. After 10 years in doing this job I'm still not able to produce a \"decent\" paper.  WTF am I supposed to do?",

I know you're not a student, but it will still be helpful- even after teaching academic English for years, this book helped my writing as well!. Maybe get a tutor to go through the book with you.

But in the example I gave, I don't think that 1-3 citations for a fact like that would be excessive. Some journal's standards differ (they limit the # of citations) as well, and editors will tell you if you're just being silly with too many citations.\n\n> The fact that the top engineering journal for my field has an impact factor of 3 and \"average\" neuroscience one of 7 reflects different quality or different social standards? Are engineers less rigorous?\n\nI don't think its fair to say any field is less rigorous, but I imagine it might have to do with the type of research. Not a neuroscientist myself, but the \"high impact\" papers I've seen from neuro/developmental journals tend to integrate a lot of concepts and have a \"broader\" theme. So they're more likely to cite and be cited. My buddies in engineering tell me that they publish a lot more (like, for a bio PhD student 3 publications is considered good, but for an engineer, it might be more like 5-8) and their publications tend to answer 1 specific question. If my sense is right on this, it might just come down to differences in the scope/directedness of the literature in each field?",

However, scientific writing, as linear as it is, is still writing, which is why you might have this mental block of still not being good enough.\n\nYou're probably perceiving a difference in writing styles: they're a different kind of scientist, thus they were trained to read and write in a completely different way than you are; as a criticism of your own writing and thus you're upset, thinking that just like all the other times your writing didn't measure up, this is what is happening. Take everyone's advice, ask another math-related person to look at your writing and as this person for specific examples of how to improve your writing.

      "text": "Eh, your writing in this post isn't bad.  \n\nI'm of the opinion that many scientists think that only their way of writing is ok, and all other styles are bad.  This is why some PIs can't handle not \"editing\" (i.e. completely re-writing, rather than editing via comment) their students (including post-docs) writing.  \n\nI'm a research scientist, meaning not a PI, as it wasn't a route I felt like taking, yet I have quite a few years of experience beyond a postdoc and a few dozen papers under my belt.  My PI and I just write completely differently.  I personally think he is overly vague and repetitive, whereas he thinks I am overly terse and too complicated.  He edits my papers, I roll my eyes, make sure my thoughts are still in there, edit back sentences that I think he went overboard on, and call it a day.  It's writing.  \n\nThe only thing that irks me too much is when people are vague in results sections and also insert what I think are discussion sentences into the results.  I find sentences like \"When we added x to y, we saw z (p = 0.003), therefore y made z)\" very frustrating. A lonely p value without any description, especially when it's probably coming from some internal contrast after a complicated mixed-effects model, based on looking at the figure.  Then also the \"therefore,\" which is pure speculative discussion and doesn't belong in the results where it can taint a reader's ability to self-interpret.  \n\nThat said, even this is just style, and there are many journals where the results and the discussion are combined!  A very bad decision, in my opinion, but I guess it makes it easier to write and easier to convince readers of your viewpoint.\n\nSorry, I got off-topic.  It's probably style.  Don't imposter syndrome yourself.",

      "text": "That sounds really tough. I second the advice about getting another opinion from someone in your field, because there are massive stylistic differences between disciplines. \n\nThat said, all writing that is done with the purpose to inform needs to be based on a logical flow of information. A story. A framework that gets flushed out. I have two pieces of advice for how to learn and practice this. \n\nThe first is to make very broad and concise outlines for every section of your paper. For example, you open the document and start with \u201cINTRO: 1) we know X about this thing 2) but we don\u2019t know Z 3) this is a problem because.. 4) in this paper, we did P and Q to address the gap in knowledge and 4) this was the result. Then add the detail underneath each main point. Sometimes I surprise myself when I realize some piece of information makes more sense in a different location. Give yourself space to play with the order of ideas, then bake the structure into the \u201cbones\u201d of your paper. \n\nSecond, understanding how compelling stories are told will help you. Read fiction. This sounds like silly advice but I\u2019m 100% serious. Find a genre that works for you - murder mysteries, sci-fi, fantasy, romance, whatever it is. You will start to absorb structural elements of storytelling that will really help you understand how to fit ideas together. \n\nAny old coworker can fix your grammar the week before you submit.  But fixing the bones of a paper is a job most people are unwilling to do. So focus on learning how to do that part. \n\nYou can learn how to write better! Read more!",

I am not saying you should dismiss your colleague's feedback (after all, she did took her time reading your paper and providing said feedback) but there are some people whose perception of 'good' writing is very off the mark.\n\nWhen I was doing my undergrad, I had two modules with two professors who wrote like shit. I am not being arrogant or petty, but their writing was appalling (which did not help the fact that most of their papers severely lacked in terms of content). This was something widely known in the department and some of their colleagues even teased them about it. However, and despite all evidence of the contrary, they both thought that they were incredibly good at writing and always were severely harsh to those who did not write like them (students and colleagues alike). \n\nSo... get a second opinion. If people still have problems with your writing then I would suggest reading literature, mainly adventure novels and books aimed at divulging knowledge (history/physics/quantum physics). Both genres are known for being tailored to be understood by a wide sector of the population with no prior knowledge and thus they will help you create a template as to how to write in an accessible manner. The last group will be particularly useful for your academic papers as those works have to maintain a delicate balance between accessibility and academic/scientific rigour.",
