  "text": "For newly appointed assistant professors in the Humanities or Social Sciences, is it considered imperative to go for a grant I one's first year and if so what kind of grants should one be aiming for? Does anyone have experiences applying for grants in their first year of work and if so what was your process like?\n\nNote: this is Canadian and American university-specific",

      "text": "My institution offers small grants for stuff like professional development (especially in pedagogy), and depending on specific field you might need one to support your publishing (common for image rights in art history, for example), but I can't imagine what you'd need a large national grant for in my field. After tenure you might go for a fellowship at a museum or to be a visiting scholar at some other school, but that's about it.",
