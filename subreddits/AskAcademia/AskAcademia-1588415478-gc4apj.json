Up to now I've never submitted in a journal that claimed apc.\nShouldn't reviewers stop entertaining such journals?",

Many research funders now require their funded research to be published open-access (and often have apcs costed in their grants), and I have never heard of reviewers having issues with this.\n\nWhat many academics have issue with is the traditional model, where researchers provide their work to journals for free, reviewers do peer-review for free, but journals then charge readers/libraries a ridiculous amount to get access to these articles. A lot of academics now refuse to review for major publishers that use this business model.",

              "text": "No cost in editing? Excuse me? Who pays the editors and the people maintaining the journal website? Someone is just supposed to do these jobs for free or what? On top of everything else academics are already having to do? Teach, do research, publish it, peer review for journals and now you want them to - for free - be editors as well? How about you do it in your free time then? Most publishers ask to follow a template layout which is useful for peer review, sure but most people don't follow that guideline at all. The guideline is there bc people keep submitting utter rubbish formatting. On top of that, considerable reformatting has to happen before a paper gets published, even if you did submit it using the proper template.\n\nNow it is absolutely one thing to critizise the cost associated with journals, as well as paywalls and their stances on open access. There are many valid points to make for open science and they have been made from well balanced perspectives. But it is absolutely silly to suggest hosting and maintaing a quality journal has no costs or \"can't be that expensive\". Do it yourself then and show us how you maintain a high quality website, have decently fast responses from editors who have to sift through shitloads of nonsense and lack of guideline compliance etc.\n\nAgain, I totally get and support the open access movements but such an uncritical opinion HARMS the open access movement and gives off anti-science vibes. If you want open access AND high quality journals with fast respond time and strong peer review process, you NEED EDITORS. Even places like preprint servers have significant and I mean SIGNIFICANT costs going into maintenance and they have no editors. You are an academic, so educate yourself on a topic before you opine on it. There are ways around some of the costs I've mentioned but none that have had any widespread success or don't come with major drawbacks of their own.\n\nAlso, do not mistake this as me defending the specific costs of some journals or paywalls for that matter. I have my own views on all of these things which I have not touched on here. My point here is yelling at an uncritical strawmen version of reality will only ever hurt the credibility of your cause.",

But I think that if the cost of editing all these journals is spread over al Universities, the cost will be bearable for the University. In the past, many Uni0's had their own journals but over time sold the publications off to publishers. The publishers have to make a profit, a University does not (only cover costs). \n\nAnother about decentralised journals: keeping one journal online is easier than keeping 100s online via a dedicated platform. \n\nI think free peer review is not bad (have done it myself before you attack me on that) but academics should get a reasonable salary with enough time to take care of these duties. \n\non the $1500: some OA journals accept everything. Example: on RIO (research ideas and outcomes) you can upload your work in progress to be peer reviewed. Why can't I put it on Twitter (or reddit) and get a quicker discussion going on. We are here talking about OA publishing. Had somebody started this thread on RIO, I might not have read it, let alone reply to it.",

Your paper gets accessed either through university subscription (usually a bundle deal, up to millions of dollars) or individuals pay the 40$ for 48hr access. Now when you make things \"open access\" it means the university is not sending the publisher any money (subscription fee lost) and no one needs to pay the 40$ for access. You now have people who did the galleys, layout editing, maintaining your marketing, communication, billing, etc. who now cant be paid and need to be laid off. But you still need them. So journals have calculated how much money do they earn from one paper on average which should be able to sustain their system. That is the APC and your uni needs to pay it (never you as an individual) as the uni now doesnt pay subscription, the logic is that these funds will be allocated as \"Open access fund\"",

The value added of publishers is gatekeeping.\n\nHow else are you supposed to convey the impressiveness of your research if it's all self-published? It's not like people will actually read all your papers and contextualize it to form an opinion about you. No, they'll count the number of papers in what they deem to be high-prestige journals, and that's that.\n\nEDIT: And this is why we all deride \"predatory\" journals. They charge you top-dollar to give you what looks like, on surface, the same service that Nature gives you. Except, they publish anything that comes their way (they need to, since otherwise they wouldn't publish anything), so they fail in the one service we expect from the publisher: gatekeeping.",

It's fixed bandings because you work in the public sector. They effectively doing peer review on top of their usual work because they 'need' the same service from other researchers when they submit a manuscript. Everyone is ok with it (kind of), but don't think they get anything extra from doing it.",

Sadly though, quite often that part of the job and how much time it costs to do proper peer review is disregarded by head's of universities and people get little credit for it. I will also check in the future if peer review duties are mentioned on job offers for PostDocs/PI/Professors. At least for Germany, I dont really think thats the case. \n\nIdeally, no one should financially profit from peer review. It should be unbiased. (Particular) publishers have developed an excessive business model when you look at how much profit they are making. Leading to editors being forced/encouraged/ who knows into accepting sub-standard articles to get publication fees and increase profit. This is a big issue and maybe also initial cause of this thread ( that article fee number sounds oddly familiar).",

Before, publishers, yes, but also societies, make money from universities paying for journal access through huge library buys. I've posted about this before, but my Society runs on their journals, which on average made $10,000 per article due to libraries buying subscriptions, and charges $0 to publish. With open access, you're looking at charging authors $3,000 per article (losing the society $7,000, and crippling our grant-giving ability), and making $0 because there would be no subscription service. \n\nOpen Access is Open to those who can afford it.
