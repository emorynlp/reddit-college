  "text": "I am posting my first paper, and I heard that I need endorse to do so. However, it didn't let me do the endorsement and I can upload the paper directly. I have never submitted any paper to any other places either. Do I just get auto-endorsed by having an edu email? (This is the only reason I can think of)",
