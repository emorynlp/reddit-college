  "text": "// cue rant //\n\nI'm tired of being looked down on for wanting to be compensated for my work. It's happened to me multiple times, during Masters and PhD.  I'm in the last year of my PhD and have maybe two months of downtime while I wait for things to progress through review, and I'm ahead of schedule so my weeks are a bit more mellow moving forward. So I've been looking to pick up some side hustle to earn a bit of extra income and reached out to one of my committee members (not my main adviser) who I know is short staffed to see if he wanted some temporary help.\n\nWe met. I was pretty clear upfront that I was looking for a part time \\*job.\\* Conversation went something like, \"Oh, well if it's important to you to be paid then I guess we'll have to look into that. If you insist...\"\n\nWhat? Of course it's important to me to be paid. Do you work for free? This is clearly supplemental above and beyond my stipend-related responsibilities, and I'm under no obligation to work extra for you. Especially because this project is basically writing donor reports and has no meaningful scientific outputs to advance my career.\n\nI'm tired of this culture of self-punishment that romanticizes graduate students working 60+ hours weeks for barely livable wages, as if intellectual passion should be sufficient to make rent and put food on the table. Yes, being paid is important to me. It's by no means the only thing that's important to me, and I take pride in doing intellectually rigorous work, but come on.\n\nPhD stipends at my university are less than what is considered \"livable\" wage for my area. I've done things like defer dental care out of income concerns. I budget carefully to make ends meet. I would love to buy a house one day, but right now saving for a down payment is not feasible, and I'll be well into my thirties before home ownership is realistic. Am I supposed to feel grateful and indebted to the university to provide free labor, all because the basic stipend is a generous minimum wage for only 9 months a year? I'm so over being made to feel like I'm whoring myself out by asking to receive an income, especially by out of touch faculty and administrators who make 5-6 times my salary.\n\n// end rant //\n\nEspecially as many universities are contemplating or enacting budget cuts in response to COVID, I would really love if there was more recognition and dialogue around the fact that many (most?) graduate students are struggling financially.\n\nEdit: To the folks making comments to the effect of \"supply and demand.\" Yeah, I get how that works. I'm not a moron. I know I'm \"replaceable\" and will likely only be paid in this case because I have a valuable skill set and there is a shortage of incoming staff due to Covid. Just because it's true doesn't make it right. I'm in the US, and it's clear how we (don't) value education and worker rights. Should the cost of education be serious and lasting financial hardship? Maybe you think yes because it's \"my choice\" to pursue education. That's your prerogative. I disagree. Plenty of other countries have legislation to protect people when capitalism becomes exploitative.",

If I worked 20 hours a week I\u2019d be kicked out my PhD program within a month. We\u2019re paid $18,000 (USD) a year but required fees are $2,500 plus it\u2019s $500 to park on campus. Based on my pay it\u2019s about $2,300 a year in income taxes. So after taxes, fees and parking I\u2019m left with $13,100 to live off of for an entire year. It\u2019s not a livable income and I hate that nobody who has the power to change stipend amounts seems to care.",

          "text": "What makes me even angrier is that the same faculty saying, \"Well, you can find $10 for a six pack of beer\" or \"You manage to buy coffee, don't you?\" (as if that's at all comparable to rent, fees, etc.) will then compare your work and progress to people at MIT, Yale, or other top tier programs in the field.\n\nImho, it all comes from a place of privilege with the older faculty. They got their degree from _______ 25-50 years ago and $10k was just fine for them, so why can't you live off of $18k? And simultaneously they think it's justified to pay you lower because you didn't get into such programs.\n\nThat said, I think this is symptomatic of the larger culture in the US. Longer hours, lower benefits, harsher treatment, and cuts to grant funding have been the strategy ever since the boomers took over.",

Somehow a job that doesn't need years of technical training, education and daily grunt work (of a different kind) justifiably pays better? Not to mention that after the first few months or even a year's worth of training that a student receives, it isn't that straightforward to replace them as putting out an ad and getting someone in a few days or weeks.\n\nThe system is screwed up, simple as that. I don't know how much we as individuals can do short term to change that for the better..",

If I worked 20 hours a week I\u2019d be kicked out my PhD program within a month.\n\n\nThat's the norm. Was for me, was for most folks I've met in our field. You tell me how **I'm** \"entitled\" b/c I believe people should be paid what they're owed but schools who can throw millions at trendy \"initiatives\" or new complexes *aren't* entitled when they expect grads to literally work for free - b/c that's what working over 20hrs/wk on a 20hr contract is. Working for free. Everyone should feel entitled to be paid what their employer **agreed to pay in signed legal documents** - that's the basic thing grads are asking for.\n\n>You think you should be able to do whatever you feel like doing... and get paid lavishly by others for doing it.\n\nMhmm. That \"lavish\" dream of grads making above the poverty line & getting decent insurance. B/c that's what we're talking here; not \"TAs should be able to buy a house to raise a family,\" but \"would be nice to earn literally above the poverty line.\" I reckon it's pretty fair for anyone with 6+ years of education & training to feel \"entitled\" to that...

In my final two years, I took zero classes, taught the same load as a tenure-track faculty, developed new courses, and trained faculty members on technology tools.

      "text": "Excellent point that should be repeated all over again. The problem is that university research should be funded by the state because it's of public interest, but Western societies see everything as merchandises that should be monetized, owned and \"profitable\".\n\nOf course, some disciplines are easier to commercialize than others, but in social sciences and humanities this means that more and more research is underfunded and only available to those who can do it for free, because why should you get paid for something that's not profitable and that cannot be sold? \n\nSo we need to agree on this, because I'm sure many people will disagree with me and start spewing neoliberal dogmas. Once we as researchers agree on the need for adequate public funding for research, we need to fight for it. We need to stop normalizing exploitation, we need to go to society and show why research in all areas of knowledge has societal benefits and is actually not an expense but a very valuable investment. \n\nThis will be difficult because many researchers have internalized an individualist \"meritocratic\" logic in which they see themselves as the very best and other researchers as competitors that need to be beaten, so it will be very difficult for us to collaborate. \n\nLuckily thanks to the internet and the mass pirating of academic books access to knowledge is democratizing and there will be plenty of intelligent people who will learn outside of universities whereas academia will be more and more full of arrogant, ignorant people who draw their self worth from diplomas and titles. \n\nSo to sum it up: congrats for not being brainwashed, never let people make you work for free!",

      "text": "I absolutely sympathize. Unfortunately, this will likely never change until universities in the US are fundamentally restructured. There's far, far too much administrative bloat & far too many college graduates in fields without career paths (who then turn back to academia even if it's not their aptitude). It's *supply & demand*, sure (a lot of kids want to go into academia - to get paid to study what they love), but it's also an ***artificially controlled demand***; universities should be letting in far fewer grad student, only accept/train the best & brightest (but then they'd have to pay a fair wage).\n\nThe unfortunate reality is - and this is the real gut punch - research oriented academia was not made for the middle class (much less the working class or below). Outside of STEM+ fields & certain corporate-type masters, \"the Academy\" as we know it today was designed for the children of the elites. They could fund their own research, subsist on family stipends, & use the university as an intellectual community to contribute/receive information/perspectives. The current system still inherently implies that this is the circumstances of graduate students (& even lower-profs); clearly that's not the case but it will involve a **fundamental** restructuring  - including changes to gov't policy - for universities to finally catch up to the reality of the past century or so.\n\nEdit: Also! universities breech employment contracts like it's going out of style which is disgusting, would never be tolerated in any other field, & is something I addressed in another comment.",

      "text": "I agree with you (of course) in general....  but can I offer a counterpoint?   (it won't be popular, but I think it's important to recognize.) \n\nFirst, it's not *just* about supply-and-demand (overproduction of PhDs), and not *just* about exploitation, although both of these are certainly there. It's also about life choices. \n\nIt's that the *kind* of people who go into academia--and, I might add, into education in general--are the kind of people who are already *not* prioritizing money as the benchmark of their success and/or happiness.    It's the same with school teachers.  Why are elementary school teachers paid such shit wages, considering that their job (educating and taking care of the entire nation's *children*, for chrissakes) is the second most important job in the entire nation (after farming)??  So why are teachers paid such shit wages, why are they disrespected constantly (\"those who can't, teach\")?  \n\nBecause society can get away with it.  *Because* people who want to be teachers (or academics) don't do it for the money, don't do it for the social status.  They do it for personal reasons--because it is a fucking crucial job, and (unlike a hedge fund manager) it actually *means* something to be *good* at this job.  \n\nSomeone else in this thread talked about quitting academia to work for Goldman Sachs.  yeah.  Fuck that.  Those people do not have my values.  If you work for Goldman Sachs, you are (in my opinion) not only NOT offering anything useful to the world or to humanity, but worse, you are a leech on human society. \n\nI worked for the corporate world--for a decent company with good people.  But even though it wasn't Goldman Sachs, the fact is, it was a meaningless career:  I was selling shit to people who really didn't need more shit.  \n\nI went to grad school (a long time ago), and my income dropped by 75%.   \n\nI survived on starvation wages... indeed, I burned through my savings I'd had from my corporate job. \n\nAnd I was never happier.   \n\nSo, is it disgusting, unfair, flawed, and (to go stronger) even a social *evil* that our society (modern US, but also other places) exploits this reality, and pays grad students, teachers, and even most professors absurdly low (barely survivable) wages?   \n\nAbsolutely.   \n\nBut if we didn't have people like me, and like my kid's elementary school teacher, and countless others, then the world would be a festering shithole of real estate con artists and dot-com scam bubble-inflators.  We ARE the backbone of society, we are the future, we are... really, everything important about humanity.   everyone else is just a monkey pressing the 'consume' button.\n\nFor me, that actually counts for a fair amount.    I ain't rich, but I'm happy.  If I wanted to be rich, I'd have stayed in the corporate world... and despised every minute of it (and myself, for being there). \n\nJust my own $.02  (an hour's wage... :-)",

              "text": "actually, I think it's more complicated than just that it's \"women's work.\"  (though I do very much see where you are coming from!)   In much of European and even early American history, schoolteacher was a predominantly male profession.  It was mostly in the Western US in the late 19th c. where it first became \"female\" in the USA... and has remained \"female\" since.  Certainly, this does have a lot to do with how little respect the profession receives.  (In Europe, schoolteachers are now a female-dominated profession, but get a lot more respect from society... perhaps because it was once male-dominated?  hard to say.)  \n\nBut I don't think that's the root cause.  \n\nFor instance, academia/university professors was *exclusively* male until just a generation or two ago.  And yes, salaries have fallen since women came into the profession.  But they were never astronomical... no where near (as you say) doctors or lawyers, for instance. \n\nThere's an American-ignorance strand factoring in here, of course. American culture is the most anti-education culture of the industrialized world, despite our university system being one of the best.  The UK is on a similar course. \n\nDoctors are a special case:  there's a case of 'desperation' there.  When you are gravely ill (or even facing death), there is no amount of money you wouldn't pay to get better.  \nThat (more than the cost of med school) is one of the factors that drives their pay upwards.\n\nBut think of all of the OTHER professions that are paid far less than their education (plus talent) would seem to require: \n\nsocial worker.  concert violinist.  elder care.  environmental sciences.  disaster relief.  working for national parks or the Forest Service.  \n\nThese career paths require degrees, sometimes post-graduate degrees.  (I know people who have PhDs in Environmental Studies who have a tough time getting a job as a low-paying Park Service.) \n\nOne reason is that people *want* to pursue these careers.  They want to do these jobs, and are willing to do them for less pay... because these jobs are *meaningful.*\n\nBut there are other reasons, too, of course.   One is sharply political.  Just accepting a job that (for instance) protects children for abuse or protects the environment instead of maximizing one's earning potential by going to work in a brokerage is making a political statement... and thus, has become a *target* for all of those people who have a vested interest (financial or even just in terms of their identity) in a non-socially responsible institution.   For instance, everyone I know in a low-paying socially-minded career has someone--a parent, uncle, spouse, whatever--who has a career that makes lot of money, and voices *constant* criticism (and sometimes worse) about the socially-minded person's career choice.  I've seen this so many times it's not even a meme , it's a universal reality.  People who choose money as their guiding light are profoundly, fundamentally *threatened* by people who make a different choice. \n\nThis is one reason for the disrespect, especially in America, land built around ~~money-making~~ sorry \"opportunity\".   A great deal of the shit heaped on academics by (especially) right-wing politics has, I would argue, insecurity and even envy at its core. \n\nBut in the end,  you are right:  there is NO REASON why you shouldn't be able to love what you do, be highly trained and specialized, and get paid what you're worth.",

Staff making a wage below cost of living cannot survive and will not be happy in 99% of cases regardless of how passionate they were at the start or uninterested in money. Glorifying the starving struggle towards a noble goal while demeaning jobs that are better rewarded monetarily is a key way the institutions try to shame us into not daring to even hope for a better wage (\"what you want money? Aren't you doing this because you're passionate rather than for superficial reasons? How disappointing\"). This turns into the notion that only the poor starving PhD student is a real PhD student while neglecting the fact that A. Most PhD students that do well are successful precisely because they are not poor (due to preexisting privilege, accrued wages like you from a previous job or actual decent compensation) B. Forcing people to live in terrible conditions in the name of their passion almost systematically excludes huge numbers of very competent candidates that could contribute so much to society but can't because they are suffering from physical / mental issues or difficult circumstances and thus cannot afford to sacrifice themselves in the name of the greater good (or if they do, will do so with graver consequences). I'm fortunate to be a PhD student in France and my stipend is comfortably above minimum wage (while also being very far from what I'd earn in the private sector). Having a livable wage isn't necessarily and shouldn't be incompatible with doing a useful job and pursuing your passion. As another commenter mentioned doctors are payed decently despite also being a 'passion / higher motive' type profession. That is deeply rooted in supply and demand as well as historical bias against certain professions / areas of study. Summoning the 'higher calling' justification is just a way of excusing away unacceptable work conditions and, in my opinion, is not sufficient to justify defending the status quo.",

It's wrong wrong wrong. \n\nI shouldn't have had to rely on savings to help me get through grad school.

And don't get me started on how immoral the abuse of adjuncts is. \n\nI was just trying to explain one element of the \"whys\" of it...not to say that this is good, okay, or even acceptable.  \n\nKnowledge is power, as they say.  (or it can be.) \n\nI have talents and education.  I KNOW how far that can do far better (financially) in the corporate world, because I worked in the corporate world. \n\nWhen I went to grad school, I wasn't \"choosing\" to be poor... but I was choosing to do what I loved, and I need to recognize that ANY inability or unwillingness to 'walk away' from a job in a capitalist system is (to put it bluntly) a \"weakness\" that this capitalist system will use against me.  (and ruthless capitalism with plenty of cheerleading from certain political directions who have their own agenda.) \n\nI guess I see some power (and perhaps take some comfort) in recognizing the state of things bluntly/crassly, rather than aspirationally/how things \"should\" be?   Hard to say if that's a good thing or no.",

Obviously some solutions to this issue are pretty much out of our hands although we can work towards them (wide reform of higher education). I think people in academia should strive to protect their freedom to walk away though. This is unfortunately much harder in some fields than others, but as much as possible I think we should try to build up alternatives (in other workplaces, industries, countries etc). The skills and ability people have to do good and enjoy themselves in academia can be useful elsewhere and sometimes could even be of greater use in alternate paths. The dichotomy between public good + academia + passion on the one hand and private interest + industry + superficial motives isn't the be all and end all. If you believe that you are unable or unwilling walk away, they will use that against you. That is a good thing to see and recognise bluntly but then the next powerful step would be to figure out how to make walking away possible / acceptable to you.",

The graduate student union protested the wage for years. Eventually, they were able to double it. That doubling meant cutting all teaching assistant lines for nearly all departments in our college of arts and sciences, including some STEM fields. I'm still angry about it because now faculty can't even recruit students with a teaching assistantship, and the message is clear - get more grants. Really pisses me off [https://www.ubspectrum.com/article/2019/09/students-and-faculty-upset-about-recruitment-pause-in-college-of-arts-and-sciences-departments](https://www.ubspectrum.com/article/2019/09/students-and-faculty-upset-about-recruitment-pause-in-college-of-arts-and-sciences-departments)\n\nAs traditional universities move more towards a neoliberal way of operating, students who should be supported financially will be iced out of graduate studies more and more. It'll become the new unpaid internship, where only the privileged survive. \n\nI suppose if I were some terrible administrator I might make similar decisions. Why support and mentor new students into a field with fewer job prospects every year, when I can hire adjuncts who refuse to enter other areas of the workforce, for less? I guess I would let the graduate programs die a slow death, and then blame the professors later - well, if you got more grant money, this wouldn't have happened. If you published more and had more patents, this wouldn't have happened. Sorry but you just haven't had the enrollment for x number of years (but you wouldn't support our existence!). \n\nIt's worrisome to think where this is all headed.",

That's your job, and you receive an adequate salary for it and it's a permanent position. \n\nHonestly you sound like you never have experienced financial hardship. Furthermore you sound like you are in dire need of an humbling experience.",

While of course it is reasonable to expect to be paid for work, I also think the OPs expectations are a little off for exactly the reason you describe - stipends. Your stipend is paying for you to do something other than \"wait\" and work a second job. Mentoring undergrads, reading papers, performing experiments beyond the thesis work, giving a seminar talk, organizing events for the lab, all of these are things you can reasonably be expected to do, occasionally, without extra pay.",
