  "text": "I am applying to conferences for the first time in my academic career, and I am wondering a few things as I don't know the etiquette around proposals (I am really trying my best not to mess up this process even though I have no general idea what I am doing).\n\n1) If they have a word count, should you do your best to stick to that and not go above it? (If you go above will they automatically toss your proposal?)\n\n2) If they have an outline of what they want to see in your proposal, should you stick to only those statements in the outline?\n\n3)Do you have any tips, tricks, or general insight on what has worked for you when preparing a conference proposal that you could pass along?",

Very much so.\n\n>If they have an outline of what they want to see in your proposal, should you stick to only those statements in the outline?\n\nNot necessarily, but you should make absolutely sure you have everything the outline says you should have.",

      "text": "As the other commenter said, follow their guidelines and word count. Another is to be informative over using 'catchy' language. Now that I have some experience reviewing proposals, I can usually pick out junior academics based on their writing style. It's like they choose to be unique or punchy over the standard, formulaic format.",

      "text": "When I review conference proposals, I'm looking for them to reveal a basic understanding of the methodology of my field (i.e., asking the kind of question we ask), and for them to pose a question that can realistically be answered in 20-25 minutes. I read a number that pose much too big a question. I don't think I've ever read one whose question felt too narrow.",

      "text": "1. Yes, stick to the word count. Usually you submit an abstract/proposal online so it will automatically delete the additional words. \n\n2. Use the outline as a guide but feel free to discuss about other topics as well. The outline generally tends to serve as a starting point. \n\n3. Make sure your topic is relevant to the session you're applying to, have an introduction stating the relevance of your work (i.e, why people should come and listen to you),  and offer some key results/messages you will be sharing. \n\nGood luck!!",
