  "text": "I am applying to conferences for the first time in my academic career, and I am wondering a few things as I don't know the etiquette around proposals (I am really trying my best not to mess up this process even though I have no general idea what I am doing).\n\n1) If they have a word count, should you do your best to stick to that and not go above it? (If you go above will they automatically toss your proposal?)\n\n2) If they have an outline of what they want to see in your proposal, should you stick to only those statements in the outline?\n\n3)Do you have any tips, tricks, or general insight on what has worked for you when preparing a conference proposal that you could pass along?",

Very much so.\n\n>If they have an outline of what they want to see in your proposal, should you stick to only those statements in the outline?\n\nNot necessarily, but you should make absolutely sure you have everything the outline says you should have.",
