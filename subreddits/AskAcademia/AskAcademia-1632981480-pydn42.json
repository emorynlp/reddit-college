  "text": "Hi. So I am in my final year of a Masters program in Clinical Psychology. Infact, I have completed my four semesters and am a semester late, so to speak (which isn't that big an issue because most of my batch is in the same position, its sort of a norm now of our university) but I am finding it so hard to work on my thesis. I have been working on it for a year and have switched three topics so the one I have now just feels meh. I like the topic (its NOT my passion though, the one I liked had  feasibility issues) but I am struggling to develop a conceptual framework for it. I have been told to expect lots of questions so that has made me feel more stressed. I keep passing my deadlines without submitting anything. My supervisor is supportive but everytime we meet, she and I discuss possible deadlines and I just don't meet them because I think my study is going to be so boring and useless and I just procrastinate on reviewing the literature. There isn't a lot and since I can't find a theoretical framework to back it up, I just feel unmotivated to even attempt writing.\n\nIts too late now to start over with a new topic, I feel. Therapy is not an option. Any advice how I can get out of this mental state and just get a proposal out asap?",

Use phone apps to make sure you won't get distracted by anything else, if needed (like Forest) and give yourself timeframes e.g. write non-stop for 45, then take a 15 min break, then start again. \n\nI procrastinated a LOT to start my thesis, but once you get going everything becomes easier.",

Write anything; start with bullet points of your major thoughts that you can then flesh out, or just word vomit onto a page if that is more your style. You need to break through the dam that your anxiety has created.\n\nOnce you have something written down, even if it is trash, it is a starting point. If you need help from your supervisor, it is a lot easier for them to help you with targeted questions based upon something you've actually done than it is for them to help you with... nothing.\n\nThere are two sayings that I quite like: \n\n1) Perfect is the enemy of good. \n\n2) Write drunk, edit sober. \n\nI'm not saying take these entirely literally (certainly I'm not encouraging anyone to drink [if they don't want to/can't do so responsibly]), but both embody the point that stressing over creating something amazing from the outset can prevent you from creating anything at all. Jump in, get something done, and you can worry about making it better later on.",

There isn't a lot and since I can't find a theoretical framework to back it up, I just feel unmotivated to even attempt writing.\n\nBefore you just start writing, I think you should spend some time on your literature search/review. You say there's not a lot. So, schedule 5-6 hours per day and start reading. Give yourself breaks every hour and get up and wander around. Keep electronic notes as you read; I'd use bullet notes. But, as you take bullet notes on the content, you could write sentences at the bottom of the note area as if they were in your thesis.\n\nWhen you're done with your lit review, then continue with the \"write anything\" model. Copy/paste those sentences you took with your electronic notes onto the main document, rearrange them so they make sense and you'll have a chunk of your intro and part of your discussion already done.\n\nBy the way, it seems remarkable to me that your doing your MA in clinical psych and you say that, \"Therapy is not an option.\" I went to grad school in experimental psych and it seemed that most of the clinical students were bouncing in and out of therapy for various issues, extended procrastination being one of those things that I heard about pretty regularly. If it's not possible on your campus, perhaps privately or in a community mental health center would be possible.",

The responses here have helped me give some perspective so I am going to journal on my own. Self reflection helps.\n\nAnd thank you so much for your reply. It was very helpful. I have since downloaded some papers and organized them into folders. I am going to work on my literature review and try to write something just to get my thoughts out on a doc.",

              "text": "I just wanted to second that excellent advice. I realized relatively late in my education that what I thought was \"writer's block\" was actually \"thinker's block.\" I couldn't write because I didn't have anything to say. Whenever I have trouble writing now, I go back and read, read, read. Take copious notes, especially commentary about what you agree with/ disagree with. After you finish an article, write a summary of it describing specifically how it relates to your research topic. After you finish several articles on a topic, write a summary of the topic. If you do the summaries well enough, you can just copy and paste them into a first draft. \n\nThe other thing that really helps me is that I tend to freeze up when I try to write an \"academic paper.\" So for my first draft I always pretend I'm explaining the topic to one of  my colleagues. Someone smart with a general knowledge of the field, but without knowledge of my specific topic. Write in a casual tone, use personal pronouns, make jokes. When you're done, edit it into academic style. \n\nAnother thing that really helped me is that I don't try to be a good writer anymore; I try to be a good editor. Your first draft should be a flaming pile of crap, that's why it's your first draft. If you're sculpting a statue out of clay, your first goal is just to throw as much clay as possible into a pile. Once you've got a big enough pile, THEN you sculpt it down to look like what you want it to look like. The first goal is just to get the big pile of clay to work with. \n\nLastly, find a framework! If it doesn't fit perfectly, that's fine. I used to be really self-conscious when a framework didn't perfectly fit my topic, and I'd tried to gloss over it in my writing. Don't do that! \"Theoretical contributions\" are literally about identifying the shortcomings of a framework and proposing changes/ improvements. If something doesn't fit, note it, call it out. That's scientific progress. \n\nLearning to write is a life's work. Keep at it! It has never gotten easy for me, but it's gotten easier.",
