  "title:": "Imposter Syndrome in First Research Position",
  "text": "Just had my first research position over the summer (I\u2019m in undergrad) and it was extremely educational. My research is contributing to my advisor\u2019s next publication, and I feel an immense amount of pressure on the validity of my observations. My technique and data collection was solid, but I can\u2019t help but second guess all my data. What if I\u2019m completely wrong in my conclusions?",

      "text": "This is why peer review and a research community exists. If you got it wrong and it still passes peer review, some other researcher will be thrilled to prove you wrong. I'm on my second year of a PhD and have huge issues with imposter syndrome, but you have to trust that in the long run any mistakes will be corrected by others. The perfect study does not exist",
