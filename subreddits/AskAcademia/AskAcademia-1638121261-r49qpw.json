  "text": "Hi everybody!\n\nI am international student and graduated master research course in Aus. My profesor already contacted with me last week to suggest me scholarship in PHD. Although i did not have any publications but my WAM is quiet high (over 85). So the probability of having scholarship is high? And how long i get outcome of my scholarship after submitting EOI?",

      "text": "The exact requirements to get a scholarship as well as time line may depend on your uni and also who you're competing against, i.e. other PhD applicants. I'm an international student too and got one at Melbourne Uni. At the time, my paper wasn't published yet. I had very good grades (didn't study in Aus, but I heard it was equivalent to over 90% WAM). It's ok if you don't have any publications yet, I think it's more based on your grades. Re time line, I got my scholarship offer just before Christmas, but that was before COVID-19.",
