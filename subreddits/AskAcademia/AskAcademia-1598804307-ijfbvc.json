  "title:": "Should I withhold that I want to leave their lab in a year?",
  "text": "I want to apply for PhD programs this year for admission in Fall 2021.\n\nI just graduated and wanted to join a lab as an RA until I start my PhD - Which is September next year if I get in. When I revealed this to a professor who initially took an interest in hiring me, she it wouldn't make a lot of sense for her to go through the hiring and training for someone who would leave in a year. She is looking for someone who would stay at least for 2 years.\n\nMy parents are angry that I revealed this and lost the opportunity. However, I find it very sneaky to apply for a PhD without my employer's knowledge or support. I'm desperately looking for another opportunity and I'm not sure if I should hide this next time.\n\nFor context, I'm looking for positions ASAP not just for a source of income, but to demonstrate preparation for graduate school when I reach out to mentors or submit my application.\n\n**Edit:**  \n\n**I wasn't banking on getting a letter of rec from her in these few months, I already have two solid ones and one good one. I felt that showing that you're taking the effort to gain more research experience is better than introducing yourself as just a recent grad who's unemployed, especially in the introductory email to prospective mentors where you ask if they're taking students and to get a feel if you're a good fit for them.**\n\nWould appreciate any feedback, thanks in advance!",

      "text": "I think there\u2019s a kind of middling approach here. You don\u2019t want to miss out on RA job opportunities, but I also think that you shouldn\u2019t withhold from your potential employers that you plan to do a PhD. What I did at interviews when I was asked about future plans was went with a \u201cI definitely want to do a PhD in the future\u201d, which was sufficiently non specific for most. If they pressed, I\u2019d say that I hadn\u2019t decided when I was going to apply, but I definitely wanted to gain lab experience first and would apply to suitable positions as and when they came up. \n\nSomething to also bear in mind is your references. If you\u2019re in an RA position you want to get a decent reference from your supervisor. So if you know that someone\u2019s looking for an RA for 2 years+, think about how they\u2019ll react if you have the job for 6 months then ask for a reference. Most people I\u2019ve worked for have been super chill about this, and understand that being an RA is normally a stepping stone in your career - but not all supervisors are like that! \n\nGood luck!",

Admissions committees will look at your CV, see full time work experience in a lab, and then see that you don't have a recommendation from that lab and they will get concerned. I don't know how big a hindrance that would actually be, but it could potentially be the small negative that keeps you from getting an interview invite.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, why are you dead set on applying this cycle rather than taking a year? Following undergrad I worked for a full year and applied in my second year as an RA and I noticed a profound improvement in my abilities as a research due to that second year. Others I have talked to that have worked for a time after undergrad usually say the same.",

I hope this also answers your question about why another year is so unpalatable to me, given how staying in this country, is, in my experience, holding me back.",

If you\u2019re in an area where doing an RA position for multiple years is standard, consider whether it\u2019s worth working in a lab and then leaving after a year - would this leave a bad impression/make future collaborations harder? In my field being an RA for a year is pretty normal though, so I\u2019m not the best judge. \n\nI get that you want to show your commitment to your degree in your application, which is great, but given applications are soon there are many ways you could do it. Starting a blog/podcast - it\u2019s a bit cliche but scientific communication is a great skill! Independently researching new areas, working for a charity related to your field, volunteering etc. I don\u2019t know if any of these appeal to you, but I just wanted to point out that you can show that you\u2019re expanding your knowledge in multiple ways, and being an RA is only one of them.

My undergrad research advisor was a new professor and he was surprised that he had to figure out how to pay people enough to quit their restaurant, Target, and movie theater jobs or else they would have no time to make progress on any of the research. We were at a primarily undergrad institution, so he didn't have any grad students. And he literally couldn't pay one person enough for her to quit her job at Buffalo wild wings. When I was tutoring I saw many students who would have made great researchers, but they couldn't afford to quit their jobs. Unfortunately that also meant their chances of getting into grad school were much lower, and they didn't have internship experience to add to their resumes for industry.",

In the US (where I'm located), many (I hesitate to say *most,* but it very well could be) PhD students do not have a masters. It's commonly straight from undergrad, or undergrad followed by 2-3 years of being an RA somewhere. Masters and PhD programs are effectively presented as two separate paths, just with the caveat that getting a Masters would definitely strengthen a PhD application if it's something you might need (had a low GPA, etc.).\n\nEdit: Oh crap, this is apparently cross-post. I thought I was in a biology subreddit. This is just my experience for *biology in the US.* I don't know about other fields!",

Without the RA experience (and reference from my Supervisor) I doubt I would have even made it to interview. The application was all about framing the work I had already done in 3 months, and the new techniques I was learning, and what future work I would already have experience in by the time I joined the lab for my PhD 9 months down the line.\n\nThis isn't a novel route to get to a PhD either, at least not in the UK.  You can jump from a Bachelors degree straight to PhD in the UK, unlike a lot of places, and one year of RA work gives the same amount of practical lab experience, if not more, as a Masters degree.\n\nHaving said all that, I had finished my Bachelors project in the same lab that hired me as an RA, so I already knew my way around, knew the people, and my previous Supervisor recommended me personally such that my new Supervisor already knew I could be trusted.

I'm not on a graduate application review committee, but I imagine a lack of a letter of recommendation from your most recent boss doesn't look great, and this is just coming from a cynical point of view. Now let's look at other people's point of view. If you still haven't secured a job, you probably wouldn't be starting until September or even October realistically, so the lab has 9-10 months with you. At least 4-6 months of that time, you'll be a weight on someone's shoulders because you won't be completely competent, so you'll end up with 3-5 months of actual high productivity work for the lab. Not to mention, when do you break the news to everyone that you actually lied?  Relationships in academia are important, and burning an early bridge is stupid. I know a year sounds like a long time, but it really isn't, most labs are going to want you to wait to go until 2022. I was in the same boat as you when I decided to join a lab with a 2 year commitment before starting my PhD, but the extra experience was worth it. I'm far more competent than I would have been otherwise.",

Having said that, if an applicant to my PhD program told me they were offered a job at lab X but the offer was rescinded when they revealed thwir intentions to pursue a PhD the following year, Id take that as a sign of goodwill. Also, one year experience at a lab as a research assistant of some sort wouldn't surprise me too much.

But I promise you this: if you make it into a top notch PhD program, what you learn in your first year or two will (should) make your 12 month experience seem like a cute internship. Importantly, if you apply for top notch programs, you'll find the best scholars and researchers. They'll be your PI. They will likely have a very different understanding of \"substantial\" than you currently do. And again, I say this in my kindest tone, because I think that you seem genuinely interested, but as a professor in one of the programs you'd be looking at (if you were in my field) a one year (unfinished) role in a research lab wouldn't make you more interesting. Experience at an NGO, international service learning, attending a grad summer school in a topic, would make you more attractive.",

I think it all comes down to what you're ethically comfortable with.\n\nI got a job in research out of undergrad and they wanted a 2 yr commitment. I felt bound to honor that, so I applied in year 2. That didn't work out for me, mostly because I only could apply to three schools, and I had to move around that time to a new city for personal reasons, so I got another job that demanded a 2 yr commitment, and I waited again. Second time around worked.\n\nIt sucks, but you have to understand where they're coming from and I personally don't think it's worth making enemies over. Honestly, there's no rush. Providing the lab is working on something you're interested in, taking two years to work there can only make you a better candidate when you do apply.\n\nEDIT: Damn, there's a lot of entitled attitudes ITT. If a lab is willing to commit to training you and they ask for a two year commitment, because that's the timeline that makes their investment worth it for them, AND you agree to that timeline, you do owe them that time. There's nothing legally holding you to it; you could break it in self-interest, but it's kind of a dickish thing to do, especially if you were going into the arrangement know you weren't going to honor it.
