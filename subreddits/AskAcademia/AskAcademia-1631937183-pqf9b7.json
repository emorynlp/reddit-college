  "title:": "Thinking about switching departments for my PhD",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have been racking my brain about whether or not it would be worth pretty much starting my PhD over again- here's my situation.\n\nI graduated from undergrad in 2020 with degrees in Physics and Chemistry from a R1 university known for science.  I ended up deciding to stay here for my PhD and was accepted into the Chemical Engineering program.  For reasons that aren't relevant, I ended up leaving my previous advisor at the very last second before my departmental funding ran out and I needed to be put on a research grant.  I searched around in my department and related fields, but I was unable to find someone willing to take me on (I don't blame them).  \n\nJust when I was ready to give up and find myself a job, I received an email from a Physics professor who does work in the topic of my undergraduate research offering to take me on.  I swiftly accepted their offer, and things have been going well ever since.  The only concern I have been having is that it isn't Chemical Engineering.  At all.  \n\nThe ChemE people seem to be okay with what I am doing, but I have been considering taking my MS and starting over in the Physics department (I've been told I would more than likely be admitted since I already have funding, did pretty well, and know most of the faculty).  I'm pretty torn about this, but here's a pros and cons list of starting over.  I would greatly appreciate any input.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* I like Physics better than engineering.\n* the Physics department is more highly respected then the ChemE department of my school.  \n* My degree would better match my area of expertise.\n* I would get an additional Master's degree.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* It would take longer.  At least one year for classes, but I'm pretty sure it would be even more.\n* It would be harder.   They Physics department seems to have a lot more hurdles (which is why I think it will take >1 year longer).\n* My advisor wants to retire.  They were asked to do a project for a national lab, so they picked me up as a grad student and intend to retire after this is done.  There is another project on the horizon that would cause them to delay their retirement, but I would feel bad being the only reason.\n* I feel bad abandoning the ChemE department.  They have put a lot of money into me, and they seem to have a tough time finding qualified candidates.  My school is much better known for science than it is for engineering.\n* I would likely need to take a year off research for classes.\n\nI spoke to my advisor about this a while ago, and they pretty much said to do whatever I want and they will be supportive.  Recently, however, they have been mentioning \"getting quals out of the way\" so I can focus more on research.  I am currently taking one physics class and it has been taking up more of my time than I wanted, and I feel guilty adding more classes, thereby reducing the amount of time I can spend on the research I was hired to do.\n\nSorry for the essay, and thanks for reading!  Thanks x2 if you have any input to offer",

You like Physics better, so why do engineering if you don\u2019t like it as much? \n\n- don\u2019t feel bad for ANYBODY (whether that\u2019s your advisor or the ChemE department or anybody else for that matter) you are doing what is best for you\n\n- The additional masters degree could be a pro or a con in my opinion\u2026 sometimes hiring in the \u201creal world\u201d sees people with a bunch of degrees in different fields as more \u201cMasters of None\u201d \n\n- I think you need to speak to your advisor about this again. Seems like they are trying to get you to get your quals done because they figured you were staying. \n\nIn summary, do what you think is best for you. Weigh your options time wise, if you think you will be happier doing Physics, I would do it. The extra time won\u2019t matter as long as you are happy about it.",

      "text": "It doesn't really matter what your degree title is as much as your research. You will gain very little by switching to the physics program since it won't change your research. Just do the work with the physics advisor and then apply for the jobs you want. If you want to go into academia, you'll need a post doc anyways and your physics advisor should be able to help you find a relevant one.",

      "text": "No one cares about the name of the degree, just your publications. If your current department doesn't have a problem with you doing physics research instead, stay. I would only switch if there's some actual heard to it like you can't take a class that would give you relevant skills or something or the ChemE department wants you to adjust the research somehow to make it more ChemE.",
