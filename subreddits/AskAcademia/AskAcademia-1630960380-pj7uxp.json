  "text": "Here are a few things I need answering as a phd student. My lawyer sister says these are illegal in any civil court. :/\n\n1. Breach of contract. doesn't pay me even half of what is in the contract (ps, this includes industrial fund, scholarships earned all by the student, goes to profs account)\n2. Supervisor pays my husband nothing, he's in his 4th year, contract never got renewed after 3rd year and professor ignores any message regarding it.\n3. Refuses to pay for publications.\n4. No maternity leave, bjt highlights on his profile that he is one of the few professors who give a mat-leave.\n5. Holds no meetings. Ever.\n6. Pays 8 dollars per hour even when he does pay",

      "text": "I think you need to provide more detail about this. Besides the country you're in, what these points mean. Like \"refuses to pay for publications\", do you mean pay for conference travel, open access fees, or pay a reward when you publish? Is this the same supervisor for you and your husband? What did the supervisor(s) say when you asked them about the pay or discrepancies between their actions and what was written?",

When I asked him about it, ue why I wasnt being paid all that is in my contract, he said I wont understand and refused to explain further. U went ahead and contacted the department and university award bodies, they assured me that according to my contracts stacking is allowed.",
