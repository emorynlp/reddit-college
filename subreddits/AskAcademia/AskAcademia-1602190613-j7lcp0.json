  "title:": "Should I tell my professor that I saw postings of the exam questions on chegg?",
  "text": "I had a quantum mech exam today and I wasn't sure about my answers. So I googled the questions about twenty minutes afterwords to see if there were similar questions with answers around. Before you ask, I didn't participate, I work way too slow to spend time posting questions. So I saw at least three of the eight exam questions screenshotted and asked verbatim. I'm wondering if I should say something because I am fed up with people affecting the curve of the whole class, but it was 'open-book,' so maybe they thought it would be ok? Also, I don't know for certain if people asked the questions right afterwords, similar to me, and just got the answers quickly. Fairly sure since the professor is old he won't be investigating timestamps on internet posts (but you never know). I don't want to report people who haven't done anything wrong but it really sucks to see that the questions you mulled over were solicited. What do I do?",

      "text": "Yes, report. Posting questions, even if not using them, is against the honor code. This sort of thing is the absolute worst part of my job as a prof. Making a test takes days of work. And we reuse tests because that means we've vetted the questions before. It also takes away the ability to truly assess if students understood the material or not. I'm so so so sick of dealing with shit like this. And sadly, the majority of students don't see it as cheating, or at least not if it is \"just an assignment.\" Students hate if all their points come from tests, but make some low stakes assignments and students on this board readily admit it isn't really cheating to use Chegg or whatnot for them. Sorry for the rant, but this is infuriating as a prof. Please report.",

                  "text": "You must realize that there are cliques of students sharing infodumps of questions they create after taking tests. Once a question was on a test, it's out, whether it's on a public website or in a private document.\n\nBy re-using questions on multiple tests, and going after publicly available questions , you are making it very beneficial to be in an in-group, and making test extremely unfair for students just learning the material on their own. How can you compete with other students who have access to old test questions when you don't?\n\nThe only fair way is to publish all test questions a answers publicly after each test, and give this info to the students. Then write new questions every time.\n\nThis takes time and effort, but well: This is your job. It's what you are paid to do.\n\nFor my entire student life, this was a huge issue that otherwise intelligent professors just didn't understand. After EVERY test, students are going to sit down and write down all the questions they remember. After all, this is very valuable information. Then they distribute it somehow, in a way that is completely unregulated and benefits people who have the social capital required to get the info. This is not beneficial to education.",

                      "text": "So a few issues here- \n\n1) Think of the SAT, or another standardized test. They use the same questions over and over. Why? Because you have to test out new questions. When I write a new test, I will likely, despite extensively checking questions and having others do them, have to throw out some questions. Tests get honed in over the years. If I was making a new test every single time, they wouldn't be good tests. \n\n2) At least in terms of my tests, I write them in a manner that just knowing what the questions are, while wildly unethical, won't really help you. Chegg is another issue- where you can pay people (very quickly) to solve answers for you. If someone finds out my questions and studies them to figure out the answer- great, they learned the material! That is what I care about. \n\n3) I do a damn good job of teaching. My tests are not curved, so if a student truly knows the material (and can apply it), they'll do well. Their grade will not be hurt by others cheating. Those that cheat are just stealing grades, which really really sucks, but it doesn't stop those honest people from learning. \n\n4) There is a lot of misconception of what a professor is actually paid to do... Teaching is a very small part of what I am paid to do, and if I spent all my time truly trying to circumvent all the possible ways people might be getting an unfair advantage, I wouldn't have time to do the 75% of my job that is NOT teaching. I am also technically on a 9 month contract. My contract starts one week before classes start. So if we want to talk about me doing only what I'm paid to do, I would not be able to actually  make anything new semester to semester. \n\nIn every facet of life, people will always cheat in some manner. It sucks. It really does. So when you can report it, do. But no, I don't think people reporting answers on Chegg totally solve the problem, but until people get some integrity, nothing will.",

                      "text": "This is cheating. You're saying that you want to be able to compete with the students who form these cliques. Here's an idea: study the actual material, then perform well on the tests! I used to teach, and I grew so tired of students trying to game the system every which way, including entitled students who became upset that other students had questions from previous tests, etc. It's defeating the point of getting an education. Study the material on your own, put in the effort, and get a grade that you can be proud of. It feels good when you know that you worked hard and got a good result, and didn't need to rely on posted questions. You should have other resources available too, like office hours, to help with aspects of the course that you find particularly challenging. \n\nAnother thing. If you are only passing tests because you are cheating by accessing recycled questions, you are wasting thousands of your tuition dollars each semester because you are not going to remember anything you learned in your courses. You're just going to memorize the questions and answers, and trust me, that information fades very quickly from memory. It's a very shallow level of processing that doesn't engage your long-term memory. For better or worse, the act of having to wade through the mud of figuring out how ideas and concepts come together is what makes memories stick.\n\nIf your goal is just to get a rubber-stamped degree, then fine, do it the way you were describing. Good luck when you get to the first day of your job, post-college, and you find out that you don't know anything about what you're doing. So yeah, do what you want, but you're only screwing yourself in the end by obsessing over the fairness of getting access to posted questions. You are better off pretending that they don't exist. Let the other cheaters cheat, and they will get theirs in the long run.",

How I teach is going to be drastically different to how someone else teaches: even if we cover the same content, what my colleague and I tell our students is going to differ at least a bit. \n\n_That's exactly why writing tests is so hard._ \n\nYou can't just take questions from someone else and drop them into your test. You have to make sure that what you have is both accurate to what you taught and accurate to how you teach it, and you have to cover enough of a spectrum that your students can't just regurgitate stuff. I have one question in particular that I'm REALLY proud of in one of my exams because it's genuinely very fun and challenging without being excessively difficult. It's just very slightly above the curve of what I've taught, but every single building block is there to let those kids who've really applied themselves figure it out for themselves. If some punk-ass kid stole that and published it online, I'd lose my number one question for distinguishing between smart kids who nevertheless can't think outside of a rote learnt box, and ingenious little buggers who can think on the fly and truly understand the course material rather than just regurgitating information. \n\n_That's_ why we hate question-thieves. They aren't just stealing a good exam question. They're stealing our primary means of understanding what separates our students and who is more than just \"bright with good prospects\". I've had kids who do _abysmally_ on specific assignments and then come into these exams and do phenomenally on those kinds of questions. That tells me that this is probably a kid who's struggling with something at home: are they working too many hours and can't prioritise their coursework? Are they just resentful of something that takes 15 hours to complete? Are they struggling with undiagnosed ADHD or depression or similar? \n\nOn the other hand, if I have a kid who is _suspiciously_ good at assignments and then fail to repeat that performance in an exam? That tells me I need to take another once-over on the _rest_ of their work because something doesn't add up there and it's pretty likely they're buying their papers.",

Did you understand my point about in-groups and the unfair advantages they get from policies like yours?\n\n> \"I'm going to create a goddamn forum post in order to share as many stolen questions as I can so that future students can cheat.\"\n\nIn my education, it was WhatsApp and Facebook groups or other closed social media. Sometimes student organizations had folder of physical knowledge dumps you could browse. Heck, at ETH the student organization officially sold copies of old tests and transcriptions of students memories of tests. That was a good system, as at least everyone had access to these collections. Of course, friends of the people involved often had more complete and earlier access to the documents, so it was still terribly unfair to people not in that particular in-group.\n\nThen you had student groups that lived together sharing info like this, or groups of students coming from a similar foreign country that formed cliques and shared this kind of info and varying schools and universities.\n\nHeck, if you are just a year behind a friend, sibling or lover of yours, they can be your single source for all test material! How the hell do you expect to stop childhood best friends or a couple from sharing info about the contents of your test? It's completely impossible!\n\nYou HAVE to operate under the assumption that once a group of students took a test, the contents of the test will be shared with some students. The only fair way to handle the situation is to openly share it with ALL students. Anything else is morally wrong and incentivizes group membership rather than work ethic.\n\n> Ahahahahaha no that would be the worst possible way to do it because then you couldn't tailor anything to your own specific content or style of teaching. \n\nOf course you would have to create a pool of questions for your own individual class, you could not share these questions across classes on the same topic. \n\n> If some punk-ass kid stole that and published it online, I'd lose my number one question for distinguishing between smart kids who nevertheless can't think outside of a rote learnt box, and ingenious little buggers who can think on the fly and truly understand the course material rather than just regurgitating information.\n\nIt's your job to come up with questions like this, again and again for every test. It's also your job to provide example questions like this, most easily taken from previous exams, so students can practice on questions of the difficulty level that will be on the test. \n\nSurprising students on the test with a question that is harder than any they had available to them during preparations is not about enhancing education.

It makes me sick to think that I went through undergrad and grad school, put in the work to become smart, and go on to work in a biotech field... knowing that there were students next to me who were probably pulling your shit the whole time. \n\nNow, I have to work in a lab with lots of potentially dangerous chemicals and equipment. I shudder to think that there is (likely) someone who works alongside me who has no idea what the fuck they are doing because they did not retain any of the information they learned in school, and instead committed to a shallow level of processing recycled questions/answers just to temporarily get through a test with an acceptable grade. Because, this kind of employee is going to not understand how to make a proper reagent, is going to mix some shit together at a rate that would cause an explosion, or they are going to operate an unbalanced centrifuge and destroy sensitive equipment that I will then have to fix.\n\nSeriously, give this shit up. You think you're slick, but people like you are the reason that laboratory accidents happen. Or accidents in whatever other field you are in. And if it isn't enough motivation to not harm others through your stupidity, it should be motivating to know that you will quickly be found out for your stupidity and fired.\n\nAlong with sheer incompetency, these are usually the type and character of coworker who are constantly gaming things at work, because they get used to doing it in school. Maybe you manage not to get fired, but management will eventually come to know you as a \"game player\" and you will be the last on the list for raises and promotions as long as you work there. If you decide to switch jobs, you will have only lukewarm references from your coworkers, making it much more difficult to get jobs at other organizations. When contacted, they will say only enough about you to be polite, and the hiring manager will read between the lines and interpret that appropriately as \"Do not hire this asshole.\"\n\nAnyways, whoopsie me, I sometimes ramble on. Good luck with the dishonesty and entitlement and all that!",

I still think that was very unfair, which is why I am trying to explain this point here.\n\nIn fact, by writing new tests every time and sharing the results of the old tests, it will be harder for the students you describe to get a degree and work in your lab. The opposite: If it's harder to cheat and exams are more fair, the quality of people in your lab will go up!",

If you\u2019re already doing well in the class, I personally wouldn\u2019t report it, but if you\u2019re doing average then it makes sense to report it because it will benefit you.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that not everyone is an excellent student and that they are taking this class just to complete this degree. Many cases, such as myself, students excel in labs/industry but just don\u2019t have the time or care enough to do well in class. Especially when they are in the middle of a pandemic and every professor is assigning homework as if all students are home 24/7.",
