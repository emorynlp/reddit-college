  "title:": "Starting a PhD and cold feet",
  "text": "I have been working toward getting a PhD in Counselling Psych admit since my undergrad (2015, India). Finished my UG w/ honours, did my Masters at an Ivy League (UK), and have just accepted a fully funded PhD position at a virtually unknown university in the US, but under a *great* PI.\n\nI'm getting really cold feet about starting this degree. I feel like they accepted me to fill a diversity quota or because of a fancy MA degree, and not because they thought I was a good student. No idea if this is true or not, but I think my imposter syndrome is getting to me, and I'm now completely torn about whether to actually follow through on this degree or not. I'm also panicking about the change in the style of studying and grading, the lack of  university brand name, my severe anxiety and chronic fatigue (which I've had since I was 15), and generally flunking out.",

      "text": "I wonder how many doctoral level universities in the US are \"virtually unknown\" as opposed to perhaps being lower ranked. Particularly one with a great PI and that fully fund doctoral educations.\n\nIn any case, the APA Workforce Studies (https://www.apa.org/workforce) says that there's a less than 10% acceptance rate into counseling PhD programs. That single statistic suggests that you weren't accepted simply to fill a diversity quota. And the fact that you have a \"fancy MA degree\" suggests that you are, in fact, a good student. The place may well be getting a two-fer: a good student who also meets diversity concerns. But I'd be very surprised if diversity was the only reason you were offered a doctoral education with funding.\n\nIt's not really clear to me whether your issue is the university or the imposter syndrome that you suggest you have. If it's the first, then I think that looking at the overall ranking of the place and the outcomes of their doctoral graduates would be useful. If it's the second, you might consider that graduating with honors, doing your MA at a very good/great university and being offered a fully-funded position suggests that you are, in fact, pretty good at what you're do!",

      "text": "How exactly does having an MA from an Ivy League school not make you a great candidate? Your mindset is such that you've managed to turn a great achievement that demonstrates what a strong student you are into a negative against yourself. \nIn addition, lots of people love to claim that diversity hiring is a thing and yet programs aren't flooded with mediocre, black, Asian and minority ethnicities. Quite the opposite, they are woefully under-represented and are often the most talented individuals there because they've had to work twice as hard to get half as much. Universities aren't just giving away places based on the colour of people's skin and many unfortunately are doing exactly the opposite.\n\nI convinced myself that my PhD place at Oxbridge was a mistake and that one day I'd be found out and asked to leave. Never happened and I've gone on to have what I think looks like a fairly successful career. \n\nThe reality is you're on this program, you can grasp the opportunity and do your best or you can let what you imagine people are saying about you become what they really are saying about you. Don't talk yourself out of this and don't put words into other people's mouths and minds. You earned your spot. Maybe you'll fail, but you won't know if you don't give it a shot and you definitely will fail if you don't.",

Holding onto them as I try this degree!",

              "text": "There was never an ah-ha moment when I realised everything was fine, and I definitely still have moments where I think I can't do this, but you do slowly build confidence and there will be days where you realise you know stuff and can do stuff and you know more stuff and can do more stuff than other people. For me, I try to think of it as having no choice. This is my job and I have to just get on and do the best I can. I've never quite been able to phrase it right to other people but when I doubt myself and get in my head it's like it's implied that there's a choice about doing it and maybe if it went away I'd stop worrying. The moment I stop seeing something as optional and just see it as something I have to do, I stop worrying so much about whether I'll fail and instead I just focus on getting it done. I definitely do still get nervous but not nearly the same way. I don't know if this helps you, but my brain likes it!",

      "text": "I'm just finishing my first year of a psychology PhD. Imposter syndrome is so, so, so common in academic circles - I had a chat with my supervisor recently about it, how I felt like I didn't deserve the position, how I was sure I wasn't good enough.\n\nShe then told me that she sometimes feels the same. Bare in mind she's been in the field for over 20 years, with lots of published papers. She said she sometimes feels like \"who am I to be telling people these things?\"\n\nI can't tell you how not to feel this way, but I can reassure you that you're definitely not alone. You got where you are through hard work, and they don't give PhDs to just anyone.\n\nYou deserve it. You can do it.",
