  "text": "I have a wet lab of about 12 with one pregnant post doc (with a 18 mo old at home), and another with an infant. They would have to interact with the traveling post doc.  Additionally, there are lots of elderly faculty around where my lab is. I know the traveling post doc had a big experiment planned that probably will not occur now. I think it was a careless decision on her part to go and she did not ask me in advance, or I would have said that.  I have told all other lab members to inform me if they travel outside the state until this is over.",

If so, you didn't have a choice in the first place.\n\n> I think it was a careless decision on her part to go \n\nWere there any instructions given *beforehand* that you shouldn't travel to a certain place? If not, nobody can be blamed for not following instructions not given to them in the first place.\n\nIn general, nobody is required to tell their employer where they go on their free time, with very limited exceptions. (And if it was a work trip and you authorized it, then it's kind of obvious whose fault this is.)\n\nAlso, COVID-19 is not contagious without symptoms. Simply visiting a region with an ongoing epidemic does not mean that the person is a hazard.\n\n> I know the traveling post doc had a big experiment planned that probably will not occur now.\n\nAt this point, you'll have accept that the postdoc has a good excuse, and you can't blame them for not doing that experiment you're talking about. It's not her fault that she's not getting it done if her superior actively forbids here for doing it. You can't take it up in a performance review and blame her for it.\n\nDid you check what are the rules exactly on quarantine? Quarantine is not sick leave. Where I did my DSc, if you are officially quarantined because of a contagious disease, you're on full pay (100%), and the employer will be reimbursed. The rules for regular sick leave do not apply in this case.",
