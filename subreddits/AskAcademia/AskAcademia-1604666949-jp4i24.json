When I finish my PhD I'll be in my 30s, and I'll still be getting post-docs before I can really find a proper job. Meanwhile, it seems like most people my age are starting families, they have steady, high-paying jobs, and they're putting down roots. Me? I live in a studio apartment and I make just enough to live comfortably (without being able to contribute to savings for retirement or even a rainy day fund). I love what I work on (theoretical particle physics), and there's literally nowhere else in the world I could work on it other than academia, but sometimes I question if I shouldn't have just gotten a job in finance after I finished my bachelor's.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely not a disadvantage in terms of *finding* jobs after you graduate. It's very normal for people to be starting PhDs in their mid to late 20s. But it is worth considering if it's *right* for your life.",

                  "text": "So I upvoted this but disagree with your second paragraph - I would say a PhD is almost NEVER a smart career move from a time investment perspective, particularly in the US. Especially If you're motivated, quick to learn, geographically mobile and have interpersonal skills you can climb the career/salary ladder real quick.\n\nI would argue you should do a PhD in 3 cases - the jobs you want require a PhD (university professor, laboratory director, some psychology fields), you really want to do a PhD for the sake of doing research, or you're a non-US citizen who wants to have the opportunity to work in the US and can't otherwise get a work visa. Otherwise, I'd say that most US citizens who can get into a good PhD program can make way more money by spending the 4-6 years of a PhD investing in career, jumping companies, etc.\n\nFor example: I worked in manufacturing and supply chain for 5 years prior to PhD. For the 4-6 years of a PhD, assuming I made regular raises (not promotions) I am giving up, on average, $90k/year including benefits. I hated my job, but would have made a bunch of money. If I get an assistant professor job straight out of PhD, I'll basically be making what I did before, with $500k less earned. Thankfully my wife got an amazing job when we moved and vaulted wayyy over me in terms of my former earnings.",

So there's a tendency to think that we can't take a break between undergrad and graduate. But that's not true. \n\nSometimes you need the break. You need to experience being in the work force, or not having homework deadlines. That helps you figure out if academia is right for you, and also what subjects you're truly drawn to.",

So the only way to start a PhD before the age of say, 24, is if you start uni at 16. I\u2019d argue that if you complete your PhD at 30 years old or before, you are super young.",

Also, I talked about what I LEARNED from my military experience. Specifically, about how working for a larger mission along with my personal duties provided macro- and micro- perspectives which leads to success on different scales and levels. Lastly, I contacted the VA Office of the University I was applying to and asked about programs and resources for Vets. Got connected to scholarships, work-study programs, and networks of great people. Most importantly for me was articulating WHY I chose a future in academia and not the military, by explaining what I am/was passionate about and my research goals/interests which I could not pursue in the military. \n\nThose are broad strokes. Hope this helps. Feel free to DM if you want more specifics.",

I honestly think starting it later is better. 26 is fine, and even if you feel like you need to wait longer then that is ok too. \n  \nThe worst you would face is questions about what you did with your time before PhD, but that can be explained in any way you need to. You are very unlikely to be questioned about it though since all people really care about is your work ethic and publication record when you come out of the PhD.\n  \nAnecdotally, I think people are in a much better place developmentally for a PhD as you get older. The PhD is an exercise is resiliency, and so the more life experience you have and the further along you are in your personal development, the easier it is to learn and apply the tools you need to be successful.\n  \nI am not saying that younger people are at a disadvantage at all, I more just mean the priorities between younger and older students are very different and so require very different strategies.",

One thing to think about though is what impact it will have on your long term financial growth. Doing a PhD takes time, even longer if you have to do a postdoc afterward, and pay is usually not great. That\u2019s a lot of time of missed potential earnings and retirement savings you may have otherwise had if you stayed in the workforce. Not saying that should be a deal breaker- I just think it\u2019s an important consideration for making an informed decision that isn\u2019t brought up often enough. It depends on your own situation and life circumstances, but for many people it means prolonged renting, putting off buying a home or other large purchases (like buying a new car, getting engaged or married, going on nice vacations, or having expensive health procedures), delaying starting a family, or not being able to help support aging parents or other family members who need care, etc. This is not meant to discourage you- these are just the things I wish someone had told me before starting my PhD! It probably wouldn\u2019t have changed my decision, but it would have been nice to have thought that part through more before I committed the next 10 years of my life to a PhD and postdoc salary.",

They tend to mostly care about recent PhDs rather than age since age discrimination is illegal in the US. However, they do like people not to have established lives or families.\n\nThat said, companies that do this might *hypothetically* find themselves stuck delaying promised technologies year after year and getting overtaken by competition they used to have a massive technical lead over because of high turnover in engineering and terrible management.\n\nThis is an industry problem, but not every company is like this.

It might be a good idea to think about if you plan on having children during the PhD, as that's a common age for people. \n\nAnecdotally my gf was 26 when she started and it took her 5 years and 9 months to finish due to teaching, courses and maternity leave (her department gives  +3 months after coming back from parental leave to get your head around what the hell you were doing before). \n\nhowever i would assume that it depends on your country. If the vast majority has finished their PhD before an age of X, then being an outliner might be disadvantageous.\n\nLastly AFAIK on the engineering side it's not uncommon (and science as well, but I'm less sure) for a person to do a PhD at a company or in some way have ties to both academia and a company.

I worked as a pastry chef before realising I thirsted for more intellectual stimulation. I worry a lot about my age: how old will I be when or if I graduate from Masters or finish a PhD? In the end it doesn't really matter. The time will pass anyway. What matters is, I know that research what I enjoy, what makes my life meaningful, and that academia will validate my interests. In a way it's a very selfish pro or con list. The money and opportunity costs are definitely something to seriously consider as well. But try to think about seriously pursuing another career or route and see how that sits with you. For me it just doesn't.",

I graduated just before my 34th bday, and spent 8 months applying for Data Science jobs (perfectly timed to hit my stride about March 2020 and get ripped by COVID) and have been in a satisfying position for 6 weeks now that I\u2019m very happy with, earning double what I could (more like would) have hoped for by now with just a bachelors and I\u2019m fairly confident I\u2019ll be able to double that again in 5-8 years. \n\nDo a PhD because you want to and assess if you want to\u2014there\u2019s a lot of ways they\u2019re impractical, but in spite of a lot of things I\u2019d do different in my life, I\u2019d never not do my PhD. \n\nA fun thing to do if you care about financials is plot lifetime earnings (with guesses at yearly raises) starting at a few different time points and salary points. My exercise showed I\u2019d make up for and finally cross my BS trajectory about 6 years into working post PhD (12 years after BS), and I\u2019d cross the MS line (assuming 1-2 yrs Masters) about 12 yrs into my career. If it\u2019s money you\u2019re after, a Masters is economical and a good level up, plus in some fields includes all the class work of a PhD without the years of research slogging. If it\u2019s research you want to do, though, then try hard and do it, and I\u2019ll appreciate your contributions to the knowledge base of humans. The thing a lot of people who begin/finish PhDs don\u2019t recognize is one can make such contributions through other means, too, and the Academic path isn\u2019t the infallible aesthetic dream many make it out to be.\n\nDM if you want more convo (anyone)\u2014happy to chat.",
