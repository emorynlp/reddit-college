  "text": "I've been using [Meta.org](https://Meta.org) for a while to find new papers coming out for my topics of interest and I really loved it. Since it has been announced that Meta will be sunset (probably for facebook to have the domain), I have been looking for alternatives but haven't found anything as easy to use and functional. What do y'all use to find new stuff coming out? I typically check Meta every other morning to see if there's anything new for my keywords.",
