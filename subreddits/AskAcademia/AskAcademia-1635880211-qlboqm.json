  "title:": "Started a postdoc recently and quickly realizing academia long-term isn\u2019t for me (quitting?)",
  "text": "I defended my dissertation a few months ago, took some time off, and started my current postdoctoral position last month. At first I was very excited because I\u2019m at a very good institution in a great group and living in a fun city.\n\nAfter a month, I still love the people I work with and the city, but I\u2019m not in love with the academic life. Working long hours, being underpaid for my degree, and lack of financial security/constantly having to write grants at the faculty level just doesn\u2019t seem to be a life for me. I\u2019m already emotionally drained and losing excitement/passion for this work.\n\nPart of me knew these things before starting a postdoc and I feel extremely guilty about it, but I wanted to see what it was like outside of graduate school and give it a go. The lab has been very welcoming and have had to deal with a sequence of unfortunate events lately so I feel like I would be adding onto that. It was also such a good postdoc offer everyone was essentially saying I was stupid for considering no. I just don\u2019t want to keep stunting my professional, financial, and emotional growth.\n\nI\u2019ve started to explore jobs outside of academia and already have offers that pay much, much better and offer remote options. Part of me wants to stick out the first year (mainly to reduce the disappointment/betrayal) and see if I feel differently but I definitely am not happy or excited about continuing down this path. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? What would the protocol be for terminating the position if that is indeed what I end up doing? I\u2019m not trying to rush this and will give it a few more weeks and also explore other offers before making such a big decision. The toughest part is the guilt I feel for the group I\u2019m in and my family don\u2019t understand when I explain the academic struggle and end up saying I\u2019m a quitter.\n\nI appreciate any insight or thoughts.",

      "text": "Have an open, honest conversation with your supervisor. If they're decent, they'll encourage you to find a path that makes you happy and help you achieve those goals.  As to leaving- the minimum requirement is (generally) giving 2 weeks notice. Giving a longer timeline could be considerate (help them transition the project) but isn't required.Ignore the guilt. There's a growing push in academic circles to remove the antiquated stigma of 'quitting'. Leaving academia isn't failure or giving up- it's the norm. No need to justify it to anyone.",

      "text": "Postdocs leaving soon after joining a lab is more common than you think. I was on the postdoc board in a position that put me in touch with many of the new postdocs and saw it a LOT. People would come in and then realize the group was a bad fit, get homesick for their home country, realize that academia wasn't right for them, decide to start a family, etc. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with deciding that you want to take your career in a different direction after a month; you gave it an honest try and it's not what you want to do. And let's be real, after a month it's not like you're integral and irreplaceable to the group yet. I would advise that you not say anything until you're firm in your decision and know where you're going next. Be gracious with them for the opportunity, but also remember your time and expertise has value as well which you provided for presumably NIH minimum for several weeks.",
