  "text": "Hey academics! I'm currently researching a topic from my career and working on a separate project. That's how I came in the last few days to two old documentaries that are impossible to find on the internet. The only place these two archives are is in a video provider named Alexander Street. which is an academic library.   \n\n\nIt's my first time looking at that online library and frankly looks amazing. The problem is that my country's institutions don't have access to the content. Could anyone with access to that provider share these two archives with me? I'll be forever grateful to you. Thanks!",
