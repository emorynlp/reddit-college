If that appeals to you you should apply there.\n\nI apologize because I was being college rival sarcastic, just taking an unasked for potshot insult at LSU for fun. That didn\u2019t come across. I honestly have no opinion about the college as a place of work or scholarship,but I do think you should apply where you feel you would do well or learn or prosper. Sometimes academics like your professor can be stodgy or snobby. Take them with a grain of salt.... like maybe they have a reason and you can learn from it, or maybe they are just being snobby and therefore unhelpful.",
