  "text": "Hi everybody. I'm in the middle of writing my Masters dissertation (in International Relations) and I'm feeling pretty hopeless. Do you ever feel like your research is pointless? Or not worth the time you've given it? Are your expected outcomes obvious, or just not that important anymore? Feeling down. Need a pick me up. At the very least, it'd be nice to know I'm not alone.",

But it is absolutely normal to be frustrated, irritated, bored, exasperated, desperate, distracted, and not fulfilled at times during the dissertation engagement. Here\u2019s the thing: Keep your eyes on the prize. A dissertation is a tool to the next step in your career. \n\nAnother wise professor told me that \u201cthe dissertation should be the worst piece of research you ever do.\u201d This incensed me: I was putting all this misery and stress into something that was going to be terrible? Nope. What he meant was that hopefully, over time as a researcher, your research will get better and better and better, right? I mean everybody wants to do better on the next project than they did on the last project? You are not supposed to peak your career at your dissertation.\n\nThese two philosophical insights help me get through it. It\u2019s a business transaction. Finish it. Do a good job. Pass. Use it to get to the next step whether that\u2019s a post doc or a tenure-track position or a good job in industry or government. Then the dissertation has worked.",

Of course, it shouldn't be making you miserable all the time, in that case you might consider trying other things.

How am I to solve challenges in a technology that has been in the interest of researcher for decades? If you\u2019re exceptional, then maybe you\u2019ll get the attention of a few people. Sometimes you have to be lucky, I guess. But normally, master students are going through a learning process, and they don\u2019t have significant contributions. Research is new to us. We haven\u2019t experienced it before (at least myself). So, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to learn how to do research, so that in our next stages we can do better. I don\u2019t believe getting a degree should to be a goal for us. It should be an intermediate stage for whatever our actual goal it, and whatever that goal is for you is, you have acquired enough skills from your research to have more significant contributions to it.

Hopefully you\u2019ll come out feeling the same when it\u2019s all over and find yourself working on other research projects.\n\nYour dissertation has a concrete outcome and goal: graduation.

You can accomplish one goal and make a dent in another (i.e. doing cutting edge research) if you think of them separately.",

      "text": "Ultimately, does any of this have a point? Life, research or otherwise? Philosophers, zealots, and wanderers have contemplated the point of anything we do for centuries. Don\u2019t let it get to you too bad. \n\nPerhaps what would be best applicable is to shift your expectations/sense of gratification to something more self-centric. Do you enjoy what your are researching? That\u2019s a good start. Shift the focus from whether or not the research is worth it or not, and shift to gauging your happiness and ask \u201cdid I do the best I could today?\u201d\n\nIf you did. It do your best, why not? Was it something within your control? If yes, how can you work towards changing that? If not, why worry? Simply be happy with doing your best. It may not be *the* best, but it will be *your* best, and that is something to be proud of.",
