While that is not an excuse for cheating, the punishment should not include a punishment for not having enough life experience to deal with such a thing.\n\n\nI tell them what is going to happen, and that they should respond in a timely manner to all notifications and make time for the meetings.  This is very stressful and they are inclined to make things much worse for themselves by panicking and making even worse decisions.\n\nI try to impress on them, that how they behave now can either help to make the situation better, or worse, but it can't make it go away.\n\nI try to get them to see what choices they had, and while none of them were fun, none of them were as bad as this one.\n\nMy school , first offense is not expulsion, so I try to get them to see that they can take the class again and even have a successful academic career if they learn from what happened.\n\nI think there are repeat offenders and remorse-less mercenary shit bags, but some of them are desperate, short sighted, young , and getting bad advice from peers. Many have no real role models or any idea how to college.  \n\nWho of us as young people didn't do something in a moment of stress of utter stupidity that could have affected our lives if not for luck?  \n\nI can't imagine just socking this to a student and not telling them anything.\n\nIf I get some bull shit I may mention that this won't go well for them  depending on how much more help from me I think they deserve.\n\nEdit - after this I don't contact them about it anymore and direct all correspondence to the correct office.\n\nEdit - thanks for the gold.

      "text": "We warn them by policy: any student caught in a violation is required to meet with the professor, who writes up a formal statement of the \"charges\" and evidence. The professor, the student, and a witness (usually the department chair) sign a form that says they have all reviewed the charges. The student can either agree that yes. they did it, or they can appeal-- but they have to sign the form acknowledging the charges and the penalty, which can range from failing the assignment to failing the entire course. The form and evidence then go to the dean's office. If it happens twice in their college career they risk expulsion.\n\nAs a department chair I like the system because it 1) ensures the student does indeed know they have been caught and face consequences, and 2) eliminates any questions about the charges. Parents can't call and say \"My  Johnny would never cheat!\" and students can't claim \"I didn't know \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ was a violation!\" because it is all documented. I'd say 9/10 students almost immediately admit their wrongdoing when we meet to do the paperwork; the few that do not usually end their appeal when they meet with the dean, who will always back up the faculty/chair in academic dishonesty cases that are documented. Tears are not uncommon at this stage (from the students), though 4/5 of the accused tend to be male on our campus. Most of them claim they were too busy or overwhelmed, so took \"short cuts\" that resulted in plagiarism...in 20+ years at my current school my department has never had a case of cheating that \\*wasn't\\* some form of plagiarism (no exam cheats or anything like that).",

Large portions of  his paper were pulled directly from blog posts but never cited or paraphrased. This could be a result of inexperience with writing, though we held multiple full classroom meetings were those issues were discussed. The paper was also late.\n\nOn the final exam the student was witnessed using his phone to Google answers by a student. After I was notified by the student next to him, I personally witnessed it myself. After the exam I searched Google for key words related to each short answer. Many of his answers were correct, but used language we never used in class. Words that were never in the textbook or slides, and that I never spoke in lecture. The exact phrasing he used for multiple short answer questions were like that, and matched the summary descriptions of the first or second link when you Google the questions. \n\nI don't necessarily think he's a bad student or a bad person, but I do believe dishonesty of this type needs to be addressed. My main concern is whether or not the student should get a chance to defend themselves to me before I report. I want to give him the best chance to view this as a learning experience and correct some negative behaviors before they ruin his future.",

We had many, many foreign students who were dedicated and hard working and were excited about the opportunity to work on their English and earn a U.S. degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut we also had a not insignificant amount of foreign students who, judging from their English skills, likely hadn't been entirely honest in their applications or even taken their TOEFL exams themselves. They had cheated to get there, were totally unprepared, and probably could not have passed without cheating. (As for why they were admitted in such large numbers in the first place, this was at a state school that charged non-residents a higher tuition and I can only imagine how much the school was raking in by admitting  foreign students.). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTBH, usually no one would do anything when they caught some of these foreign students cheating, unless it was too egregious to pretend to ignore. When they did try to do something, however, the student would claim that if they were sent back to their home country, they would face abuse, or even torture from their families for dishonoring them and failing.  The faculty member would almost always back down at that point, worried about sending some kid to their death over cheating on a paper. I imagine the cheating still continues.",

The most common results of first time honor code violations at my University is apparently a required course in academic integrity. The student will also likely be assigned a course on avoiding plagiarism in academic writing and he will receive an F in my course. The worst case scenario is a transcript notation but that is honestly reserved for very severe violations. If this is a multiple offense situation then I'm not sure what the likely outcome is.",

These are tough classes that help determine who is able to handle a STEM career. That said, I'm not going to make the material easier to reduce the risk of cheating. It's my first cheating incident in seven years of teaching.

So, eventually, we have a system consisted of you and students. And you can affect the students' behavior only via changing your own behavior. There is just no other possibility because you are the main actor in the described system (discussable). More than that, you can't even be sure how many people were cheating because you were notified about the fact of cheating. Maybe the whole group was cheating - you never know. That's why I am interested in what lessons you have learnt. I can see at least two problems to think about - you haven't noticed the fact of cheating and someone decided to cheat. Though, it's perfectly normal not to solve those problems, since, you don't have to.",
