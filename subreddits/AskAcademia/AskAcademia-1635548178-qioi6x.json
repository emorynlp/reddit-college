  "title:": "Should I quit my postdoc?",
  "text": "It is difficult to write this post, but the short version is that I am seriously thinking of resigning my seemingly pointless postdoc position and doing contract work while applying for industry jobs. For the long version, see below.\n\nI was fortunate to do my PhD at one of the best (top 10) scientific institutes in the world, and my thesis largely focused on applying statistical models in an ecological field. I had the privilege and pleasure of working under some very competent, experienced, and knowledgeable scientific researchers. Over the course of my PhD, I published three papers that were done rigorously, and by the end of my PhD my mentors treated me as more than a student, but as a colleague. In retrospect, it was an amazing feeling to experience such scientific growth.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I moved to the US to start a 1-year postdoc position (with possibility of renewal). The project also applies statistical/machine learning models, but to a different system than what I had studied during my PhD. Initially, I focused on replicating and expanding on the results of a recently published paper that my two supervisors wrote with a postdoc (who has since moved on and I have never spoken to). I admit, I read this paper when applying for this position, and while I noticed some indications of potential problems in the methods, I felt they didn\u2019t sink the paper (side note: by actually replicating the results in this paper, I\u2019ve since learned that as a general rule, any paper with apparent issues like this means the paper probably has several more serious problems just below the surface).\n\nI spent about a month and a half processing some data, and then going about replicating the results of their paper. It was nothing special. During this time, I met the lab group and while they are nice and approachable people, I am basically out of place as someone new to the field and as a statistics/modelling person. Moreover, my main PI (PI1) readily admits not knowing much about statistics or modelling, while the secondary PI (PI2) is an active modeller and was probably the main support person for the postdoc on the paper. Anyways, after replicating their paper results quite easily, I suspected that the results might be too good to be true and thought carefully about how this might occur. After a day of coding, I applied a more robust test to their results (instead of the test they use in their paper) and found that their model clearly fails this test. To be clear, this test demonstrates that their model performs so badly that it seriously undermines key results in the paper.\n\nWhen I presented these findings to my new supervisors, PI1 did not outwardly oppose or support my results (which was fair). PI2 adamantly said I was wrong but did not provide any explanation as to why. Although I was reasonably confident about my test, I organized meetings with researchers at my new institute (outside the lab group) and previous collaborators of mine to show how I replicate the paper results and test how they fail. Nearly all of them have agreed that the test I devised is more reasonable and robust than the original authors\u2019 approach.\n\nHaving my own ideas for alternative methods that could work well for this type of data, I started developing an alternative model as a backup plan for my project. However, I\u2019ve received only lukewarm support from my supervisors for my ideas and received very little useful advice on how to proceed with their paper\u2019s methods (PI2 only recently had a complete change of mind, but hasn\u2019t admitted the flaw extends to their paper). Even in my project meetings with them, they often cannot correctly recall the methods they used in their own paper (because their previous postdoc clearly did most of the work!) and make incorrect claims about the capabilities of the type of model they used (because they applied a machine learning method with a shotgun strategy without really understanding how it works). The crazy part is that I\u2019ve received more useful and constructive feedback from my old colleagues and outside researchers than I do from meetings with my current supervisors/research group!\n\nMeanwhile, PI1 has assigned me to present a poster and a talk without really admitting that their paper (which was meant to be a springboard for my work) provides no basis for readily usable results. I\u2019m just expected to present \u201csomething\u201d. To maintain open communication I\u2019ve raised my concerns about a lack of positive results (after 3.5 months), but it seems like this is just pressure to deliver results. I\u2019ve been told that I should just throw variables into the model I\u2019m using, and \u201ccan\u2019t you just do a simple ANOVA or something\u201d. (As an aside, imagine speaking to a scientific audience in a new field with such flimsy results: they\u2019ll rip you apart!)\n\nI\u2019ve also been assigned by PI1 to mentor a student, which is a duty that I agreed to during the interview. At the time, I assumed that any student assigned to my supervision would be an undergraduate or maybe a master\u2019s student, someone who is somewhat familiar with research and could tangentially help my own work. Instead, I\u2019ve been assigned to supervise a junior high school student who is taking part in a regional high school science competition. Neither the student nor the competition has any affiliation with the university where I am employed. In fact, PI1 openly told me that they personally know and agreed with the student\u2019s father to make this arrangement, suggesting a possible conflict of interest for PI1. PI1 also suggested that I could add this \u201cmentorship\u201d to my CV, when its clearly a complete waste of my time as a doctoral researcher (I don\u2019t want to come off as arrogant, but why does a high school student need a postdoctoral researcher for a science project?). \n\nSo here I am, trying to squeeze blood out of a stone by (1) producing positive results based on a questionable paper with sloppy/invalid methods, (2) \u201cmentoring\u201d a kid for a high school competition, and (3) holding project meetings where I can\u2019t make any progress or get any meaningful help. I feel that my time and effort here is not respected, and my expertise is largely ignored.\n\nI\u2019ve also been living completely alone (in an old, noisy apartment) with no friends or family to talk to. My only refuge is spending the weekends outdoors (but winter is approaching), but I am otherwise completely isolated and often go for days without speaking to anyone. I feel like my mind is literally splintering under a crushing weight; I can\u2019t sleep at proper hours, I clench my jaw all the time, I can\u2019t relax, I drink more than I should, and I\u2019m probably gaining weight since I don\u2019t exercise as I should.\n\nI know that I\u2019m unhappy, and that leaving the postdoc won\u2019t fix that, but I am seriously thinking of resigning from my position. I would rather go back home to my family and take up some contract work while I search for a more serious position (in industry or government, I\u2019m done with academia), because my current position is simply a waste of my time. Has anyone here been in a similar position, and if so what did you do? Are there any special considerations I should make before/while leaving?\n\nMy rant is over, thank you to anyone who is listening. I hope you are all doing well.",

Something that does not concern the main focus of the lab (so you don't get to contradict them), but would be interesting as well for the team.\n\nSo in conferences you would be able to talk of your work saying that your role in the lab consists in carrying on a smaller side project; and you could present your own results without going against your PIs and the rest of the team.\n\nIf they are reasonable people, that might work?\n\nBeing far from home and alone when things are not ok is shit: if you can, please remember that your mental and physical health is way more important than your career (I've been there because of academic issues, too: I spent six months being totally unable to rest without nightmares and eat without throwing up. It took a while to recover. I swore to never let it happen again to me). I send you a big hug.",

For a nearly insulting  salary, a serious postdoc must publish (as much as possible), develop course material and teach, mentor junior researchers, write project proposals and grants, present/network at conferences, and many other duties. With COVID, many of these duties (e.g., networking) become even more difficult if not impossible to do effectively, which really hampers career progression. Most shockingly, the few faculty members I have met don't even have much sympathy for this new reality.\n\nDealing with all this is a hard pass from me.

However, go for it. There are really great careers out there.
