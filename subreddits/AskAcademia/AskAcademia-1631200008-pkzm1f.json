  "title:": "Which academic job offer should I take?",
  "text": "I\u2019m (26F) a fresh PhD graduate with 4 years of teaching experience (labs and tutorials), and I currently have two offers:\n\nFirst offer details:\n\n- Location: Same city I\u2019m currently in (Middle east)\n\n- University: Small, local institution\n\n- Position: Lab Engineer and Research Associate \n\n- Salary: $4100 + $1650 overload = $5750 monthly; tax-free salary\n\n- Workload: 60% Teaching Labs and Tutorials, 40% Research. There are very small classes in this university, so the teaching should not be overwhelming.\n\n- Advantages: my whole family is based in the same city, light workload, lower cost of living, very safe city. Also, the workload contains a research component, which is essential for a growing academic. I was also promised an Assistant Professor position once available.\n\n- Disadvantages: small university, the research component is considered as an overload; but I got a verbal guarantee that it will be there for 2 years. \n\nSecond offer details:\n\n- Location: Indianapolis, US\n\n- University: Well known and reputable university\n\n- Position: Lecturer\n\n- Salary: around $5000 after taxes (I used a take home pay calculator)\n\n- Workload: 100% Teaching, non tenure track, but they are not closing possibilities for research\n\n- Advantages: well known university, challenging, good for professional growth\n\n- Disadvantages: i have to move halfway across the world, far from family, no definite research component, higher costs of living as i will likely live alone. Also, the city i currently live in now is alot safer than Indy.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and help me decide! Thank you",

The classes you teach will probably have very large enrollments and be at the introductory level. You will not be earning a high salary. There is no guarantee that your contract will be renewed (\"lecturer\" in the USA usually means a one- or two-year contract). Your time in the USA in this job will not help you build the career that you are currently interested in.",

      "text": "Congratulations!  These both sound like great opportunities!\n\nI just wanted to offer the perspective of a full-time, non-tenure-track lecturer in the US.  My two cents after five years as a lecturer: I would take the job closer to home in a heartbeat. \n\nWhile nobody explicitly stops NTT (non-tenure-track) faculty from doing research, the work load is overwhelming.   We are frequently too overworked and underpaid to get much research done.  You can expect a very heavy teaching load, large and mostly intro-level classes, and a salary that just barely pays bills and rent. (Your salary offer sounds nice, but high cost of living and the housing crisis will offset this considerably).  My teaching load is so heavy, I barely have the time or energy to focus on my own research.  And frankly, if I did spend any quality time or energy on my research, I would be jeopardizing my job because I\u2019m on an annual contract (as you will be) and my teaching scores need to be excellent.  Many lecturers do make research progress, but it tends to be slower.  Overall, the NTT lecturer position will still tend to inhibit your research progress over the long term.\n\nLike many other lecturers, I originally took my position hoping that my NTT job would be a stepping stone to a TT job.  While that does occasionally happen, it\u2019s pretty rare, especially because it\u2019s so hard to keep a research program going while also spending 60-80 hours a week on teaching, office hours, lesson prep, grading, etc.  I do still really love teaching, but I wish I could do it under better conditions (like a higher salary, reasonable teaching load, and time for research).  \n\nI do know a few people who have eventually been able to land TT positions after working as lecturers, but many more of us end up remaining in the academic underclass.  It is VERY difficult to make that jump.  I suppose this partially depends on your field, but the issue is systemic. TT positions are increasingly rare, and universities are increasingly relying on NTT faculty members rather than creating TT jobs.  This is true in some fields more than others. \n\nFinally, it can be very lonely in academia if you don\u2019t have family nearby (I don\u2019t).  If I had a chance to take a job that supported both teaching and research AND was close to family and friends, I would take that one in a heartbeat.  I really miss my family.\n\nThis is just my perspective and experience though, and for full disclosure I\u2019m currently extremely burned out by teaching through the pandemic. It really depends on your career goals.  You and your advisor understand your situation and field better than I do, but I just wanted to offer my perspective. \n\nEdited for clarity",

The department won\u2019t give you attention, you won\u2019t have time for self-driven research, you will not have job security or stability, and you will be away from your support network. Other universities are very unlikely to consider a NTT lecturer for a tenure track position. \n\nResearch opportunities and a path to an assistant professorship at home seem like much better prospects!",

The fact that they selected me actually made me really consider it. But your comments on the teaching load and possibilities for getting a TT position really gave me a wider perspective. \n\nI\u2019ll be choosing the first option due to the research component, and the proximity to my family. I also grew up in this city, and I really love it in here. \n\nThanks again!",
