  "text": "Hi, \n\nI would like to share this looking for some advice. \n\nMost of my colleagues have published many more articles than I have and are involved in very high-level research. I have made some contributions with other colleagues, but they could be considered as minor. Also, In my case I have not published in more than a year and I feel that I am getting stuck in my academic career.  \n\nHave you been through the same thing?  \n\nHow have you handled it?\n\nThanks for your feedback.\n\n**Edit: Thanks to all to take your time to answer me. They only that I can do right now is checks where are my weak point and try to correct them.**",

Some labs are very collaborative where everyone is on everyone else's paper, making it easier for everyone to constantly publish. Some labs just aren't like that. I think it's very hard to compare your situation with others. \n\nIf you really feel stuck, ask yourself what exactly is it that you feel \"stuck\" about? The publications? Teaching experience? Number of techniques known? Number of students you mentor? Number of grants written? Number of conferences you have attended? And so on... and then I would try to make plans to resolve those feelings of inadequacy by actively hunting down or creating opportunities (if at all possible) to meet those needs. Find the training, analyze that data, make the graphs, write the paper, volunteer on that committee board, etc.",

I lived in fear that I wasn't good enough for ages until I finally accepted that, yeah, other people are smarter than me. They can grasp and utilize theory better. They publish more, and get more funding. So what? I'm still good enough and I have my own skills. I don't have to pretend to be the best because I'm not and that's ok! Reframing that kicked my imposter syndrome out and made me relax so much more, backwards as it may sound.",

You would be busy having fun and making progress.\n\n\"How have you handled it?\"\n\n* When I self-diagnose my inner motivations and review my feelings towards science and engineering then the achievements of my other colleagues stop mattering and I can keep focusing on myself.\u00a0",

Some days I feel really encouraged by some of the things I've done and projects I've worked on. Other days, I see people slated for talks at conferences on minor topics when I got rejected, and I start thinking \"How can I ever hope to get ahead when they've got MIT/Columbia/Prestigious Institution at their back and I don't?\" And I've seen other friends who were more talented, who didn't even go the postdoc route like I did.\n\nI think that's what I dislike most about academia, the non-stop uncertainly about careers and where you might end up. I think people imagine it will be like Star Trek or the military or something, and that success simply comes from competence, dedication and hard work, but over time it becomes clear that that's only half the story. This is not meant to disparage colleagues any coworkers, the vast majority of whom I think are quite talented.",
