  "title:": "Thoughts and suggestions about pursuing a PhD in social sciences in Germany",
  "text": "I have been actively applying for PhD\u2019s for over a year now yet got no luck. I graduated from an Ivy League university and I am often expected to hold third party funding for my research project. However, I am only qualified to get funding if I am already admitted to a PhD program\u2026 So I figured I could self fund my studies, is this realistic? If so, how can I explain this in a convicting way? Would proof of a blocked account suffice? \n\nAlso, what is a good way to go on about making applications to individual supervisors in Germany? They rarely reply to my emails, it is super frustrating!",

      "text": "I studied in Germany so I can answer that a bit.\n\nGerman professors rarely reply to cold emails. Most of the time, they prefer to work with students who have worked with them earlier or those that have been recommended to them by colleagues. They also prefer that the prospective applicant speak German to a little degree so they can help supervise their bachelor or master students. \n\nThe best way will be to contact the coordinator of the PhD program you're interested in, tell them you're coming in with your own funding and you need help with connecting with prospective supervisors.",
