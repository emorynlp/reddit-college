  "text": "I'm an undergrad and while I read a lot of articles when it's time for me to write papers and such, I don't read many articles as a way to learn more about a subject. At least, not successfully - I am not afraid to admit that I often struggle to understand what a research article is trying to say as a lot of them are way beyond my level of comprehension. How did you come to be knowledgable and 'up to date' about your subject of interest? Stumbling through articles until eventually you absorbed info through osmosis, reading review papers, talking to your mentors, etc. ",

While it is true that, as a researcher, you are primarily writing for fellow experts, you should not forget that they most likely read about your project for the first time. Therefore, you should make it pretty clear what you're doing, why, and what you found out.\n\nIt can also be observed at conferences that most researchers don't seem to care about their audience.

      "text": "The answer to this question depends on your field. \n\n\nI was already an expert in my very very niche specialization (the systematic biology of certain rare invertebrates) as an undergraduate. I was the expert because nobody else alive was working on these groups, and there was fairly little published on them. Ergo, after reading those papers, and generating new information with my research, I was the de facto expert. I wasn't the expert because I knew a ton of stuff, I was the expert because I knew literally everything that was known previous to me (because I read it all), and then added to what was known through empirical research. I'm now a PhD student, and my knowledge of that original system has broadened and deepened significantly since then, and there are now multiple other poorly understood topics in which I'm 'de facto' expert that I don't understand as deeply yet. \n\nThe point I'm making is this: the amount of knowledge that defines expertise in a field is highly discipline-specific, and there's no universal road to becoming an expert. In my very small field, if you've read all that's been published, and you're doing at least some empirical work, it's generally not unreasonable to call yourself an expert and to expect recognition as an expert on a subject. \n\n\nIn other fields, due to complexity or sheer scope of subject, the barrier to entry may be much higher. \n\nLikewise the level of knowledge constituting expertise can vary: in my field reading all of the literature on the subject is an expectation, but in a field such as, say, cancer biology, it would be unheard of for a single person to have read the entire body of literature. This is why review papers exist. \n\n**TL;DR: Expertise is highly field specific, and also depends on the scope of the subject at hand. There's no universal rules or shortcuts, but you can't go wrong by reading as much as you can, and talking with others in your field about what they think constitutes expertise.**\n",

Once you know that, you start to understand where the holes are in our understanding and you think of ways to start filling those in. You think of good questions, design experiments and carry them out, analyze the results.\n\nWhen you start to publish and present on your findings, you start to contribute to the body of knowledge as a scholar. And when you write about  your work, and otherwise present it, you need to show how your small findings in your narrow field are relevant to the wider field of study and how it fits in. To do this, you learn more about your subject to contextualize your findings. Soon, you are an build your knowledge base on the larger field as well. Do this a few times, then you become an expert in this field.\n\n\\---\n\nTo address the rest of your question, don't sweat it about the articles. Take it slow and look things up as you go along, write in the margins the things your looking up, too. Reading scientific articles is actually a skill to itself we all had to learn and it takes a while. But like most other skills, they become second nature. But it definitely takes practice. Scholarly articles are written in a very specific way that is different from other forms of expository writing, you need to learn that way to get it, but we all did it and so can you.",

I am no expert in my field or anything but I can say for sure that I have improved A LOT since graduating college. \n\nI feel like a lot of my improvement came from the fact that in grad school, almost everything you learn and talk about is research-driven. For example, in college you mostly learn \u2018facts\u2019 and memorize them, but then in grad school classes they teach you \u2018these are the facts, and this is how you prove it\u2019.  I was able to learn the methods and interpretation of basic biological concepts there.\n\nThen I joined my thesis lab where all that we talk about is our field. Everyday. Constantly. So I picked up terminology and stuff here and there over the months, read basic papers about the foundations of our projects, and now for my qualifying exam I know a little more about what sort of papers to look out for.  My professor actually asked me to do a small lecture on our topic to our peers in our institution in a couple months and I think I can at-least do that now! I definitely would not have been able to do that when I was an undergrad.\n\nI guess the point is, it literally just takes a lot of reading and talking and thinking and at some point some things click.",

Yes, at first you stumble over every word.  Then  you start recognizing words and names. Then you start linking ideas, and on it goes until you begin to have a sort of grasp of the subject.

For example \"study X showed you can lower cholesterol by exercising more\" turns out to be a study of rats.

If it's a lab technique, you can read a lot about the theory and practice, but you won't truly know it until you do it A LOT, and fail A LOT and troubleshoot and hopefully eventually succeed with some reasonable frequency.\n\nIf you're clueless about a certain research topic but you want to do a project about that topic, you can do weeks and weeks of literature review and studying, design your study and do it only to find out that what you did has been done before. So it goes. That's why you can't always get bogged down in the stuff you don't know. Just jump in the deep end. Eventually you'll learn enough to have a quality product on your hands. If not, then maybe you didn't do enough of the legwork upfront (familiarizing yourself with the literature) or maybe your adviser wasn't present enough for you. \n\nThe reason why I think advice is important is because some young people feel so ignorant about a subject it prevents them from taking the first steps, which are definitely the most important ones. Do not be afraid to do something because it feels beyond your reach or you feel like you're not an expert. Just trust the advice of those around you and try your best to not be mostly lost.",

You probably know this, but you can learn a lot by reading abstract, intro, headings, conclusion and bibliography alone. Reading the bibliography will often give you a sense of the kind of argumentation or techniques the author will use, as well as to help you work out where the paper sits  in the relevant academic milieu (how old the sources are, which schools of thought are being applied etc. etc. etc.).\n\nAfter reading these, you can then go back and kinda selectively read for what you actually need for your paper, or just read the whole paper if you're reading just to expand your knowledge. When reading that second time, it's vital to take notes: best is on a printed copy of the paper so you can underline, write in the margins etc., but handwritten on a piece of paper will work too. Write down the questions that come to you (what you don't understand especially), as well as the key points you take away. I like to do this after each paragraph, so I have some time to reflect on what I've read, then again at the end. As you go, see which of the questions you wrote were answered.\n\nThis same methodology can be used for entire books, and by looking at the bibliography and headers, you can avoid reading entire chapters that aren't relevant to your research, or at least, know to only skim them for key words to answer the questions that might have arisen for you.\n\nBut yeah, as many other commenters have said, the more you read, the easier it gets. And papers are often simply just difficult to get through, especially when the author's style doesn't work for the way you read (or they just suck at writing well). As you read more, you can begin to piece together all the random bits you've read in other papers/books/classes and start to get a wider idea for the information that's there, and more importantly, for the information that's not there.\n\n&#x200B;",

Go with genuine curiosity and high level questions that demonstrate you\u2019ve really thought about/care about the material. It helps if you wanna talk papers that they are in that specific field.",

One piece of advice we were told was that in the beginning we shouldn't focus too much on understanding every single minor detail, but rather understand the paper and its main result as a whole, and critically analyse it (e.g. where could they have improved their experiment? Where could they have explained better?). \n\nEventually reading papers becomes natural. As you learn more in whatever you study you'll find it much easier to understand papers as well.  It was an exponential learning curve for me, personally.",

I think it's a good way to promote developing active reading and other critical thinking skills. It's a good way to start small. I'd look for professors who use similar assignments. The basic goal is in line with SupSquark's post.\n\nIn my own path, I've found that I was able to critique in a much more sophisticated way by doing longer research projects. That started with longer undergrad research papers, but really happened substantially in grad school, especially during comprehensive exams and dissertation writing.",
