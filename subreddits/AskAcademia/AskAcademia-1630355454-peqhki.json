  "text": "Hi guys I\u2019m getting a PhD in data science and I\u2019ve considered taking only math classes.\n\nThe idea being that I think I am less likely to pick it up from applied experience. Also it changes more slowly so universities are more up to date with it than deep learning for example.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this a good/bad idea?",

As a programmer, I am struggling to produce an original research, because I cannot even understand most of the state-of-the-art approaches to improve upon them. I also don't think that deep learning as well as programming classes in general are that useful.\n\nHowever, I would also suggest spending considerable amount of time on improving the coding skills and learning various data science libraries, frameworks, etc. This is crucial for the industry and pretty useful in general, even if you prefer to pursue a career in academia.",

                      "text": "Assuming you will be using Python or at least have a choice to use it, becoming a good Python programmer would be the first thing. That requires two things: deep knowledge of the language and standard libraries, and a lot of practice. Since you have been coding a lot, you undoubtedly had many cases when you looked at a piece of code you had previously written and though of many ways to improve it. However, the more proficient you become, the less there is to improve. I would suggest regularly reading other people's code, preferably good one, standard library docs (great for learning features of the language), programming articles and etc. And, of course, you need a lot of practice. When you finish writing a piece of code, always take some time to think how it could be simplified. Always try to write a good code, or find ways to make it better.\n\nNext comes the usage of professional tools. For Python, you should familiarize yourself with either PyCharm or VSCode. Good knowledge of Git is also a must. Most students know the basics, but advanced features (branches, merging/rebasing, stashes, etc.) will help a lot. In addition, for data science / ML specifically, there is an entire discipline called MLOps, which deals with management of data and experiments, and there are many tools and libraries which would help you to do that. Research how this is done in the industry and try to imitate it. Of course, you won't need everything (such as maintaining models in production), but a good portion of it would be useful for research as well.\n\nAt some point, these skills would greatly simplify your work, reduce the time needed for doing experiments, the amount of mistakes you make, and make you much more competitive for positions in the industry.",
