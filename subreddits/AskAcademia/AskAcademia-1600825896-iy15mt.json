  "text": "Recently had a misunderstanding between my PI about publications, authorship, roles in the project were which lead to some conflict. Looking back, I see that we could have avoided those misunderstanding if we had talked about these things before we started the project and made those point crystal clear rather than talking about it in the middle.\n\nAnother etiquette that I learned about although I'm not completely sure. If someone else applies for the grant which is awarded and leaves, its polite to keep them updated about the project or invite them as a co-author on any potential papers or acknowledge them in the paper if they'd prefer that.",

If your agarose spills in the microwave, don't leave it for someone else to clean up.

Don't wait until things run out to speak up.   \nCommon sense stuff, but somehow overlooked. :)",

This was a constant issue with screentape for our bioanalyzer. I would get panicked texts about it approximately every other week, even though a- not cheap, so I wouldn\u2019t order it unless it was running low, and b- those expire pretty quickly!",

Even if I happened to notice that someone's reagents or consumables were low, I ignored it until the person(s) using it asked me to order some. I told them fine, but it will take a week or perhaps two. In the beginning, they freaked out because they need it TOMORROW AND WHAT SHOULD THEY DO NOW WHY DOES IT TAKE TIME GET A QUOTE AND TO GET APPROVAL FOR A QUOTE AND A PURCHASE ORDER AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT TAKES TIME TO GET HERE!!!??? I told them to beg for what they need from other labs, and next time let me know if you need something before you use the last of it. Not long after, I started receiving requests well in advance of things running out. \n\nYou'd think that adults work in labs.\n\nOrder your consumables before, and not when, they run out.

Even if I am in a first name basis personally, I don\u2019t bring that into meetings that are not lab meetings.  In meetings and when speaking about them in the third person, I usually revert to formal titles. It is ingrained from when I worked for clinical faculty in the hospital environment, patients or others could be within earshot and it is overall just more professional.  I think it\u2019s a little more casual with postdoc researchers, who mostly don\u2019t roll with wearing the \u201cDoctor\u201d title everyday in a medical school setting.",

That doesn't mean he isn't a valuable member of the team; keeping those tools running is absolutely critical to the many labs who use those tools. But, it alos doesn't make sense for him to be an author on every paper in the chemsitry department just because he runs most of the NMR samples.  \n\nNow, very often, he helps interpret that NMR spectra. He may give suggestions as to what happen when we get an unexpected result. At that point, authorship makes sense to me.

Very often this doesn't really require an intellectual contribution or analysis, they just need to send the data, but if I decided on that basis to refuse them authorship, they wouldn't be my collaborator anymore, and the measurement would not get done and our knowledge of the world would be (albeit probably marginally) poorer.\n\nOr for example many large  experimental facilities (synchotrons etc), make it a condition for use that the staff scientist who helps run your experiment is an author on any publications using the data. Granted they will often make significant contributions to data analysis and interpretation, but sometimes they will just help run the experiment and give you some data at the end.

Today I had multiple phone calls and emails flying back and forth telling me how bad the student is (student included in the emails) and I now find myself feeling sorry for the student. Yes, they made a mistake, but they admitted it and apologised and immediately started working on it. In my eyes, the story is now over. No need for all the dramatics and the insults.

My new boss wanted me to construct something, so I needed to buy some parts, so I made my shopping list of a couple dozen items, showed my boss, and gave a price estimate -- something like $5,000 -- and boss said OK.  My boss was out of the country so I just had a chat with the requisition department and showed them that email and got it all purchased, way under budget (say $3,000).  Turned out my boss was SUPER pissed that I bought all that stuff without having them sign a single purchasing form, whereas it was my understand that they had OK'd the purchase and just left it up to me to do it.\n\nSo, make sure you know when your boss wants to see/sign the purchasing forms :)",

In the end, contribution of the lesser known person is usually forgotten by the majority of the people (unless they have very closely related work). I know some journals used to ask these people to coauthor and produce one paper in these situations. I don't think that is a very good idea. Some journals publish these papers back to back. Of course, physical copies matter much less than it did 30+ years ago but still this is a better idea. Just require both sides to cite the other one and I am happy with that.",

If you present your research to others, assume that they don't know much about your topic, because most of them probably don't. I've been in too many scientific committee meetings where topics have to be approved for research, where the presenter blasts the committee with too much specialised information, acronyms, obscure methods or techniques, etc. Maybe one or two people will know what you're talking about, but the rest won't. Of course, they won't admit that and they'll pick on specific things that they recognise. I follow this rule of thumb: if my wife can understand what I'm trying to say, it's a good presentation (She's not dumb by the way - she's also a scientist but in a different field).\n\nI once sat in a Physiology PhD research presentation like that. So many details and technical jargon and statistics. People asked questions that seemed intelligent. Then the oldest and wisest professor leaned forward and said \"Hm... I'm sorry, interesting work but... Where is the physiology?\"\n\nBecause the presenter had buried the audience in alphabet soup, everyone except him had completely missed the fact that the study did not, in fact, contain a single bit of the subject at hand.",

The argument you\u2019re making is: assuming there is no effect in the population, it is unlikely that we would observe a difference as great as we did as compared to 0.

Assuming a standard test of equality (so not non-inferiority, superiority or equivalence), your H_0 is already that the effect is 0 in the population, so the probability of that assuming H_0 is true is 1.\n\nYou obviously do know the correct interpretation in your second paragraph, but the way you wrote it down is just as wrong as the Bayesian interpretation you are complaining about.",

          "text": "I completely disagree with this. Having a relaxed and inviting relationship between senior grad students with junior grad students/undergrads is very important. Asking somebody to run an experiment with only input from their PI is a terrible idea, people need help from those who work in the lab everyday and have direct experience with similar assays is very important. When you are new to the lab you need help and when you have been there for longer you pay it back, not having that sounds like a horrible lab environment.\n\nThis attitude where you either feel superior to those with less experience or a very selfish attitude to work and time would not work in my lab, no matter how good of a scientist you are my PI would tell you to leave. In my lab every PhD student has at least one undergrad they directly supervise and a junior grad student that works on a similar topic that they don\u2019t directly supervise but are expected to help out when they have questions.\n\nEdit: I understand there are cultural differences so I am a 4th year PhD student at an R1 university in the US.",
