      "text": "It differs hugely. Not only between institutions and disciplines but between different groups as well. I am primary for some, and co-supervisor for some. In one context we pretty much do everything equally as a team. In another, the co-supervisor is basically a stand-in, if the primary dies or moves, to ensure that the PhD student doesn't get stuck because of it.\n\nYou need to have a conversation about this with all of them so that everyone is synched regarding expectations.\n\nIt is also a matter of resources. Our primary supervisors get twice as much time allocated as the co-supervisor. PhD students are rarely aware of that side of things, and it might not only be a matter of personal preferences. (In some places, where they do the \"stand by\" version, the co-supervisors aren't paid at all until they potentially have to step in as primary.)",

      "text": "At my uni, co-supervision is supposedly meant to be completely balanced so you have \u201cfreedom\u201d with who to work with. Obviously meant to be based on what makes the most sense for your project but if you have real issues with one of the supervisors then it would be fair to more or less only work with the other. Only time I had to make a distinction is where to get my PhD awarded from as my supervisors are from different faculties.",

Often, the PIs are only co-supervisors because they are not professors and the supervisors know nothing about our projects. We use their name because our PIs need someone with the title for administration.\n\nI think the term \"daily supervisor\" has more uniform meaning than supervisor and co-supervisor. Perhaps you can ask if X is your daily supervisor.",
