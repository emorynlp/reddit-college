  "text": "I see this particularly in STEM researchers; it's a thing for you apparently. I'm a spouse working in the private sector. We, along with your children, get a bit tired of not seeing you much. And I cannot understand how the hell you put up with the very long hours, horrible pay, medieval managers which you call PIs, incredible amount of stress every few years looking for funding, and one of the most ferocious competitive contexts that exist. \nSorry about the rant, but it's dinner time, and my spouse is running some cells through some machine or whatnot in the lab.\nSo, closing the circle repeating myself, kiss them fondly and thank them profusely!\nCheers.",

The role will always be over-worked, underpaid and underappreciated unless you land some senior chair somewhere in an institution that has somehow kept itself in the 90's.\n\nMost academics I work with manage a healthy life balance by saying no to things. Unless I have something unusual and time critical (e.g. a big grant deadline) my work hours stay strictly between 8 am and 6 pm. I don't work at weekends. If I haven't got time for something I say no. \n\nDoes that mean I am less research productive than I could be? Absolutely. But the end of that logic chain is that you choose to prioritise your research or your work-life balance. It is a choice. It's perfectly possible to have a successful research career *without* optimising every hour for research rather than family/free time. \n\nYou have to draw your own boundaries; no one else will do it for you, and everyone will expect more of your time than you have to give.",

If you can secure a position as a permanent researcher, earning three to five times minimum wage puts you up there in those 5%.

There's a push now, at least in some countries, to get at least 10% of an institution researchers to be permanent staff. It's... Incredible.

Those permanent staff positions: lab manager, lab assistants, seniors gets some slacks. \n\nAnnual leave, they'd take it. 9 to 5 work hours, it's regular. Project not working? It's not their problems. As long as NaCl is where it's supposed to be, lab manager job is secure. As long as one has some data to shore up in the lab meeting, seniors are secure. They have no path forward and \\*no motivation\\* to make the project work and publish. As long as they have some decent data and small project in hand, they are secure. \n\nFor PhD and those TT aiming postdocs are in hell. If the project is not working, it's their career to be ruined. It's their dreams to be destroyed. PI damn well knows this situation and takes advantage of grad and postdoc labor to shore up their permanent staff position. \n\nThose very positions are the one that pops up everytime there's a discussion on creating jobs for PhDs and postdocs. Once those positions are filled up, scientists lose motivations. They only care about the weekly lab meeting reports. They don't care if the project is working or funding is secure. That's the PI problem. That drives the PI to pressure on those lowly waged grad students to gather more data and publications. \n\nThe entire scientific process is broken.",
