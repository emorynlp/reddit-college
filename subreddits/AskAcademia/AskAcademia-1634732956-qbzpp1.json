There's so many subtle things that happen when anyone takes extended leave but the general attitude is \"well if we extend the promotion window, that's all cool\". But that leaves women constantly chasing a gender pay gap, and doesn't address any of the issues like maintaining a lab while you're on leave, grant management, restarting paused work, the discrimination women face for being pregnant or going on leave, and so much more. Thing is making these things better is better for men too. \n\nWhen the Chemistry Dept at the University of York made a policy that when anyone went part time they would be able to return to a full time post if they chose (or something along those lines) suddenly a load of men requested to go part time seemingly to allow them to deal with personal life stuff knowing they could return to full time. How good is that for everyone? The benefits are enormous.",

You just can't imagine a world where we don't penalise people for having children. I can imagine a world where men and women take equal responsibility for children and where taking leave doesn't penalise them. And there's no reason why someone not being penalised for taking leave must translate into penalising those who don't take leave. That sounds much more like grumbling that some people got something you didn't while ignoring the fact that you've lost nothing by them having equality.",

Equality isn't a zero sum game. Parents having different rules to ensure they aren't disadvantaged does not equate to non-parents being disadvantaged, except if you believe parents should be penalised and non-parents rewarded for not having kids. Non-parents already benefit because their pensions are largely dependent on the children of their colleagues working and paying into state and private pension schemes.",

One PI was talking about hiring, and full-on said that he doesn't hire married women as postdocs anymore because they get pregnant and aren't as productive. This wasn't a massively old guy - about 41-42 when he said this. The guy to his right chimes in and says he doesn't hire women, at all, for postdocs because if they aren't married or pregnant, they're looking to be so and will spend all their time going out, looking for a husband. This person was in his mid 40s. \n\nThey felt fine saying this in front of students!  It was myself and three other students. What did I, a young woman, take from this? That the deck is stacked, no matter what I do. If I have kids, I'm a liability. If I don't, I'm trawling for seed and a liability. So I should do what I want and if someone gives me heat about kids in an interview, take that warning as a gift. A female friend of mine cites this as a pivotal conversation for her to leave academia because she realized that no matter what she does, she's screwed.\n\nThe male student at the table just laughed. \n\nIt's very hard to persist in an environment where you know there's a target on your back. Where you know you'll have to be twice as good, and you still might wash out for reasons that have nothing to do with your work.",

This is what happened to me as a grad student.  My best work actually followed the birth of my son.   \n\n\nThe best case is the person, especially the woman, who is already a parent.  If she managed to be where she is while raising a kid, then it  says a lot about her grit.  She's also likely already have a good dose of pragmatist reasoning and sense of time management, and again, the survival stakes are higher for her because she needs to consider her kid's needs...   if she gets pregnant again,  the transition to two children won't be as shocking as the initial shift to parenthood as well.    \n\n\nPIs need people with a good sense of conscientiousness, maturity, and responsibility, and few people have these qualities like ambitious moms do, so I think the pragmatic calculus of a lot of the older (mostly male) academics is actually mistaken.",

          "text": "I'm one of those STEM women who left academia... the biggest reason for me was the crappy job market and the crappy pay for what would have been a postdoc track had I stayed.  Parental leave was less an issue given my field.  I'm now making six figures in industry with a much better leave policy than I had as a grad student mom and flexibility to work from home once the leave is over.    \n\n\nHaving said that, I think one of the best things that can help women take their leave but then be able to work in a way that doesn't set them back is to enable a culture where people (not just women btw) can simply have their babies at work with them.   The issue I would have with simply expanding parental leave to dads or funding for child care (both which I support) is that many of us probably are instinctively hesitant to be separated from our babies at so early a time.  My first kid was high needs and not the best sleeper, and the only thing that worked was attachment style parenting + an exclusive breastfeeding route, which has all sorts of additional benefits, but resulted in me having to spend a lot of time with him by me.  At that time, neither dad nor day care could replace me on a lot of the tasks needed to care for him.  It's probably not popular to admit, but, for many babies, I find it hard to see how the mom  can opt out of bearing the brunt specifically of caring for the kid in the first year or so of his life, even though dads can and should do a lot.  \n\n\nI brought my first baby to my office with me when I was a grad student... kid ended up being a beloved honorary PhD student among the other grad students in the office building, to the point that when I had to go back to teach, I had several friends able to watch him in the few hours I was gone.  I also wore him in a baby wrap and would breastfeed him in my office.  Having that pro-baby culture really made it possible for me to both care for my kid and be close to him most of the time, while still doing my work.   An added plus is that in the first few months, the baby is most often asleep anyway, so I was able to meet with my advisor and attend part of seminars.  Things did slow down, but only a bit, and I found that the time crunch made it so that the time I still had for research was way more efficiently used.  I can imagine this would be much harder to do if research involved a lot of lab hours, but it might be possible to use the early months as time to work on the writing end of things?",

Most males don't either but some do. \n\nThis is apparently true because the ratio changes to about 1:6 at the post doctoral level, and 1:25 at the faculty level in my department. It is a problem but not one that is being ignored. Search committees put a high priority on hiring females over males to the point where they have simply not entertained the idea of hiring more men (literal discussion I had with members of the committee). We have several open spots right now because there are no qualified women, who also have intent on going here, applying, and men are not in serious consideration. (Qualified women apply but get better offers at better institutions).\n\nThe problem is elsewhere. The problem is that science and academia suck and women are too smart to put up with it's crap. The environment needs to change. There needs to be more money and less pressure to work a lifestyle that is not compatible with family, friends, and self care. The hiring practices are actually in place to correct the imbalance, but retention is the issue. If retention is the problem it's saying something about the working conditions.",

I left out the fact that the admission committee will refuse to hire me as a tenure track faculty because they would rather wait for women to apply and accept. Considering I am region locked for family reasons, this is a devasting blow to my career that feels straight prejudice. \n\nDespite my feelings, there are good reasons to worry about a ratio. First, it is hard to attract talent when the environment is all a single demographic. You don't want to scare off female talent because the environment is all male. I don't know how realistic this argument is, I am not a woman, but having listened to women complain about how our department is a \"good ol boys club\" I am assuming it's valid, at least to some.\n\n Next, the director of my division of the NIH came to talk about proposed policy changes to funding criterion, and mentioned that if a department doesn't have a representation of women and minorities it might not be eligible for funding. This threw our department into a female hiring frenzy. Although they have been wildly unsuccessful at recruiting talent (1 female in 4 years with at least 5-6 open slots, males have been seldom considered depending on how much grant money they already have, females only need to demonstrate promise, not actually have funds).\n\nTo the best of my knowledge this policy isn't in place, but hearing it even as a proposition has serious implications for many departments, as well as for men trying to secure a tenure track position in the next decade. Not that it can't happen, but in places like my institution the standards for admission are disproportionately higher, maybe not even possible.",

I recently was in a meeting where a point I made (as chair!) was attributed to 5 different men by the other men in the room. It's exhausting and they came out thinking I didn't contribute anything. \n\nIf you're asking at the point of recruitment how to get more women to apply, it's too late. You need to lay a lot of groundwork first. \n\nYou need to bring in a specialist in equality and diversity but they also need to be someone who knows about change management. One of my unpopular opinions is there are far too many (mostly) women who have felt forced out of their academic career and gone into EDI careers but while they are passionate they have none of the skills required to change an organisation and the result is a lot of talking and no action. \n\nA good place to start is watching Picture A Scientist on Netflix. It'll give you an indication of the problems and also how some people have instrumentally driven change to the benefit of everyone in their organisations (or nearly everyone. The old boys who kept it a closed shop don't love the change).\n\nThis of course also applies to BIPOC and you must do the work there as well.",

Women just usually realise they don't like it so much and they pursue other more interesting things, which brings me to the second point...\n2. Women don't like careers oriented on things. So many careers in stem are just not as interesting. We are wired to be more people oriented (of course this is generalizing, and it is true for majority but not all). If you don't find something as interesting then you will never be so good at it. When I see how my collegues really enjoy reading about technology in their free time I'm surprised because I would literally rather do anything else. I love achieving progress in my field but in my free time I don't wanna see/read/ do projects in any technology at all...\n\nI think main issues with not many women in stem is that there is just so many men around we feel underrepresented, imposter syndrome etc. Then also it can be hard to work with only males, there are some needs that could be not accommodated. Also you are constantly undermined, not respected, you have to prove yourself much more than others etc.\nOther thing is short term contracts, lack of stability, issues with how hard it is to have a baby while having a career.",

It's held to a pretty rigorous accreditation standard that makes it exceptionally difficult to get into engineering at any level other than the ground floor (i.e. freshman year engineering courses), and as a result essentially **no one** transfers into engineering; they only transfer out.\n\nIn my experience, this has been a significant issue; a lot of women seem to discover that they have the talent and interest in engineering by their junior year and seek to transfer in or try for grad school, only to be told that;\n\n1) Transferring will mean throwing away the last two years of school because none of their prior classes matter for an engineering degree.\n\n2) Grad school is out of the question because most engineering programs (outside of bioengineering) straight-up do not take non-engineers. Physics majors already have a hard enough time getting into mechanical, aerospace, and electrical engineering grad programs; other majors find it basically impossible because of the sheer amount of remedial coursework they'd have to wade through.\n\nThis isn't to say that there aren't other, deeper issues at play. But the easiest problem to solve is simply the fact that women just aren't enrolling in engineering courses as freshman; until that changes, any other \"solutions\" are basically just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.",

So although the engineering issue may or may not be the same, I think the ground floor situation is the same for al STEM subjects here.",
