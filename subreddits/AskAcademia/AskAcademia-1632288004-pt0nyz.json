  "text": "I am seeking advice on how to tackle Imposter Syndrome as a first year Master's student. It has only been 5 weeks, but I have doubted myself more in these few weeks than I ever did in undergrad. I got my BA in History and stayed at my university to get my MA in History, but I can't help feeling that I was only accepted because the relationships I made with my professors. I know that letters of recommendation help tremendously, but I also came in with a 4.0. I felt confident in my ability to construct quality research papers and answering questions in class. I'm not falling behind in terms of content, but I fear that my anxiety will change that. I was on the verge of tears after my seminar today, when I fumbled quite a bit when my professor called on me. I was flushed and could not help thinking that my peers thought I was an idiot. In that class, there are also PhD students, which does not make me feel any better. I will read the articles, books, and do the assignments, but I can't bring myself to participate. I have no idea what to do.",

      "text": "You may want to reduce your course load if you can, speak with a tutor or counselor. Mental health is important. \n\nI just started my master's in history this year after being out of academia for the last 5 years. \n\nI went from teaching grade schoolers (still am) to reading thick dense obscure readings that take me hours to read in which they seem to say everything and nothing at all. To top it all off I have a very niche interest and none of the courses offered are in my niche. I feel the only way I can do this is if I have a moderate interest otherwise I'm done for. \n\nAs a teacher I have to dilute learning to make it crystal clear to learners and this is the complete opposite. It's purposefully dense and obfuscating. I like challenging readings but this is pure pain. I've asked to switch courses so hopefully that will help.",

      "text": "I definitely felt this way when I started my history MA! I also was on the verge of tears in one of my seminars at the beginning of my program feeling like I didn't belong and that everyone else had such a good grasp on all these new concepts.  \n\n\nWhat really helped me was being vulnerable and talking to some of my peers in the program. Most of them felt exactly the same way as I did and felt relieved to be talking about it! At the end of the semester, we spent an hour in class talking about the seminar and pretty much everyone said something along the lines of \"it was really overwhelming at first and everyone else seemed so smart and I seemed so out of place\". The people sharing this I thought were effortlessly confident and incredibly smart, so I felt relieved going forward realizing most everyone feels this way!  It sounds like you're a competent historian and you are able to keep up with the coursework and thats what is really important",

Even when I was the only MA in a class full of PhDs, they\u2019d tell me after class they were in the same frame of mind as me. \n\nYou know how when you\u2019re a kid, you think adults know what they\u2019re doing, and then you get to be an adult, and you realize that\u2019s not true and most of us are just winging it and learning as we go?
