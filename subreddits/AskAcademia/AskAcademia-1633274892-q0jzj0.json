  "title:": "If your book cites no BIPOC scholars and 3/3 of your examples are White people, is your book racist?",
  "text": "I am asking this question genuinely so please bear with me.\n\nI am a young (white female) scholar working on a book manuscript. It will be \\~120 pages, and will cite or reference \\~40 scholars and give 3 \"examples\" (basically cutesy stories about individual people). Tonight, I was concerned to realize that 39/40 of my scholars are White (one is Indian) and 3/3 of my examples are White.\n\nIf I leave it in this form, is my book fundamentally racist?\n\nFor context, my field (a subdiscipline of philosophy and I won't be more specific for privacy) was historically overwhelmingly White, partly because of geographical hubs in Europe but of course also partly due to racism. While the field is (at least somewhat) more diverse now, my topic is somewhat niche and I have not found any BIPOC authors who have written on the topic. Of course, I could expand my discussion in a different direction to encompass more topics for this reason. I don't know enough to know whether this is a good idea or a bad idea.\n\nAdditionally, 3/3 of the stories I use as examples or salient features feature all White people. 2 are linked to the texts (family members or subjects of the research texts I've used), and White for that reason. The 3rd is someone with a unique story which I learned about in the news and I just don't know of anyone else with that story. I could find a different story but it would be lacking some features.\n\nWith all that said, I would appreciate any insight or perspective on whether this is a serious problem with my manuscript which needs to be corrected or if it is just something to accept. I genuinely want to know, particularly from people who are better educated on these issues than me, is my book racist?\n\nRelated questions would be \"is my book more racist than others of its kind?\" (Do most humanities books focused on historical material end up citing all White people, or do I specifically have a blindspot here?) and \"will my book look racist?\" (As in, readers will not be able to hear any justification from me or know my personal beliefs). However that said, I want to be clear that I am sincerely seeking answers on what makes a book racist and not just as a \"PR\" type of question.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "There's not a number at which point your book becomes racist or unracist. These are qualitative terms not easily turned quantitative.\n\nAre you making good faith efforts to ask how inclusive your field is? Do you talk to other scholars about this? Do you try to make sure that students and trainees feel welcome in the often homogenous halls of academia? If so, great. But if there simply aren't nonwhite scholars to cite, you can't invent them. It's not always your bibliography's job to solve racism or to reinvent history. The past is what it is. If there are contemporary scholars whose work is underappreciated due to their race or nationality, you could certainly cite them, but if they don't exist yet, they don't exist yet.",

      "text": "It's good that you're considering if your book paints a picture representative of the groups who would be impacted by the ideas presented. It is important to acknowledge the racial biases in the field, both past and present. However, I don't think \"is my book racist?\" is really the right question to be asking.\n\nI would evaluate the specific reasons why you choose to include any one story and exclude another. Evaluate the depth of your research to see if there is a BIPOC scholar you have left out. If you're in a small field you may need to expand your search, but this doesn't necessarily mean expanding the scope of your book; someone who works primarily in an adjacent field may still have work that impacts your own.\n\nI also like /u/Honestaltly's suggestion of addressing historical and current biases of the field directly.",

It\u2019s highly improbable that 100% of scholars in any topic are ONLY white and European. You just have to look for the diversity in your field, explicitly and actively by choice.
