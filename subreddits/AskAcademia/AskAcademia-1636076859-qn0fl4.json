  "title:": "What would you change most about your experience in academia?",
  "text": "I am a uni lecturer and final year PhD candidate in business collaborating with a start-up that is working on a social network aimed at connecting and supporting grad students and early career researchers and academics. The start-up is interested in hearing especially from those groups but others within or outside of academia sharing their experiences and challenges while working or researching in academia. What would you change most? What kind of support is/was lacking during your time in academia?\n\nResponses here are welcome. If you are willing to answer 12 shortish question in the survey link ([CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZimTShGFV6CFCA8rgNsohYmFyx46CwynZux03joSf0RxEQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)), it would even be more helpful in setting the priorities of the start-up's commitment to putting users first. \n\nThanks for any input you are willing to provide!",

      "text": "This may not be the answer you're necessarily looking for.\n\nI dropped halfway through my Master's program because of an issue that may seem miniscule to some, but was a deal-breaker for me, especially with COVID going on. **Non-techy savvy professors.** Now, this may seem ridiculous, but this issue can ruin retention rate and someone's academic experience, like it did for me. I also heard this as a common complaint from undergraduates while student teaching, and I suffered from this myself while an undergraduate *and* graduate. I'm not talking about professors who occasionally struggle - after all, we're all human. **I'm talking about professors who have little to no knowledge on how to conduct online teaching**, especially now that everything is hybrid or completely online. Professors who do not know how to create and lead a discussion board forum; professors who don't know how to upload syllabi; professors who cannot, for the life of them, structure an online class to be easy and helpful to navigate for students. Eliminate unnecessary student frustration by s**upporting professors and training them on how to use technology, and how to incorporate technology into lesson planning and assignments.** We're in a technological age, and we need technological professors who can support us in this age. And this problem is significantly worse than anyone believes it is - *there's an entire study in academia devoted to fixing this problem because of how rampant it is.*\n\nEdit: words",

      "text": "Something that is very frustrating for me is how inaccessible external support is for graduate students from a financial point of view. When I felt like I was not getting the support I needed from those inside my university, there was only one academic coach who I could afford to work with on a consistent basis. It feels like these coaches get their PhDs and automatically forget that we're living on 30k or less a year which is barely a living wage in most places. I would very much appreciate a network that would allow graduate students to receive more affordable support.\n\nI would also appreciate a network that would allow opportunities for research collaboration, conference meet-ups, the development of graduate-student led journals, etc.",

The founders are not receiving any support or funding through any organization with an ethics review process. It is not part of a study but is initial market research for a private start-up aimed at supporting grad students and ECRs.",
