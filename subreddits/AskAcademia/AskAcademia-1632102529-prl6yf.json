  "title:": "Can someone suggest a natural sounding text to speech app for proofing papers?",
  "text": "I am posting this here because I specifically need a text to speech  program, or a website, that I can paste or upload my papers into and  have them read back to me, but in a very natural voice. I have tried a  company called Natural Voices and they are anything but natural. I don't  need to convert them to MP3 or use them for voice overs like many  services provide, I don't even need to save them. I just want to listen  to my papers for clarity and flow. Paid is fine, I do not need free. I  figured maybe grad students would have ideas. If it matters, I am using  Linux as my OS.",

When you\u2019re reading your own work out loud you\u2019re using your eyes not your ears. I do read my stuff out loud but it\u2019s nowhere near as helpful as hearing it in another voice. Your own eyes are too forgiving.",
