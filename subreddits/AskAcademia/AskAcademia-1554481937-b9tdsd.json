  "text": "I found this really fascinating article which I think would be useful for my research. Thing is, I have to purchase it or a subscription in order to get access to it (which I can't afford right now). I saw this meme floating around social media which said that academics don't get any compensation for people purchasing access to their work, and so are usually okay with just sending it to people who ask, but I wasn't sure if this was actually accurate or not. Wanted to know peoples thoughts? ",

However, some of them may not respond in a timely manner.\n\nOne other thing that I haven't seen mentioned is that you might already have access to the journal, but you are not going about it the right way. For a lot of colleges and universities, if you attempt to access the paper on the academic journal website (J-Store, Elsevier, etc.) while you are on campus, you can gain access as long as your university has an institutional subscription. A lot of students try to access articles while they are off campus and find they suddenly can't access them, and they mistakenly think that they can't get it through their library. If you are off campus, you may want to look into whether or not your school has a VPN. If I am off campus, as long as I log in through my school's VPN, I can gain access to our full range of library subscriptions.\n\nSome colleges and universities also require you to log with your school credentials, even if you are on campus, to gain access to the library's resources (this strikes me as an outdated mode of doing this--this is what I did in grad school 10 years ago). \n\nAll of this is to say that you should familiarize yourself with your college/university's official process for accessing electronic materials.

However, it automates the request process, so that if I get a request I just hit \"yes\" and the article is automatically sent to the requestor.\n\nMost of us do not get compensated in any way by publishing. It is sort of a professional requirement to contribute to the field for many of our jobs, and not a source of income. ",
