  "title:": "Placed on a review paper with a sexual assaulter and I don't know how to reject the role respectfully to my supervisor",
  "text": "TL;DR Some pervert I used to be house-mates with molested my friend in her sleep, I've now been put on a project to work with him. My friend isn't comfortable escalating it herself, so I have to respect that, but it also means that if I do bring anything up, it's just going off hearsay. I have a huge amount of respect for my supervisor and don't want to come off as taking shortcuts, being undiplomatic/unprofessional, or gossipy. I'm not sure whether I should just power through, do my job, and keep my mouth shut, or whether I should speak up?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a little bit of background - I'm an undergrad in Canada aiming to get into med school. I've been working on medical research with a supervisor of mine for about 2 and a half years now and have amassed a huge amount of respect for him because of the amount of trust he's put in me and how many opportunities he's given me over the years. I was initially working with Person A on research under my supervisor until Person A decided that he wasn't interested in research anymore and dropped out. At this point, I turned to two of my friends interested in med school and told them about the opportunity in case they were interested. The name of my supervisor was no secret, so if they were interested, they knew how to find his contact info. However, my roommate in the other room overheard, emailed the supervisor, got the vacant research position within a few days. This roommate, let's call him Dickhead for anonymity, told everyone that he wasn't interested in medical school and that he was gunning for a PhD and everybody supported that. The research that he got involved in through snatching this position is very, *very* medical - as in, it's confusing why someone would do this research unless they're involved with medicine in some form or another. I can respect if Dickhead didn't want people to know he was aiming for medical school because it's a cutthroat environment, but he did it to be able to stomp on people's feet to work his way to the top without them realizing (and, as I'll soon explain, he's in it just for the prestige, and would be a threat in a position with that authority, but I suppose that's a separate moral issue). He would ask everyone to help him with work and assist him with anything he didn't understand, and since he wasn't their 'competition', he knew they would. On the flip side, if he had taken a course and a friend or I wanted to ask him about how to go around doing an assignment, he would either ignore the messages until the due date had past (quite literally staying like a hermit in his room to avoid talking to anyone) or would just say he doesn't want to - which again I would be able to respect *if he didn't leach off of everybody he could himself*. I could go on about how unbelievably filthy Dickhead is as well, but I don't want to deviate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround about a year and a half ago, I asked a friend of mine why she stopped coming over to our house to hang out. Long story short (and also for the sake of retaining anonymity), she got coaxed to nap in Dickhead's bed and was molested. She doesn't feel comfortable escalating/reporting it, which I can fully understand, and so I've supported that decision and will absolutely not tell her to escalate it if she isn't comfortable. I found out about this a few months before Dickhead got the research position, but it wasn't my place to say anything and so I left it alone. A few months later, when Dickhead joined, he never told the supervisor that he heard about the position, albeit indirectly, through me, and acted so surprised when he saw me at his first research meeting. Since our supervisor didn't associate us with one another, we ended up getting put on separate projects with different people, and so I didn't feel as though it would be appropriate to bring up his behavior out of the blue. This is about a year ago from today, and last night I just got put on two parallel papers with Dickhead for the first time. The groupchat has been silent for the time  being, but I literally cannot work with him without feeling my blood boil knowing what he did, not only the backs he stepped on to get in the position he has, but the fact that he molested someone, doesn't give a >!\\>:(!< about it and never apologized for it because he never saw it as wrong.  I have a huge amount of respect for my supervisor. He's put so much trust in me and given me so many incredible opportunities. I look up to him as a mentor and I don't know how to tell him I'm uncomfortable working on these projects, or if it's unprofessional to do so. I don't want to just say \"no, thanks\", but I don't want to blatantly say \"Dickhead's a sexual assaulter, and I'm uncomfortable working with him\" because I'm worried it would be undiplomatic/unprofessional, and since my friend never escalated it, it could come off as hearsay. I definitely don't want to make it seem like I'm spreading rumors, but I also don't know whether I'll get the opportunity again to tell my supervisor that he's working with a bad apple if I don't say anything now. On the flip side, I'm not sure if I should just bite my tongue, do the job I signed up to do and work on the project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd really appreciate anyone's advice on i) how to address my discomfort of working on these projects, and ii) whether it would be unprofessional of me to justify *why* I'm uncomforted by it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, I can also offer a poor man's gold award \ud83e\udd47if somebody could give insight on whether me keeping quiet is the right thing to do considering this guy wants to become a doctor, even though I can't imagine it being my place to ever discuss it with anyone? I feel guilty knowing this information and not saying anything about it because I genuinely believe he has done it before and/or will do similar things again considering his lack of remorse, and I would feel partly responsible if I literally know the threat he posed from now and never did anything to prevent it from happening again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance to anybody who took the time to read this post in its entirety and/or took the time to write a response, I really appreciate it!",

I'm not sure if this has come from experience dealing with a similar situation and you knowing how best to address it, if so thank you for choosing to reflect on it and helping me in this situation. If you just phrased it this way off the top of your head, this was the best response that encapsulated everything I feel in a mild enough manner to not throw subjective spite at Dickhead that the supervisor wouldn't care for, keeping the situation calm so that my supervisor doesn't have undergraduate drama to deal with, and still informing him that Dickhead is someone to keep his eye on. Since we're currently working through online chats, I think I'll proceed with a message very similar to this (I'm sorry in advance for not citing you in my text!). It states everything I wanted to say and I stay in my place by not going behind my friend's back or making allegations on her behalf when it isn't my place to do so.\n\nThank you again.

That did not matter and it was still required to be reported.  It is one of the few things that I can instantly lose my tenure/job over if it is discovered I did not report something. \n\nI like everything about the advice that was given (private meeting, keep to the facts, no emotion, no speculation) but I would be very vague and, like phiupan suggested, just say for a personal reason.",

      "text": "This is an important issue so thank you for sharing on the subreddit. \n\nA lot of comments seem concerned about your advisor having to report this sexual assault to Title IX or the appropriate office(s). I'm not sure about your university (so maybe check?), but my role as a mandatory reporter is that I just have to let the Title IX office know--does not need details, names or anything, just that someone confided something. I always preface this with my students that if something comes up in class or discussions, I will have to report. So you could preface this conversation with your advisor that you have something that may need reporting, but the victim does not want to pursue charges.\n\nTangentially, I think it's necessary to call it what it is: sexual assault. Don't beat around the bush with your advisor saying \"something happened\" or \"something inappropriate\" happened between your friend and Dickhead. These sound vague and will give your advisor the idea that it's petty drama when it's very much not.\n\nHopefully your advisor is understanding! Good luck!",

Loads of the replies here take this as fact from the get go, but that's not how law works.\n\nTell me, what would you do in this situation? Would you fire this kid off hearsay or wait until it's proven? Would you talk with him first?

Some others have kindly suggested reporting it to the university, but again there\u2019s no way they can state he\u2019s guilty if my friend is uncomfortable coming forward with it, and I\u2019m not in a position to force her into having to discuss it with anybody.

Anything more seems unethical to me. My undergrad had an unwritten policy that people could inform the uni of a person they are uncomfortable with, and (I think) the uni would inform you of classes that you had signed up together to take (if they do take a class together I think there's some way to make sure they aren't grouped together for projects; I'm not sure of the specifics), or like make sure you live in different dorm buildings.

This may be a cold take on the situation, but I\u2019m going to run a scenario on how this could backfire on you. \n\nIf anyone (supervisor, Canadian equivalent of Title IX office, etc) hears of your concerns and feels like they need to get DH\u2019s side of the story, it would become his version vs your rumors. DH could easily spin it to say that the assault was really just a misunderstanding and that\u2019s why your friend never reported it. He could use the fact that you continued to be roommates with him for several months after it happened as evidence that it was \u201cnothing\u201d and say that you are only bringing this up now to sabotage his position in the research group out of professional jealousy. Obviously this is a nasty twist on the truth, but it seems like it would be in character for him. This could potentially blow up on you very badly, or force your friend to come forward even though she doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nIn my opinion you don\u2019t want to say anything to anyone that triggers a situation where your ex-roommate has the opportunity to spin the story unless your friend decides that she wants to report. It\u2019s up to you to decide if your supervisor is likely to keep the concerns you express to him private or if he would want to hear the other side, but please proceed with caution and CYA as much as possible. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think there is any avenue you can take to reveal this guy\u2019s true colors since your direct knowledge is just general jerk-like behavior and the serious offense is second hand.",

I appreciate that you're thinking first of your friend and the potential victims of Dickhead as well. Your discomfort gives victims like me hope that things can change for the better.\n\nAcademia is such a mixed bag of allies and old boys' clubs (yes, including women with internalized misogyny), so my first thought would be to feel out which one your supervisor is \u2013 are they more likely to sympathize with the victim or more likely to retaliate against you for \"unprofessional hearsay\"? From your post, it seems that you've known your supervisor long enough to see which side they would take.\n\nIf they're more likely to sympathize with the victim, then you can have a sincere conversation where you say \"Dickhead has done something unconscionable to someone I know, and working with him violates my non-negotiables.\" If your supervisor inquires further, then just tell them that you're not at liberty to say out of respect for the victim. From my experience, supervisors I respect appreciate two things: honest communication and their mentees' ability to define their non-negotiables, drawing the boundary when need be.\n\nOn the other hand, if you feel that your supervisor is someone who wouldn't care much about what Dickhead did, i.e. his personal and professional lives are separate or any of that BS, maybe it's best not to strike up that conversation at all since it won't lead to anything anyway. If you've already proven your mettle with your supervisor, declining a review paper for reasons like \"not wanting to spread myself too thin\" is always a valid and respectful response.\n\nAs for what you do to prevent Dickhead from harming more people, it's a tragedy that most of universities' accountability measures place such a huge burden on victims to disclose. I think if you can afford to reject the project, the next best thing to do without putting your friend on the spot is to support them emotionally and let them know you're there until they're ready to hold Dickhead to account in whatever way.",

If that's the case, then it's annoying, if he got it because he beat them in an interview, then that's life I'm afraid.\n\nThat aside though, the biggest problem with the molestation is that it isn't reported. If you tell your supervisor or other people at work that he did that, without evidence or a conviction, it could be risky. He'd just say he didn't do it, right? Then what happens? Nothing can happen to him on just an accusation without a conviction. Men have been fired on an accusation alone, but only when the police have been involved.\n\nHonestly, I'd say nothing and just not work with him. Think about it this way, what would you do if he said you molested his friend? Because everything you would do or say is exactly what he is going to do. You'd say it didn't happen, he'd say it did. Whether it's him being guilty or you being innocent doesn't matter, both cases have no report and no conviction. Both would be treated the same.\n\nOne thing to think about. Some universities have a code of conduct where staff and faculty have to report certain things. I have worked at 3 universities (UK, Germany, USA) and this would come under that in all of those. If you were my student, and you told me, I'd have to report it. Then the police would be involved etc. Is your friend ok with that? She didn't want it reported before, so if you accidentally report it, is that ok? Another thing, is it your place to tell people? Your friend is the victim and doesn't want it out there, is it ok for you to put it out there for her? Yeah, you'd just tell your supervisor, but if he reports it then it's out there.",

          "text": "Hi u/realwinstonsmith44, thank you for your reply. If you read through my post again, I\u2019m actually hesitant to make any accusations because i) it isn\u2019t my place to do so if it breaches my friend\u2019s respect, and ii) I recognize that it would come off as hearsay. I also didn\u2019t come to get pumped up, but rather asked how to go about it diplomatically without discussing details with my supervisor. Again, I\u2019m not destroying someone\u2019s life, and have instead opted away from making any accusations if my friend isn\u2019t comfortable coming forth herself. \n\nTo be honest though, \n>Or sometimes people fabricate or are delusional\n\nI\u2019m actually quite concerned by this statement. You sooner disbelieved my friend\u2019s accusations and defended someone who, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is a predator, than rationalized that I\u2019m not even going after him. Please, moving forward, don\u2019t discredit somebody\u2019s claims of being harassed because you think they\u2019re delusional. It\u2019s immoral on so many levels. \n\nRegarding this being a sick crowd and sick post, the majority of people replying have been a huge help by suggesting ways to professionally bring up my discomfort in something that I heard, and disclose that these rumours are secondhand allegations, and as such I should tell my supervisor to be wary that they may not be true. For the vast majority of people on this thread, they followed that Dickhead is innocent until proven guilty, and have been incredibly respectful in understanding that I want to treat the situation as such and don\u2019t want to escalate things since it isn\u2019t my place to do so",

          "text": "Thank you for your response u/anavarzaa. The incident occurred at 3am that night and I went to bed at 11pm. My other roommates are friends with her as well, sorry for not clarifying that earlier, and so she ended up spending the rest of the evening with Dickhead after everybody else went to sleep. I found out about the incident months after it happened. What happened wasn\u2019t rape, although I\u2019d like to refrain from providing details. I also hadn\u2019t mentioned it influencing my career; I\u2019ve chosen not to escalate it because my friend was uncomfortable doing so herself even after we discussed it. I wasn\u2019t a witness to the crime and so if I were to report it to the police, they would go straight to the victim, who would then say she isn\u2019t comfortable reporting it. In that case, not only would nothing have come from it, but now my friend would feel disrespected that I went behind her back to escalate it. It isn\u2019t my place unfortunately, although I do feel some moral obligation to say something to prevent it from happening again, why is why I asked for advice on how I could go about doing that since I truly have no clue where to go about it. I made a previous post about it too - rest assured, the potential impact on my career has never been a consideration. I apologize if any omitted details from the main post gave that impression",
