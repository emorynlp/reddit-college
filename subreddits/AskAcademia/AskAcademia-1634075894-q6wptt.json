  "title:": "Systematic Review - What kind of research articles are appropriate?",
  "text": "I am working on a systematic review for a class and I've completely missed and unable to find in the book or online what research articles are appropriate to be included in your systematic review. Also I'm struggling with how to tell what kind of article you're dealing with. \n\nFor example: \n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316491/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316491/) I cannot find what kind of research study this is, what section should I be reading to find out?  This is what stood out to me: Longitudinal Suicide-Related Outcomes: We reviewed participants\u2019 electronic medical records to determine whether they had any suicide-related outcomes in the time after the completion of an SP following their SPAN event. What kind of study would this be? And what kind of study is appropriate to include in a systematic review?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks (:",
