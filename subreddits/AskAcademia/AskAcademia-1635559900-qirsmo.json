  "title:": "Group member plagiarized from an article",
  "text": "College student here. I'm currently in a predicament where I have a group member who has plagiarized from an article and submitted it with our GROUP paper. The group member quite literally copy-pasted text from the article and acted like no one was going to know. If this was not a group assignment and I knew about this, I would have just let it slide because its his life - if he wants to risk it go ahead but this effects me and my grade on this assignment as well as the 4 other assignments I'd have to complete with him. The rest of the team has been unresponsive to this problem and I only realized one day before the paper was due that their section was plagiarized. I have fixed his section and resubmitted the paper since no one else has responded to my texts. After debating my decision to report this to the professor, I eventually submitted to my professor a paragraph detailing what happened. My question is, did I do the right thing or should I have let it slide given that I didn't get a response from my other team members regarding the plagiarizing team mate? I'd hate to know that he'll get into severe trouble but I also don't feel right having to cover for someone who was so willing to put me at risk.",

      "text": "You did the right thing in removing the plagiarism that your group member was prepared to submit. No one else is looking out for you but you, and you did what you needed to do to protect yourself.\n\nAs far as reporting to the professor, I think you did the right thing, too. Given that your partner was readily prepared to put your grade and academic standing at risk, I wouldn't worry too much about putting his grade and standing at risk for far more justifiable reasons. (It would be more accurate to say that he put his grade and standing at risk when he chose to plagiarize.)\n\nMore broadly, I think it's good to make your professor aware that these kinds of things happen with group projects. I've dealt with a few cases of plagiarism in group projects, and it can be a bit of a nightmare to check in with each person to try to get a sense of who did what so I can implement consequences for the plagiarizer but not punish their partners who may have had no reason to doubt the integrity of their group member's contribution. In part based upon identifying plagiarism in a handful of group projects, I've added a group member evaluation for all group projects in which I ask each group member to specify what they did and what each partner did. It's possible that being more aware of plagiarism in group projects will help your professor to implement something similar, or respond sensitively when it does come up.",

I also think what you initially did - fixing his section and resubmitting it - would have been fine, but yes, you are in a delicate position. Ultimately it's good you're considering how harsh being caught in a plagiarism sitch could mess up his college career (but again, if your whole group was blamed for it, it would be needlessly bad for all of you!)  You handled it fine, and I hope your groupmate learns his lesson without messing up his schooling too bad. I always tell my students you're better off handing in word salad that's barely coherent than handing in something plagiarized!",
