Network network network. Don't assume you will stay in academia. And don't look at the PhD as an end in itself. Think about what you want once you are done and prepare for it. You might change your views along the way but better start the process early than in the last 1 year.\n\n\n3. Stick to a 9-5 routine if possible and actually socialize on days off. Don't let anyone push your boundaries. People will try to make you feel bad for not slaving away. Recognize it for the dysfunctional way of life it is. Work smart and work consistent. This is your degree, don't follow anyone blindly if you don't agree.",

          "text": "This is getting a lot of up votes, and I do not know why, but I thought I would add a comment for anyone considering a PhD.\n\nThis week would have been the graduation week for my institution, pre-covid. I transitioned out of academia two years ago, so this is the last cohort of students I taught in their first year.\n\nI went into academia because I held three degrees in different fields and I wanted to tie them together in one PhD. I found a supervisor I liked and stayed at my third institution and put forward a methodology based on a sector of my masters I had enjoyed.\n\nLet's be constructive. My tips:\n\n- Make sure there is teaching work available from the moment you start (unless you're independently wealthy - in which case, good for you!)\n\n- Contact your ethics committee rep before you start to discuss your proposed methodology. I did not, and because it involved observing classes and interviewing students, my start date was delayed for *10 months* because the committee rep refused to believe my head of department would okay it. \n(They already had.)\n\n- Check the funding you can get. I was given a bursary that was a nice amount, except because there was no work I was using it to pay my tuition fees. My institution also reserved 1/4 of the first year amount because it took them three months to administer it. My first year the funding paid the fees. For two years after that my bursary paid the fees and left me with... \u00a3120 a month. \n\n- Arrange your second supervisor as quickly as you can, but be careful. I later discovered that my first supervisor was so hated by other departments in my institution that they refused to provide a second from either department related to my MA track.\n\n- Speaking of which, make sure you research the reputation of your advisor. I didn't. I paid a huge price for that later. My supervisor denigrated my research but provided no alternatives. My procedural methodology - the instructions for what I had done for future researchers to understand strengths and weaknesses - was described as \"like an instruction manual for flushing a toilet\". That was one of the more constructive comments. \n\n- Make a plan and stick to it. Don't be afraid of adaptation but don't be pressured into going into areas you have no expertise in, especially if you are then assessed on them.\n\n- If you have to make a complaint, sad to say, you're probably fucked. If your relationship with your supervisor breaks down, you're probably fucked. Academia is a closed rank, however serried. The problem will never be with the academic. To admit this would open up the floodgates, and the gates must remain unassailable. The problem will always be with the student, because how could it not be? The academics are always right.\n\nTwo years ago I was making a small amount of money per four month module, of which I would get around four per year. I would have to hustle and beg for every single piece of work, and it would rely on both funding and an academic not wanting, essentially, to do it themself.\n\nI failed my PhD slowly, over eighteen months, when I should have pulled the pin and left before that started. I fought when I should have left. \n\nDuring my PhD I authored one book review and one conference paper. I should have done more, but I didn't make a plan, and I didn't stick to the plan I did have.\n\nI transitioned to teaching afterwards. I make in a month what I made for an entire module before, every month. In two years I have authored a book review, a book chapter, and have submitted a journal article, with more in the way, because I actually want to do it now. \n\nThere's an anti-gambling slogan which always sticks in my mind, so if the above is too long: \"When the fun stops... stop.\" \n\nI wish I had sooner.",

That sucks for me since I'm a generalist by disposition. Being more of a generalist does have its advantages of course (maybe better able to weather academic trends, potentially apply for a wider array of jobs and grants, etc.) but most jobs they'll take \"world expert in X with ten publications in it\" over \"pretty deep knowledge of V, W, X, Y, and Z and two publications in each\". PhD is an ideal time to start marking your territory and establishing a specialised niche. I sort of did that, but it was partly accidental, and driven by the social and environmental factors (it so happened that everyone around me was working on X, so I also put 75% of my efforts into X). I could certainly have made more of an effort to do it strategically and deliberately.",

Ive been practicing on doing all of this and getting that hard work of sustainable habit building out of the way early. So I\u2019m doing all of the things everyone else has listed here already as I enter my first year. I mostly just wanted to get my shit together but I figured there\u2019s never a more crucial time to do so than before my PhD starts. \n\n\nI\u2019m so glad I figured out what you\u2019re advising before I chose some crazy topic \u201cfor the challenge.\u201d I started getting carried away with topic ideas at first. Then I took a step back. I asked myself, what\u2019s the easiest way to get a PhD? I listen to EO Wilson\u2019s \u201cletter to a young scientist\u201d audiobook. He advises the easiest way (and most fulfilling!) is simply finding something no one else is exploring. That way all of the basic, foundational questions are right there for you to investigate, instead of competing with thousands of others on the same topic over the scraps of nuanced questions. Then you get cited more since you were one of the first. And it looks awesome because you get \u201ccutting edge\u201d points\u2014my subfield is new because it\u2019s simply the direction the entire field is heading toward (and has been heading toward, so it\u2019s not a fleeting trend) so now I\u2019ve set myself up beautifully. And it\u2019s applicable to all sorts of tangential issues that society is facing, in addition to advancing understanding, so it\u2019s very marketable for grants. All I have to do is keep buckling down on learning how to code and staying updated on new technology to incorporate (wow factor+can answer new questions we weren\u2019t able to before)/ other technical aspects/data analysis/etc...you know, the gatekeeping shit that the \u201cold boys club\u201d profs like to circle jerk about knowing better than everyone else. \n\nKeeping it simple has been freeing me up to work on my other passions: social justice and working to make the ivory tower diverse and inclusive (I\u2019m gonna lose my fucking mind if I have to live out my career with the ways things are currently. *fuck.* this. systemic. racism.). I\u2019ve got four publications so far, one in review, and 2-4 in the works. The best epiphany I had was realizing I needed to take a step back and figure out the easiest possible way for me to maximize my success. It\u2019s just as fulfilling to make \u201cdoing it as easy as humanly possible\u201d the challenge.\n\nEdit: published to cited..but published fits too",

I didn't get on meds until my 30s because I had figured out enough work arounds and I guess I'm smart enough to compensate (and am generally a really hard worker). It looked like post it notes everywhere. Before smart phones in college I just had everything written on my arms and hands. Just notes and reminders EVERYWHERE but still missing assignments and being late and/or unprepared all the time.\n\n However, getting a TT job and having a baby made it so those compensations didn't work anymore. I was constantly missing deadlines, realizing I didn't create a lecture the morning of class, forgetting to write tests etc. It was bad. Then I finally got on meds and literally cried bc I just sat down and calmly wrote like 3 lectures in a row in a methodical way. It was like holy shit, my life could have been so much easier - but my dad refused to let me be treated when I was initially diagnosed at age 7 (my parents had recently divorced and this was part of the extremely nasty divorce process) and also engrained into me that I didn't need meds bc I could just work harder. Spoiler alert: it doesn't work like that. All that does is create horrible self esteem and make you feel isolated from the world. I definitely had an image of me just being a fuck up and being behind everyone else. I thought I was just dumb. Turns out I'm actually really effing smart and my brain just needs a little help. I like that narrative much better.",

I had to get those under control before I could treat the ADHD because the most effective medications, stimulants, can really exacerbate the other disorders and send me into mania or give me waves of panic attacks (which the first two stimulants actually did). It's a stepwise process. It could be that your doctor saw something else that may be made worse by stimulants and wanted to treat that first. But it's also good to get multiple opinions. I went to my current therapist for over a year before I starting seeing my psychiatrist for medication. I was also pregnant and then breastfeeding which caused some other issues - in addition to having raging post partum bipolar and depression. It's never one size fits all and is rarely as simple as it seems on the surface. Stick with it, though. And I think everyone should do this work along with therapy. It's really necessary bc the meds are not silver bullets. You still have to work hard even with medication.",

The other issue is that my work is fieldwork-based and in most cases you have very little idea what novel findings you'll get before you go. But of course the proposal comes first because the department says so. My proposal was \"I'm going to go to Place and look for Things 1-12 and write about whichever I can get data on from Theoretical Perspective X\". What ended up happening was I got a bit of data on all of them, and the best way to turn it into a dissertation is to analyze the whole pile as a comparative study. None of the data analysis can reasonably be done by anyone but me and little of it can be automated, also each Thing has its own literature and needs to be analyzed slightly differently. It's working and most of the feedback I've gotten is in the form of \"that's great keep doing that\" but I'm also 300 pages in with no end in sight. Oops!",

I'm sure it's very similar though.\n\nActually I just opened Zotero up again and it didn't suit what I wanted because I don't believe you can make notes, highlights or open the paper within the app - it would open the PDF in Adobe. I think it's just nicer to have it all in one place, particularly when searching for terms through all your papers.",

I never read eTOC etc. I hated journal clubs and never went. Whenever I need to learn something, I just dive into papers for a few hours. I found twitter helpful for getting me to \u201ckeep up\u201d. Again, I know I would be a better scientist if I read a paper a day...but it was just not for me, which is OK, I focused on building up other habits/skills.\n\n1b) Similarly, an amazing skill is writing a little each day. Again, never built that habit. Overall, it prob (def) slows down my productivity, but it makes my life so much less stressful not to have \u201cnot writing guilt\u201d. Instead, I try to force myself to make PowerPoint slide figures as early as possible... also as a PI, I purposely pursued lots of different projects... that forces me to periodically pick up and put down things (e.g. can\u2019t write a little about 5 different projects every day even if I tried). \n\nAim 2) distinguish fear/activation energy from \u201cjust not fitting your style\u201d. Unlike college, where it is possible to excel in many things... the value of graduate school is to excel in just one thing. It is OK to just not do something b/c it is not coming easily. \n\n2a) For example, I briefly tried to learn R (literally a week or two). I just didn\u2019t enjoy it/get it, so I stopped and it was fine..I just re-arranged by projects and collaborations around a lack of bioinformatics skill. Similarly, if you hate benchwork, don\u2019t fight it, just find a way to collaborate with a bench person or change the % of benchwork in your project. \n\n(Again, need to distinguish \u201cnot a good fit\u201d from \u201canxiety or activation energy to start anything new\u201d).",

However the person I picked was so hands off that it was impossible to get any guidance or help, and he worked from home so much that after about two and a half years of fruitless struggling, I basically gave up and just started working half days.... then quarter days... then I just left.

I don't mean quitting the program, I mean when to realize a research project is just unsalvageable; just cut it off and stop wasting time on something that you know won't work.\n\n4: Find a therapist BEFORE you're at the point when you really, really, really need one.

      "text": "My two cents:\n\n1. **Supervisor**. You have two options here: you can choose a supervisor who is highly recognized and with an excellent academic output, but you will struggle to be recognized for your own work. If I read a paper and see a 'big name' I don't really care who the first author is or the person that did all the work. A PhD is the start of your own (independent) academic career, not piggybacking on your supervisor's reputation. **That being said**, it will bite you in the back when you continue to pursue an academic career (postdoc, associate prof, etc), because suddenly everything is about who you know (grants, paper reviews) and if you don't have those connections or are too independent you'll have a hard time. I went for option 1 for my PhD and am very proud of my work because I pretty much did everything myself, but I switched to option 2 during my postdoc to secure more funding for more and better data/experiments. In all honesty, my PhD was three of the best years of my life because of my supervisor, but since my postdoc I have lost a great amount of passion for my research, even doubting whether I should stay in academia. \n2. **Research Topic**. This is a tricky one. I rejected a decently paid PhD offer (by my current postdoc host) when I graduated my Masters, because I wanted to follow my heart and work on something oversees that I was highly passionate about (with just enough 'salary' to survive in that particular country). I will never regret that choice. A PhD is a serious commitment (3-4 years) and if it is not your own thing or idea, you might struggle to finish. The problem here lies in the fact that (at least in my home country), competition for individual PhD fellowships is very fierce (requiring at least one publication, which is very very rare at Master's level) and many PhD students are 'put on' a project that the supervisor received funding for. Most PhD students in my current department are being paid by projects like this and they all take 5-6 years to finish their PhD (what should take 4 years). Referring back to (1), a PhD should be an individual achievement and if little freedom is given regarding the subject (e.g., decide which techniques or experiments etc), it can be a real struggle. Conclusion: if you can, do everything possible to come up with your own research project. \n3. Oh and (3). Try to stick to a **regular daily schedule**. It has been a few times in this thread. You can't keep up working long days and weekends for years, but most importantly: **It's not going to make a difference, honestly**. Take weekends off, build social relationships, spend time with family and dedicate some energy to a hobby to take your mind of the stress associated with a PhD / academic career.",

I went into my PhD for the wrong reasons, I started it because I felt like it was expected of me and not something that I actually wanted. When combined with a primary supervisor who was pretty intolerant of neurodiversity & who ignored the life part of the work/life balance, a secondary who was pretty absent while working on other things, and poor support from the department it was a pretty terrible environment. \n\nWhile I will remember fondly the two times I was able to present at conference and get published, along with the many hours I invested in teaching and lab demonstrating, the lingering effects the PhD has had on my mental health even now five years after dropping out during my thesis write up (UK PhD's are only three years, four if you take an extra for writeup) and several years of therapy are pretty severe. I was only able to start my new role as a game developer back in February after four and a half years of just surviving, and even doing it part time at 10 hours per week is thoroughly exhausting.",

      "text": "It is extremely difficult to answer this question because a lot depends on luck. I screened my potential supervisors, and tried to plan things as much as possible. However, in the end my PhD was made hard due to numerous artefacts in the signals I was measuring. I would advise to:\n\n- Choose which people to work with, rather than project topics. People are very important. Work with the best scientists and the nicest people. Do not work with idiots and assholes, and reject them directly.\n- Judge your potential supervisor carefully. Does he take care to plan your PhD project well? The success of a PhD is 90% design.\n- Ask grad students on their opinion for the supervisor. It's hard to get them to tell you the truth, though. Ask people who are leaving the group, as they don't have a motivation to lie.\n- Choose carefully whose project you're \"inheriting\". If the paper looks shit, then chances are you'll have to deal with garbage data and bad science. Also, avoid inheriting from students who publish too much and look too good to be true. If a grad student looks more like a salesman, and always looks excited about average-looking data, then avoid.\n- If possible, start your own research path during your PhD. This will prevent you from inheriting another student's garbage research, and will protect you from desperate final year loser grad students who may decide to jump on your research topic (it can happen).\n- Practice office politics and beware of your alliances. You will want to ally yourself with the good, hard-working people in the group, and for this purpose you will also want to behave well and be hard-working. No 9-5 bullshit. A PhD means you will live in the lab. Otherwise don't do research. You will want to know who in the lab is a good student, who is a loser, who is two-faced, who is the prof's favorite, who will put your name in a paper if you help him, who will invalidate your contribution and steal your ideas and so on...\n- This is from personal experience: Avoid supervisors with tons of Asian students. A good supervisor usually tries to keep a balance of students in his group. If he gets too many Asians, these tend to form a sub-group inside the group, and fight each other viciously for publications. Asians are weird, and are under tremendous pressure to succeed and look good. Most of them want to go back to their home country and hence have no qualms about screwing people over. This applies especially to Chinese. Most Japanese and South Koreans I've met were OK.",
