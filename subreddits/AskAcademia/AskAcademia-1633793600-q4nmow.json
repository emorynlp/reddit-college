  "text": "So I was in the office for a couple of days last week and didn't really enjoy it. I found the other students to be a bit cold and they didn't really chat much with me.\n\nI was thinking about how I can make myself seem like less of a stranger and less awkward? I'm terribly self conscious so I'm really worried about not making a good impression.\n\nWhat can I do to ease the anxiety of meeting new office mates?\n\n: I appreciate this is slightly off topic but I'm totally new to the PhD game",

      "text": "Two things I would suggest:\n\n1. Ask them about their studies, try to find common ground there. People love to talk about themselves and their work. And just be friendly and say hi to everyone.\n2. Some people will like you and be chatty and some won't like you or be friendly at all. You generally can't control that, so don't take it personally. \n\nFinally, my PhD department wasn't always a friendly environment. I made sure to have close friends outside of academia, but overall I put my head down and worked.",

      "text": "Universal: Humor, disarm yourself ie: don't try to impress anyone with your competency, rules 1 and 2, reflective listening\n\nI have a very cold job now with very cold people, it's the nature of the industry and I struggled with this, too. I had to realize you can't make everyone like you, and if people are cold and pissed off and you're cold and pissed off they're cold and pissed that they're frigid bitches don't hide it. Over time you'll build rapport, and sometimes  cold and pissed off is actually just guarded, and they can be great people that are even more insecure than you\n\nEdit: I was totally sober writing this abomination",

      "text": "I would give it time. One thing I've learnt over the years that when I'm tired and stressed I tend to be a bit stand offish with new people. It's partly because their unbridled enthusiasm can be exhausting, partly because some new people will latch on to the first person who speaks to them and insist on being their best friend, partly new people just need a degree of hand holding and helping that I don't always have time for and partly that I'm an introvert and when I'm tired finding the energy for new people I'm not directly responsible for is hard. It's not my greatest trait. \n\nSo I'd say play the long game, be nice and open and friendly, but don't push too hard. Look for opportunities to suggest going for coffee or even offer to buy coffee for people if you're getting one (don't make this a habit though as you'll get bled, academics are bastards when it comes to coffee). Once you've had a few shared experiences, like lab meeting or working on something together, you'll start to find more to talk about and the relationships will grow organically. Also you may find you don't like some of them and be grateful that you took time to make friends (and avoid others!).",
