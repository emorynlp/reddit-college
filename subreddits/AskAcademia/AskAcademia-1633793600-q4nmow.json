  "text": "So I was in the office for a couple of days last week and didn't really enjoy it. I found the other students to be a bit cold and they didn't really chat much with me.\n\nI was thinking about how I can make myself seem like less of a stranger and less awkward? I'm terribly self conscious so I'm really worried about not making a good impression.\n\nWhat can I do to ease the anxiety of meeting new office mates?\n\n: I appreciate this is slightly off topic but I'm totally new to the PhD game",

      "text": "Two things I would suggest:\n\n1. Ask them about their studies, try to find common ground there. People love to talk about themselves and their work. And just be friendly and say hi to everyone.\n2. Some people will like you and be chatty and some won't like you or be friendly at all. You generally can't control that, so don't take it personally. \n\nFinally, my PhD department wasn't always a friendly environment. I made sure to have close friends outside of academia, but overall I put my head down and worked.",

      "text": "Universal: Humor, disarm yourself ie: don't try to impress anyone with your competency, rules 1 and 2, reflective listening\n\nI have a very cold job now with very cold people, it's the nature of the industry and I struggled with this, too. I had to realize you can't make everyone like you, and if people are cold and pissed off and you're cold and pissed off they're cold and pissed that they're frigid bitches don't hide it. Over time you'll build rapport, and sometimes  cold and pissed off is actually just guarded, and they can be great people that are even more insecure than you\n\nEdit: I was totally sober writing this abomination",
