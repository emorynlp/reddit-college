So like if there was an organization - governmental, nonprofit, NGO, think tank, private - that needed philosophers to do philosophical reach in a similar manner or style as they are trained to do it in graduate school.\n\nThere are *some* of those kinds of jobs. Think tanks, nonprofits (especially museums and other public educational organizations), and NGOs may hire philosophers to do work that is similar to (or at least adjacent to) academic/research philosophy. Healthcare organizations may have medical ethicists/bioethicists on staff. Some private companies, especially tech companies, also have ethicists to help them make decisions about cutting-edge technology.\n\nBut there's certainly not a large market for these kinds of things or predictable places to look as there would be in other fields for people with PhDs (engineering, economics, psychology, education, nursing).",

You say \"If this sounds like something you would want, by all means do it\" after only listing negatives.\n\nI agree that it's important to be informed of people's experiences, but I'm continually surprised by how everyone online is always talking about academia so negatively. Whenever someone encourages it, it's often just like this; \"if you love all these bad things, go for it!\"\n\nNobody in my real life circles seem so adamant, even if the standard complaints of pay or bureaucracy still exist. It makes me wonder if it's a US-thing, or is this narrative global? I know the relationships between degrees, people and universities vary a lot, but then again academic jobs often require relocation, so I can imagine that the narrative is global and I just get more exposed to it online.\n\nIt's extremely interesting.

                      "text": "I'm in the U.S., but I feel like a lot of people online are combating what they heard, and they know or suspect others are hearing, in person from people within academia. It's unclear to me whether the market really changed so rapidly in a generation or whether there's just massive survivorship bias, but many professors will blithely encourage their best students to get a PhD in their field simply because they are smart and talented, and *will not* warn them or even talk about the job market crunch.\n\nIn my undergraduate training program (explicitly for students with goals of getting a PhD), we talked a lot about the competitive process of PhD admissions and the rosy parts of what the career of a researcher was like. I saw beautiful gleaming R1 labs and heard from happy, well-paid professors at top universities. We *never* talked about the tightness of the academic market. When I did my PhD at a well-reputed program in my field, the prevailing messaging seemed to be \"well you're getting your PhD from here, so of course you'll get a job\" even from the younger assistant professors who had *just* been through the process, though that wasn't true in my field and hadn't been for decades.\n\nA lot of the time, I assume when I'm commenting that those asking the question have never heard the negative side and already have their head in the clouds dreaming about their ivory tower life (because I certainly was), and I imagine that a lot of people in this sub and others like it feel that way too (because they probably were as well). So the goal of presenting the negatives is balancing the story as much as it is dissuading people from going.\n\n\\*\n\nHowever, if I had to present the positives, I can immediately think of many. The flexibility is unparalleled, both on a small scale (I can go to the bank on a Tuesday at 11 am! I still miss that!) and a large scale (I can pivot what I am concentrating on or follow an interesting thread down a rabbit hole - and I am *supposed* to do that. Even as a researcher in industry, I don't have time or resources to do that all the time). You spend many years in focused, intense, deep study of things that are intensely interesting to you, and there's a sublime sort of joy in that.\n\nI love writing, and I really enjoyed writing my dissertation: the combination of discovering new knowledge, teaching myself things as I went along, constantly making little mini-discoveries and connections independently, and getting to write voluminously made it a pretty blissful year for me. And I completely controlled my own writing schedule (and was on fellowship, so I didn't have to teach - I did 10 hours of stats consulting for undergraduates writing their thesis at the library, and that was it, and that was actually fun). I also love to read, and I got to read a lot. I enjoyed studying for my comprehensive exams, as I read widely and deeply in a lot of areas - some were new and I learned new things; some were familiar, but I deepened my understanding.\n\nThere's the access to resources and materials - I still miss my library access to look up any damn thing I want just because it's interesting, and the access to academic texts and manuals when you wanted to learn something new was amazing. (Now I have to *buy* them! And *wait* for them, rather than walking to the library RIGHT NOW to go get a book I *must have for science*). And the access to other scholars in varying stages of their own careers, in various fields related to yours and not, in your department and others, even other universities in the same city - the vibrancy of belonging to a field of scholars exchanging knowledge freely is wonderful. I work in industry now, and although my field is a relatively vibrant one, exchanging knowledge is done cautiously and with lots of lawyers involved because here, IP is attached to money. It's not as simple as emailing a scholar for a preprint. The university itself is an environment made for the flourishing of ideas and the deep study and attention to them - all ideas, many ideas, interesting and different ideas. There's really no other environment that's like that. Even when I was living in a place I really didn't want to stay long-term, the university still held a sense of scholarly life or essence to it.",

                          "text": "Thank you for the exhaustive answer!\n\nI suppose my surprise of the leading narrative mirrors my perspective. I come from a low income family and I am the first in my family to get a higher education.\n\nEspecially due to my area of study (humanities), I've had to listen to a varying degree of discouraging comments from my friends and family up until actually applying and getting into university, after which it steadily decreased. \n\nI very much lived in a bubble of hearing about how I will end up working at the store counter or in a coffee shop. These were all people who went to a vocational school and pursued a career as early as possible.\n\nTo me it was a feeling of unparalleled freedom when I entered the academic environment. The government assistance in my country (nordics) ensured my survival and universities seemed interested to pay me and encourage a career in academia, even in the humanities. I felt like I could be proud of myself and my interests for the first time.  \n\nBut perhaps this is exactly the trap you were talking about. The encouraging atmosphere without talk of the negatives. I guess the negatives brought up by my non-academic social circles were demeaning enough for me to dismiss them completely after getting into academia and a more balanced narrative would be welcome.\n\nOf course we need to draw a line between anti-academic discourse and anti-PhD-discourse. I'm sure my (for example) family would find a doctorate more impressive and desirable than just going to university in the first place. Perhaps I can see the place for this sort of talk when it comes to PhD's, as after entering university there is a certain pressure to continue it as far as you can if you don't have a clear industry path in mind.",

Deadlines are so long that they don't really exist, except for the one looming deadline for your entire dissertation that is too big to really fathom. Feedback, even well-intentioned, is mostly negative, and will give you the feeling that the work you're doing is never really done. You're constantly surrounded by people that are almost universally smarter than you are and you're constantly reminded of all the stuff you don't know, which leads to imposter syndrome. Also: It will always take longer than you initially plan for, and the academic job market is horrible: Our last vacancy drew 250 serious applicants, out of which about 100 could easily be qualified to do a stellar job.\n\nStill people, myself included, are drawn to academia. Why? For me: Because I love my field of study. This love feels so deeply engrained in me that getting a PhD was a logical step for me. I actually worked at the federal government of the Netherlands for a while, and I had a blast there, but academia never really left my heart. And you need this type of love to get through the frustrating days, which can easily turn into frustrating weeks or months.\n\nSo: For me a PhD is kind of like having kids: It's a great thing, and you know deep in your heart whether you want this or not. But: It's incredibly taxing, and I never want to be the person to advise anyone to either obtain a PhD or have kids, because if you're on the fence, it's highly likely that you should decide against it.",

There are some exceptions of course, but usually they involve technical skills not learned in a Philosophy program. So you are trading in time, money, and effort for essentially 0 upside except satisfying your own curiosity. I'm not saying don't do it, but perhaps figure out whether a PhD is necessary or even common for the jobs you care about. My best guess is that it won't be necessary.

How much generational wealth do you have? These are factors that should really matter.\n\nMy fiance has a JD and is mostly done with her dissertation, just waiting for funding to dry up as she job hunts to defend. She pretty soundly regrets the phd except for the fact that it has qualified her to teach--what she actually loves.

They assume that's what they would do if they were poor, because their worldview and approach to money and security is totally different. (I say none of this to be judgmental: I also can't understand what it's like to grow up wealthy because I didn't, so I can only make assumptions based on what I've heard, through the lens of my own experience.)\n\nAlso having grown up poor, I am acutely aware of the experience of having no safety net to fall back to - I always knew that returning to live at home was not an option for me, and that I would be more likely to be sending money to my relatives to support them than the other way 'round. But there are as many different reactions to those kinds of constraints as there are people. Some still dream and strive for the rare even if they know the chances are slim - you know how many aspiring NBA players and rappers there are in the hood? Some go for something practical while spending their free waking hours working on their other dream to make it take off.\n\nYes, it changes how we make decisions and think about the future - and yes, being able to pursue a PhD is definitely a privilege. But viewing PhD experience as valuable - and not valuing 401(K) match opportunities over the opportunity to learn and grow in a different, focused way - isn't necessarily just a stance of the rich.\n\n(Also, not to generalize, but a lot of poor people aren't thinking about retirement savings as an opportunity cost anyway...because a lot of poor people never really expect to retire. Many of the jobs that our parents, adult relatives and other loved adults do don't have the kind of retirement savings that would enable them to live without working for 20-30 years. I always mention 401(K) match when I talk about opportunity costs *now* precisely because I had no idea what a 401(K) even was, or how much compound interest made a difference, before I got my first job after graduate school in my late 20s.\\_",

It's only an opportunity cost if there's something else I could be doing to better further my life goals.  But my life goal, at the moment at least, is to get a PhD.  There's no opportunity cost.  There's nothing I'd rather be doing at the moment and nothing else that could fulfil my goal.\n\nSecondly, I've done lots of jobs in my life, including run my own business.  I came to academia later in life, I'm 39 (gasp).  I've done lots of different jobs and been lots of different places.   One of the things I've managed to learn in my life is that there's many different ways of doing it, and those people who tell you that there isn't, that you need to have a plan, are really coming from a place of insecurity in their own situation and lives.  You do you, but you don't need to talk others out of following their passions and interests just because you need certainty and direction in your own life.\n\nObviously there's lots that needs to be weighed up when deciding to take on something like a PhD.  What do I want to do it for?  Will it help me achieve my goals?  What are my goals?  These are all questions that someone should be asking before undertaking one.

It's not naive - it's just different, valuing different things.\n\nA PhD isn't totally *meaningless* in and of itself. First, there's value in the skills that you learn: both useful technical skills (and I use \"technical\" in the traditional sense of \"how to do something\" - so not just engineering or coding, but writing, public speaking, specific analytic approaches and tools, reading languages, artistic skills and approaches etc.) as well as useful skills and attributes often called \"soft skills\" (critical thinking, interpreting and synthesizing large amounts of information, communication, patience, project management). There's worth in that.\n\nThere's also the subjective value placed on being able to devote a time in your life to get paid to answer the questions that you're most passionate about. There's real value in that. The actual content of what I studied during my PhD was meaningful and helps me understand the world around me today, even in places that seem far afield of what my dissertation was on. I'm a different person because of the time I spent doing my PhD, different in a way that wouldn't have been achieved had I spent six years doing something else, and that's valuable to me. That value is subjective - it can't be expressed in a dollar amount - but that doesn't mean it's nonexistent.\n\nFor some people, those pieces and others may make the PhD worth the opportunity cost, depending on their personal situation. And that's the key: it really is a personal situation. For some, even having the chance to shoot for the moon and be a professor is worth the effort. For some, the outcome doesn't matter as much as the process. There are lots of other things that people delay starting work for: traveling the world, joining the Peace Corps, teaching abroad, volunteering. Doing a PhD isn't necessarily less worthy or valuable than those kinds of experiences.",

I had a triple major of Phil/Soc/Psych because I was interested in learning, and  understanding why we do what we do as a people and as individuals. I got sidetracked by becoming a parent but I still wasn't sure what path I was going to take next. After taking a few years off I went back and got my Computer Science degree. The logic and analytic reasoning studies in Philosophy made that jump very easy. I found a background in humanities instead of science offered me a unique perspective and has offered me work opportunities I never could have done without that background. One of those opportunities even brought me to your beautiful city of Buenos Aires during an extended trip through S. America.",

Late one night at work doing data analysis on the PC I realized computer work came fairly natural to me. I started fiddling around with programming, went to a year long course in programming from Control Data, and was able to get an entry level position in an engineering company. I knew I'd need my degree to advance so over the next 2 years I went to night school to get the requirements for the degree. I graduated with about 40 more credits than I needed from switching majors in my 3rd year.  \nI was fairly quickly contracted to one of the big 3 Auto companies and have been there in a variety of roles for over 30 years. One of those roles had me training people in the factories. Over about 15 years I visited most of our manufacturing sites around the world. Antarctica is the only continent I haven't been to.  \nI've also been a DBA, prior to being the trainer I was part of the team traveling to plants to configure new hardware and software, and I'm finishing my career in a factory as a general IT engineer. For the most part, I put out fires all day now for the applications I installed and trained for a decade or so.",

      "text": "I would say that you should explore the reasons you want to have and/or do a PhD in philosophy. If the answer is \"because I want a sustained period of research into philosophy in a specific area,\" then I'd say - that's a good reason, *but* you also would need to have eyes wide open that the PhD is unlikely to increase your job prospects for anything outside of academia. In other words, if you are fine with the idea of spending 6-8 years getting paid around $25-35K to study philosophy for a while, and then change your career to something else completely after that...well, it's not a bad idea at that point.\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but I'd compare it to teaching abroad or joining the Peace Corps for a few years: you do something that you enjoy and that is meaningful to you; it may not help you get a job in whatever area you end up in later, but the experience may be personally enriching and you may \"use\" the knowledge later, although almost certainly not in any direct sense. (Learning to think logically and critically, to write, to synthesize and distill large amounts of information, and to clearly communicate your thoughts to others are useful regardless of what you do.) You also have the opportunity cost of earning real money during those years and the experience you could be earning in the field/specialty of your later choice, which is not insignificant.\n\nIf the answer is \"because I believe the credential itself would be enjoyable to have,\" then I'd say don't get a PhD. IMO, it's not worth said opportunity cost, and the benefits that such a degree confers are minimal and usually far afield from what people imagined they'd be before starting. (I've heard a lot of people tell me half-jokingly that they want to be called \"doctor\"; I can assure you it doesn't happen often outside of academia.)",

I've had classes where attendance wasn't mandatory- and ended up passing, despite only showing up for the first class, midterm, and final. And, in almost every college class I ever took, the assigned textbooks were available for free (to the student, anyway) in multiple libraries.   \n\n\nNow, I only have master's degrees. I don't have a Ph.d. That said, I'm thinking about getting one and have done a fair amount of research- which almost anyone can do online. And every single video I've seen- from actual Ph.d. students- is that getting along with your adviser is the biggest obstacle.   \n\n\nSo, do what makes you happy. If you really like philosophy, get your Ph.d. Show up in a tie-die shirt, if it's allowed. If it's not, wear the tie-die shirt under your jacket.   \n\n\nI graded students at 3 a.m. while listening to T.I. So, if that's any indication...",

You don't necessarily have to \"be an academic,\" to pursue a Ph.D. You just have to be able to get along with your colleagues and adviser, and submit consistently good deliverables as needed.   \n\n\nPhilosophy is one of those things that's universal. It's powerful in its myriad applications. And, from my own experiences, I've known more than a few people who have used philosophy classes/tutors as supplements to their LSAT preparations. So, if you took the LSAT once- even if you didn't want to go to law school- and scored pretty much anything over 170, I'd say a philosophy doctorate would be more than enough to start asking for 300+ an hour to help people with their LSAT struggles. That sort of thing might not make you happy directly, but being able to take crazy vacations and buy plenty of whatever snacks you like... Well, my philosophy is, money can buy happiness. And, if it can't, go buy some literal dopamine and take a hit.   \n\n\nIn much of the western world, as far as I am aware, pretty much any Ph.D. entitles one to smugly remind everyone that you have an official title of distinction. If you want- which is fine, if you don't. It's probably better if that's lower on your priority list. A Ph.D. can get you pretty fair job security, and leave you in a position where you're odds of unemployment would be virtually zilch. A Ph.D. in philosophy \\*might\\* only have a ceiling of 75k a year, but 75k in most of the country isn't all that shabby. You can buy a house, leverage it to get a second house, then AirBnB that out. Invest a little, maybe.   \n\n\nNow, if you want to be happy, well, in all honesty, a degree- or lack thereof- won't solve your problems. You're restless for a reason. You're hesitant for a reason. You have unfulfilled needs. Happiness is a much a quest as it is a present state of being. Or we're all simply floating through the Matrix. Who knows? (Can they know? What is knowledge?)   \n\n\nGood luck.",

The only instances where a Ph.D. isn't *the barest of minimums* for becoming a professor is in areas like creative writing, where the highest possible degree might be a MFA.
