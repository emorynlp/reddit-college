Shot over three years' time in the molecular biology laboratory of Dr. Lawrence Shapiro of the Columbia University Medical Center, the film chronicles how the tool of X-ray crystallography enables the discovery of the workings of the AMPK protein molecule, revealing a new path towards the treatment of diabetes and obesity.

It literally has a professor and his grad student as part of the cast, but, beyond the obvious - it's about a group of underpaid and overworked individuals being sent on dangerous missions by their tyrannical PI who should've retired 100 years ago. There's storylines about academic rivalries, what it means to go from academia to industry, and weird scientific discoveries. Of course, as it's fiction, it's interspersed with random bouts of saving the world with physics - but that's the only inaccurate part.",

Just to confirm, it's accurate in the way that Scrubs is accurate to the medicos, yes? i.e the characters and plots are exaggerated/caricatures but it captures the spirit of what doctors go through. Asking because in my part of the world, academia is quite different to what's portrayed in The Chair and often I go like \"really, *these* shenanigans are what actually happens in US academics?\"",

I would say for example that it's not *terribly* common for a professor to set off alarms by burning their teaching evals - but I'm sure an awful lot of professors would *really, really* like to.\n\nUltimately it is for entertainment which means it is not going to be \"accurate\" in being true to life as it is lived, because life as it is lived makes for boring television. But I do feel like The Chair is \"accurate\" in the sense that the inspiration is clearly (at least to me) drawn from the actual stories and experiences of academia rather than a made-up, Marvel-Movie public conception of what academia is like.",

And there are a few things that may not ring true based on your corner of academia. At least in my experience, most people don't view becoming chair as a crowning achievement. (My doctoral advisor was chair of the department during my graduate education; he set a timer on the day he became chair that counted down the hours until he wasn't chair anymore.) Chairs also aren't always elected.\n\nHowever, those are pretty minor, and most academics seem to think it's a relatively accurate portrayal.",

She had a likable elder woman professor that was getting complaints from students that she had to guide to retirement.

And she had a constant fight over a professorship that was supposed to be named by the faculty, but the administration kept mucking with it. \n\nI only made it through the first couple of episodes, so I don't know how it ended, but I was just really uncomfortable the entire time.
