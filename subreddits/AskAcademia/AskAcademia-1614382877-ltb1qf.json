  "title:": "Virtual Study Zoom for learners who need accountability and productivity",
  "text": "Hi learners,\n\nMy name is Mei Mei, a 2nd-year PhD student at ASU. I don't know if you have ever felt lonely and low motivated when studying alone at home because you can't go to a library or coffee shop as liberal as pre-Covid. I know I have.\n\nI tried to watch study with me videos on YT, but I just feel it is lacking something\\~like, I am still alone by just watching... So, I am creating a virtual study zoom. You can join and study with others TOGETHER. You are watching and watched. Sounds creepy, but you got it, you are participating in it\\~  No obligations, you can choose to come/leave whenever you want to, and there will always be people there (hopefully soon, now it is just me, lol)\\~ no fee or talking or rules needed\\~ just show up and dedicate to your own work during that time. **Oh\\~Just one rule: MUTE yourself, please.**\n\nIt is a recurring meeting without a waiting room, which means you can join even if I am not there, and whenever you want to. Grab your own drink/coffee/snack, let's hold each other accountable, and get some work done :)\n\n~~Zoom link:~~ [~~https://asu.zoom.us/j/82954351559?pwd=TlRNNW1rZVFRREd4UlY3bURKejdmUT09~~](https://asu.zoom.us/j/82954351559?pwd=TlRNNW1rZVFRREd4UlY3bURKejdmUT09) (**Not available anymore**)\n\n~~Password: studybuddy~~\n\nEdit:  First off, I want to thank everyone who comments and joins. The idea behind this **Virtual Study Zoom** is a 24/7 virtual coffee shop (no fee or talking or rules needed)\\~ It is up to you to come/work/leave at any time, and there will always be people there. Hopefully, this zoom can grow bigger, so whenever you join, it will always have people studying/working there\\~ Even if there is nobody when you join, I hope this zoom can be a cue for you to focus on your tasks. Sometimes, you might be the only person sitting in a coffee shop, right?  When you click on \"join the meeting\", hope the camera helps get you into the studying/working zone quickly and effectively. Thanks!\n\n*NOTE: Don't send or click anything in the chat.  Please send me a message if you notice a sketchy person. I'll try my best to keep this zoom safe and clean.*\n\n**2nd Edit:  Thanks to everyone who has joined Virtual Study Zoom, but I closed it due to bad people infiltration.  I am now working on developing an app that focuses on bringing people virtually together to study/work/ in the safest way. I really appreciated your participation. and I will keep everyone updated with the app development in the near future. Here are a similar Zoom shared with me:**\n\n**Zoom id 965 9670 4442, Password 839150**",

We had lunch parties of 10+ regularly. As a professor now, I miss those days fondly, although I never appreciated them back then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that the vaccine has things back to \"normal\" next year. You are doing the right thing trying to stay productive and sane, because it is easy to lose your edge under these circumstances. Also, as you know, the market is a little messy now, with university budgets being hit by massive losses. Lets all hope that clears up soon too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the best",

Someone also mentioned focusmate and I just checked it\\~ But it is a reservation-based method\\~ I am assuming that someone might just want to join in it on a whim\\~I don't want people to feel obligated or pressured or something like that\\~ My vision of this virtual study zoom is like a virtual coffee shop kinda thing\\~ You can choose to come/leave whenever you want to, and there will always be people there (hopefully soon, now it is just me, lol)\\~ no fee or talking or rules needed\\~ but when you do join in, and see others studying/working, hope it helps you get in that zone quicky and effectively\\~",
