      "text": "I don't know about depression, but I have experienced myself and observed many others who struggle with motivation once you reach a goal and come out on the other side. We jump through hoops and after each hoop, I think it is quite common to be slightly at a loss on the other side. \n\nPsychologically, I guess this has a lot to do with how extrinsically we allow ourselves to be motivated when we work hard. You got accepted to a PhD program, check. You got your PhD, check. You got a TT, check. You got tenured and promoted, check. After each step, we may ask ourselves, \"what was the point?\", and \"in relation to the work, time, and hardship it took, was it worth it? How are things really better now?\"\n\nIt may be easier said than done, but if we let ourselves stay motivated by the things we enjoy more than \"hoops\", we can stay afloat much longer.",

You're largely on your own, and for a large part of your career you're a employee yet are treated as some kind of student+1.\n\nIt's been a tough couple of years since covid hit. From what little context you shared, sounds like you might be a little depressed. Don't be alarmed, it happens to us all. Seek help, and fall back on friends. Good luck!",

      "text": "I think it's pretty normal, ebbs and flows of not just academic life but life in general.  It probably does have to do somewhat with season, diet, etc., as others have suggested, maybe even hormones, burn-out, morale due to things going on, etc. But I don't think anyone feels like they are performing at peak levels all the time. Rather it's a series of peaks and valleys. I wouldn't say it's depression until you aren't even eking out the bare minimum and don't even care. I find when I get to the point where you are now I usually course- correct.  Might help to change up your routine a bit or get involved in a professional or personal project that gives you inspiration. Think of things that have energized you in the past, and pursue one of those again.",

I have been experiencing seasonal affective disorder like nobody's business. I never have it this bad this time of year. \n\nBut as others are saying, you need a professional to give you an accurate diagnosis. This is critical because your symptoms could be caused by major depressive disorder OR something else entirely that needs different treatment. Seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, vitamin deficiencies, etc for example. They know the questions to ask you to figure out what is going on.",

As we sometimes forget to get enough rest and eat properly when I feel energized/motivated to get things done and that always comes back to affect me a short while after. It could also be a sign of depression or some sort of hormonal imbalances so I wouldn't rule that out completely.",
