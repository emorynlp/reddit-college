      "text": "I get your point about things that never worked out, some of my greatest strengths are from learning through tough experiences, but people recruiting are looking for concrete things they can use to assess an application. \"I dropped out but learned valuable experience\" is very hard for a person who doesn't know you and only has your CV to judge you on. Also I'm afraid \"I got in\" doesn't count for much and I don't even understand point you're trying to make when you say the grass isn't greener. Most people know it's ok to change direction when something's not working out but in itself changing because you effectively had to change doesn't help someone understand why they should recruit you. \n\nYou can frame some of these things as strengths in you CV for sure but the way you're presenting it here isn't going to work. Philosophical arguments about your personal values with respect to failure and changing direction don't give the person recruiting you anything material to say you can do this role. The professional world is full of people who love to throw around buzzwords and mantras about failure and management styles etc and some of them will inevitably make it through but at the end of the day for most of us results are what get you hired and keeps you in the job.\n\nPersonally I would note you started the degree in order to account for that period, note some key achievements and then in your cover letter briefly address that the degree didn't work out and explain why you're applying now and what you're going to do differently to ensure you don't fail again. That is until you get your PhD and then it won't matter. Include it in your CV but you won't need to address it unless asked about it.",

In my mind, focussing on the PhD you didn't complete a bajillion years ago in a job application would be weird and imply that you're really not over having transferred.",

While perhaps an interesting talking point, it doesn't really strengthen your CV is a tangible way and has the potential to backfire.

      "text": "The only valid reasons for you to do that would be iii) to fill a time gap. Nobody cares about the rest and it is absolutely not a guarantee that they will come to the same conclusion as you. I agree with others, it would do the opposite effect of what you think it's going to do. It will raise bad questions and assumptions of failure which are red flags for recruiters.  It really won't have the end goal you want.  *You* know what happened to make you leave that PhD, but strangers looking at your resume don't. Keep that in mind.\n\nIf this PhD leaves a significant time gap in your CV (\\*like over a year), then yes you should try to find a way to include it that won't make people jump to bad conclusions. After you graduate from your current PhD program and gain enough work experience in your field to overcome that gap, stop including it.  Otherwise, it's not worth including and only talk about it if you are asked to explain the gap during a job interview. \n\nIf that's the case (\\*), I would recommend including it as others said by listing your achievements and maybe giving it another name. I like the suggestion someone else made to call it a research assistantship or teaching assistantship instead of a PhD studentship/position. That would work if a new PhD student or postdoc took on your research at your previous university from where you left it. Maybe email your previous PhD supervisor to ask if they would be ok with you using a different position title in your resume for the sake of providing corresponding references if needed. If they refuse, could you make it look like a school transfer (if that's what you did, meaning continued your thesis at a new university)? If not then I am not sure how you could include it... but saying ''discontinued'' won't look good IMO.",

I am not at all ashamed by my alma mater, I am very proud of them and I display their name clearly for the degrees they awarded. I even got some significant awards and a large fellowship for it, but listing that university for the PhD I never completed would only raise more questions and none of those would be good ones.\n\nIn reality, I left because I got a better offer somewhere else, my PI approved of the move (he did the exact same), and it had all been pre-planned. But to an external observer, it would only look like failure. The **only** reasons I could have left were failure (to choose the right programme *or* to complete) or interpersonal problems and they don't want anything to do with either case. \n\nYour CV is a curated space to show your successes. It is not a comprehensive list of everything you've done and it shouldn't be. You should not include things that make you look bad. A potential employer is going to naturally *assume* there are failures or changes that you have not included in your CV. If you actually list them then what you're saying is that you have so few successes that failure is the best thing you have. Or that you're dangerously naive.\n\nEdit: You may include the first PhD and frame it as a transfer to somewhere else if you had >2ish years in it, but it should be mentioned only in minimal passing and not given more weight. You left and so it is inconsequential. If they ask in interviews, be brief about your reasons for leaving and don't get philosophical. Focus on things you've actually done, not what you chose to *not* do.",
