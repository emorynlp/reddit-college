  "text": "Hi all! I think this is the right sub for this question- if not please let me know! Long time part of this sub and it has been so very helpful over the years.\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep this short: as the title says, I recently finished my PhD in biomedical sciences (yay!) and am looking to the next steps. Most of grad school had me pretty confused about what I wanted to do with my life, but in the last year or so I had settled on staying in academia - doing a postdoc and all that. \nAfter I defended, I had feelings of deflation and basically a fog when it came to lab. I\u2019ve since overcome most of this; I\u2019m back to being productive in lab again and that part of the burnout has passed. What hasn\u2019t passed though is my questioning of my career. I no longer feel particularly attached to academia and really don\u2019t have any desire to be in the lab these days (although I still do it). I also can\u2019t seem to focus on applying for postdocs and the idea of doing this for the foreseeable future makes me miserable. What I can\u2019t decide is if this is a red flag of pursuing academia in general or if I\u2019m still battling a post-PhD burnout. \nI recognize that a postdoc is a good next step even if I don\u2019t plan on staying in academia; it may just be that I need more time to get through this burnout stage (and maybe a vacation \ud83d\ude05). But I also don\u2019t want to waste more time doing something I\u2019m unhappy with if I don\u2019t have to. \nHas anyone else experienced something like this at some point? Any advice on navigating the post-PhD world and how to decide if academia is the right choice?\n\n\nEdit: thank you all for the thoughtful responses! They are certainly helpful. Unanimously it seems I certainly need a vacation first ;)",

Now a few thoughts based on your post:\n\n* I'm just a step ahead of you career-wise (post-doc applying for faculty positions), so take this with a grain of salt.\n* Yes, you should definitely take a vacation!\n* Have you taught? Do you enjoy teaching?\n* Have you considered what type of academic environment you'd like to work in (teaching heavy vs. research heavy)?\n\nI think that my post-doc experience has helped me to answer some of the same questions you're asking yourself. I hope it'll be the same for you!",

      "text": "I, too, am in the same boat more or less, but this is now my second year on the academic job market and things are feeling pretty bleak. Last year I had one campus interview at an R2 where I narrowly lost out to another candidate, and one Skype interview at an R1 for which I did not make the short list. This year, nothing, despite having taken on a course a semester as a lecturer, getting a decent intramural grant as a PI, and publishing a ton. Make no mistake, the market is brutal, even if you are 100% committed to academia. If you are having doubts now, you might use your time as a postdoc to start exploring other paths, particularly in industry, which can offer a lot of different benefits depending on where you land. \n\nQuestions you absolutely must consider if you are planning to continue an academic path include, What does your path to independence as a researcher look like for the next 5, 10, 15 years? What is your path to tenure? What funding will you apply for and what support will you be able to gain if that funding doesn't come through very quickly? What kind of an institution do you see yourself in *realistically*? and how will you balance the first competitive years as junior faculty?\n\nIf you're like me, you might have realized that the idea of grinding hard at establishing a lab while potentially taking on a sizeable teaching load in addition to service and mentorship requirements sounds an awful lot like having three concurrent full-time jobs, which just sounds like a recipe for misery. I dunno about you, but if I'm burned out now, the life of junior TT faculty sounds like a living nightmare. Plus, I have a family to worry about. If that hadn't happened by luck or accident, there never would have been a good time for it, but now it's very much a reality I have to contend with.\n\nI don't know if \"time off\" is really a thing, as I had about 2 weeks between my PhD defense and the start of my postdoc. For me, the postdoc itself has been a critical time to explore what other alternative pathways might be out there. Your institution probably has good resources for postdocs navigating career transition, so I've attended all kinds of career workshops. I've watched people move in different directions, into biotech, consulting, publishing, patent law, nonprofits, sci comm, policy...all sorts of things. It's nice to talk to people who have left academia successfully at every stage in the game, and to realize that the one narrowly defined path your PIs have set you on is not necessarily for everyone. For now, explore your options and start thinking more critically about the path your life is taking, and if it's actually making you happy.",

I enjoyed teaching and I was doing labs with the students so I still had some hands-on stuff I was doing.  \n\nStarting about my 3rd year of teaching I missed \"real science.\"  I miss being a part of research and talking with other scientists.  Right now I never get a chance to talk to someone who knows as much or more than me about biology.  I only talk to students who barely know what a nucleus is and colleagues in other disciplines. I've started volunteering in my old lab during the summer just being their lab monkey processing samples because I missed the lab.  \n\nOf course everyone is different, and you may love a different career, but you also might just need a break.",

      "text": "I'm almost at the end of my PhD and went through a terrible burn out phase starting a couple years ago. I had started with an 'academia or bust' attitude, but slowly realized that while I love the lab, there were other considerations that made academia a non-viable choice for me. It took me a good while to find a career that I'm very excited about. And once the decision was made, I've felt happier every single day. This is how I know I made the right choice.\n\nThe first decision is 'academia or not'. Make a full list of pros and cons and don't leave anything out - FYI money was a huge consideration for me. A large part of what kept me in limbo was 'if not academia,then what?!'. Don't fall into this trap. You _will_ find something. No other options is a bad reason to stay. Stay with your \"decision\" for a couple weeks. See how you feel everyday. Relief? Fear? This will give you a clue as to what feels right for you. Once you are committed to your choice then you can look further. \n\nDon't do a post-doc as a stop-gap. Do it with clear intention to gain some career capital. I doubt you will have more clarity as a post-doc than as a recently minted PhD,  so make the choice now. \n\nI went through a slight identity crisis when I decided to leave academia, but I reframed it as ' I love solving puzzles and learning new things'. This can be true anywhere you choose.",

      "text": "I was totally lost and burnt out post PhD so it\u2019s definitely not uncommon to feel that way. I always find you have to make important life decisions when you\u2019re at your busiest/ most stressed i.e. you\u2019re meant to decide what you want to do post PhD while still writing a thesis! It honestly took me about 18 months to feel like a normal human being again post submission and not feel guilty for not working at weekends etc.. \n\nI rushed into a job in industry and started a week after submitting. I was pretty miserable for about a year. I got lucky in that the job itself was not taxing and it gave me a break from the pace of 5th year PhD lab work. It was a good experience but I ended up leaving as I just didn\u2019t enjoy it enough and moved abroad for a post doc. I did take 2 months off once I\u2019d secured the post doc and was waiting for my visa.\n\nI would highly recommend you take some time off! Getting a PhD is a very taxing experience emotionally and physically. You need time to unwind! Then I would pursue what interests you/ what you think you might like to do. Make as informed a decision as possible by talking to people in the field and asking for informational interviews or seek out career guidance. You basically need to choose what the best decision is for you at that moment in time. Also bear in mind your needs and wants will change over time depending on you circumstances (significant other, family, parents etc..)\n\nWishing you the best of luck with your decision!",

If you become a professor you won't have to do lab work.\n\n2. It's common for postdocs to be a time for people to pick up a new skill.  That might be one way to get out of your current lab lifestyle.  If you used to work in a wet lab, you might be interested in microscopy or computational work.\n\n3. There are a lot of cool industry jobs.  Look around, apply to some.  Interview.  See what they tell you when you interview.  Half of the interview process is usually them telling you what the job is like or you asking them questions about it.  Some of them will probably be really interesting.  Some will fill you with dread.\n\nGood luck :)",

So, you're left with either (1) applying for further funding, and surfing from project to project, which is incredibly stressful due to uncertainty (especially if you are raising a family), (2) hoping to get tenure at some point. Both of these involve a resume-driven rat-race. There is no incentive to \"just do research and be good at it\", as you're constantly faced with the uncertainty of not having a permanent position. You're basically selling yourself and networking. On the upside, you get a chance to actually continue building your scientific resume and making a decent pay, which is great while you're exploring options outside of academia and buys time to find out what you want to do.",
