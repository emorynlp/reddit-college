So his situation does not really apply to all academics in all disciplines.",

I love teaching, mentoring students, and exploring research problems I'm interested in.  I love the freedom and the ability to set my own hours.\n\nThat said there's a lot that's a grind in academia especially\n\n1) Dealing with university related bureaucratic nonsense, especially budgetary compliance, time reporting compliance, etc.  A bunch of that stuff takes up way more time in my week than actual science.  I've been dealing with a bunch of budgetary stuff that has become a mess due to COVID and it is eating up a lot of my time.\n\n2) Dealing with various compromises between competing goals with the university...sometimes you have to deal with university level initiatives, larger programmatic goals, etc. that affects how you need to teach your classes.  For example, sometimes the college puts pressure to pass X% of students per year in general chemistry to improve first year retention rates especially of first generation students.  You are put in a hard place between effectively dumbing down the curriculum so more students pass and not hitting the topics they need for upper division classes.  Since in our state a lot of students come in with inadequate math skills to perform in general chemistry but still want to be pre-med, etc. this causes tensions and pedagogical compromises that are pragmatic beyond high minded ideas of education.  Working within these competing goals is part of the job.\n\n3) There's a lot of complex politics surrounding lab space usage, etc. with your colleagues and some colleagues can be a total pain in the ass.\n\n4) Managing people is hard, and we have no formal training in it.  It's hard to strike the right balance of freedom and micromanagement for my grad students and postdoc.\n\n5) I don't always get to research \\*exactly\\* what I want to research.  I still have to figure out how to get funding, and some of my ideas seem to be more attractive than others.  Writing grants is a grind.\n\nIf I were independently wealthy would I be writing NIH proposals?  Would I be dealing with budgetary compliance and various other administrative crap?   Obviously not.  But that's why it's a job.  There's more to being a professor than daydreaming about research proposal ideas and telling your underlings to do them.",

People should not work for the university without compensation. The university does nothing to deserve having people's time donated to them and they will not reward it in any way.\n\nThere is a big university public outreach scheme in our department with many people doing lots of work for it for free. The university paid for one permanent position focused primarily on outreach (though also with standard teaching duties) and this person died last year. They advertised the job, still theoretically as an outreach focused position, and all the people who have been involved in this outreach for years applied. Did any of them get it? Of course not. It went to somebody from the other side of the world who has great publication stats but does not even speak the local language (mainland Europe) very well.\n\nOne problem is that the faculty here don't seem to recognise that people are even working for the university when they do this stuff. They consider us to be a team and when an issue comes up, the team should get together to fix it, regardless of whether they are paid. Starting next semester, our department will have literally no dedicated teaching staff left. Ten years ago there were loads, but now they have all retired and not been replaced. The number of students has tripled in the last 10 years. The professors recently sent an email around with a list of teaching organisation responsibilities that were previously done by permanent full-time teaching staff and that they now expect postdocs (90% of which are third party funded) to volunteer for and do. Fuck that! Of course people still volunteer for them.",
