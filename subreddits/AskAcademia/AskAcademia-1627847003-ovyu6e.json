  "title:": "[English] [PhD] Reading for Comps",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nCurrent grad student in English reading for comps and worried about my reading pace. For context, I switched over from a far less reading-intensive field and am not used to the volume/pace of reading, nor the need to sit down and read with uninterrupted concentration for extended periods of time (also some chronic pain getting in the way but that's another post).\n\nWould love any advice from folks who've successfully passed their comps. I know how to skim academic books, articles I just slog through, but I've no clue how people in literary studies get through lists of 100+ books of 200-400+ pages in a timely manner. \n\nMy fear is always that I'll miss a crucial detail somewhere in the middle that reveals the last segment of the book to be a dream, or told by a completely unreliable narrator, etc. And I've no idea how to read texts like Ulysses or Cyclonopedia.\n\nWould love any advice folks might have for skimming literary works!",

      "text": "I passed comps last year in English lit - we all had reading lists of about 150 books but literally no one I know who passed read all the books. I think we all averaged out at about 100 books total, including literary works and academic texts. What is the format of your exam? Chances are, it's more important that you know many literary texts really well as opposed to having skimmed all the literary texts and having a shallow knowledge of them. \n\nI do understand your fear of not reading a book completely and then saying something totally off-base about it in your exams. For this, it was helpful to me to set up times to read together with cohort mates. I'm guessing you will have a decent amount of overlap with some people in your cohort so you guys can talk about the books you read that week so even if you weren't able to read it carefully, you can at least see if you got all the major plot points. Or you could sort of split up the common reading and then meet up to discuss after a week. Honestly, though, I really doubt you have to read all the books so I wouldn't stress so much about it!",

      "text": "I am in art history and not literature. I had some literature on my lists, but mostly my comps were in theory, art history, and other historical fields. For secondary sources you can't read every word. Just read the ToC, the Intro, and then what seems most interesting/relevant to your field of research. Maybe skim some of the other chapters and read a couple book reviews, too.\n\nFor literature you can probably avoid reading the whole book too, to be honest. I took a literature class in grad school, and no one read all of *McTeague*, for example. You can get a sense for the language and then aggressively skim for plot. Maybe get a sense of the passages that are often cited/analyzed and spend a bit more time with those. Good luck!",
