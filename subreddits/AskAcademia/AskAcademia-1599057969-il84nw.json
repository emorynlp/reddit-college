  "text": "Hi all,  \n\n\nHope this post is allowed here. I'm curious as to how easy or difficult academics find it to make friends in similar fields or their institution. I know people define 'friendship' differently, but I guess for the purposes of my question, I mean someone you would see socially and with whom you'd discuss your personal lives beyond polite small talk (maybe [Level 4 and higher?](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/ejbpo2/levels_of_friendship/)).  \n\n\nPersonally, after 8 years as a PhD student and postdoc, I know three people, all of whom I met as MPhil/PhD students, who I might call friends. We've talked about personal stuff but we're very low contact which is partially due to geography. I also initiate most of the conversations. My two proper close friends are non-academic and I have lots of academic colleagues/acquaintances.  \n\n\nIt seems like lots of other people in my field have circles of academic friends but maybe this is a misperception from social media. I see people thanking loads of friends in their thesis intros and I can't relate haha. I have, unsuccessfully, tried to put myself out there with people but I think it's a combination of incompatibility and some being understandably busy with their own stuff.   \n\n\nThanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.",

A lot of people don't understand what a post-doc is, even after you explain what you'll be doing (oh so you're a student still? do you get paid? do you get college credit?). And it's easier to talk to people who understand why that your career takes 10+ years after graduating to even reach a point where you'd be considered \"successful\" or that you're not just trying to get rich in life.",

The other students from our degree program are friendly and there's more of an \"we're all in this together\" feeling, than anything competitive.\n\nThinking about it like this: after I cut every tie from my hometown and left for university I don't have any friends anymore who are not studying or finished their degree. Not because I have any kind of issues with people who haven't studied, but just because living in a university city with loads of other students. \nRent is very expensive, most people not planning on going to university move to smaller cities and find jobs there, leaving mostly students in the core of the city, so that's most of the people you meet.",

The only people I know who are not on the move are anchored by a partner or family and typically don\u2019t feel the pressure to move for the best opportunity + funding to advance career. If you are able to stay in NYC and do what you want with all the opportunities and proper compensation that seems like one of the luckiest folks o have heard of in my decade of doing this.

We are all in our mid twenties so though i have non academic friends, i do not have \u201cnormal\u201d friends that are no longer in school or are working \u201creal\u201d job.\n\nBUT i have noticed that my non-academic, advanced degree seeking friends, have a vastly different perspective of education and advanced degree seeking life. To be frank, my friends aren\u2019t *that* intellectually independent. I am not minimizing thier hard work in anyway. But they are given directions and they follow them. Yes, they are intellectually challenged but *not* independent. \n\nBut me? I am pretty much left to my own devices. I decide what to research and its my responsibility to justify and present that research. It\u2019s also my responsibility to teach at least 40 students a semester about a topic. I am a grad student and its not always perfect but I am usually treated like an academic professional and a scholar in my own right. There is no one giving me any direction and, if anything, I have to do everything in my power to stand out and \u201cbe unique.\u201d \n\nBut my friends are still very much \u201cstudents.\u201d They have tangible goals. I feel and behave as if academia is a \u201cjob.\u201d I get paid a stipend. I wrestle with the copy machine. I\u2019ve even got a cubicle office. But my friends are very much still \u201cgoing to class\u201d and \u201cstudying.\u201d This has become very long but i am a bit envious that they get to be 25 year old students and I have to be a 25 year old who is grasping at straws in order to build a CV.

All my other friends live far away so we only connect virtually; about half of them are academic too (grad school friends) and the rest are from college/high school.  Ultimately I'd have to say that nearly all of my friends with whom I interact regularly IRL or online are academics, though a few are high school teachers or people with graduate degrees working for the government.",

I do have one person who I was conference friends with and now works with me. I like them a lot, so they and their partner started coming to group social things and they have really become a part of the group (hanging with them without me! Which makes me happy) but because their move coincided with quarantine so we are not as close as I wish we were!",

I have a few non-academic friends from college and one that I met in grad school while she was an undergrad, she went into industry afterwards.\n\nI've been very lucky with my academic friends. Our department/uni is awesome and we don't really occupy a competitive environment, it's more collaborative-focused.

They do their research, I do mine, when there is an intersection we do a partnership, but that doesn't happen often. I strive to do my best and do whatever necessary, as long as I'm not voluntarily hurting or doing harm to others - basically, my motto is \"Don't be an asshole to others\" (pretty much the only thing I grasped form Buddhism, so thank you buddhists for this). \n\nMaybe I'm too naive, I don't know. I know that sooner than later we might end up applying to the same positions and compete with each other, however today, after finishing my 2nd year as a chemistry PhD, I don't think I would end friendships with anyone if they took my place. Alas, I might be a big exception because I have no desire to be a university professor, as I really don't like the idea of teaching. I want to do research, be it for a public or private institution. \n\nIf there is an \"associate professor\" anywhere in the world, someone who only does research and advise prospecting MSc. and PhD students, that's where I'm going to. Otherwise, private sector it is. I have made peace with the fact that I won't earn much from it.",

      "text": "I like my department but have very little in common with most of the other faculty (they are much older and don't go out, for starters.)  The two people who I have more in common with are also very competitive, so even social gatherings are all about work (what big name just emailed to say they liked their work, where they were just invited to speak, etc.)   \n\nSometimes I feel like a failed academic because I don't want or need every conversation to be about my discipline. I accept an invitation for a drink to unwind a bit, but then the bragging starts and I feel like I should be home working instead of enjoying some downtime.  \n\nIronically, I've met a few people in other departments that I hang out with occasionally, and while we vent about work like non-academics, they don't talk about their own accolades as my department colleagues do.  It is \"normal\" work talk without any one-upmanship.  But maybe they are competitive in their conversations when they meet with their department colleagues in social situations? \n\nAll of my friends that I hang out with on a regular basis are non-academics. I met them through volunteer work, a hiking club, they are neighbors, and then became friends with the friends of these folks.  They don't talk about their jobs in human resource management, dentistry, health account management, etc. and I have no reason to talk about mine (beyond normal stuff.) It is much more relaxing for me. \n\nAt conferences I try to catch up with grad school friends, but the dynamics of the friendships have definitely changed. One grad school friend makes a full list of who he is meeting for coffee or a meal or a drink in hour-long slots for the entire conference, and it has become exhausting trying to find a time that works for all of us to get together.  His email signature includes all of the books he has on contract for the next 2-3 years. I don't think this is normal, but maybe I am just an underachiever and the reason I feel uncomfortable/dissatisfied with time spent with old grad school friends is my own fault. \n\nWhen something important happens in my life (for example, ran my first 5k, sibling died, got engaged, etc.), grad school friends and academic colleagues are not the people I call.",
