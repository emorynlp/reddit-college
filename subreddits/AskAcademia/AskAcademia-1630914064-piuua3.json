  "text": "Hi Everyone! I am not a native English speaker but would try my best to be clear :)\n\nI recently graduated with a [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). in Software Engineering, with a distinguished Bachelor's thesis, and I expect to start my Master's Degree soon. My adviser (Full Professor) was impressed and asked me to collaborate with him on research in machine learning **(UNPAID)**.\n\nWe started from scratch, he brought the idea and some theory, while I defined the architecture, wrote the code base and produced all of the results myself. Afterwards, we split the labor of writing the paper half-half. Now, my first publication is on peer-review, and another one is in process. In both I am the first author.\n\nI wish to note this on my resume and Linkedin as experience in research.\n\nMy question being - what title would be appropriate?\n\n\\- Researcher? (feels quite immodest considering that I am merely a soon-to-be Master's student)\n\n\\- Research Assistant? (I am a first author, not an assistant - also according to my Prof. + unpaid)\n\n\\- Research Fellow? (again, I am not paid for this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm clueless. Your help would be appreciated! Thank You!",

      "text": "> Researcher? (feels quite immodest considering that I am merely a soon-to-be Master's student)\n\nProbably fine.  \n\n\n> Research Assistant? (I am a first author, not an assistant - also according to my Prof. + unpaid)\n\nThis is the normal title for this job, and the one I'd be inclined to use.  \"Assistant professors\" aren't \"assistants\" either; the term merely indicates a relatively low level of seniority.  If you read some job ads, you'll see that \"research assistant\" is a common in many places for people who don't have a PhD.  (After that they would probably be a \"Postdoctoral researcher\" or a \"research associate\").  However, the conventions vary by country so you should look up what's common in your own country, and in any country you may wish to study/work in later.\n\n\n> Research Fellow? (again, I am not paid for this)\n\nDefinitely not; this implies that you have applied for and been awarded an independent research fellowship, which you have not.\n\n\nEditing to add: while it's nice that you're trying to get this right, don't stress out about it too much.  When reading your CV and Linkedin, people will care far more about your description of what you did/learned and how much responsibility and independence you had.  They'll probably assume that your professor is the one who selected the title anyways.  :)",
