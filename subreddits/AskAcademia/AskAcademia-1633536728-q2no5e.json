  "text": "Hello, I am applying for PhD in the UK for starting next year 2022 in genomics, bioinformatics. I have almost fives years of industrial experience as a scientist, but want to learn new skills. Since I don't have a PhD, thought this would be the best way to learn. I have givn alot of thought to it thus I am quite picky about the projects I am applying to. Can some one advice me about: \n\n1. What makes your application stand out?\n2. Do I already need to have most of the skills necessary before applying?\n3. If so what skills are good to apply for genomics, bioinformatics?\n\nThank you :)",
