      "text": "Stance on co-advising is an awkward one but is important to know about. I've seen/heard some faculty, at all levels of the career ladder, be very jealous about their students and discourage co-advising and independent collaboration to their students' detriment. \n\nI'm not going to say that every student working with new faculty needs a co-advisor, but it's hard to predict what will happen over the next few years and the need or preference might arise.",

      "text": "You should discuss expectations about authorship. If the professor is a brand new assistant prof, they will most likely be expected to have first author publications. Thus, what are the rules in place for you to be first author? If your goal is academia, then you\u2019ll need first author publications as well. You want to make sure that you won\u2019t constantly be competing with your advisor over first authorship.",

I'd ask to be connected with any of his current phd/masters students or students he may have mentored in his post-doc (if he did one) so you can talk with them about what kind of supervisor he will be! My current supervisor offered this option to me coming into grad school and it was actually what helped me decide between him and another professor/institution.",
