      "text": "I am in linguistics and generally speaking, no, at least not for a TT position at an R1 or something like that (at least in the US, though I think this applies in the rest of the world as well, from my experience with non-US linguists). The problem is that when you are presenting yourself, people on hiring committees want to see that you have some kind of coherence to your research plan and importantly that they can more or less predict what you'll be doing for the next 5-10 years. You won't be seen as a good \"investment\" if they're not sure that you'll be able to consistently come up with stuff to publish.\n\nOn top of that, if you're seriously hopping from one subfield to another, not just different topics within phonology or syntax or whatever, even if you do consistently come up with new interests and research questions, you'll have to spend a LOT more time doing the necessary background reading, study design, potentially learning new methods, potentially new formalisms, and then piloting to write a publishable paper. Again this depends on the subfield, obviously formal semantics and syntax do not have as much experimental stuff, but the reading will not go away and experimental methods ARE increasingly common even in historically non-experimental fields. But this means that your output will be much lower.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to go into a primarily teaching position, it can be to your advantage that you've got more varied background and that you might be more comfortable teaching a broad range of classes. This is particularly true in smaller departments or departments where linguistics is a small program housed in another department. But for this you'd want to make sure that you build up your teaching portfolio.\n\nJust FYI, you don't have to be working on \"just one thing\" to be specialized; if you are interested in theory you can always approach it from different angles. E.g. \"what information is in a phonological representation\" gives you a WIDE array of languages, angles, and even methodologies to work with.",

      "text": "Hi, just defended my PhD in psycholinguistics. To my mind, the whole point of doing a PhD is to specialise in a field. Even if you do decide to do something like 'general linguistics' there are some distinctions such as theoretical/experimental work that you need to specialise in. Interdisciplinary work is great, but still you need to decide what you're passionate about (and are willing to sacrifice 3-5 years of your life). You can be interdisciplinary, focus on one topic for your PhD and then you can jump onto something a bit more different afterwards (considering you have similar skills).  I would see whether this stems from other insecurities in life (fear of failure?).",

I knew I was going to be good at whatever, but kept being defensive of doing a PhD without having a passion. I found my area of specialty and it still guides me as to my future plans. \n\nAlso, general piece of advice: invest in more general skills, such as technical skills; they can help you whether you want to stay in academia or not.

It very well may be the case that the Indian linguistics market has more positions for language family specialists (esp. Dravidian) or historical. But even in the UK and Europe, historical positions are quite rare, especially if you don't have some secondary methods focus (computational, phonetics, for example). In the US there's a single historical position maybe every 2-3 years or so. \n\nAnyway, you shouldn't worry about your previous background. It's very possible to succeed in a linguistics PhD and not have done any linguistics at all previously. Now you just need to figure out what about language is really intriguing to you and what research is out there that is also trying to ask those questions. It can be hard to broaden your focus this much when you're just starting out, but certainly by year 4 or 5 (or whenever you're starting to dissertate) you should be seriously thinking about the bigger questions that are driving your research.",

Some schools also like to see 5. some evidence of dedication to underserved communities. \n\nHonestly the market in the US is very tough for linguistics, even if you are trained in the US. It is difficult to achieve all of this in grad school and many people bounce around in temporary, high teaching-load positions before getting something permanent (if they don't leave academia before then).",

If you were to take those 18 hours in an associated area in addition to your linguist hours it would make you eligible to teach in a second area. That can be useful; I chaired Social Sciences and due to a retirement we needed somebody to teach several philosophy classes a year but not enough to hire a full-time philosopher. We also needed a couple more classes taught in a different social science area. So, I advertised for somebody who could do both and got 4 or 5 applicants who actually were eligible to teach both (in addition to 40-50 for one or the other of the areas!). I hired one of them and he's busily earning tenure right now and also building the philosophy program. As more students take those classes, we offer more sections that he teaches. He might well end up just teaching philosophy (his doctoral area) when all is said and done.",
