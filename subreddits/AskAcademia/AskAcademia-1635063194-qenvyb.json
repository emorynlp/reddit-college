  "text": "It's again the time of the year where the academic societies I'm a member of ask me for money to renew my membership. Honestly, I don't understand what I'm in for. It's not like I don't feel benefitted enough from what I get. It's that I don't see any activity/benefit that I could theoreticall get from them. On top of conferences fees reductions, but that's the worst, because I pay something that  benefits my employer!\n\nI do see a strong reason to have an association of people that are expert in the same field... But I don't see that reflected into practice. \n\nHow does that work in your field? Are they expensive? What exactly do you get out of them?",

For tax reasons, all members had to pay for the fees themselves. The conferences were run and paid for by rotating universities. \n\nSo, people only got an e-mailed newsletter four times per year for 200 USD. This was set up before social media when networking was done stone age style.",

      "text": "I think it's a reasonable question to ask, and some of the other comments make some sensible points (e.g. social networking fulfilling some of the same functions). A few things that came to mind that the societies I'm part of do:\n\n1. **Oversees a biennial conference (a local organising committee will do the bulk of the organisation, but the society is responsible for decisions like where the next conference will be held).** I can see a need for an overarching body making decisions about where to hold conferences, ensuring equality of access, some oversight of format and expectations etc. If it wasn't for the society then I feel like some body would need to be formed to do that anyway. \n2. **Runs a journal.** One of the societies I belong to recently set ditched the major publisher they were affiliated with to start their own journal. There are some positives about the way that it's run, like being fully open-access, transparency about the costs, not focused on profit etc. which I think are a product of it being primarily controlled by academics. Not impossible without a society, but I wouldn't expect a major publisher to push the same things.\n3. **Sponsors summer schools and workshops.** I don't think societies are necessary for workshops to exist, but providing some funding to assist reduces the costs for attendees, so I think that's a net positive.\n4. **Sponsors bursaries for (e.g.) graduate students to attend conferences etc.** As with 3, I think it's a worthwhile thing for the society to provide funding for activities or to enable access to activities for people who wouldn't be able to attend (e.g. students from low SES countries).\n\nThough you could argue that a society per se isn't necessary for all of those things, I think they're a) useful functions and b) you'd need *something* to organise things like that if not the society. \n\nIn terms of value for money in membership fees - ultimately conferences etc. need to be funded, so whether it comes from membership fees or attendance fees is kind of a non-issue to me. There are some annoyances to it though. I can charge conference attendance fees to my expenses, whereas I can't charge membership fees to them because they're not a recognised body in my country for tax purposes. So, I (/my university) end up paying more for conferences than is necessary or be personally out of pocket. Arguably not the societies fault, but it's up to them to seek out recognised status.",

There are smaller travel awards to the conference, but there are also research grants for young investigators and such.  They give out awards (outstanding young investigator, lifetime research, outstanding mentor, etc.).  They sponsor workshops for trainees (which was really valuable to me when I was starting out) that covered topics from how to get a job to best practices to analyze certain types of data.  We also have access to video archives that has everything from interviews with older prominent researchers (many that have passed) to research topics updates.  \n\nAnother big thing the societies do is employ lobbyists that lobby for increases in research funding for our specific area.  A friend of mine is the president of a society and they were recently asked to testify in congress related to a bill that was being passed.",

      "text": "> On top of conferences fees reductions, but that's the worst, because I pay something that benefits my employer!\n\nMy employer paid me back which was the only reason I was a member of societies. Condition was that you could proof that you save the institute money (which makes sense and usually is the case).  \nHonestly, if they don't repay you and allow non-member registrations I would always book that, there's no logical reason why you should foot that bill only to safe them money. If there is any benefit you like you could of course do otherwise but honestly, most societies I joined didn't really offer much over the year.  \nThe only compromise I did was paying for off-years for a society that only has meetings every other year, simply because I know that they also organize a lot of additional training courses for scientists and do other stuff I liked supporting. I left when I left academia, although that was mainly because not only would I have to pay each year myself, but the fees of course are a lot higher without \"student\" or \"postdoc\" discounts.\n\nBut about your question, the reason I hear was that it apparently proves you are serious about your involvement in the community and to help furthering the field but I am not sure it really has a big impact if you are not (as in, would a possibly employer reject your application simply because you don't list any memberships). I kind of doubt it because most of my former colleagues either only had \"strategic memberships\" or were actually involved with the society. Most people who paid without visiting a discounted conference simply visited one in the past and didn't cancel.  \nOtherwise it of course depends on which benefits they offer and what they do for the field and community. Some very visibly offer more or at least you can see that they do have an impact on the field that you may want to support while others seem to mainly want to organise a neat conference each year.",
