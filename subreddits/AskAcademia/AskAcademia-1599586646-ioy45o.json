Oops. Sorry friend. Looks like you accidentally sent the wrong resume that makes it look like you still work part time four years later.\n\nAdditional tip, get your regular old email, the gmail or whatever that you won't lose if you switch institutions/employers. Email all your important docs to yourself and keep them in a special folder. Computer fried. House flooded. Stuck with only your phone. Doesn't matter. You've got everything right there.",

However, you're also shooting yourself in the foot by increasing the chance of a file being lost or unread due to being confused with dozens of other similarly-named files (regrettably, for every person like you who asks, there's a dozen others who assume).\n\nAs a general rule, any file name should have: your name, some kind of date (year, semester, month-day, etc. depending on what is appropriate), and a short but descriptive name. This lets a professor or any reader know from the file name whose it is, when it's from, and what it is, which tells them all they need to know to figure out if that file is relevant to them.",

              "text": "So when I've applied for jobs/PhD positions, they typically have a number associated for them. It's an internal number for their admin side.\n\nAn example is here- https://www.findapostdoc.com/search/Job-Details.aspx?jobcode=9209 So I'd title this Name_1871552_Cover_Letter or a different order of that but will include their admin code. For my current position, they explicitly wanted Number_Name_Documenttype because then they just order by number and all the applications are next to each other. \n\nIf it doesn't have a number, you want to have something that is in your file name which is unique to your job position so that it's easier for your application to be found.",

      "text": "Ha I think it's find. If you're interesting enough, your mentor will like you anyway. \n\nThis mistake is quite common. I think the best way to prevent it is to change your habit: [always name your file properly](https://blog.magezon.com/best-practices-email-attachments/).\n\nHere is some tips I found. Hope it helps. \n\n\\#Do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFile name should be sufficiently descriptive and tells you what\u2019s inside. In some cases, you may want to add some more information in your file names so that the recipients can easily tell it apart from others. These info can be the name of the project, name of creator, \u2026\n\nAdding a number of versions or a/b if you send more than one version of a content. This will help your recipients distinguish them.\n\nIncluding the date into your file is a good idea. Use the format YYYYMMDD or YYMMDD because they are the most common ones. Plus, applying dates to your files helps you organize them better. \n\n\\#Don\u2019t:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t use the word \u201cFinal\u201d. Many people use the word \u201cfinal\u201d in their file names. And then \u201cfinal 2\u201d, \u201cfinal-of-final\u201d\u2026 the list goes on. Just remember that your recipients don\u2019t want to see that. Remove as soon as possible.\n\nDon\u2019t make a file name too long because some programs can\u2019t read the files with too long names.\n\nDon\u2019t overuse caps lock because it looks like you are SHOUTING. Using lowercase letters is a safe choice.\n\nDon\u2019t use special characters such as  \\~ ! @ # $ % \\^ & \\* ( ) \\` ; < > ? , \\[ \\] { } \u2018 \u201d and |. \n\nDon\u2019t use spaces. Space can cause problems with some reading software. Instead, use dashes, underscores, or camel case. \n\nMost importantly, be consistent. Find a name formula you like and stick with it. Otherwise, your file names will mess up, sooner or later. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead more in my [blog](https://blog.magezon.com/best-practices-email-attachments/). I researched every single corner of the internet to make it happen.",
