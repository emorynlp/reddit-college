What was your topic, if you don\u2019t mind me asking? \n\nDid some subsurface micro far inland that turned up isolates very similar to those found in distant ocean water columns\u2014 personally, I\u2019d love to revisit any number of related topics\u2014 consortium, quorum sensing, extremophile traits, metabolism etc. Miss just growing new stuff in the lab.",
