  "text": "This is a long story, but I've wanted to tell it. I'm a regular lurker and commenter on this sub but creating an alt account to maintain my anonymity. The story has a happy ending, but it took a long time to get there. \n\nI finished my PhD in 2016 in Geography. I came out of one of the top graduate Geography programs in the US, but from a university that doesn't rank as 'elite'. Not all colleges and universities have Geography departments in the US and so people with Geography PhDs are often hired in departments that are interdisciplinary (such as environmental studies or international studies). I started applying for jobs in 2014-2015 while ABD and had a few phone and Skype interviews but nothing beyond that. I applied to all types of institution, in lots of different kinds of departments. I really didn't care about rank or anything like that, I just wanted a job. In 2015-2016, still ABD, I kept applying with no luck, and began to despair. I imagined a different life for myself outside of academia and began to mobilize some alternative options for myself. At the end of the Spring that year, I defended my dissertation, a few days later I half heartedly applied for one more job and got it! It was an NTT Instructor position at a large well-known research university in the US. I moved myself to a new place where I didn't know anyone in the summer of 2016 and started my first faculty position in an R1 Geography department that fall semester. \n\nSoon after I got to the new place, I met with my new colleagues and was told that they intended to hire a tenure track position for exactly the type of research that I do. Of course, I was immediately very excited about this. I really liked these people, loved my new students, and could envision a future for myself at this new university. From the time I got there in fall, 2016, I worked to distinguish myself. I published all of my dissertation that first year, and was able to submit some other publications as well. I consistently had stellar teaching evaluations. I began developing my next research project. My colleagues seemed supportive and I received very encouraging feedback about everything I was doing. Multiple people told me they wanted me to have the tenure track position when it came up. I tried to take this with a grain of salt, but of course I was very hopeful. \n\nIn the fall of 2017, my department posted the ad for the new tenure track hire. It was clearly written around what I do. It was quite obvious, even to the point that friends and colleagues elsewhere were emailing me to figure out if the job was for me or if they should bother applying. I advised people to apply, because I knew that I wouldn't be given any particular advantage over other applicants. Nonetheless,  I was very hopeful. But, I didn't want to think of it as guaranteed and I did continue to apply elsewhere for TT positions. I didn't have much luck. I was shortlisted at another R1 Geography program and (as anyone who has been on the market for awhile knows), applying for jobs is enormously time consuming and emotionally draining. After January, I stopped applying to other jobs and  decided to let the chips fall where they would. \n\nI made it to the campus visit stage in the TT search at my university. I felt like my interview went well. Throughout the process I was very aware of everything else that was happening (a common challenge for the internal candidate). I knew when search committee meetings were happening, I knew when other candidates were visiting, I knew something of the internal dynamics of the search. For complicated reasons, the search was drawn out, a final candidate interviewed a month after the initial interviews happened. Members of the search committee were out of the country off and on. It was about 2.5 months from the time of my interview to the time when they actually made a decision about the job. \n\nMeanwhile, I organized a conference on themes that related directly to the position. I continued to work on publishing, provided quality educational experiences for my students, and generally do my thing well. But I was under an intense amount of pressure. My insomnia was terrible. I was dealing with some crippling anxiety. I was socially isolated because everyone I knew in this new place was either a colleague or a grad student in my department. It seemed like a bad idea to unload my stress on anyone in my department while the search was underway, so I kept my distance and spent a lot of time alone. It was honestly one of the hardest times in my life. Being alone in a new place, not being able to reach out to the few friends I had made there, and feeling like everything I did professionally was being judged. I felt that I had to do everything right so that they would give me this TT job. I was a mess emotionally, but managed to keep it to myself and appear as if I was doing fine professionally. \n\nThey didn't give me the job. Worse, they didn't give it to anyone. It was a failed search. No one would ever give me a straight answer about why. My colleagues were mostly gaslighting me and acting as if I should not be impacted by how this all played out. Senior colleagues said things like, \"I had lots of jobs I didn't get\" and tried to act as if they knew my experience. But they didn't. They all got TT jobs within a year of finishing their PhDs (most straight out of grad school) none of them had to go through what early career people do today. A couple colleagues even offered to help me improve my application materials so that when they re-run the search next year I would be better prepared. I tried to be polite and not burn bridges, but all of this was insulting and hurtful. I'd already made it to the campus visit stage. I felt that they had their opportunity for me to be a part of their department long term and they didn't take it. So why would I bother putting myself through another year of that hell? \n\nAs I saw it, my only pathway forward was to leave. But the NTT position I was in wasn't terrible so I couldn't just take anything. I knew it was a long shot but I applied to a few jobs that were posted in April. I got 2 on site interviews. One of them was an amazing good fit at an R1 near where I did my PhD. It's a great city that I love and I have friends in the area. The interview was like a great blind date. I loved it there and I could tell that their department was really excited about me. The day after I got back from my interview, I had an informal offer from the chair and after a bit of negotiation, I signed the offer letter and am now on my way to a TT position in a place I am very excited about. I really can't get over my good fortune here, especially after such a hellish year. So, after 4 years on the job market and a terrible experience an internal candidate, I finally got the job. It felt great to email my current colleagues brief polite emails about my imminent departure.  \n\nIf you made it to the end of this, thank you for reading. I am mostly posting this for my own catharsis, but also for grad students with academic aspirations and others still on the market. Good luck to all, the market is brutal and demoralizing. \n\nThe End \n",

Their work informed my own theoretical orientation as my field (environmental history) was taking shape in the 1980s/90s, but by the time I was trying to find working geographers to guide me through their work in the early 1990s they had become a small minority in a sea of GIS acolytes.",

But, like the OP said, there aren't very many actual geography departments so geographers end up all over the place. I'm starting a job in an anthropology department in the fall, for example. With administrators cutting and combining programs, I don't expect to see them start adding back the geography departments they started cutting in the 80s and 90s even with this regrowth. ",

He was a NTT in the department for several years. Really did a lot of great work (both research and teaching) in the department. The sticking points:\n\n1. There were a few professors in the department that he really rubbed the wrong way. People that he had gotten into email \"fights\" with about things that were, overall, pretty trivial. Ones where the chair had to tell him to STOP. And he didn't. He totally didn't see this as an issue, as he thought he was in the right. \n\n2. Had started policing the place like he owned it. See a student working alone in the lab? Kick them out. Even if their advisor is down the hall in the fucking bathroom. Not only was that not his place, but it was completely absurd.\n\nThose two things were enough to give everyone enough pause to ultimately say no. I mean, literally, every single person in the department voted for someone else. Even if they weren't the person on the receiving end of his issues.

My department recently hired a faculty member who seemed excellent and collegial throughout the application process, but was not the first choice. This person was a disaster as a pedagogue (holding roughly 60% of course sessions) and unfriendly/uninterested the remainder of the time. I spoke with the faculty member 3 times, which was on the high side, and the faculty member **never** attended colloquia and only rarely attended lunch presentations. \n\nI say \"was\" because the faculty member resigned.

Basically, they ranked the final candidates and decided that if the top 2 didn't take it, they weren't hiring anyone. I was #3 of 4 finalists. #1 was someone who had offers all over the country, from an elite school, had all kinds of amazing things going on. #2 was someone I didn't know much about, but I guess ticked more of their boxes than I did. So #1 and #2 took other offers. Pretty sure my (soon to be former) colleagues thought I would still be there regardless of how the search turned out. A known problem with internal candidates is that you are less new and exciting than the external candidates. I think that was a big part of how it went down. ",

Hiring and admission practices are bricks in this type of long-term agenda-building. \n\nIt could be that your research simply wasn't a match with the sort of department they want to be ten years down the line. This has, I'm sure, very little to do with the quality of work (which, from the quality of your writing, I can assume to be high), and everything to do with the direction they want to take the program in. \n\nAgain, thank you for your story, and congrats on the new job!",

We've pretty much stuck to those plans for the two decades I've been here, with only modest exceptions.

While I fully grasp that intent =/= result, in this case I was truly asking in what I consider a lighthearted way, that I didn't think it's rational to have thought when you started your undergrad in geography, that you'd be able to pick up an easy, well\\-paying job anywhere. That's all. It's just not as an obviously employable career as some other fields are and I feel that perhaps you and the others downvoting me are drawing from their identify scripts and being defensive. The notion of 'well obviously MY field is great, \\*I\\* wouldn't go into a lacklustre field' rather than 'yeah, the average person probably wouldn't know that geography is a broad, great field, and it took me some time to realise how awesome it would become.'   \nI do sincerely apologise if I came across as offensive or abrasive, however. \n\n\nedit: I am also not trying to call geography a lacklustre field, just using an example statement. How would you have phrased the question?",

And we do have a hard time explaining to others that geographers don\u2019t just memorize maps, that geography is different from cartography, and that it\u2019s a heavily quantitative and incredibly useful specialty. I personally didn\u2019t know that I could get a degree focused on what I study until after I had started an economics doctorate program. So my field is definitely flawed. \n\nMy point was that it\u2019s mildly rude to say \u201cyou got a degree in X, how was that ever going to work out for you!?\u201d I\u2019m in a highly interdisciplinary field, and I come across a lot of scholars who have niche degrees. I used to think along similar lines \u2014 why would you spend so much time, energy, and money studying *that* useless area \u2014 but I used to not say anything because I was so junior. Now I would never voice that opinion, because I\u2019ve noticed that a) I\u2019m always proved wrong, and b) I usually have no idea what that person does. \n\nAnyways, maybe I should\u2019ve used less abrasive language in my response. You clearly didn\u2019t mean to offend. I\u2019m happy that you learned something about our field today, and usually I try to be more diplomatic about it. I apologize for that!",

But I was and am keen curious to learn about why these degrees are necessary, I love to learn how disciplines like geography fit into society at a high level. \n\nThank you for helping me understand.
