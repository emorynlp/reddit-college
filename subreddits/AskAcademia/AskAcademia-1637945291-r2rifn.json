It'll also be entirely research and you'll likely have a very solid idea of the project from the start.\n\nMy understanding is that US PhDs are longer and the first few years are taking classes and basically doing what someone in the UK would do in a taught masters programme.",

You must satisfy the master's requirements as part of the PhD requirements, and you receive a master's when you compete them, often after your second year in the program.",

      "text": "In Sweden you have to have a Master's degree to do a PhD. In the STEM field you usually have funding for 4 years, full time. During your PhD you're required to take some courses but the majority of your time should go to research. \n\nAt the start of my PhD I had to hand in a project plan detailing 4 projects that would make up my thesis in the end ( ...ideally. Of course there's been a lot of changes to the projects over time). A thesis will normally include several original articles (in my department 4 is the norm). Some can still be in manuscript from, but a published first author paper and a second published article (can be co-author) are usually the minimum requirements to graduate. Although there are differences between fields and universities on that.",

      "text": "\"Other countries\" is a big place. \n\nEven if you take well-known and high-ranking universities in Europe, comparisons with the US are super difficult (as is evident on this subreddit almost daily). The misunderstanding of \"years\" and other comparisons with... less than full knowledge is quite frustrating here.\n\nAdd other continents and things get even more confusing. On average, almost 50 % of all Nobel laureates in the last couple of years in STEM got their PhD in the US (an impressive portion for sure), and the rest in \"other countries\" (mostly Europe, but Japan and some others are in the mix).\n\nIn some academic systems, the name of the institution is an important tell. In other, it isn't as much. You have to remember that not everyone everywhere builds on institutional reputation. In some places, you have world-leading departments/research groups existing next to bush-league dittos. I work in an institution that is in the elite of the world in some areas (according to Nature), and the very bottom (not really, but they suck) in others. I am not in either extreme, so I can claim this with some level of objectivity.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, where do you wish to work if/when you get your PhD? If you apply for a job in the US and you are the weird one (with a degree that the reviewers don't fully understand), chances are you may be overlooked. Fair or unfair, it is the way things work.\n\nI assessed applications for a full professorship earlier this year, and one of the applicants had all their merits from China. They had some translated record of a \"PhD\" from way back, and then something called a \"doctorate\" decades later. I didn't know what this referred to. Did they get a PhD yesterday or 20 years ago? Was it a double PhD? I had no clue if the different institutions referenced were reputable or not, and of course even less so if various departments or research groups meant anything. If s/he had been competitive all things considered, I would have struggled with this. (Luckily I didn't have to worry about this in this particular case, but I think you get the picture.)",

      "text": "I did a CIFRE industrial PhD in France, but there are many other types of contracts in France as well. A PhD in France is a work contract, the \"student\" part means virtually nothing beyond the student meal at a kebab shop. I was pretty well-paid, got seven weeks of holidays per year and was not allowed in the lab on weekends. Overall, I didn't suffer through the majority of grad school complaints. \n\nMy doctoral school required 180 hours of classes to be taken over the three year contract. One third at least somewhat related to my field, one third professional development and one third whatever I wanted. They also laid out the rules for manuscript approval and submission. \n\n\nOther than those classes, I spent pretty much all my time with the industrial partner. I basically worked with them on my project and towards the end I wrote up the manuscript.",

I have no idea *where* this perception comes from other than bad interactions with UK engineering companies, but it's very real.\n\n5) In the current (geo)political climate, getting a PhD from a Chinese institution in engineering is going to make it exceptionally difficult to get hired outside of China.",
