  "title:": "Getting back into grad school after being sick for the whole pandemic",
  "text": "In fall of 2019, I started my PhD program after finishing my Master's at another lab, but I got sick with covid (probably, testing wasn't available yet but my current doctors said that's what it likely was) right as the pandemic started up, and I have been debilitatingly sick since. I wasn't able to reasonably move around and had severe brain fog to the point where I frequently couldn't even talk. Since I wasn't recovering, I eventually went on medical leave in the fall of 2020. However, when I still hadn't recovered at all after the medical leave, and I wasn't sure when I'd recover at all, I left the program. I realize now that I probably should have just extended the leave and possibly just transferred labs when I came back - but brain fog.\n\nIt's been a year and a half and I'm suddenly in remission. I've been in diagnosis hell but I gradually got put on medications that work for my lungs and heart, and I finally just finished identifying allergies that were causing my severe brain fog. I'm finally able to live normally and actually think and plan things, and I want to get back into research as soon as possible, but I'm feeling really lost.\n\nI was wondering if anyone here might have some sort of guidance for getting back on track. Needing to wait another year would suck a lot, especially after already wasting this much time, but I'm not sure if there's anything I can do other than apply for a PhD program for next year (or a Master's in a different field that I've been considering that still works with my research goals) and just find some job to work at until then. My PhD supervisor has since changed his research focus. I'm also reasonably sure that he has a bad perception of me with the work that I put out while I was sick (it was pure garbage), especially since I didn't get an official diagnosis for covid and he called some of my sick time-off a vacation, so I likely can't lean on him overall.",

I know there are circumstances where students may be readmitted after a medical withdrawal. It might be worth asking if they'd readmit you, though it may mean reapplying to the same program.",

              "text": "And if you withdrew by just the regular mechanism that doesn't indicate reason, know that most institutions have a process in place for an emergency / hardship withdrawal that can actually be petitioned for retroactively. I believe at my institution a student can apply for this for up to a full year after the withdrawal; if it's approved, then the withdrawal is re-labeled on their records and the \"W\"s don't count against them for program progress or whatever. Look into that and find the proper place at your institution to follow up with. If it seems like the process is just paperwork, I encourage you to still try and figure out who the real contact point is for those decisions and talk to that person in-person if possible.",

However, I'll still email around to see if they might be willing to view a withdrawal immediately following a medical leave a bit differently.",
