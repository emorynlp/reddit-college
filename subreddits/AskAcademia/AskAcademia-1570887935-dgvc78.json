  "text": "I went into my supervisor's office the other day and he was ordering books for the university's library. He told me that this is just one of the many random jobs he didn't expect he'd have to do as an academic (in the humanities) when he first thought of becoming an academic. I'm curious what other seemingly random tasks academics have found themselves doing that they didn't otherwise expect.",

For example, I once ended up giving candidates for the VP of facilities position campus tours that involved taking them through tunnels, into rooftop mechanical rooms, and through the power plant-- random chance, as I was asked to serve on the search committee by the president (because I'd been doing some work on building renovations for academic space) and nobody else from the committee was free to show the three candidates around the campus.\n\nOn two occasions I had to represent our university at formal affairs in other countries, bringing gifts and greetings from our president to a partner university overseas. Where I did not speak the language, so needed an interpreter. Fun!",

                  "text": "Sounds like a really inefficient use of faculty time. At my SLAC every academic department has an AA, often shared with another department. Department chairs also have an \"assistant to the chair,\" who may indeed also be an AA for that department and others. In any case, none of our faculty are doing basic administrative work as they are busy doing other stuff-- the AAs handle budgets, purchasing, travel, event planning, supervise student employees, maintain records, deal with building issues (like janitorial concerns), etc. These assistants (almost all of them are women) keep the entire operation running. I can't imagine *not* having them, as I'd end up wasting a hell of a lot of time doing stuff that is not related to my teaching, research, or advising. \n\nFrom a purely institutional perspective, how does it make sense to have someone who is paid $50/hr make copies or vacuum floors when someone who can do the same work would be available for $20/hr? Seems like bad management to me.",

We are done for the foreseeable future, and everything seems to be working now, but I cant say I enjoyed that part... also, there is so much black magic involved.\n\nThanks for the technique - its approximately what Ive done in the past, but I mostly used electrical tape, which just doesnt stick very well. I almost had more success just very gently wiggling the flange on to slide the gasket back into place, but I think thats a good way to risk getting a leak.",

          "text": "Thanks for your insights! My supervisor wasn't irritated, but more so surprised (when he first ventured into academia in his 20s) that compiling lists of books that the library should order would be part of his job. I guess for more context, He specialises in Indian languages but has to submit orders for a very wide range of books about India and South Asia studies because no one else at the university does work relating to Indian cultures, languages, philosophy etc. I think this can be stressful since he isn't a specialist in some of these fields, but for the sake of his students, he tries to keep the library's collection up to do date.",

The depth of my experience is what I hear on NPR every day. But they are pretty good at making recommendations, so I don\u2019t have to do a lot of buying for them. If my department was India and South Asia studies, I would be completely lost.",
