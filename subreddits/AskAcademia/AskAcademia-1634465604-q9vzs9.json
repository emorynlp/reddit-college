  "text": "I've been having some problems with motivation lately because it feels like all I'm doing is running batches of code and sending them off to my supervisor.\n\nI'm about halfway through my first year as a PhD student and I'd really hoped it'd be more hands on than this, I want to do more work but it feels like my supervisor is holding it back.\n\nI'm also losing motivation because covid restrictions and the general feel of the office make it a bit unpleasant to work in. \n\nAll in all I'm struggling to keep going and I'm planning to speak to my supervisor about this to see if there's a way for me to get back on track.",

      "text": "I don't know any PhD that is hands-on in the first 6 months. That first part is about getting yourself up to speed on the literature. Honestly it sounds like your expectations were far off reality. Did your supervisor lead you to believe that you would be doing hands-on work at this stage?",
