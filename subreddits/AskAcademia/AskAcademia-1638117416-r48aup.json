  "text": "Hi all, I was recommended to ask this in this sub.\n\nI am doing a gap year (UK 18M) and will be going on to study Physics. My intention being to work in the Nuclear Physics sector.\n\nI believe this is the prime time to network as it will open up opportunities for work experience during holidays in uni but I'm not sure the procedure behind contacting current nuclear physicists.\n\nMy initial idea was to just look for relevant companies and look for contact info on the websites but I'm not sure of there are dedicated resources for this sort of thing!\n\nI would love any advise on the topic, I do hope this is sub appropriate if not I will delete the post!",

      "text": "Few different strategies to keep in mind:\n\n1) When you start your studies, faculty and grad students may have industry connections to utilize. \n\n2) Identifying companies that interest you is a great idea. By all means email folks in said companies asking to chat about their career path and work. Sometimes such emails go unanswered, but the only cost is a bit of time. \n\n3) Identify conferences and/or professional societies pertaining to nuclear physics. Thats not my field, so I don\u2019t know specifics - but would be good to see if you can attend any gatherings or conferences during your studies to network. \n\n4) Ministries or other governmental agencies that relate to this work could also be explored - though these may be more on the policy side, still could be useful to building a robust professional network.",

      "text": "This is too early to network. You are unlikely to have anything interesting to say to any of the people who you want as your mentors. I would recommend instead to 'network' with people just one or two levels above you: so in your case, reach out to upper undergrads or very recent graduates from the school you are planning to go to or would be interested in apply to. This will get you started.",
