  "text": "My K01 application to NIA underwent Council review in May, and its status was changed on 6/23 to \"Pending administrative review. Refer any questions to Program Official or Grants Management Specialist.\"\n\nThe project start date was supposed to be 7/1/21, and I emailed the Grants Management Specialist last week to ask for an update but he said he wasn't aware of any and did not have access to that information.\n\nI previously had an R03 that progressed from Pending to Awarded in about 10 business days, so I'm not sure if something's going on or if I'm reading too much into the wait.\n\nShould I email the PO?  Tbh I feel super anxious about doing that and I don't know why... I guess I'm just worried about receiving bad news.  But I am getting tired of checking ERA 4 times a day!",
