I have talked to senior graduate students (~year 3) who discover this about themselves when their responsibilities increase and they take a more active role in managing their projects and time. \n\nI like this piece from Rob Zacny that talks a bit about his experience finding out as an adult, reflecting on some of the coping strategies that allowed it to go undetected for so long, and how treatment has helped: https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy84pa/rob-zacny-games-of-the-year-2020",

We typically set aside this time to work *exclusively* on our dissertations.\nMeanwhile I use Forest to block apps from my cellphone so I can't get distracted and sometimes I use the app \"cold turkey\" on my laptop so I can block web access. \nI have ADHD so I get distracted very easily, eventhough I am on meds. \nThe rest of the days I work more freely, mostly on preparing the materials for the classes I teach and grading homework and doing paperwork.\nI make to do lists for what I need to get accomplished in the day in order of importance/urgency. \nAnd I work through that. If I get bored I switch to another task, complete it, and then get back to the former task. \nMy days start at 9ish-10ish, I take a break from 3 to 5 to have a meal, and rest a little bit watch some YouTube videos. Then I work from 5 to 8, sometimes 5 to 9 if I have a deadline, and go to bed, watch some Netflix  or hang out with my husband. \n\nIt took me 2 weeks to write two drafts of an article of 17 pages (previous research done, this was just writing), which is an accomplishment for me since I avoid writing like the plague, It makes me anxious, an constantly feel like ppl are gonna find out I don't belong in academia when they read what I wrote. But that's my imposter syndrome. \nSo, yeah, schedules, to-do lists, pomodoros and app blockers like forest and also taking time to rest and being able to say well, that's enough for the day so you can get a good night's sleep. \nAnd I also agree with the second monitor, it has changed my life, it hella reduces the time it takes me to read through a paper while making notes. And don't get me started on the writing advantages. Just a blessing.",

      "text": "I bought a 30-minute hourglass. Basically it's the Pomodoro technique, but using a clock or a timer on my phone was more distracting and made me feel stressed. Instead of repeatedly checking a clock and thinking, \"28 more minutes, 27 more minutes...\" I just glance at the sand. I like seeing the sand in the bottom, like it represents how far I've gotten. When I can't focus or really get going on something, I sit down and commit to not changing tasks until the sand has run out. \n\nSecond, dangling prizes for myself. Generate the new figures, get a new fountain pen. That kind of thing.",
