  "text": "Hey all, can anyone tell me what happens after you accept a full-time offer to teach at a university? Like, are you expected to show up a week later? A month? A week before the next semester? Do you have to go to a lot of meetings/training before you start teaching?",

You will receive several emails before your start date asking about textbook preferences, office equipment, and boring stuff like that.",

We had a week and a half of orientation and several faculty and college meetings as well during the first week. Of course, courses have to be prepped before you come in, so you\u2019ll likely be working before your official hire date.",

Offers will go out to new faculty generally in the spring, though if a search runs late (especially for NTT jobs) an offer might not come until June or even July. Adjuncts get hired up to the start of classes, though the really late ones are mostly emergency hires.\n\nEach department will be different as far as meetings and the like. We have one mandatory HR training and one optional new faculty welcome on a university-wide basis.",
