  "title:": "Why don't colleges hire programmers?",
  "text": "I think that universities could really use a sort of \"floating\" programmer who picks up odd projects from any employee who needs programming assistance. There are a couple of reasons that this position is needed:\n\n1. Academics aren't always good programmers, and they often don't have the time to write quality code. (Full-time programmers don't also publish papers, so why should academics do both?) In college, I was always surprised by the simple programming tasks that PhD scientists couldn't (or wouldn't) do. This can be a serious hindrance for data-heavy research.\n2. Universities already use such \"floating\" programmers, but haphazardly. The go-to programmers are usually:\n   1. CS profs: A couple statisticians once came to my data science prof for help reading a .sav file into R. Seriously. This same CS prof was approached by a hard sciences student who needed a basic Linux command...and the student's prof had sent him.\n   2. CS undergrads: Not a bad idea, but students graduate, and then the project just hangs there. Sure, you can get a whole new team when the old team leaves, but it's inefficient to spend so much time catching up new people instead of making project progress. As an example, an engineering prof at my alma mater was running a small-scale STEM speakers bureau, but she had to quit after a couple years because she lost the CS students who maintained the website.\n   3. Grad students and postdocs: These are usually no better at programming than tenured researchers are, and they certainly don't have more time on their hands!\n\nSo let's hear it straight from the horse's mouth: why don't universities hire \"floating\" programmers?",

I'm assuming the person who made the comment is from the US, where academia is 100000x worse (hyperbole) than anywhere else in the world right now when it comes to supply and demand, job security and availability, work-life balance, etc. I'm sure there are well documented statistics about declining numbers of TT positions in the US but it's not representative of the whole world imo. Even in Canada we're hiring tons of permanent positions and it's not shrinking. But to say we'll all end up like the US in the coming years when it comes to academia is unfortunately probably not a very unrealistic prediction due to just overall trends (amount of people with PhD's increasing and stuff like that).",

Whether the original poster was citing data from the United States or from some different set of institutions, I\u2019d appreciate them sharing the cite or source So I can address this gap and my own understanding of current hiring.  \n\nIt also occurs to me that perhaps OP was referring to hiring freezes adopted by so many institutions during pandemic, but at my institution that applied to all positions, not just tenure track.",

I can't speak for all universities, but a the few that I've worked at in the past ten years have been highly dependent on contract/adjunct-based positions to teach classes and are more than willing to let tenure track lines die off if someone retires or leaves the university. When I moved universities my tenure track line at my initial institution decided to terminate the position and opted to hire some adjuncts to cover the classes I was teaching there. At my new institution we've had a few retirements and instead of filling those positions let them die off as well. All of these decisions were budgetary based and part of larger trend in academia in the US where financial concerns make contingent faculty appealing. Tenure is also a secondary reason for contingent faculty. The overall number of contingent faculty vary by institution type and even department. \n\nAnd here are some links to a couple of stories that talk about the overall trend:\n\n[https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/951](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/951)\n\n[https://insidescholar.org/the-rise-of-adjunct-faculty/](https://insidescholar.org/the-rise-of-adjunct-faculty/)",

Quite simply, American culture unnecessarily romanticizes higher ed. Why is our student debt crisis so bad? Because students are *willing* to pay $100,000+ for a degree. More and more, degrees are becoming \"expensive pieces of paper.\" Students care way more about grades and credentials than they do about learning. In addition to budget constraints, another reason universities prefer adjuncts over TT is that in this market, universities can sell prepackaged course material (the adjunct has little to no input, and the pay is not enough to incentivize improvement to this system), usually online, that the student could easily find for free on the Internet. But we don't realize this because we measure ourselves by our academic \"achievements.\" (I put that in quotes because, is it really an achievement to learn a field \"for the exam\" only to promptly forget it before graduation day?) How do we value a degree more than good, honest, hard-working self-teaching?\n\nAnyway, there's your daily dose of pessimism. :) Rant over.",

They hired a couple \"floating\" programmers to help pitch in with research projects, sketch out pipelines, help grad students figure out what training they needed. Retaining them was really hard. I think during my PhD, they entire staffing turned over twice. To pay the kinds of salaries needed for retention will rival full prof salaries, and that just won't fly. \n\nThis university also had a major high-performance cluster computer, and being funded separately, they've had more success paying and retaining consultants.",

      "text": "It's fairly common with big grants to hire developers as a line item in the budget. The easiest grants for this are often from government initiatives to commercialize basic research. Essentially, you do the research and the grant pays for developers to make a proof of concept tool/software based on your work. The end goal is to spin-out and build an impact story / IP revenue stream for the university but commercial success is essentially never a requirement dumped on the researchers. If you're not bad at pitching research, it's a decent way to just build tooling for your work.",

When they hire somebody they are not interested in the quality of that person\u2019s scholarship but in how much measurable prestige (e.g. glamour journal publications) and third party funding that person will bring in. Good research practices do not help with what university administrations care about so they have no reason to want to hire programmers.",

He does some teaching, but only 10% of his time - so he can do the programming! - so we can only pay 10% of his salary from tuition. The kind of work he does is not the kind of work that you can get a research grant to fund, so instead the resr of us have to put his salary together by putting 5% of his time on one research grant, 10% of his time on another. Still, I wouldn't expect his job to be safe if financial times get hard in the future.",

As a CS graduate student I can guarantee that I\u2019ve never met a cohort mate who couldn\u2019t program and passed their classes. Maybe the reason the people you asked couldn\u2019t program was because they aren\u2019t CS specific PhDs who focused in something like software engineering? What did you ask them to program?",
