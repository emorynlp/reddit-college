  "text": "\nI haven't been on campus in nearly 2 years and I haven't physically spoken to my supervisor in about the same about of time (face to face of course).\n\nMy university seems to be playing a dangerous game by refusing to let PhD students and support staff back on campus despite there only being 43 of us in the building as an absolute maximum. If things do take a turn for the worst when term time starts, I'm worried I missed a Window to have some face to face communication.\n\nI'm worried that if the situation worsens in the UK, I'll be working from home for yet another year. I don't want to miss out on the teaching and social opportunities that a PhD typically offers so I'm kind of upset about it all.",

I've never met anyone face to face, never seen my office, not seen any students or anything. I'm also in a foreign country though, been here 3 years now but two have been in quarantine. It's not exactly the research abroad I was expecting!\n\nI'd love to go to my actual office because working from home in a place where you don't know anyone really sucks.",

      "text": "I'm very torn. Both my husband and I are academics and we've managed so far to avoid covid by making some pretty big life changes for us and our two unvaccinated children. My uni says we're not allowed to ask for vaccination status and we're not allowed to ask students to wear a mask, but we are ordered to teach in person, unless very big class sizes. My husband and I are vaccinated but he's had ME as a child,  Guilan-Barre syndrome as an adult and I just can't see him recovering well from covid. I fear for my 6y old. I really don't know what I'm going to do. I miss the interaction with my lab and I miss in person teaching, but I'm not willing to put my family's health for the sake of \"they are paying so they need in person teaching\". But I can't afford to get fired. It's really tough. \nAs for my Msc, PhD students and postdocs,  they are doing great work, even better than before. I have weekly  1:1 meetings with them, a lab meeting and other meetings for the Msc. But yes, they miss personal interactions.",
