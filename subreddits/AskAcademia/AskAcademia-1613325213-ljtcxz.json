  "text": "I received my review comments for a recent manuscript. The comments were addressable, but the editor sent a LIST of 15 of his papers asking to cite them. Some of the papers are somewhat relevant, so I cite 4 of them. The manuscript came back, and the editor says it will be accepted once I fix some \"citation issues\"\n\n\nMy advisor told me to just cite every paper on the list and send it back. I did, and the paper got accepted. Does this not seem a bit shady? Seems like the editor is using his position to boost his citations.",

I absolutely refuse to add requested citations from reviewers (a few times recently), and I clearly spell out to the Editor why I will not be adding the citations (which normally have little to do with the subject material).\n\nI think the problem arises if you review an article that has enough substance to ultimately warrant publishing, but whole swaths of references are missing. That's in my experience not uncommon. I end up pointing authors to references in nearly half of reviews I write. (Typical example: authors use satellite data from, say, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. The NSIDC makes it really really easy to correctly cite the data:  [https://nsidc.org/daac/citing-daac-data](https://nsidc.org/daac/citing-daac-data) . But in the manuscript, the reference is missing.)\n\nIn one case I knew the relevant most recent review of the field, and the authors were machine learning specialists, but not really part of the more narrow community of the field they were writing in, and they cited a 15 year old review, and not the newer one... written by my mentor.\n\nAnd in another case, the authors claimed in the introduction something like \"there are no examples of applying method XYZ to problem ABC in the literature\"... and I am aware of a list of people who have done this, and one of the papers is by me. What would you do in this case? (I listed 5 recent papers of the type, including mine. But I agonized over whether I should include mine. Still, mine was just as good as any of the others, recent, and relevant to their area...)\n\n(Obviously, and as I said above, the situation of the OP is *blatantly* unethical.)",

An exception might be where (in my field), an editor had perhaps written a specific test or procedure, or otherwise specially contributed to something the reviewers perhaps asked for elaboration in. In the latter case, they might be saving you some time, but it's rare and definitely not standard practice. Not sure what stage the paper is at but if it's out of the first round of R&R then they should defer to the reviewers. If they think it's in shape, and you've addressed their concerns, then there is no reason (the above aside) for an editor to suggest that. As other say, boosting their own and the journals citations like this is shady practice.",
