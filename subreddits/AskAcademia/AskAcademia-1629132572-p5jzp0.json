  "text": "Hello, I completed a manuscript with my old group after being two years in a new lab as a postdoc. I'm acknowledging the grant that is paying my current salary. Also I would like to acknowledge the PI of this new grant, as s/he allowed me to work on the old project (s/he refused being co-author and s/he reckon that s/he gave no scientific contribution). Can you recommend any appropriate and nice phrasing in the acknowledgment section? Thanks!\n\nedit: typos",
