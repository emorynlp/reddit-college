  "title:": "How should I handle a fellow student that is obviously cheating on their tests/quizzes?",
  "text": "I'm in the same class as this person and that class is one of the courses known to weed out people - it's definitely harder material and just a harder course, it's also required for graduation. Because it's harder, the Prof. said that she'll curve grades so the way other students perform does effect me directly. \n\nAnyway, there's one student that I've seen blatantly cheat multiple times throughout the class and I can't think of a single quiz we've taken where he wasn't looking at his phone under his desk. We just had our midterm that many people were unquestionably rocked by and throughout the whole thing I kept seeing him use his phone to look up how to solve problems. \n\nI don't think the prof. is aware of him cheating because she's not being the most vigilant during these times. I know another student went to talk to her and just told her that some students were cheating (without specifics) and she just said that she'd be more aware next test and during quizzes, but nothing really outside of that. \n\nIt really pisses me off because I work hard to earn the grade I have and the curve can admittedly help me, but this guy is choosing to stand on the heads of people around him to make sure he doesn't drown. It also waters down the meaning of my grade that I worked hard for - it's less impressive to say \"I got an A in XYZ\" when the person right next to you can say it even though they didn't work for it. I know that he is looking at trying for the same place I am for internships which also makes me upset because they'd think we performed equally well in this course when he didn't do a tenth of the work I did.\n\nI don't want to be a jerk and immediately throw him under the bus by dropping his name to the prof./administration but I also don't think approaching him directly would resolve anything because I think he'd keep doing it regardless.\n\nWhat should I do?",

People who are good at cheating don't get caught, and when they do get caught, they somehow figure out how to spin it into a win for themselves. \n\nI had a student I was a TA for who I caught cheating severely. So did a few other TAs. We tried to get the disciplinary board involved, school didn't want to do it (looks bad when your grad students get caught cheating), so they asked him to leave. He did, and wound up getting admitted to a higher ranked subfield in our program. Last I had checked he made it through classes there and was working his degree. Given his attitude and reaction after being caught, I would never trust his research results aren't faked.\n\nA few people I knew in undergrad I had suspicions of cheating and got positive confirmation later on. Most of them made it through very high ranked PhD programs and are, so far at least, doing very well in high paying careers.\n\nLook at plenty of people in our highest offices. Karma doesn't exist.",

      "text": "Depending on your school, you may be honor bound to report the cheating.  Give your honor code a look over.  Many schools have this included in their honor codes.  Schools not using the honor code system may still have it in the student handbook.  If this is the case, by continuing to let him cheat and not report it, you are essentially considered breaking the honor code yourself.  \n\nNow if you do have an honor code, google your university and report violation of misconduct.  With duty to report, you also need a reporting system, so many colleges have just this.  This way you can report without the professor being involved.  If you do not have an honor code, then when you email your professor, you can cc the department head and the dean of students.  \n\nGenerally, teachers want to know a student is cheating.  If cheating is happening in the class and they are not seeing it, they will want to know at least they are allowing it to happen.  Moreso if a curve is involved or it is a weeder course.  In these cases, student's cheating as you said, creates an unfair system and most teachers would be horrified by allowing this.  Most likely the teacher may not notice it, because they honestly believe that no one would cheat in their class.  I know in grad school I could talk to other students during the tests themselves and no one would bat an eye because the very thought of someone cheating at that level seems crazy.  Then again one of my professors literally wrote a book on cheating and consults with schools in high profile cheating cases, so cheating for us would have like trying to mug a cop.  ",

      "text": "While I don't disagree with the majority of people who have already commented, I'd  have to say that if you're spending your time during your test paying attention to what other people are doing, you are probably losing focus on yourself. Cheaters usually get found out one way or another - eventually - and while I take your point about the prof marking to a curve it's highly unlikely that his cheating is going to stop you getting a good mark unless there are only a tiny number of students in the class and/or there is some particular benefit to you in coming top of the class. I'm not saying you should do nothing but it may be desirable to try to worry less about this. \n\nA further consideration  is how you think the teacher might react. You say the prof is not \"being the most vigilant\" during the tests. Is that because she trusts you all and thus really does need to know about the cheating? OR is it because she's not really bothered about preventing cheating and thus can't be relied upon to act if you do bring this to her attention?  \n\nThere's lots of good advice on here saying you should tell the teacher, and some saying you shouldn't. But overall my advice on this would be that whatever you do, you need to be focussing on your own work and stop letting this person's cheating annoy you to the extent that it clearly is. You have to focus on your own results and this seems like a major distraction. Basically, he has his responsibilities (not to cheat); the teacher has hers (ensure the integrity of the assessment); yours is to do the best you can yourself. ",

That's probably the better solution.\n\nThis student isn't an international one, is it? Cuz sometimes they will have a translation device to help them actually read the questions.

There have been cases where that guy has scored the highest of all just by mere copy-pasting. This is really ridiculous. The worst part is that I know this is fucking wrong and unfair and should definitely complain about this but again, some reasons stop me from doing this like good friendship with them, to prevent unnecessary enemies and to prevent my self being dubbed as the complaint box of the class. I could also tell to the teacher personally but then again, suspicion would fall over me as everyone knows I do not like cheating even if I am failing in an exam. \n\nThere was one such case when I was in 9th grade. The guy sitting beside me was in class 11 and throughout his psychology exam, he had his book opened under the desk without being confronted by any invigilator. He actually warned me to mind my own business. I did that as a coward boy and ended up getting very good marks.\n\nAccording to me, you should tell your professor separately. Don't think about any consequences. Tell her straight. You will be relieved. I can really fell your situation. Plzz don't commit the mistake I committed in school. It's very disgusting. It's actually a disrespect of your own hard precious work. If you have other like minded people in your class, then you should go with them. It's better to do this in unity",
