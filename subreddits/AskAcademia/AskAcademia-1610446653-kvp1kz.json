  "text": "I am wondering whether it's worth writing comments to the authors. My dilemma is this: If I'm rejecting the paper anyways, won't my (necessarily) negative comments about why be overkill? And yet if I can manage to frame it in terms of constructive criticism, it would look as though I'm recommending revisions and resubmission.\n\nI really believe this work is bad enough to toss out but I also don't want to be rude and leave no explanation. This is only my second reviewed paper - the first I recommended minor revisions and made detailed comments. If I do submit no comments to authors, I still will be filling out a detailed, confidential entry to the editor about why I decided it.  \n\n\nThanks  \n\n\nEDIT: For more detail, if I was to be completely honest my summary would be something like this: \"There is no original contribution. Although it's a review paper, the authors have not consolidated the information in the discussed papers in such a way that makes comparison between them meaningful, which doesn't help the reader understand the state of the art. There are also many pictures with watermarks that indicate they are not original pieces of work, but they are not cited by the authors. The quality of English is not adequate to follow easily.\"  ",

Your job as a reviewer is not just to render judgement but to provide that feedback. If you only render judgement, you have failed to do a significant portion of your job as a reviewer. Your concerns about overkill or appearing to be recommending something else are simply wrong. You need to clearly state up front what you are recommending and then structure your comments as both explanation and constructive criticism.

If I find fatal flaws in their reasoning, methods, etc., I point them out to the authors and even suggest how they could fruitfully address those flaws, so that if they want to submit the paper elsewhere, at least they've been given some advice that allows them to fix the issues that led me to reject the paper. \n\nI just consider this being professional and also (mostly in jest) racking up some \"reviewer karma\" - the worst reviews I have received are not necessarily the harshest reviews. They are reviews that do not contribute anything meaningful to the paper. At least harsh reviews give me a good sense of what I need to change before resubmitting. If you have comments about the paper, don't just tell the editor and leave the authors in the dark. Say what you have to say in a constructive way (but it's okay to be critical at the same time) so that the authors know what to fix. I personally would be very angry to get reviews back on a paper I submitted to a journal and see that one of the reviewers literally said nothing to me. If you don't want to provide authors with any sort of comment, then don't agree to be a reviewer.",

For example, would a review paper on this topic be useful to the field? If so then add that in and add a sentence encouraging them to keep working. Pointing out things that work well is helpful because it give the authors examples to work from, and tells them what doesn't need major revision. It also shows the authors that you really read their work and cared enough to give a detailed review, and you aren't just being negative for no reason. \n\nBut yeah, uncited figures borrowed from other sources is a blatent plagiarism issue.

My professor in governance taught me this: \"Approvals don't need reasons, but rejections do.\"\n\nYou should always provide some comments and ways to make the paper better. If the paper should be rejected (not edited), you should provide an explanation why the paper is not good for publication or not a good fit. At least there must be a section that's worse than the others, right?\n\nOf many, here are some of the comments for papers I rejected, written in a vague manner so I don't trip on anything bad:\n\n* The paper's methods were not clear, and some methods contradicted each other.\n* The methodology does not follow the objectives. (In my head: What the hell is this guy trying to prove?)\n* Based on the results presented, this is an incremental improvement based on Coauthor and Author (199X), and Author and Coauthor (200X). These papers weren't properly cited here. (Dear Editor: These fuckers are self-plagiarizing.)\n* The methodology is too similar to another paper on a similar topic. Ensure that they are properly cited before resubmission. (Dear Editor: Mine. These fuckers dare use my spells against me. You told me I can't recommend they cite me, so I'm telling you.)\n* The results omitted something and this isn't mathematically or scientifically acceptable. The improvements necessary will be too substantial to be edited in a timely manner.\n* The authors used an inappropriate sampling method without justification. This affects too much of the subsequent work and it's impossible to fix it without recruiting test subjects again.\n* The authors mixed up two experiments together and was unable to determine if the factors are independent from each other. Please go back to the drawing board and do one thing at a time, or convince your professor not to be so stingy about the materials.\n* The authors wrote only 3 sections. Yes, this is a students' conference, but you can't write just up to the methods and leave out the results. Dude, say something even if it isn't complete.\n\nPlease be clear and be direct about where this can be improved. Please do not be condescending or judgmental about it. State matter-of-factly about what's going on, and offer a clear way that the article will get more points the next time.",
