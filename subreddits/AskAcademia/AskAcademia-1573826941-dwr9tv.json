      "text": "Use zotero and set up collections and sub collections to categorize the papers you are reading. This helps in keeping stuff organized instead of being just one huge pile.\n\nThen when you take notes while reading papers, you can add an \"attachment\" to the zotero parent entry to store your notes. If you're taking handwritten notes, scan and make a pdf and then add it to the zotero parent item. Sometimes, I take notes in lyx or word. In that case, I simply attach the file to the parent item.\n\nFinally, set up zotero to store its database in your dropbox folder if you can **or** just back the folder up every once in a while to whatever service your prefer.\n\nMucking around with folders and renaming them and organizing them is a fools errand and I have realized that too late. Just let zotero handle all that low level nonsense.\n\nZotero is like itunes when it was at its peak design. It helps you organize everything.",

      "text": "Don't use Mendeley: they are owned by Elsevier, and so are now evil. Didn't use to be evil, but now they are.\n\nMany people use Zotero (open-source).\n\nI used to collect all stuff I read in one giant super-review, like a review of everything I know. But as my interests shifted and spread out, it became impossible.\n\nFor a while I had an Excel-like table (Google Sheets) with a paragraph written about every paper, and a list of papers I want too read. But now it became so huge that it takes 2 minutes to load, and I hate it. It's still kind of useful, as I use keywords as internal tags, but I stopped adding stuff to it.\n\nI also tried to run a personal wiki (aka \"Knowledge base\"). There are some great free wikis out there: Zim is great, then there's also Tomboy (aka Gnome), and Wiki that comes with any repo on GitHub. But it takes a bit of effort, and also I am kinda afraid to create a knowledge base with nooks and crannies, as I'm afraid to forget about some nooks and crannies. I want to be able to \"see everything\" every now and then, even if just to remind myself of what is out there.\n\nNow for about 2 weeks I'm trying a new approach, where for every paper I read I start a markdown file (using Typora editor, which is one of the coolest pieces of software I ever encountered). All of these markdowns are in a git repo that I synchronize with Github, which means that I have access to them from everywere. I know some really cool people that use this approach, so I hope it will work, but I haven't yet quite figured out my personal feelings about it. The actual test will happen at the point when I'll need to write something (an intro, or a review), and so will have to find all relevant papers on a topic. We'll see how easy it would be.\n\nMy \"knowledge base of dreams\" would probably look more like a database, a collection of cards, where every card is filed with a bunch of tags. And then I want to be able to see a tag cloud, and easily get all records for any given tag. It's relatively easy to organize something like that with Tomboy, but it's not automatic. I guess I could have written my own piece of software for that, but for now I'm lazy. Maybe I'll do it in the future; that could be fun actually, especially if it's based on markdown files, and so would be compatible with my current approach.",

      "text": "I'm currently at the beginning of my PhD, but this is a system I've used since 2015. I use endnote and Word simultaneously:\n\n**EndNote** (or any other reference manager): I find, index, tag with relevant keywords and sort references into folders based on topic. I also add the article PDF to the reference and mark out interesting sections. Unread articles are marked as \"unread\", and articles can be easily searched by looking through topic folders or searching for keywords.\n\n**Word**: I have a \"literature document\" where I have headings that are similar to the folders in EndNote.  I copy the article reference from EndNote and format it as a sub-heading, and while reading and marking in Endnote, I make short notes in the Word document. Then the navigation pane works as an index of the topics and related articles. I also always add page numbers to interesting information, so it's easy to go back to the text.  \nI have a list in the beginning of the document of articles I want to read, but haven't yet downloaded, indexed in EndNote or made notes of.   \nI also sometimes have notes for articles that aren't yet indexed in Endnote, and they are easy to find because the reference isn't formatted the same as the indexed ones. \n\nIt's a system that takes a bit of time to implement and follow up, but when I manage to use it properly it works really well. Saved my ass a bunch of times when trying to finish my masters in too little time.",
