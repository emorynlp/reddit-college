  "text": "History grad student here. I have been wondering for a while what people make of [\"footnote mining.\"](https://onelastsketch.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/footnote-mining-and-interdisciplinary-research/)\n\nBy that I mean: When I do my reading of the secondary literature before starting to write an article/book chapter, I often try to look up and locate the sources in the footnotes/endnotes. This often is a good way to find relevant secondary literature and primary sources. Now, when I later end up citing secondary literature and (more importantly) primary sources first found in another historian's work, it is my understanding that I do not have to acknowledge where I found the source, but can simply cite the original source (for example the primary source that I first learned about in another historian's work but then located myself) and do not have to add something like \"also see/also cited in....\". \n\nAm I correct that this is generally seen as acceptable? A quick search on google seems to suggest so:\n\n[https://onelastsketch.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/footnote-mining-and-interdisciplinary-research/](https://onelastsketch.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/footnote-mining-and-interdisciplinary-research/)\n\n[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/\\~myl/languagelog/archives/004608.html](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004608.html)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/dz4cnx/do\\_i\\_need\\_to\\_acknowledge\\_it\\_if\\_a\\_primary\\_source\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/dz4cnx/do_i_need_to_acknowledge_it_if_a_primary_source_i/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am wondering where one would draw the line? Using a few primary sources that another historian working on a similar topic has used as well is surely fine and probably unavoidable. But what if it is more than that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Like the others said: yes, \"footnote mining\" as a way to find references is fine.\n\nI might be stating the obvious here, but what is NOT fine, however, is to just add such references to your paper. You should only cite references that you yourself have read, i.e., don't believe other people's claims about a reference, check them by yourself. Otherwise you need to attribute the claims to the publication where you found the footnote. In other words, there IS a difference between \"As discussed by Biden et al., Trump et al. make a number of claims about the voting system of the US\" and \"Trump et al. make a number of claims about the US voting system.\" , and you can use sentences like the 2nd one only if you've read (and understood...) the Trump et al. paper.",

              "text": "Because of the citation statistics of recognized reviews, I think people just directly learn from reviews in practice. In a way that makes sense, the originals are normally shooting in the dark, so the concepts and notation are all mixed up and confusing. It's only with the perspective of a few years that people can tell a more coherent story in a review.\n\nPlus there's the problem of volume: a given result many times is spread out over the publications of an entire community in the span of years, whereas in a review it can be simply stated as its own lemma in a few lines. Of course you'll get the most out of it if you read the entire literature, but in practice nobody's got time for that. So as long as the proof presented in the review is robust, I'd go with staying at the review level 9 times out of 10.",

Database search won't find everything, and it's an imperfect tool for telling you how important an article is. Those references get added to the list (with a record of how you found them) and reviewed to the same standard as articles found by other means.\n\nThe reviews themselves can be used many different ways. If a review is directly relevant to research I plan to do, I follow up many, maybe all, of its references depending on their relevance. If it's a supportive or peripheral concept, or I'm summarizing a body of work, I may stop at reading the review or use it to find just a few articles that are most directly relevant to my research. I also use them any time I wade into a topic that is new to me, so I'm aware of good search terms and generally what I should expect to find. I've developed measurements based on research themes identified by reviewers, too.",

Footnotes also can highlight unique or interesting sources which you may not considered, such as a diary you didn\u2019t know was published, or a report which doesn\u2019t appear in the normal archival record.

You have to give credit to the original author because it's not your own thought. And if you did't read a source, you can't be sure if the secondary source is telling the \"truth\".

I'm guessing you are young enough to never have used published (paper) bibliographies, or even \"bibliographies of bibliographies,\" which was how you found the former. You don't have to cite a path to a source any more than you would cite Google if it turned up a primary source or an article in Google scholar.  You are 100% correct that you must actually *read* said source yourself of course, but once you've done that there's no reason to say \"I found this source in Smith\" or anyplace else. Cite the document you use, not the tools that helped you find it.",

I'm writing about the river crossings of Alexander the Great right now. When reading and using academic works that cite Herodotus or Xenophon, I wouldn't cite the original article because I have these sources at home, read them and so on. But if the athor used a source I never heard of, that's different, no? Because using this and that source in that specific scholarly context wasn't my original idea. Therefore I thought, I have to give credit. (at least theoretically, no saying I always do this)\n\nThat's how I learned it anyways.",

There's no way in hell I would have found all of those without piggybacking on the works of other historians-- and never once my footnotes did I say \"I found this source in X's notes.\" That simply isn't something we do; if I did my editor would have insisted it all be cut.
