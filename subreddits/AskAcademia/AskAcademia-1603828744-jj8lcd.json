  "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/dt2s3l/i_think_ive_just_failed_my_phd/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nOriginal post above.\n\nIt's been ages. Since the post, I was given a few opportunities to fix the issues with my thesis and then submit for a PhD.\n\nI tried, and tried, and then hit a point. I just couldn't do it. So instead I went for a downgrade in the form on an MPhil. \n\nHappy to say it's done! It's not what I set out for, but I'm still super happy. I've got a great job, and get to use loads of the skills that I developed during the PhD. \n\nIt's not academia, but has provided good training for the future",

Take it from a colleague masochist, it takes a brave person to stand up and first recognise the situation for what it is, and then go against what most of us have been trained for for the better part of our lives and say - enough is enough. Good job! It's like a superpower. The skill that is actually necessary in life, I believe.\nIt must feel liberating. Go you ;)",

There are many different paths in life that we can walk when it comes to our careers, and choosing one that makes you happy is not a failure. Congratulations on your success!",

It feels like a huge weight has been lifted. The last year I was only going through the motions and really sacrificing time with my children and my mental health in the process. I still have 4 degrees, great job opportunities as a nurse and can now pursue the degree I originally wanted to be a psych nurse practitioner.",
