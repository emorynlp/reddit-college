(for the students.)\n\nWe're humans.  Humans are (like all animals) quite *lazy*.  (This is not a flaw, but an adaptive trait--save energy whenever you can, so that you have the energy/fat reserves for when it's necessary, in fighting or hunting.)\n\nIn academia, humans work better when pushed.   (A huge caveat:  not all forms of pressure are useful or productive.  And everyone responds to pressure in different ways...) \n\nBut basically, I've found that the more (supportive, good-natured) pressure I put on students, the more effort that most students put into the class, and the more they learn and grow.  That's just a fact. \n\nIn fact, this has been recognized over thousands of years of teaching, going all the way back to Socrates. \n\nNow, however, there's a not-so-subtle pushback developing, saying that students shouldn't be pressured, that they all \"learn and grow at their own pace\". \n\nHmm.  \n\nThe fact is, only a *tiny* fraction of students have the capacity for true self-motivation.  I'd say, based on my two decades of teaching at a university, that about 1 in a 1000 students are true \"self-starters.\"  The rest--myself included--need deadlines, need social pressure and peer pressure (everyone's studying for finals, I'd better study too), need to be faced with high standards (\"damn I so badly want to quit and watch videos, but I got a C on my last paper, so I'd better do another 2 or 3 rounds of editing\"), in order to actually reach our potential. \n\n(Note:  this is NOT an excuse for a professor to be an asshole who belittles students.  That's exactly the kind of pressure that doesn't work, because it provokes anger and/or resistance and/or despair, not engagement and/or re-commitment to work harder.)\n\nBut lowering standards just hurts students.  Period.   \n\n(best thing that ever happened to me was to get an \"F\" on my first real college paper.)  \n\nSo when I see this quotation, it's usually a subtle or not-so-subtle hint to make my classes easier.   And I hate that.  It's making us dumber as a society.",

The vast majority of students would be 100% okay with being handed a passing grade, and even given a degree, without learning a thing.\n\nThe whole concept of \"self directed learning\" at an undergrad level is silly.",

      "text": "I agree with your first statement. I suppose I simply can't image there being a single way of learning and of personal growth that would be applicable for each and everyone of us. Difference is key. Otherwise one might be able to establish a rough period of time needed for each and every student for learning, for instance, Freudian psycho-analysis. Perhaps we can calculate a rough time frame for getting the basics across, but which aspects of those fundamentals will be acquired by each student varies and therefore, again, implies difference. \n\nRegarding the second statement: I do but it perhaps depends on a variety of factors like your own expectations, *which* academia it is we are talking about (academic practices vary from field to field and country to country) or your socio-economic background. Just take this last point as an example: Being more flexible when it comes to time management is crucial for being able to learn and grow \"at your own pace\". Students from wealthy backgrounds or at university programs which pay scholarships and such are therefore at a great advantage over students from trickier circumstances. \n\nNow imagine you're doing an undergraduate program without any type of scholarship while having a kid, while needing to work, without having a family that helps you out, etc. I believe in most cases academia isn't able and/or willing to permit those people the flexibility that \"studying and growing at your own pace\" would require. It is, after all, a system put in place in very concrete socio-cultural and historic contexts. It goes without saying that academia is not only about learning and growing. One might even argue that those aspects were never a fundamental part of what academia constitutes. There are hierarchies, expectations, external influences from politics, from the economy, even religion, etc.",

Taking things slower can be good or bad, depending on the student and the subject field. Too slow will kill the motivation! The rhythm of the academic year has always been good for me, but I will say the students in the last five years have had more trouble than those I taught in the decade before that. My students now are perfectly smart and interesting, but they do worse on assessments every year. They are less and less literate and their attention spans are shorter. I had one person with reading difficulty in the entire decade between 2008 and 2018 in my college classes. It was so unusual that I changed my syllabus around to try to help (it didn't--still resulted in a dropout). Now close to 1/3 of my students are having difficulty with reading assignments of longer than 3-5 pages per class session. They can read things like texts and emails (and I assume labels and signs) just fine, and they can read the words of something, but understanding a big chunk of text is hard. Now most of my quizzes and exams are of the \"can you read and understand this passage?\" type, because I am actually teaching reading skill and not so much literary studies. In college. To literature and language majors, who have self-selected for the kind of thing I teach. I think technology has been very disruptive to the human brain.",
