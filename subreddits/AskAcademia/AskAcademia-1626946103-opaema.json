  "text": "Have completed my PhD and checked all of the references. Unfortunately, all of them seem to have shifted one down (i.e. reference 1 is showing as reference 2). When I right click on each reference and use the Mendeley tool in Word, it shows that it's the correct reference. However, it's just displaying the wrong citation in-text. Anyone had a similar problem?\n\nMacbook Pro (M1), Word, Office 365 if that helps.",
