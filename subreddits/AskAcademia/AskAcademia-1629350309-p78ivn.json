  "text": "I got a research assistantship job offer from a lab with a super productive PI. She publishes 30-50 papers a year in computer science conferences and journals (some of them in very top conferences). However, I\u2019m a little concerned about: \n\n1- I\u2019m intimidated. Can I catch up with that speed? Also I\u2019m concerned about work life balance in her lab and afraid she makes me work 24/7!\n\n2- She and all 10-15 people in her lab are from a same country. Lack of diversity! Is this important?\n\n3- How can you actively involve and contribute in 40 papers in one year. \n\nAny experience or opinions is very much appreciated. Thanks",

The head of my lab during my PhD shows up as the last author of my papers, but he didn't actually contribute anything to the work. \n\n2. Depends on why that's the case. Does she only recruit foreign PhD students and post-docs from her country in order to ensure that her group is totally dependent on her while lacking a local support structure? Have you talked to people about the vibe in the group/work-life balance? \n\n3. It's highly unlikely that you'd be involved 40 papers. Talk to her about setting more specific expectations for you personally.",

On the other hand, if she is recruiting only from her home country, this would be a red flag for me. If you want to a private life in a country, you need some local coworkers to start integrating.

Maybe even worked with the same person? ;)\n\nNo, you\u2019re not expected to work on 40 projects a year, but my experience with this kind of PI is that they\u2019re extremely impatient and will not be willing to understand that it might take you longer than \u201cnormal\u201d to understand some concepts in however many projects you\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s also because they have set-in-stone schedules regarding each of their 40 projects, and any \u201cdelay\u201d due to you will not be looked upon kindly. \n\nLack of diversity is extremely important! Especially if the local language that everyone speaks is not one you\u2019re fluent in \u2014 definitely do not take this offer if this is the case. Talk to people in the lab, but more importantly, to people who work in the department (even with a different PI) but are not from this same country. Must do: see if you can find out a list of ex-employees over the last few years, and email them. If it\u2019s as prolific a lab as you say, there must\u2019ve been at least *some* applicants from other countries. Either they are not being hired, or they\u2019re leaving really quickly into their contract. Neither of those are good signs. My experience was that 4 of us (out of 25) didn\u2019t speak the local language (even though the working language was supposedly English), while the entire group knew this but continued to speak the local language around us, and 3 of us quit within the year. So that kind of attrition is definitely a warning sign. \n\nOne more thing, which might or might not apply: do not take your PI at her word when she describes the lab experience to you. It\u2019s entirely up to you to make enquiries and find out what it\u2019s really like, and the easiest way is to contact ex-employees who might not have as much to lose by painting a negative, yet true, picture.",
