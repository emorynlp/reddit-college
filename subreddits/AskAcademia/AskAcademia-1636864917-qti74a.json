  "title:": "Assessing low evaluation response rates for eventual tenure review",
  "text": "Hello,\nI\u2019m a lecturer in my fourth year at a university, teaching in the arts. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have some high evaluation scores (generally around the 7 mark on a scale of 1-7) for many of the semesters I have been teaching. That said, there have been a few anomalies along the way: For one, I really did a poor job my second semester by assuming students would take the evals as seriously as my first semester students had. Though I had stressed their importance, my response rate was low, under 50%. Additionally, my second year, I actually had a class that\u2019s scheduled ending was literally the week that we went into shutdown due to Covid, in March 2020. In truth, there was so much disarray then and students and I were no longer in face to face contact - response rate was 50%. Lastly, I had a major medical emergency last spring and had to leave the semester for two months at which time the evaluation response was very very low as I was not able to facilitate these evaluations when on leave. \nI\u2019m back teaching and very involved in committees, outside research, enjoying the support of my faculty with great peer reviews, and continue to research outside the university to hone my profession. Aside from these few semesters, I\u2019m curious as to how much of an effect these unfortunate response rate semesters will have on my tenure review down the road. It\u2019s definitely caused a lot of anxiety in me. I know that I can support my case regarding my medical leave and that the period of Covid was especially unique in effecting everyone. But wondering if that unique time would be taken into consideration upon review. I\u2019m just curious as to how much these few anomalies in my record can shift my trajectory.\nThanks in advance for any input.",

      "text": "First off, do you know what the average response rates were for other courses in your department? It\u2019s possible you\u2019re not as low as you think. I know that once our department moved from paper evaluations to electronic, response rates tanked. \n\nBut even if you are, you can\u2019t really infer anything about the instructor from low response rates. I can tell you that I\u2019ve had some courses where only 20% of students fill out evals. That was never mentioned once during my tenure review. The only reference to evaluations in any of the letters I received were to the generally high marks.",

      "text": "I'm a retired chair. On our campus, student evaluations are a pretty big deal. But, chairs have a lot of discretion concerning anomalies. Such things are mentioned in annual evaluations by chairs and once that happens, the faculty member can use that as part of their own tenure/promotion review applications. So, for example, a chair might notes that a given semester's evaluations were lower than typical and it's likely because the faculty member was ill for much of the semester and so the chair is going to discount that semester's evaluations. That then means that the faculty member make note of the chair's evaluation for that year in their application and leaves those student evaluations out of their own calculations. \n\nBUT, there are also pretty significant differences in how chairs respond to such things. There's a chair who would search for individual negative comments in student evaluations and focus on those. Most of us are human beings, however, and treat student evaluations seriously but as only one smallish part of an overall faculty evaluation.\n\nI'd suggest that you have a chat with your chair about those evaluations and see how s/he views them. If they're a really big deal to your chair then you'll need to find a way to have an ongoing set of really good ones to discount the lesser ones. If you can do that, when it's time to write your tenure application, I'd suggest that you mention the poor ones and the suggested reason in just a couple of sentences but really focus on the better ones. If your chair views them as a one-off, then you really don't have anything to worry about. Of course, some institutions don't seem to worry about student evaluations much at all. If you're at one of those places then I think you'll be fine without worrying about it, at all.\n\nAs an aside, in my experience it's pretty easy to get high response rates on student evaluations. I'd simply mention them in class when they were opened to students and tell them how important they are in my personal evaluation of what I'm doing as well as to future students who I'll be teaching. I'd mention them every day as response rates would go up and jokingly tell them that they're going to hear about them until at least 75% of students responded. I'd almost always get response rates that high. I had colleagues who would simply take students to a computer lab during class one day and ask them to log in and do the evaluation. Her response rates were in the 90% range! But, I never did that because I didn't want to give up a full class period for that task.",
