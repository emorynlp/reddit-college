  "text": "Seeing as the academic year is just beginning at my institution, things have been really quiet since my supervisor is busy sorting the latest batch of undergraduate students they need to teach or look after.\n\nThis leaves me in quite a predicament insofar as I'm stuck waiting for them to get back to me which leaves me with technically nothing to do. \n\nI'm filling my time by revising my code and looking for articles but I can't do much until they get back to me and hold a joint meeting with my co supervisor since they want to change aspects of my project. \n\nI'm essentially stuck high and dry until they get in touch with me. \n\nWhat should I do?",
