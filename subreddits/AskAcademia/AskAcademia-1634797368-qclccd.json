  "text": "I am an upper year grad candidate (6th year), finishing up soon. I am currently teaching (as in directing) a 3rd year undergrad course. My students all call me Professor, but I'm not listed on the dept website as an instructor (the website is old and seldom updated, they only put me in as a grad student in my 4th year) - tho I am listed as a professor on RateMyProfs (not a valid credential I know)\n\nRecently I introduced myself as a prof at my university teaching one course to my neighbours. One of them emailed me saying that she is a \"lifetime academic\" who googled me and found out that I'm also a grad student and told me not to call myself a prof since I was a graduate student. I haven't been able to find her on any of the usual academic websites, so I can't really corroborate this fact. My field and my university (Canada) is pretty informal and doesn't really gate-keep these titles as much as other fields, so I never thought much of it, but should I stop saying that I'm a professor while I'm a grad student? When would I be able to use the term professor? (Adjuncts are called lecturers here, but they are all addressed as Professor)\n\nEdit: I was not asking anyone to call me prof. This is a neighbourhood casual conversation in a non academic setting, and I just couldn\u2019t think of a good way to describe my job. My only income is through teaching a course. I don\u2019t have graduate funding",

Calling you anything else would have been rude. Just because your students mistakenly call you professor because they don't understand the hierarchy and you're in a position that appears to them to be a professor doesn't mean you can identify as a more senior employee of an organisation. This is a big no no in any job and you can be fired for falsifying your previous experience.",

You told her and the rest of the room you were a professor when you aren't. \n\nI'm a senior member of staff at research institute. I often fill in for the director of our research institute at various events and functions. Although I'm fulfilling some aspects of his job it would be ridiculous and totally inappropriate for me to introduce myself as ACatGod Director of the Institute. Just because you're doing a job that shares some similarity with another job it doesn't mean you get to inflate your title. \n\nBy telling people you're a professor you are falsifying your experience. You are claiming to hold a post you do not, and a post that requires a qualification and experience you don't hold to boot. It's totally inappropriate and I'm baffled as to how you can't see that. You aren't a professor. You don't hold any job with the title professor. You don't do the work of a professor. You don't even have the minimum qualification to be a professor.",

You seem to be trying to worm out of taking responsibility by  focussing on use of the title \"professor\" and trying to suggest that because some people call any teacher professor you are entitled to present yourself as someone holding employment as a professor. That argument does not hold water. \n\nNext you're trying to push the blame on to this woman and discredit her by a) implying she might not be an academic and b) that she's stalking you by looking up publicly available information and contacting your boss. It doesn't matter if she's an academic, she's still right. Furthermore, you publicly misrepresented yourself as an employee of University X and she is perfectly entitled to alert your employer that you are misrepresnting their organisation. \n\nThis behaviour is a really bad look and while the initial transgression suggests poor judgement, it's not that big a deal. However, your attempts to wriggle out of responsibility for your own actions by attempting to discredit the person who quite rightly called you out by trying to belittle her qualifications and then by throwing accusations and reversing who is the offender here is classic DARVO behaviour. Deny, Argue, Reverse Victim and Offender. If that's the route you're going to take with your boss, if they raise it, then you have much bigger problems and I hope they throw the book at you. You seriously need to consider your personal integrity and the values you want to build your life and career on.",

      "text": "The title Professor has lots of meanings.  Please note I'm writing from the perspective of the US.\n\nWhen someone is an instructor for a university level class, students may refer to that instructor as Prof LastName as a default.  Individual instructors (or the norms of a particular institution) may dictate something different, but this is the default way to refer to the person leading the class.  This honorific does not convey any particular job title or degree.  It can be used for a graduate student that is the instructor of record of a class.  It can be used for a person with a master's degree that is an adjunct professor.  It can be used with someone with a full time non-tenure track position like Lecturer or Instructor.  And it can be used for tenure-track faculty (ie, assistant professor, associate professor, or professor).  \n\nIn the US, it is typical to refer to grade school teachers as Mr/Ms LastName.  Using Prof LastName in the classroom distinguished being a college instructor.  Also, please note I'm talking default, should not offend anyone, language.  \n\nProfessor is also a job type.  A professor is someone employed at the university to teach at least teach, but often have research and service expectations also.  Anyone that has a full time faculty appointment can use the line \"I'm a professor at XXX University.\"  I would even include people that are lecturers or instructors, though I know that is not a universal opinion.  Better would be to say \"I'm a faculty member at XXX University\" or \"I teach at XXX University.\"  Adjunct professors are a little more grey area.  I honestly would not think anything if someone told me \"I'm a lawyer and I'm also a professor at XXX Law School\" meaning that they adjunct teach a class there.  But once again, better phrasing would be to say I'm on faculty.  While I'm a Professor (as in job title), I am also an adjunct at a different university.  When I refer to that, I will say, I also have a faculty appointment at XXXX Med School.  \n\nProfessor is also a job title.  These are Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor (often referred to as full Professor).  There are also modifiers such as Research Assistant Professor, Clinical Associate Professor, Visiting Assistant Professor, Professor of Practice, etc.  This is the strictest, \"I'm a Professor\".  \n\nAs for your situation, you are first a grad student.  Even if you are the lead instructor for a course, you are still a trainee.  To use any other title implies that you are skipping the trainee phase and jumping to the post-training employment phase.  Also, the reason you are teaching classes is not because you were hired to teach.  Instead, you are teaching because you are a doc student.  \n\nThis was especially difficult for me to navigate.  In the last two years of my PhD program, I was actually on faculty as a full time Instructor teaching 4 classes a semester.  I had faculty parking, a faculty ID, a faculty office in their suite (though the smallest one), and attended faculty meetings.  I even had a grad student assigned to me as a TA (granted the guy nobody else wanted).  All of that being said, I was still a PhD student, so I never used the term professor to describe me.  During those two years, I would often either say I was a grad student or that I taught at the university.   \n\nAll of that being said, in your position, you should not tell anyone that you are a professor.  You are a grad student.  But, if the students in your class call you Prof LastName, that is appropriate.  There is no honorific for grad student, and saying Mr/Ms LastName is not often appropriate, and of course you are not Dr. LastName yet either.  If you find that confusing or uncomfortable, then ask your students to use your First Name.",

Because of this without getting into this whole thing.  Here, were taught that k to 12 are teachers and we call them MR/Mrs. But once you get to post secondary it's Professor and that's the respectful term to use. \n\nHonestly it reeks of colonial hedgemony because some highschool teachers have way more education than alot of undergrad  lecturers, especially in larger schools who have graduate programs. It's starting to change now, even in smaller  unis with no grad programs, but you only need to be a grad student in order to teach a standardized undergrad course here, for example intro to research methods or something. But in order to teach grad or PhD you have to have a PhD. (At least this is what I understand from what I've observed and been told by various lectures). \n\nThis could explain why how classes are taught changes from lecture to seminar (I teach you, I have more knowledge and therefore you must bow to my superior knowledge and position  into we are more equals, I will facilitate this direction by choosing what materials we use and these are topics I want to know about from you, therefore slightly less hedgemonic and more mentorship based on experience, not 'rank'.

      "text": "If someone calls you Professor or a professor (e.g. ah then you're like a professor), you don't necessarily have to correct them.\n\nIf someone asks you what you do, you shouldn't say that you're a professor. Even if they ask you back \"are you a professor?\" I would refrain from saying yes and try to correct them as they might spread the word that you said you are a professor.\n\nIt's like if you have a hearing with a court magistrate, you can't go wrong with calling them your honor since they might even like it and at worst they would be indifferent. It matters if they call themselves judges becaise they are not.",
