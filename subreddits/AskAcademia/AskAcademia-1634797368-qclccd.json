  "text": "I am an upper year grad candidate (6th year), finishing up soon. I am currently teaching (as in directing) a 3rd year undergrad course. My students all call me Professor, but I'm not listed on the dept website as an instructor (the website is old and seldom updated, they only put me in as a grad student in my 4th year) - tho I am listed as a professor on RateMyProfs (not a valid credential I know)\n\nRecently I introduced myself as a prof at my university teaching one course to my neighbours. One of them emailed me saying that she is a \"lifetime academic\" who googled me and found out that I'm also a grad student and told me not to call myself a prof since I was a graduate student. I haven't been able to find her on any of the usual academic websites, so I can't really corroborate this fact. My field and my university (Canada) is pretty informal and doesn't really gate-keep these titles as much as other fields, so I never thought much of it, but should I stop saying that I'm a professor while I'm a grad student? When would I be able to use the term professor? (Adjuncts are called lecturers here, but they are all addressed as Professor)\n\nEdit: I was not asking anyone to call me prof. This is a neighbourhood casual conversation in a non academic setting, and I just couldn\u2019t think of a good way to describe my job. My only income is through teaching a course. I don\u2019t have graduate funding",

      "text": "The title Professor has lots of meanings.  Please note I'm writing from the perspective of the US.\n\nWhen someone is an instructor for a university level class, students may refer to that instructor as Prof LastName as a default.  Individual instructors (or the norms of a particular institution) may dictate something different, but this is the default way to refer to the person leading the class.  This honorific does not convey any particular job title or degree.  It can be used for a graduate student that is the instructor of record of a class.  It can be used for a person with a master's degree that is an adjunct professor.  It can be used with someone with a full time non-tenure track position like Lecturer or Instructor.  And it can be used for tenure-track faculty (ie, assistant professor, associate professor, or professor).  \n\nIn the US, it is typical to refer to grade school teachers as Mr/Ms LastName.  Using Prof LastName in the classroom distinguished being a college instructor.  Also, please note I'm talking default, should not offend anyone, language.  \n\nProfessor is also a job type.  A professor is someone employed at the university to teach at least teach, but often have research and service expectations also.  Anyone that has a full time faculty appointment can use the line \"I'm a professor at XXX University.\"  I would even include people that are lecturers or instructors, though I know that is not a universal opinion.  Better would be to say \"I'm a faculty member at XXX University\" or \"I teach at XXX University.\"  Adjunct professors are a little more grey area.  I honestly would not think anything if someone told me \"I'm a lawyer and I'm also a professor at XXX Law School\" meaning that they adjunct teach a class there.  But once again, better phrasing would be to say I'm on faculty.  While I'm a Professor (as in job title), I am also an adjunct at a different university.  When I refer to that, I will say, I also have a faculty appointment at XXXX Med School.  \n\nProfessor is also a job title.  These are Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor (often referred to as full Professor).  There are also modifiers such as Research Assistant Professor, Clinical Associate Professor, Visiting Assistant Professor, Professor of Practice, etc.  This is the strictest, \"I'm a Professor\".  \n\nAs for your situation, you are first a grad student.  Even if you are the lead instructor for a course, you are still a trainee.  To use any other title implies that you are skipping the trainee phase and jumping to the post-training employment phase.  Also, the reason you are teaching classes is not because you were hired to teach.  Instead, you are teaching because you are a doc student.  \n\nThis was especially difficult for me to navigate.  In the last two years of my PhD program, I was actually on faculty as a full time Instructor teaching 4 classes a semester.  I had faculty parking, a faculty ID, a faculty office in their suite (though the smallest one), and attended faculty meetings.  I even had a grad student assigned to me as a TA (granted the guy nobody else wanted).  All of that being said, I was still a PhD student, so I never used the term professor to describe me.  During those two years, I would often either say I was a grad student or that I taught at the university.   \n\nAll of that being said, in your position, you should not tell anyone that you are a professor.  You are a grad student.  But, if the students in your class call you Prof LastName, that is appropriate.  There is no honorific for grad student, and saying Mr/Ms LastName is not often appropriate, and of course you are not Dr. LastName yet either.  If you find that confusing or uncomfortable, then ask your students to use your First Name.",

Honestly the whole system is hard to navigate as an immigrant and a first generation academic and whenever I make a mistake or ask a question, I get a lot of pushback (see comments on this thread). Academia is toxic enough as is. \n\nI am teaching at a different institution than my grad studies and I\u2019ve run out of grad funding so this is my only income so I didn\u2019t know. I let my students call me professor and I think I won\u2019t correct them now because the point is moot. But I don\u2019t insist on them calling me anything and sign my emails with my full name.",

It's starting to change now, even in smaller  unis with no grad programs, but you only need to be a grad student in order to teach a standardized undergrad course here, for example intro to research methods or something. But in order to teach grad or PhD you have to have a PhD.

          "text": "I think  cultural hegemony is a great way to describe this. I do the same with my students. Also the whole dependence on rank is very colonial -  like the refusal to invite Elders to speak in my university because they \"don't have a PhD\". People shouldn't have to subscribe to a Western idea of rank in order to be an expert on something, especially Indigenous people who have been trodden down so much by the academy that they don't trust academics anymore\n\nThank you for your long response. I have learned a lot (and come to realize my department is a lot nicer and more chill than most people here) In the future, I will ask the grad subreddit instead.",
