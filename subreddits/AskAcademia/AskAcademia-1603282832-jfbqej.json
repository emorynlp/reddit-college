  "text": "Hi all.\n\nI am sure I am not the first to consider quitting a PhD, it is a lot more intense than I ever realised (and I knew it would be), so much more stressful (esp with covid-19 happening) and I am realising more and more it might not be for me. I made this list:\n\nIs a phd for me?\n\nYes:\n\n\u00b7 I love research\n\n\u00b7 I enjoy writing (sometimes)\n\n\u00b7 I want to be a dr\n\n\\- i love my topic and am passionate about it \n\nNo:\n\n\u00b7 It is not needed for my future career (career prospects pretty much remain the same because research roles are all desk based and I want a more practical job)\n\n\\-  i feel like the topic would be better helped practically - theorising everything doesnt so much to solve  a problem\n\n\u00b7 I am struggling so much I just the first year that I am worried about the 3rd/4th years\n\n\u00b7 Im not really botheredto do the fieldwork for a year. I don\u2019t want to take another year out travelling/learning etc. \n\n\u00b7 I want to work: save money for a apartment, a car, general life. I also want to climb the career ladder\n\n\u00b7 It is really really really stressful and aniexty ridden\n\n\u00b7 I have no desire to be in academia\n\n I also have a complex: a high school teacher told me once  I would be a failure once in life, and she is OBVIOUSLY wrong, but it stuck with me. That b\\*tchis a dr and I wanted to prove I could be one too. To myself. but why am I allowing this to encompass who I am and what I am worth? \n\nBut at the same time: my list of No\u2019s is obviously longer but I cant bring myself to give up/not do it. But I also really don\u2019t wanna do the fieldwork, im scared of how much work the write up will be and im terrified of the WIP.\n\ndespite all of the evidence pointing to quit and get rid of this stess - i just cant seem to bring myself to do it. instead, i have actually been working on my phd? i am so confused by MYSELF in all of this.\n\npls help guys, im going crazy.",

My advice though is to make sure it\u2019s true and the most important way to do that is to find a job (read: get an offer) that you want to accept that you are qualified for right now and that you see a future with. Talk to people who do that job (or similar) at different levels, if possible, and make sure it\u2019s work you would like to do. You aren\u2019t going to feel better later and you\u2019ll instead feel like you\u2019ve wasted even more time.",

Like being a dr should not be on the pro list (in my opinion). A titile isn't really something to be looking for in life in order to gain validation from others. Why does someone who seemed to have wronged you have so much weight in your life? Like you're 22/23 I imagine? At what age will you not care what that one teacher once thought of you?",

I can't tell you what makes the most sense for you, but by definition, when you do something, you give up the opportunity to do something else.  \n\nThere's no doubt that you *can* do the PhD.  Fuck your old high school teacher.  You know you can.  The people who know you best know you can.  Getting the degree to prove to her that she's wrong isn't going to get you anywhere.  You can get it to prove to yourself that she's wrong, but you already know she is.  \n\nSo, if you get the degree, you'll have accomplished something that very few people have.  You'll be well versed in whatever field you're in, and you'll have refined the skills necessary to do so.  All great things.  And in return, you'll likely be less financially stable than others your age, and may have fewer life experiences (e.g. as you said, and as I've seen, friends who didn't go to grad school had the opportunity to travel, and to develop hobbies that those in grad school didn't have while in school.

It should be worth the experience you are having now, not something down the road, since there is very often not a clear \"payout\" to a doctoral program.  \n\n\nI really enjoyed doing my graduate degrees. (Well, 90% of the time.) I hoped that it might provide some value to me beyond that enjoyment, and I did end up in academia where it is something of a required credential. But I never expected it would. I did it because I enjoyed learning in that context. I think that's the best reason to stay in a program, and if you're not feeling it, find work outside the program that brings you more meaning.",

      "text": "Academia is weird in that it somehow becomes a huge part of our identity. So stopping being an academia often feels like giving up a part of ourself.  \nI finished my PhD in March and was somewhat hellbent on staying in academia, because it felt like giving up or failing. I invested years in being where I am and I like to believe that I generally fared quite good. I already got postdoc offers, so moving on with this career would have been easy. But this is where the first problems arose: Offers abroad, partner unwilling to move there. And it wouldn't be our last move. Granny got sick, now I live within 2 hours car drive of her and my family, then at least 10 hours with an airplane. Salary. Realization that I won't have any job security for at least 10 more years, so how to plan kids/house/etc? \nThe more I though about it, the more negatives I found, not with the particular postdoc offers but general things about the academic lifestyle I don't agree with.\n\nBut honestly, what really helped me to do the jump from academia to industry was finding a job I was sure I would love. Before that, I was unsure. I didn't really want to give up, especially not for a stupid generic IT or consulting or whatever job. Finding that job helped me immensely to \"pull the plug\" because now I am confident that I'll do something I like and I actually see it as an even bigger adventure and challenge than staying in academia and doing \"more of the same\".  \nYou currently have a position, so why not look at openings \"just for fun\", without pressure? Start reading job openings to see what you could do with your current education (or where you might want to improve, if you stay at your PhD position). See if companies you like have any type of \"orientation day\" offer, with the pandemic they actually got a bit more accessible, since everything moved online. When you like a position: consider applying. In worst case, you'll have collected some experience in applying or even being interviewed, which will be handy in life no matter which path you go. Or you find a job or at least a direction you want to work at.\n\nAlso try to see all the other successes you achieved and that clearly proved that your teacher is an ass. Having a stable and well-paying job is probably an even bigger success than that stupid title, so moving on might actually help you finding some peace in that direction, too. \n\nIf you want to connect to some other \"suffers\", you can also join us at /r/LeavingAcademia.",

The only reason I hesitate in advising OP to quit now is because they say they love research, even though they say they don't need a PhD to advance in their field. OP, before you quit your program, take some time to explore the pros and cons of research opportunities available in \"industries\" within your field of interest. For me, I definitely could have landed a research-related role in my field without a PhD, but I would have been limited in what I could do in that role. For example, I am specifically asked to design and run studies in my field in my current non-academic position, which I can guarantee would have never happened if I hadn't pursued a PhD, I probably would have been in charge of data collection on someone else's study at best. But I think the degree to which these limitations exist varies greatly by field. So, start looking around and figuring out both what you want as a person, and what's available to you with and without a PhD. Once you start seeing how your personal goals line up with PhD vs. non-PhD opportunities, I think the best choice for you will be clearer. \n\nAnd never pursue anything for a title/shiny gold star. A lot of the most miserable people I know have done this, and it's a big reason why they're so miserable.\n\nAnd your teacher was/is an ass.",

              "text": "Yeah, your last point is definitely true. For all jobs that don't have a PhD as a hard requirement working experience is often worth a lot more than an extra degree. For some jobs a PhD can make landing an entry level position a bit easier, but some companies will also tackle that with \"You have no idea about the corporate world\" and will see it as a big negative and kind of view you as \"tainted\" by academia. The longer you stay in academia, the more companies might be reluctant to give you a chance.\n\nYou otherwise would need to concentrate on other skills your studies gave you. As a PhD you can always claim ability to work independently on a project, leadership and supervision (depending on your program), collaborative skills and communication, writing and presentation skills and of course the ability and drive to learn new things. If you would want to have a role associated with these, you could add a formal certificate and try to make that into a job.  \nI am not familiar where social scientists can end up, my friends (STEM) went into project management, consulting, patent law, PR for scientific communication or technical/medical writing.\n\nI suspect you have checked whether you can \"Master out\" instead, to get the benefit of having something to show for the time you invested but also being able to shorten your time there?",

Assign each pro/con a score, then see which category has the biggest score.\n\nIt's ok to do a PhD just because you want to learn and read and write etc., even if you won't need it for your future career. The downside of that is you'll lose potential wages because you'll spend several years making like $20k when you could be making $60k if you were in the workforce, but for some people that is totally worth it.\n\nKeep in mind that the difficulty and anxiety will not increase year after year. At my alma mater program, the first year was the most stressful, and it got much easier after 3rd year.\n\nIf I were you, I'd wait until the end of the second semester before making any decision about staying or quitting. Wait until the newness of the experience has worn off somewhat, because your anxiety levels at that point will be better representative of how they'll be for the rest of grad school. Right now there are so many things that you haven't experienced yet, and those unknowns are probably exacerbating your stress. I'm thinking things like exams, presentations, research, one-on-one meetings with your research advisor, etc. (I know some of these things also happen in undergrad, but part of you might be expecting them to be harder or more high-stakes in grad school, so they're different now (or seem different right now when you haven't done them yet))",

After certain milestones are surpassed, e.g. qualifying exams and coursework, the stress drops off immensely. The stress of these initial years is not representative of later years.\n\nI was stressed beyond belief in my first year; I was overloaded with a genuinely impossible amount of work and got four hours of sleep a night for the whole year. Those first two years were the hardest years of my life (and I've had some objectively tough times in life aside from this). \n\nBut it got better. Much, much better. Once you get on to focusing on the real dissertation research, it feels very different. Don't give up yet. My advice is that you get past these hardest milestones (that is, keep going for another year, until after quals and courses are done). If you are still not feeling it after that, then I suggest you evaluate the situation again.\n\nI also saw some of your post history and can chime in as a fellow person who has some unhealthy food-related coping mechanisms, including similar eating issues. The stress of grad school in those first two years really brought out the worst of my coping behaviors and was a true journey in me figuring out how to transform those. It was very tough but I eventually started to transition them over to different/healthier things. It was a hard journey with a lot of bumps, but eventually I figured out how to stay more sane and less self destructive during that time, and I ultimately learned (in a trial by fire way) some much healthier ways to cope that have stayed with me through these less stressful times and will likely benefit me long into the future. For me the PhD process has truly been a trial by fire...so many ego deaths, so many times that I felt angry and humiliated at myself, but ultimately (pardon the corny phrase) it has been a very phoenix-like process. I have gotten through it and emerged a stronger person. I believe you can do the same if you go forward with determination and intention, and perhaps if you also find a therapist to work through issues with.",

If you can get a job that pays well then go for it. You are only in your first year so you will not lose a lot and you can always do a PhD later in life. Good luck.",

I read all the comments below and they felt very helpful as well. I recently made a very similar post here and got some advice that told me maybe keep going. But i had been doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of questioning myself and I felt exactly the same as you. I\u2019m starting to feel that I can always go back and get a phd again if I want to and I truly felt like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders once I started thinking that way. Also, even the complex you mentioned abt your teacher, i have a similar memory that mostly fueled some of my higher education passion in the past. But once (after many many years and painfully conditioning myself to think this way) i started thinking that nothing, and I mean NOTHING is more important than looking after your health (mental and physical), i started to realize it\u2019s ok to quit sth for pursuing another path if that thing is costing you something much more valuable than whatever it is adding into your life. Anyways, i\u2019m sorry abt this weirdly long and maybe slightly poetic reply, but basically what i\u2019m saying is that since I started thinking it\u2019s ok to leave a phd to pursue sth else for a while and try to do a phd again if you want later in life, I have been feeling the lightest i have felt in a long long time. I suggest that you also sort out your way of thinking and priorities and decide based on that. And do not forget to put yourself and your well-being really high up on that list. Best of luck my pal!",

If you don\u2019t want to be in academia and don\u2019t need this degree for a better career opportunity then it\u2019s not worth sticking it out. Especially because it\u2019s just your first year. Do you really want to miss out on a higher salary, work-life balance for four-five more years when your heart is not set in it? \n\nQuitting a PhD is not Failure. It\u2019s identification of a different path better suited to your goals and following that path. Also if you still want to be a dr. in 5 years time, you can revisit this idea. You\u2019ll be more mature, will probably be more financially comfortable and will have experienced a life outside academia. So at that point you can make a more educated decision about whether the dr. title is important to you and whether you want to pursue it again.",

Bad reason to waste years and potential lost earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, too,  nobody will call you \"Doctor\" in your day-to-day life because you have a PhD. If you're the sort who can't wait to demand random people call you \"Doctor\" at your workplace or while making hotel reservations, that's not really healthy.",

I often wish I\u2019d just stayed in industry instead, I\u2019d be a lot further on in my career by now if I had and what doing a PhD has confirmed to me is that o do not want to stay in reasearch/academia. Being a Dr is cool but I don\u2019t think it makes up for the slog and mental stress of writing your thesis, especially if you\u2019re not going to use it after. \n\nIf I was in your position and struggling already my advice would be don\u2019t put yourself through it. It\u2019s not worth your mental health.",

Whereas some fields have good non-academic (e.g., industry) options for PhDs (that compensate for the additional degree), some don't. Since that is one of your 'No's, I would look at the job you want and reverse-engineer the grad experience you need (or don't).",

Don't tell anyone about this, just live with the idea that the decision has been made. By doing this, you will start to having feelings about your path forward. Maybe relief, maybe sadness. But take time to work through these. You will learn a lot about what you really want. At the end of the week, if you are feeling good about the decision, you can stick with it, or you can take the next week to live with the opposite decision.\n\nI've used this with several big decisions in my own life, and it has helped me a lot.
