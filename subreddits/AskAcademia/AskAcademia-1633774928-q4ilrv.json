  "title:": "Is it bad if a conference accepted some high/middle students\u2019 papers?",
  "text": "Dear all,\n\nI found a conference that accepted some papers from high or middle school students. I checked the quality of these papers, they are good for high/middle school students, but still cannot compare with papers from MSs or above students. \n\nPls. These high/middle school students are all single (and of course first) authors.........\n\nI never see a conference that has accepted high/middle school students\u2019 papers. This conference has no rank at all and its proceedings can be indexed by EI, etc.\n\nI have few conference experience and I don't know is it normal for a not bad conference to accept papers from low-level students? \n\nIs it a shame if I have a paper at such a conference?",

      "text": "I do not know how much that differs in between different fields, but the biggest red flag is them being single authors.\n\nIn my field and locale (forensic pathology, germany), we have some small and rather local conferences which are also intended as a playground for students and young scientists, while the old guys spend more time on socializing and maybe presenting their older or not so special stuff. This is all fine, it is also good to know for the students that there is a fair amount of \"puppy protection\" at these venues.\n\nHowever, they still have supervisors. People who have created the project, taken it to its written form and now take the student to the conference, introduce her/him to some people and most of all be in the room if some questions arise that the student cannot answer.\n\nSo major red flag.\n\nUnless of course the conference is defined and named as that (\"Annual young researcher's presentation day for future scientists\")",

      "text": "A conference accepting a paper from a non-HE student is not an issue on its own. However, multiple examples of that at the same conference is a red flag: the conference might be a predatory publishing venue.\n\nIn my experience, hiring committees hate to see predatory publication venues. Check its organisers, local chairs, and program committee. Do the names sound familiar to you?\n\nAt least at the universities I worked at, the library was able to assist with determining if a place is predatory or legit. You should ask them or at least provide the name of the venue here.",
