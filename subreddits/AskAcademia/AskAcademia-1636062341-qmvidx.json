  "title:": "How soon is too soon to 'keep in touch' with old professors?",
  "text": "Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to go straight from undergraduate to PhD, after congratulating me and such my undergraduate supervisor told me to keep in touch.\n\nDuring the start of my PhD (at a different university), my research partner has advised me that I should be spending a majority of my time networking, at least for the first few months, is it a good idea to use my old professor as a network point?\n\nI had considered emailing him and letting him know about the conference I've been invited too, his line of work is quite similar to what I am currently researching too, but I don't want to seem as though I am harassing him as it was only 6 months ago that we worked together, so it feels too soon to talk with him. Also it just feels rude since I feel like I don't particularly have anything to offer him either.",

              "text": "That depends. Because you're no longer a student there, if you make the email transactional (\"could you help me publish this?\") then chances are lower - you'd be asking him to do what your grad school professors should be doing.  But if you write to catch up, you can mention you're preparing a paper in their area of expertise (if it is), then you can ask if they would look it over for you as you value their opinion.\n\nThat's assuming the following:\n\nIs the paper in his field of expertise? Is it the latest version of a topic you became interested in from working with them or from their classes? If the answer is yes, then sure. \n\nIf not, then it's still fine to write and say thanks for their support, tell them how you're finding grad school, etc.",

              "text": "I\u2019d say asking someone not an author to read over your paper would be out of the norm in my area of STEM because it\u2019s actually quite a bit of work to put together useful edits. Also if it\u2019s a peer reviewed publication and just needs minor tweaks you\u2019ll get that as feedback from the reviewers. \n\nHowever, post publication as a \u201cwhat I\u2019ve been working on\u201d update I\u2019ve sent papers to my undergrad advisor who\u2019s always been really, really supportive. \n\nYou can definitely email him though! Just a quick blurb about what you\u2019ve been working on (maybe if something you did with him was helpful prep), and you can definitely ask him if you\u2019ll see him at the upcoming conference. A lot of profs will be happy to meet their old students for lunch or such",

It will make him proud. I would not worry about offering anything. It\u2019s understood he is the one with the access and more experience. Contact him to update him on your program and then find something to ask for advice. Professors love that too ;)",
