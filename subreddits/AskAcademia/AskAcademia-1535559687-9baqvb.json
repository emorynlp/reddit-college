      "text": "I personally think that it has both positives and negatives. \n\nOne reason it may be good is that it prevents some students who may be angry with their professor from unjustly writing a bad review. This isn't the case for all bad reviews, but it can be a factor. It also takes into account that students are not the best judge of what they know, how they are learning, etc. Most students (still being young and learning) usually can only explain a professor as being bad or good but not really go into more detail. Also, they also confuse an easy class/professor with being a good class/professor. And for that matter, sometimes they confuse the difficulty of the class material with the pedagogy of the professor.  \n\n\nNow looking at the negatives: it gives students less say when they genuinely feel that their professor is holding them back or when they feel that the professor is doing a poor job of teaching. For me, the negatives can be summed into the fact that the influence that these students will lose is given to the administration in regards to promotion and tenure. This, by itself, is not a bad thing, but it also creates room for abuse of power. \n\nFor me, I think its just which is the lesser of two evils. After all, nothing is completely bad or good. We just pick whichever we think is slightly better or that we will regret less.",

And these are usually the folks who have some actually valid complaints, rather than \"I got penalized for turning it in late.\"\n\nMy wife took a class where the professor was struggling with a lot of personal issues. He threw a book at a student during one class, and the group, almost in unison, stood up and headed to the dean's office, with him yelling at them as they walked.\n\nTurns out, the guy was getting multiple complaints over the course of two semesters.  He was forced into early retirement a few weeks later. \n\nThings like this have happened at my institution as well.",

Generally speaking when you get a total howler of a comment, it tends to lighten the mood as - same as any job - everyone knows the occasional person is just a bit bonkers.\n\nI had one last year: the students have a pre-lecture thing to do (reading basically), and then the 1 hour lecture. One person said it should be a two-hour lecture, because they can spend the 1st hour doing the reading. Ignoring that you can do it, like, literally any time you want. ",

      "text": "Students have no business \"evaluating\" faculty. But they certainly can be *surveyed* to gather information on classroom performance to be evaluated by other (qualified) people. For example, as a department chair I skim over surveys to make sure faculty are doing their jobs: coming to class on time, running labs as scheduled, returning graded assignments, holding office hours, responding to student concerns, providing a clear syllabus, etc.  Those are all objective measures that students can easily speak to, and when you have a large volume of surveys over multiple semesters they are useful in making some basic determinations about whether or not people are doing their jobs. (I have, for example, found faculty who cancel dozens of classes, skip labs for the TAs to run, never hold office hours, etc. on a couple of occasions.)\n\nThe only rational ways to actually evaluate *teaching* are to do pre/post tests on established learning goals and to have trained faculty observers sit in for multiple class period. Both take work, and unfortunately many schools/faculty are unwilling to invest the time/resources to make that happen. But I agree it's only a matter of time before enough women, faculty of color, and others who are routinely harmed by student *evalautions* win a few big lawsuits and before you know it our risk management overlords will do away with them entirely.",

In most departments, even good ones, professors sit in their offices and never know what's going on in the lab nearby. We stop attending classes as we grow up, yet we continue teaching.  It's like having a violin player who keeps giving concerts, but never listens to music. That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd the \"micropolitics\" can be averaged out, once the culture is changed.",

At mine, at least-- a top-100 SLAC --those surveys are still among the most critical elements of the teaching portfolio, which is *the* critical element of a tenure/promotion case.  But we don't ask them to \"evaluate\" teaching or learning; rather they are asked about course organization, clarity of goals, instructor accessibility, effort required compared to other classes, things of that nature. We get at \"quality of teaching\" via peer observation primarily, but the T&P committee very much wants to read the student surveys and see evidence of faculty engagement with them every semester-- so if one class says \"Professor was very slow in returning our lab reports\" the next semester had better not.",

For instance ours asks how \"Sensitive\" the prof is and the black profs and women profs in my department ALWAYS get lower marks on these compared to the men, especially if they are not the type of prof who hand holds their students constantly. (and having observed both in peer reviews- an actual legitimate assessment of teaching- they are about the same from what I can see). That is undoubtedly because they are not conforming to traditional ideas /stereotypes of how women *should* behave.  They are also systematically lower in classes that are required, such as our undergrad data analysis class and our social theory classes, making across-faculty comparisons unfair to those who take on the burden of teaching our required courses that are not 'fun'.  Profs that don't give out easy As to everybody also get systematically lower evals, but that doesn't mean they are worse teachers than the ones who have no standards. ",

Even still, I didn't claim that anyone read all the comments - I said that they were on offer if one wished to see them.  Not all collected data is relevant at every moment in every assessment.  In cases where some worry is raised, the data is there to inspect.  In cases where a teacher doesn't give a good presentation of data in their portfolio, more can be asked for.  Etc. Etc. Etc.\n\nEvals are bad measures of things, fine.  People where you teach don't read them, fine.

Students are consistently shown to have very little idea of what is and what is not working in the classroom. Which is not surprising. Learning is hard enough; you simply don't have capacity to reflect on how it is going, as you are doing it.

But for the sake of the doubt...\n\n> We, the professors, know better than them themselves how well they learn.\n\nYes, if you measure the learning, you know better. Measuring learning is expensive, but doable. What is slightly more doable is first running a study to know what works, and what does not. Then do things that work, and not do things that do not work. Evaluate profs based on whether they do the right things. Periodically check whether the right things are still the right things. But don't ask students to guess whether they learned something or not - the students do not know it yet.\n\n> There is nothing to gain from asking from their feedback.\n\nThere's LOTS to learn, but not about learning. You can ask whether they liked the class, how they felt. It is also important. But it is only one component to being a good professor. Best professors are rarely those who are liked the most.\n\n> I am simply discounting the notion that \"students have no working concept of what effective teaching looks like and are unable to evaluate it while it happens.\"\n\nWell, that's my strong impression. In fact, about 10%, at least, of my effort and time go not into teaching, but into convincing students that what we do actually makes sense, and they need to trust me. That I don't use lectures for a reason. That I make them do free-writes and discussions for a reason. That I return questions to them not because I'm not prepared, but because it works. That I make them develop their own assignments and rubrics instead of following pre-packaged instructions because _it is proven to work_. It feels weird, it doesn't provide the sense of security, it is objectively harder. It is fun sometimes, but usually it is harder. And you have to be awake. And you have to work.\n\nThe understanding that it actually works, comes much later, usually after they graduate. If it comes at all. I recently had some students come back as teachers, 3-5 years after they've graduated. They had a training on teaching techniques. One of their strongest reactions was \"Damn, AT LAST now I understand WHY we were doing all these strange exercises when I was a student\".\n\nA person who puts all their effort into learning something doesn't notice that they learn. Before they learn it, they don't realize what exactly they lack. After they are finished, if they learned it well, they cannot imagine not knowing it. You can do a bit to make them realize that they learn, again, through reflective writing, and through some tricks - give them their final exam on the first day, then let them compare their performance on the last day, or something like that. Make a recording of them doing something, show it on the last day. But it takes lots of time and effort, which ultimately takes time from the class, when  you could have been teaching them; from the time for which they paid. So while we all are doing it, at some point you have to make a decision: what's more important, to teach them one more useful thing, or to make them better appreciate what they've already learned. A selfless decision, for a professor, is at some point to prioritize teaching, even if it means that students will be a bit more ungrateful than they could have been.\n\n> Were you so aimless you couldn't tell between when you were taught effectively vs when you were taught poorly?\n\nA had some ideas, but in the hindsight these were not the best ideas. In the hindsight, I now realize that some of the teachers that I thought were awesome were just buying our love with cheap tricks, yet we learned and remembered nothing in the long-term. They were good, charismatic TED-talk givers, but they were not good teachers. While some teachers actually put something in us, something I'm still using many years later. But I can only appreciate it now, as a prof, because now I can understand what they were doing, and why they were doing that. And also because now I can recognize signs of honest involvement in teaching, in contrast to shiny and likable indifference.\n\nEnd of rant, I guess =\\",

It would actually take quite the concerted effort to get below a B. Before tests, they are literally told what questions will be on the test through their study guide, and are shocked and amazed that uni study guides are really just *guides*. They are initially dumbfounded that attending all classes is probably not sufficient for them to pass.\n\nStudents have never been told what effective teaching actually looks like, so naturally they're going to associate it with grades. Any professor whose class is easy to get an A in is a class effectively taught. Any class where they have to work hard and put in outside effort is an ineffective one. They intrinsically think that good teaching = \"I understand with relatively little issue\". \n\nThere's an incredibly difficult series of courses that I would have rated poorly at the time, but now I can recognise that they were the best classes I'd ever taken and the professor was an incredibly effective teacher. That revelation doesn't really help my evaluations from 4 years ago though. Students with a very narrow set of experiences to draw from and precisely no time at all test out the knowledge from a class, have to judge the effectiveness of their lecturer. They're also clouded by their expectations for their own grades and may \"lash out\" when that is threatened, even if it's their fault because they never did any of the readings. ",

Look at Rate My Professor-- those with high ratings are almost always given good marks because they are easy; faculty who demand effort and hold students to reasonable standards do not. This is especially true with younger students, whose high school experiences largely consist of filling in bubble sheets and taking true/false tests over lists of facts. When asks to do work independently  they either aren't prepared or simply balk.\n\nLuckily I teach at a relatively selective private liberal arts college, so we're at least facing students who can be taught to learn and are paying enough they will make an effort. But I still long ago lost count of students who write things like \"THIS ISN\"T GRADUATE SCHOOL!\" as they complain about the most basic of workloads. (Making one wish, of course, that they could spend just a day in graduate school and realize how assinine their comments really sound.)",

I graduated high school in Canada about fifteen years ago, but at the time there was no filling in bubble sheets or multiple choices or easy answer questions. Most subjects you either had to answer long-form problems, essays (history especially - \"discuss the main causes of ww1\" \"compare and contrast the russian and chinese revolutions\" etc...), projects (~20 pages long iirc), oral presentations... people had to put in the work or they failed, several people did. If you failed classes you lost on electives, which meant you had to take extra 0-level classes in university when you didn't have the pre-reqs, or you were held back a year. It wasn't unheard of for people to do a 13th year. \n\nLikewise, in undergrad I remember useful and useless professors, and \"how easy the class was\" had little to do with it. Some didn't know their own material, and we had to teach ourselves, which was highly frustrating and led to many complaints to the chair. Some were simply unprepared. I remember this one math prof who copied the textbook so faithfully onto the board that he even transcribed typographical errors - I got nothing more from him than I could have gotten from reading the textbook by myself. Some offered obscure assignments without enough directly, such that we might or not succeed, but learned very little in the process. Some offered such easy assignments and exams that we also learned little. Some had very well designed learning tools and projects that were self-driven. \n\nIt's not just a question of whether or not we were entertained too. One prof had the most monotone voice, and a very boring delivery, but explained the concepts clearly and succinctly, and we learned a lot from him in spite of being bored to death. Others were flashier but couldn't discuss the subject in any sort of depth, and avoided questions. \n\nOne of the profs was awful because he expected us to teach each other, and was absent from the class the majority of the time. He would ask for assignments, but not even glance at them (one student once offered pages from shakespeare beyond the cover letter and the first few to see if he'd notice - he did not). At the end of class, he would tell us what he expected the class average to be, and let us decide amongst ourselves who got which grade. He's still teaching, but they forced him to actually grade exams after the class after me went through him.\n\nYou can bet your ass that I can tell which of these classes I actually learned the material and which ones I did not.\n\nOf course something like Rate My Professor is useless - only the angriest will go there and rate their prof. If evaluations are to be fair they have to be mandatory. Handing out questionaires in-class is really the only way, you really can't rely on voluntary online assessments. ",

That said, when I went to graduate school, I found I was more prepared for it than most of my counterparts that had been trained at large, R1-equivalent universities (University of Toronto and the like). \n\nI would like to posit that poor teachers are more common than you'd like to think. I had some as a graduate student as well, though never to the same level.\n\nFor this particular person, part of the issue is that the administration took a long time before they started to take us seriously. They had the same attitude as in this thread - people are complaining because the class is hard (it wasn't - this person knew they were useless, and gave us all good grades to try and buy us. It didn't work). People just don't like her because she's a woman. People don't like her because she's foreign. She just needs time to settle in. She had a rough first, second, and third year, but she'll pick it up. Students don't really know what good effective teaching is, anyway. Students are exaggerating. It can't be as bad as what you're saying - this person has a PhD in Physics, after all!\n\nWell, she couldn't normalize a vector (an operation one learns within the first few weeks of freshman year), she would write up a proof that depended on the logarithm of 0 being 0 (it, in fact, trends towards minus infinity - a slight inconvenience) and would get angry at us when we would point it out. She didn't understand the material enough to mark our assignments, so she was reduced to purchase teaching aids with pre-solved exercises, which we could of course find. She would mis-understand the material to the point where the questions on the exam were un-answerable, but eventually with enough probing, one could understand where she'd gone wrong and repeat her mistakes in logic to arrive to **an** answer.\n\nIt took the administration 6 years to fire her. They were set to do it after year 3-4, but then she was pregnant and went on maternity leave (the part of me that is less kind believes the timing to be a calculated decision), and optics required they wait another year or two before letting this person go for gross incompetence. \n\nSo yes, this attitude of \"what do the students know about good teaching\"? I don't like it. \n\n>True-- but there are other methods. We use mandatory, in-class online assessments. They work quite well, but they do not ask students to evaluate teaching, just to report on their experiences in the classroom.\n\nThe mandatory part is important. But I still disagree that students can't tell if they've been taught effectively, if their instructor was prepared, if their instructor exhibits knowledge of their subject, if the assignments were fair and the right tools were provided to solve them, and so on. Sure, your first-year classes you're going to have a lot of noise and a lot of people who are taking out-of-major electives who are angry there's math in an astronomy class and whatnot, but as soon as you hit years 2-4 I just don't believe it.",

At certain stages in my life, I didn't know multiplication, I didn't know algebra, I didn't know calculus, I didn't know any of that advanced mathematics. And yet at the end of every semester, despite having just done an exam that I could not have done *any* of only 12 weeks earlier, I still felt as though I hadn't learnt anything. \n\nThat's just how learning often is. As you gain more knowledge, you forget or lose touch with the time before you knew it. It's as though you always knew how to do that thing, and you can't imagine not knowing it. You'd even look back on things you know you struggled with with incredulity. \n\nIf you want to look at how far you've come, you have to consciously look back to where you were. Student evaluations rarely include that level of prompting IME, and few students are going to sit back for 10 minutes to ponder that question. It may not be until a later course that they see how they're using knowledge from the previous course. They may never really notice at all in the case of more nebulous skills like \"independent working\", \"problem solving\", or \"creativity\". The course I found most difficult was difficult because it relied on true problem solving skills. Skills that had *never* been properly taught before then since all of HS had been teaching to the test. Being able to take mathematical and physical concepts and apply them to a problem I hadn't seen before was very tough to begin with and I hated it. But that skill is by far the most important thing I gained from my entire degree, and I have that series of courses to thank for it. And yet I can't go and give a student evaluation for it now. Every single year, that series has the highest failure rate and the lowest student ratings, yet the professor also wins a lot of awards for his teaching and is generally adored by students a year or two *after* his courses.

      "text": "Should student evaluations be ignored completely?  Not in my opinion.  While students are definitely not domain experts, nor are they expert educators, they are, in some sense, experienced consumers of education, and they should have the opportunity to provide both multiple choice and written comments on the courses that they take so that teachers and administrators can consider their feedback and make changes based on it where appropriate and practical.\n\nShould student evaluations be the sole measure of teaching effectiveness used by administrators?  Absolutely not.  There are many factors outside of the teacher's control that impact evaluation.  Some of these are related to the biases of the students (evaluating women differently than men, etc.) and some of them are a reflection of what the teacher has been assigned to teach (size of class, time of day, elective vs. required, majors vs. non-majors, etc.).  \n\nThere are definitely problems with the evaluations, but I believe that they can still be used to identify, in a very coarse way, better teaching from worse teaching.  Should teaching that receives scores of 7.7/10 be viewed more positively than teaching that receives scores of 7.6/10?  No -- there's far too much noise for those to be viewed as different.  Should teaching that receives scores of 9.0/10 be viewed more positively than teaching that receives scores of 3.0/10.  Yes -- that's a big enough difference that I'd easily believe that it is a reflection of difference in teaching accomplishment, as perceived by the students, not differences in factors beyond the teachers' control.  How much of a difference is big enough for it to be a real difference?  I don't know.  And unfortunately, as soon as there's a number, some people will want to compare the values numerically without doing any more thinking...\n\nIn my opinion we should only be using student teaching evaluations in conjunction with other data.  That could include things like comments from colleagues that have sat in on a class, a review of course materials / assessments / learning objectives / topics and reflective comments from the course instructor.  I believe that this would provide a much more complete view of what is being done in the classroom and how well it's working and would help support or refute what's coming from the customers, err, students.",

We should only be using them very coarsely where the magnitudes of the differences exceed what we'd reasonably expect from the biases.\n\n> Given the bias and how poor a judge students are, evaluations shouldn't be used as any measure of teaching effectiveness. By anyone.\n\nI think that we'll have to agree to disagree here.  Students liking teachers isn't the be all and end all by any stretch, but at the same time, doing things that intentionally annoy the students for no pedagogical reason should penalized, and students are the ones that are in a position to provide input on this.",
