  "text": "I will be leaving my PI's lab after 6 years. Going to an industry job which he had referred me to. Want to show my appreciation. We are not super close on a personal level but definitely chat on a regular basis and joke around. \n\nBudget wise I would say up to $500. A nice pen feels a bit cliche. But honestly don't know what else to get. Want to go for something unique and personal. Bobblehead? Feels like could be a miss.\n\nThoughts welcome!",

If he\u2019s into pens, you can get a nice fountain pen for under 500 easy , if he\u2019s into some other hobby, find out what a cool tool for it would be. (Painting? Nice brush set or paint, etc.)",

      "text": "I went back to undergrad in my late 20s and got on well with two of my professors who were closer to my age than many students. They were highly supportive and inspiring to me. I wanted to give them something special when I graduated but didn\u2019t want to go overboard, so I decided to make something related to their research and interests. \n\nFor one, I designed a mug in Inkscape (free illustration program) with some interesting clip art and words related to his field, as well as the mascot of his undergrad sports team (which he often spoke of). For the other, I made a sizable poster with a word cloud set in the shape of his head with his glasses over it, and I sourced the words from the papers he had published \u2014 this was also relevant to the research we\u2019d done together in word associations. \n\nIt cost maybe $40 to have these printed at a printing company and they really liked them! So, I think a thoughtful gift related to their professional identities would be appropriate, especially if it\u2019s something they can put in their offices. Also, you don\u2019t need to be artistically skilled or anything; I just copy pasted some clip art I found online for the most part and added some words.",
