  "title:": "Post a PhD, how common is it to get stuck within the same research theme as during your PhD?",
  "text": "This might be a silly question so please bear with me.\n\nI know that changing your research area is very common and is expected out of anyone doing good research. But I am looking to apply at a lab in my field (Fluid Mechanics) which does some fundamental work in geophysical flows, which I'm really interested in. Although the project would help me gain skills in several adjacent domains, I am afraid that by the end of it I will be concentrating on a very specific class of problems and not have much of an idea of the broader more applicable (more jobs) domain.\n\nWould this mean that I'll be stuck doing research of the same flavor as my PhD or are there enough opportunities to explore the same broad area but different application domains?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my take, which is just one opinion, so take it for what it\u2019s worth\u2026. And I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re talking about someone in a typical tenure-track academic position\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re making a slight shift with a lot of overlap, sure no problem.  But if you\u2019re making a drastic change or even changing areas, then it\u2019s probably not a good idea until you\u2019re pretty senior.\n\nThey say you can study anything you want for your Ph.D., but really you\u2019re somewhat constrained by you advisor\u2019s interests and what kinds of work they have funding for.  Even so, this may be your best chance for choice for a while (if you\u2019re advisor is open to the idea, at least).\n\nThey say if you want to change after you graduate you can, but really, you need to get some early wins as an Assistant Professor, and the best way to do that is by building on your dissertation work as directly as possible. Making a slight shift to different but related things may be possible, if you\u2019re able to get to work directly.  But making a significant change that will require years of work getting started before you\u2019re ready to publish productively is a good way to avoid getting tenure.\n\nA typical approach might be to continue publishing along your previous lines while you\u2019re getting up to speed in the new area.  However, you cannot materialize time out of nowhere, so even this will slow your existing research a bit while you multitask.  So it\u2019s still probably not a good idea before tenure.\n\nSo once you have tenure, can you switch then?  Well, the job security will help somewhat, so kinda yes.  But also, you have annual reviews, might want to still get at least the base pay raise each year, and the hope of being promoted to full Professor may still be a factor.\n\nOnce you\u2019re a full professor, then?  Sure, in most departments you are now at the point where you really can do whatever you want (in research, or otherwise).  But it still doesn\u2019t mean there are no consequences, and it may depend on how supportive your department and Dean are of the switch.  You don\u2019t have to care as much about annual reviews, except if you want pay raises, then you do.  And there are many \u201csoft\u201d ways you could be affected (like being assigned the crappy office), if others insist on perpetual high productivity.\n\nTL;DR - probably not a great idea before tenure.  After that, it gets easier the more senior you are.  But it also depends on your department and school culture, whether they\u2019d be supportive or not.  And also maybe on how much you care about \u201csoft\u201d benefits or r\u00e9prouvassions vs. your academic freedom.",

          "text": "This makes a lot of sense, and I have received similar advice from US R1 associate professors. Seems like making early career as productive as possible is somewhat necessary in such a competitive market. \n\nThat said, in your opinion, how easy is it actually to switch research focus after tenure? Most post-tenure faculty I know are very involved in research administration or other leadership roles. And for many it seems like their main job is to secure funding for a research group which is often much larger mid career than it may have been pre-tenure just starting out.  It seems like most (at least among those I know) have little time or energy to engage with the day to day research beyond \\~maybe\\~ giving feedback on manuscripts that I can't imagine how they would have the time or energy to spin up a new research direction. \n\nMy conclusion has been that it's one of those situations where there's never reeeeally a good time, and it kind of just depends on how badly you want it, how much time and effort you can give to it and, as always in academia, probably some degree of luck in how successful you are in your efforts. Just interested in your take as I am still relatively early career and perhaps my perspective is skewed.",

Being in the humanities and in Europe, that's the exact opposite of the advice I've received so far.\n\nThe job ads for tenured and tenure-track jobs here are nearly always written to include the phrase \"can \\[TT: will be able to\\] represent the discipline in its full breadth\" and we are very much encouraged to switch research areas after our PhD (i.e. for our second book) to demonstrate that breadth.",

STEM may vary by discipline, but in mine, we should have at least one top level article published per year, per doctoral student working in our lab.  (More or less - exact expectations may vary by institution, and also by sub-discipline.)",

                  "text": "I think it depends on the level of specialization (which is closely linked to the availability of funding) within the field. I'm a PhD student in Latin Philology and my department only has three full professors (two Latin, one Ancient Greek). If you want your students to get a reasonable education within such small departments, you have to hire generalists.\n\n> I think what it comes down to may be the cost of the switch - how much time and effort are required before you\u2019re productively publishing.\n  \nDoesn't really matter. For my PhD I'm working on 16th century material from the Low Countries - so I'm dealing with the tides and turnings of the 80 years' war, the European book and art trade, civic society in Early Modern cities, the court of emperor Rudolf II in Prague, ...\nBut for my second book, I'll have to leave most of the knowledge and skills I'm currently acquiring behind and do something on a big-name classical author like Horace or Ovid - otherwise I'd be only employable for positions in Early Modern Latin (which don't exist).\n\nThe cost of such a switch is of course high but the core of our subject are 800 years of literary history (200 BC to 600 AD) and ideally you should be able to handle 2,000 years (200 BC to 1800 AD). Then add different methodologies as a second dimension. Within that space you need to establish 2-4 areas of competence with sufficient distance from each other if you want to be of value. \n\nMany of the smaller humanities are in a similar position. E.g. my secondary advisor is an art history professor who handles everything from 1400 to 1900 (with some fuzziness on either end). She teaches Giotto and she teaches Bauhaus.\n\nThe time horizon on our book projects is 3-6 years. They don't completely replace articles, though - about two a year is a good target (but we publish a lot in conference proceedings and edited volumes with limited peer review, so it's not that tough).",

      "text": "This is totally field dependent, and it comes down to a) how \"deep\" your field is, and b) how dependent your field is on funding.\n\nIf you are in a very \"deep\" field (e.g. pure mathematics or theoretical physics) then switching research themes will be difficult since it will require months/years of  effort to even understand the basics of any research outside of your niche, let alone make a contribution. Whereas if you are in a more \"shallow\" field (in the sense that it doesnt require too much effort to reach the cutting edge of knowledge -- eg statistics, applied machine learning, psychology, etc) then switching is much easier and you can probably pick up a new area in a few months, assuming it isnt completely unrelated to what youre doing.\n\nSimilarly for funding, if your research is totally reliant on funding then switching will be more difficult since you have the chicken-egg problem where you will struggle to get funding without a track record, and struggle to establish a track record without funding. This doesnt really apply if all you need for your research is a pen+paper, computer, and a library card.\n\nPersonally I've switched areas a few times but I'm in a relatively shallow field so its been quite easy. Its probably held my career back but it hasnt been a big deal and its been a lot more fun than just being an expert in one particular niche.
