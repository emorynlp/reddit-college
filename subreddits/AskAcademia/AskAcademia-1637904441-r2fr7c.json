  "title:": "Tips on becoming a better communicator in academia?",
  "text": "I've recently started seeking out PhD positions for next year and I've been having a lot of Zoom meetings with potential supervisors. For some reason, I've been really struck by how well they all communicate and how much better I could be at this. My employment history has largely been in more working-class jobs so the interpersonal communication style is very different! Does anyone have some tips or can recommend any books about how to become a better communicator in the academic world?",

      "text": "Not really a tip but I would remind you that the people you are meeting with do a lot more communicating than you do, therefore they are better at it, or at least come across as being more comfortable with it. By the very nature of their job, you might have been one meeting of their day out of five meetings. So just by having to communicate over and over, our interpersonal skills develop.",

      "text": "I loved the book \"Don't be such a scientist\" by Randy Olson. Though the author's observations in academia are the opposite of yours (i.e. science communication could be a lot better), he emphasises the importance of storytelling and how you can do it better. If I understand correctly, you are looking for tips for improving interpersonal communication rather than science communication, but maybe you'd find this interesting anyway.",

I've found that talking to people who know nothing about my masters (by research) has made me better communicator, finding the best way to articulate the research I've done :)",
