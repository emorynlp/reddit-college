  "text": "Hi, I am asking for advice on motivating students. I am a TA for two art history courses, I have four discussion sections in total. I have approximately 75 students. I lead the discussion section and grade everything except for the quizzes, which are automatically graded online. I do not have the authority to alter the grade book and syllabus. For both of these classes, discussion section is worth 30 percent of their grade, meaning if they get As on everything and do not come to discussion section, they can get no higher than a 66 percent in the class. I have the same boss for both courses and she constructed the syllabus and teaches lecture. My biggest issue is for attendance. Half of the people are only showing up on test days. One of the courses is a 100 level class (50 out of 75 of my students) and most of them are freshman who this is not their major. Tests in this class are also receiving lower scores. The students are not studying. My discussion section includes assignments which are largely participation grades. I try to be extremely generous. My boss says that there was a campus wide meaning about these freshman because the school drastically lowered their requirements to accept more students and get more funding. She says that students across the board are ill prepared partly due to covid in their senior year of high school and partly do to the school accepting virtually everyone who applied. I am looking for things that I can do on my end to help the students bring up their grades. My boss also made a zero late work policy in both classes' syllabi and asked her to consider being flexible on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings that I have tried so6 far:\n\n\\-making study sheets for each test with exact answers for what should be memorized\n\n\\-dividing the students into group to work on the assignments and hoping that the A students will help the students with Ds or Fs understand the material and what is expected, then having them present their answers to the class. EDIT- I DO NOT SPECIFICALLY PAIR THE STUDENTS. I RANDOMLY DIVIDED THEM BY NUMBERING THEM OFF. THE STUDENTS PRESENT AS A GROUP AND TURN IN INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENTS WHICH ARE GRADED SEPARATELY. SORRY FOR ALL CAPS, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE MY EDIT WAS CLEAR\n\n\\-printing off examples of what an A test looks like and distributing them (tests are essay based)\n\n\\-talking about study habits\n\n\\-requiring each student to make a list of 10 ways that they can improve their grade and one reason why (scholarships, major requirements, grandma paying for school, etc)\n\n\\-my boss reopened the quizzes for one week so they can redo the ones they did poorly one. Most of them did not redo the quizzes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I have taught 5 courses in my past years as a TA and have never had such a big issue with large grades.",

At the same time, I find it helpful to remember three things:\n\n**1)** You can't do the caring FOR them, and you can't do the learning FOR them. You've already gone above and beyond. The rest is up to them.\n\n**2)** Experiencing logical consequences for the choices we make isn't some bizarre, inhumane punishment. Consequences help the individual (\"if I don't want to get burned, I shouldn't put my hand on the stove\"), and help the others they come into contact (\"if I want to have friends, I shouldn't hit people\").\n\n**3) Compassionate detachment** and **minimal ego** are key for me. I can acknowledge that it's a shame they're making such poor decisions, but accept that it's their choice and that it's not about me. I try not to spend my spare time thinking about students' progress when they themselves aren't spending any time thinking about it. The minimal ego part is about recognizing that I can't change anyone's behavior--whether that be students or family or friends.\n\nThis might be a helpful reframe: they have the right to choose to earn a bad grade.\n\nIt's great the responses here are reaffirming this. I hope you'll be able to start emotionally disengaging for your own well-being. ***We can care without taking responsibility for other people's bad decisions.*** Also, failing a course isn't the end of the world. Even if you get annoying grade change requests, the evidence will be obvious and well-documented, so that's a relief too. Take care.",

Lots of young people might be at college because of parental pressure or because they did fine in school but don't really know what they want, lots of variation on that. The most interesting professor in the world isn't going to make a dent on a student who hates college and is only there because the other option is some kind of catastrophic familial crisis.\n\nOn the flip side, sometimes the most motivated students have stuff getting in their way like mental health issues, or relationship problems, or competing priorities. Interesting classes won't fix those people, either. They need to be pointed to resources to help them solve the non-academic roadblocks.\n\nFaculty can provide opportunities for learning, and they can work on pedagogy that makes material interesting and learning rewarding, but they cannot and should not be more interested in student success than the students are. Taking lack of interest personally is a recipe for heartbreak and burnout.",

Why are students not showing up for class? The main reason tends to be that they don't think they have to in order to learn and/or to pass (which ideally are synonymous, but sometimes are not).\n\nLet's say the ones skipping are right (which they are sometimes but not always), i.e. that they don't have to attend class to learn enough to pass, it may be because either my teaching doesn't make enough difference AND/OR that my tests are too easy. Does it -- in reality -- require enough time on task for them to perform well enough? Does my teaching make enough of a difference here?\n\nI -- like most others -- have struggled with this extrinsic/intrinsic conundrum since day one of my teaching career, but I have come to think that we have a Covid quirk on this arguably timeless tug-of-war on top of things.\n\nI teach an international course fully online with students from all over the world (it was introduced literally weeks before Covid became a thing). Next week we are having our last, obligatory class in Zoom in this course and when I checked the attendance and other data just now it turned out that a substantial chunk of students had handed in all their assignments without attending the Zoom classes. I haven't read the assignments yet but in more normal times attendance and completion of the obligatory assignments would go hand in hand.\n\nMaybe we have to deal with another beast here altogether? Students who have been conditioned to asynchronous \"teaching\", where everything is about completing tasks, skipping through filmed lectures, and checking off boxes in the LMS?",

The student's grade should be a reflection of the quality of work they put into the course. Good grades are for students who do good work. A student who has opportunities to do good work and refuses to do good work is telling you exactly what kind of grade they should get. \n\nIt's another story if you have, say, students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are not used to academia and are trying their hardest to succeed and are still struggling. That's when you bring out the big guns for study help and accommodations and all the works. But slackers who won't show up to class, who won't redo a free makeup quiz, who won't even learn the answers on a sheet that specifically gives them the answers? That's what Fs are for; use 'em.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Half of the people are only showing up on test days.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water, &c.\n\nLook at it this way: You're actually teaching them a very valuable life lesson, namely, you can't just slack off and not do the work and expect to be rewarded for it. And you've got an excellent lesson plan for that, too. Too bad the lesson has to be learned the hard way, but maybe some of them will get it.",

These are young people who have spent 18 months of their relatively short lives living in fear and stress about a contagious virus that has changed the world before they really got the ability to be adults - yeah, they're going to feel disconnected, languishing, perhaps even depressed.\n\nIf you're a TA, you can't hold yourself too responsible for them failing - your section is only worth 30 percent of their grade, and you don't have the authority to change the assignments or anything. \n\nYou've tried an admirable amount of things so far, and it's so awesome that you're invested enough in the students' learning to try to help them do better. But if the major reason that they are failing is that they aren't coming to class...study sheets, group work, and study habits training won't help them with that. I know in the past I've used an idea I cribbed from another professor: having pop quizzes in class that gave students the opportunity to add points to an upcoming test (or just counted as part of their grade). It was an alternate way of grading people based on attendance, but I think encouraged attendance more by giving an *incentive* for attending rather than a *punishment* for not attending.\n\n\rDo you have any sense for why the students aren't coming to class? Is it that they just don't care, or they don't understand how important it is to their grade, or something else? Understanding what's preventing them may help a bit (although it is of course hard to ask...since the people who actually come to class can't answer that, lol).",

Honestly, it doesn't sound like the material is the problem at all. It's their work ethic and discipline. In my experience, the best intervention for an effort problem is blunt honesty: \"If you don't come to discussion, you will fail.\" Generally, I live by the philosophy that if *they* aren't concerned about their grade, I shouldn't be either.

If students know they will always be given an easy out or a safety net, then they simply can't develop all the skills that they need to. It's not your job to make sure everyone passes - it's your job to make sure everyone comes out at the end with a grade that captures their capability, and that through the process of your course you ahve provided opportunities for them to get that capability up to a high-mark standard. \n\nIt's frustrating when students fail, but what you need to be confident of is that it is a failure on their part to engage, not on your part that you didn't provide the support and training.
