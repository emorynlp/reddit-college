  "title:": "Anyone else fantasise about starting a brewery? Or becoming a plumber? Anyone done this?",
  "text": "Academic (PhD + Post-doc) now working in an academic data science research group within industry. Early 30s, but so tired of the BS in both worlds and I've genuinely lost my love for the sciences. I just don't want to be a scientist anymore, and I think this is a lot more than just a stint of burnout. I'd love to start a brewery or become a plumber. I've worked at some of the worlds top institutions (not intending for that to be a humblebrag, just pointing out that it doesn't get any better at the \"top\") and so very tired of constantly having to be on my A-game.\n\nI'm in the UK where universities have essentially become big businesses and being a scientist is not a glamorous or well-paid job. I suppose this is a silly question for this sub, given that anybody who has walked away from academia is not now likely to be hanging around on here. But does anyone have any experience with leaving academia/science and doing something widely different? Anyone know anybody whose done left academia and gone in a completely different direction? Am I completely insane?\n\nI've done so much reflection on this subject recently, and I've seriously started looking at re-training. I think a big part of the problem is that nothing is ever \"good enough\" in academia or the R&D industry. It's an incredibly thankless job. I'm not one of these people that needs constant reassurance or praise, but I've come to realise over the course of my career, that despite producing some very impactful work, that nothing was ever good enough for PI's, committees, metrics etc. and nothing ever will be.\n\nI used to work in a supermarket, back in my student days. Managed to get promoted and my boss was always pleased with my performance. Only now do I realise how rewarding it was to have a boss that was genuinely please, sometimes ecstatic, with my work (or ideas). Customers too. Hearing the words \"thank you\" and \"great job!\" every day boosted me mentally more than I realised at the time. Life was simple: nobody there was ever trying to one-up me; there were no office politics (i.e. dirty tricks, not usually collaboration); no egos; no insane deadlines; no unrealistic expectations; I could clock-off and mentally checkout, and I always had the resources that I needed to do the job. Basically, the job permitted me to recharge. I've come to realise that I miss that type of supportive environment. I'm tired of my PI's being in competition with me, tired of having to navigate the office politics, tired of being under-resourced, tired of being expected to \"just figure it out\", tired of others trying (and some times having succeed in) taking credit for my work etc. Research is hard enough without all the BS that comes with it.\n\nI'm struggling to find examples of people who have decided to go a completely different direction, not just left academia, but science altogether. I'm trying decide if this is just a burnout/melt-down or if I am seriously unhappy and in need of a change.",

You have to invest in whatever you do to make it work for you. A lot of people I see who are constantly chasing greener grass are looking for reward without investment. \n\nSometimes there are truly better situations, though. So one doesn't need to accept that one's lot is the only one that could possibly be. But such things take a lot of introspection and consideration.\n\nThat being said, academia has its ups and its downs. The fact that other jobs have their ups and downs doesn't mean that their ups, or their downs, might not be better or worse than academia.",

                  "text": "At high-level research institutions, I would describe the stress as being the idea that you're in charge of your own fortunes, but in a system that makes success fairly unlikely. \n\nLet's say you're the lucky winner of a brand-new assistant professor position at an R1. You get an offer of $140,000 a year and a $40,000 startup package to get your lab rolling. You have about four years to really make a mark before your first big checkpoint. So take that $140,000 times four years plus the $40k, and you have $600,000. Divide that into four equal piles of $150,000, and every year on January 1, fly to Vegas, walk up to a roulette wheel, and bet the whole thing on a corner bet (8-1 odds). If you go any consecutive four years without winning, your career is over.\n\nThat's what a research career feels like to me. You cannot survive without substantial grants, and winning a substantial grant has somewhere between a 2% and maybe a 15% hit rate. Each one takes six months to prepare and another six months to get a result from. And every year you fail just puts you a little further behind the people who won and therefore get to show that much more successful funding than you when you both apply next year. \n\nThe reality isn't quite that bleak. There are ways that you can mitigate the risks and try to scrabble together some notion of success that will keep you employed, but that's no way to go through life. You will absolutely feel like you need to hit that corner bet this year, and if you don't you will be afraid for your future. That is constant until you're tenured.\n\nHaving said that, I spent five years in an environment that was probably closer to R2 than R1, and all this is my perception colored by my own anxiety around it, so your mileage may vary, as they say.",

                      "text": "Thanks for the detailed answer! \nYour stress of feeling like you need to hit the corner bet every year is pretty similar to what I have experienced in industry. I ended up as a sales engineer at a rep firm instead of the traditional engineering route. Every month I either make it big or have to use savings from last month to cover my bills. I have a constant worry that construction projects will stop or my customers might start favoring my competition. Also, if I have a slow month, I have to make the boss think next month won't be slow and give some kind of evidence that I am building up the sales pipeline.\n\nAll that I could handle if it was toned down a bit but I also feel like my job is useless and I don't do anything that matters. I am pretty passionate about research and creativity. There is no role for that in my company.  Sounds like the big change would be the fact that the anxiety would come along with me doing what I am passionate about instead of selling HVAC widgets. \n\nThanks again for the information!",

I looked it up and yeah, their MLS history isn\u2019t great. I think when they first came onto the scene though before they were an MLS team they were good? I remember hearing a bunch of people talk about it like they were the next great thing. \n\nYo that\u2019s a dope backup plan. My mom runs a nonprofit in the city that works with pretty much every major brewery outside of Madtree, and I say that because after being her delivery boy and working with all these places, opening up a brewery is absolutely no small task. Suuuper fucking expensive to get all the equipment, the building, land, electricity, etc., and yeah, if you don\u2019t brew what\u2019s popular you ain\u2019t getting business. Making model ships seems much more appealing and relaxing if you ask me :D",

      "text": "My best friend did this. I think his story is exactly the one you're looking for, so let me give you a little background. We met at university when we both happened to show up for a meet-up of the outdoor adventure club and realized we were the only people there who had any real climbing skill/experience. He already held a world record in mountaineering by that point and I had a car, so we would drive to the local climbing gym at least once a week and talk about economics. Years later, he ended up at the Rand Corporation working on a number of big projects. He hated it. He realized that the entire culture / all of the incentives were structured such that real results were not being published and office politics were horrible. He told me that even though his projects received substantial money to help people with real problems that the money wasn't ultimately being spent to meaningfully test the theories he felt were important because the powers that be were too eager to rush out papers rather than effect real change. So he took advantage of the flexible work schedule and started working 10 hours/day, Monday through Thursday and spent every Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Joshua Tree, which is only a 2.5 hour drive from LA (where the main office of Rand Corporation is located), until he got a specific certification and qualified to become a guide. He then got a second job and started guiding rock climbing trips in Joshua Tree on the weekend until he had built up enough trips as a co-guide that the company he was working for would let him be a lead guide. He then worked as a lead guide (still holding the job at the Rand Corporation) at Joshua Tree every weekend until he built up enough trips that the company he was working for agreed to hire him on full time and let him pick ~~any destination in the world~~ superior destinations from a broader list that was previously unavailable to him. He now guides mountaineering trips in Oregon and Washington state. He barely texts me anymore because he's almost always outside of cell service. But, as far as I can tell, he's much happier than he's ever been before.\n\nMeanwhile, I still love climbing, but I love economic research more. I have been able to live vicariously through my best friend and learn from his experience. But, unlike him, I know that I won't be whole unless I take my research further and contribute more to my field. \n\nSo, moral of the story: we're all a little bit different. If you want to go out and do something else, before I saw what my friend did, I would have said: you're crazy and should stick to your research. But, after seeing what happened to my best friend, I can honestly say: you do you. Just take measured steps like he did so that it's sustainable. He didn't quit his job immediately, he built a new life while holding onto a job he hated because he knew he needed the first income stream and didn't have the second income stream well-established just yet.\n\nEdit: minor edits.",

I'm also starting to lose my interest in science completely as a result. I haven't been in the industry, so my current plan B is to start working as a penetration tester (my field is computer security).\n\nThat being said, I've also noticed that I feel much better working with more tangible things than computers as well, so my plan C is actually starting a brewery. So you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.",

Because of this I have a very different perspective than a lot of the commenters here and encourage you to honestly look at leaving the field you are in. \n\nThat being said, this can not be a snap decision and you will have to work very hard to not burn bridges as you make this decision no matter what it is. Sit down with yourself and write out the pros and cons of 1. leaving the field entirely, 2. taking a sabbatical/leave of absence, or 3. adjusting what area of academia/the sciences you are in. Talk with friends/family who's opinions you trust about your thoughts and research what steps you would like to take. \n\nIt is okay and so understandable to feel frustrated with work and life and reflect on times when things were simpler. You are in the UK so Covid stress is also a big thing and may be influencing your thoughts. Maybe consider talking to a councillor who has experience with work related stresses/trauma. \n\nAnd if you feel drawn to breweries, maybe, as you are thinking about all this look around at the breweries you are near, maybe craft brewing could be an awesome hobby for you on your downtime... Or home plumbing/repair projects as a way to recharge. \n\nI definitely wish you the best!",

      "text": "I know a professor who started a coffee shop. She talked about getting away from the constant pressure felt liberating. Although she feels pressure in the shop, that pressure is there to benefit her: she has impact on everything while in the University, she was just a part of a big machine. Besides her, I know a few people who went into alt-ac jobs. A history PhD for example went to work in a museum. Much less admin overburden and more contact with the public, so a better work-life balance in total. If you can move out (have the finances to do it), then I'd say go for it. Academia will not get better so it's either staying and accepting worsening working conditions and less opportunities, or taking life in your own hands.",

I thrive on the real team work (as opposed to competing for the good results in collaborative topics), the applied work we do and the variation in my projects. I used to do reasearch on climate change (the effects of it) which I considerred pretty useful. Now I'm working for an organisation actively taking steps to mitigate and battle climate change, which feels way more useful and satisfying.\n\nThere is so much we can do with our lives (and so much joy/satisfaction to find in the work we do) outside of academia. Funnily enough when I meet up with academic mates and their academic contacts, people tend to ask me \"Do you *really* not miss it?\" as if they can't believe (or won't allow them to think) there is a great life on the outside. (The only thing I sometimes miss is friends I made during my fieldwork that are now living at the other side of the world and I don't see them at conferences. It's also nice to live near to your friends).\n\nThe other day someone used my PhD dataset (from 10 years ago) in a paper and in the emails with the authors (I did not contribute much, have not kept up with the literature) I could not hel but thinking: \"After 10 years, this is still not really solved and meanwhile the Amazon is burning and the ice sheets are melting...Although this is an interesting question, the paper topic, we need action on climate change 100 times more than another paper about my little ex-niche\")\n\nNB I am not sad about my journey at all though. If I had gone stright into my current carreer I would have always wondered what it would have been like. Now, having done the PhD, post-doc, lecturer journey (wasn't a lecturer for long) I know how that sausage is made and realy appreciate the 9-5 stability (that I frowned upon 15 years ago). I *love* not working in my Christmas break, for example, and having an employer who takes overtime and a healthy work/life balance seriously.\n\nAlso, academia in the UK is only going to get leaner after Brexit, so if you're thinking of getting out, just go for it. Make an exit strategy/Shawshank yourself out.\n\nGood luck!",

You say you don't need constant praise or feedback, but you also say that getting kudos at your old job was a significant mental boost. Perhaps you should take some time to actually analyse what kind of environment you work best in, and also whether you can realistically find that in your field.",

I'm nearly 20 years in on PhD life, and it's going well, but I plan to \"retire early\" so I can do manual and LOCAL work. One drawback of my job (environmental economics) is the depressing nature of everyday reading. \n\n(Don't even get me started on grants, research and bureaucracy!)\n\nAdvice: Start the beer or plumbing hobby. Maybe you get paid, maybe you don't, but at least you'll have a diversion from the academic scrum.",

Now I\u2019m expected to be a serious and professional grown up- which I suppose is inevitable- but I\u2019ve been craving the good old days of working in a bar and having zero worries about the intricacies of my job and whether I am performing well enough.
