  "text": "The advice given by my department is that we should thank everyone who has helped us in any way with our project - family, friends, babysitters etc, and be honest about what they've done. Thus mine goes something a little like this \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- to family for plying me with confectionary to get me to do work, and for proofreading even though you must be sick of it by now. Thanks to my friends for the same. \n\n\\- to my supervisor for his work, and for getting me through three years of uni (he's taught a lot of my modules\n\n\\- to my colleagues for getting me into \\[dissertation topic\\]. May this serve as proof that I did listen when you told me things and that my three years at uni haven't all been spent drinking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs that okay or should I tone it down a little, or a lot",

I've been on search committees on the hiring end  where we definitely pull up theses and dissertations from online databases or ask candidates to submit an electronic copy or link directly. Also if you ever apply for a job outside the US (more and more people do, given the job market), and in Europe, sending a link or electronic copy of your dissertation is quite common. Obviously acknowledgements are personal but just keep it so you wouldn't mind people hiring you to see what you wrote there and it won't cause embarrassment to you or people writing your job letters.

Likewise I'd avoid snide remarks about anyone, particularly your supervisor, even if it's an in-joke.\n\nMost acknowledgements I've read usually take the form - supervisor, committee members, other academics mentoring, lab members, friends in the department, friends outside of the department, family.\n\nAs a side note, I've read some people will read the acknowledgements to get an insight into a person's writing ability, as it's the only part of the thesis that likely hasn't been edited extensively.",

Do you? The sheer number of posts here from people who say they've done or seen the exact same thing indicates that this sort of thing is the opposite of personal -- it's just meme humor. Actual dedications are moving and unique because they couldn't be otherwise -- they actually tell you something about the person who wrote it. \n\nAnyway, I think that after you've seen a few of these, the self-deprecating humor starts to look less like modesty and more like a preemptive defense against negative judgments -- \"Joke's on you if you take this seriously, because I didn't!\"",

My friends at my former workplace, some of whom are of a different generation lets say, believed that there was no real place for working class people at university. They genuinely did believe that I would spend all my time drinking, instead I am on track for a first. I make that comment because I promised to send a copy to them since they really did get me into the specific subject of my dissertation. \n\nThere are many people who will testify this isn't me trying to go for 'meme humour' since, as they will swear I don't actually understand memes. My dedication does have a little more to it than that, especially the family part. I didn't post that because that was not the part that I was unsure of. It may be slightly self-depreciating but it is true. And I have taken my degree very seriously. I would not have got myself \u00a354000+ in debt for something I was just playing around with. \n\nLastly, I'm sure yours was very dry and serious, thus fulfilling your intention to tell the reader a little about you. Mine also does that - anxious verbalisation is something I'm prone to, I'll admit that. But as said before my supervisor does know me for having a sense of humour, and knows my personality. *I write for a comedy show!*  My supervisor knows that. Not a major one, but its a start. It would be more unusual for those who know me to be completely serious, though I can say with certainty the rest of my diss is. \n\nHonestly, if I get negative feedback, that's fair. I've tried my best, and yes it will be upsetting, but I'm an adult and I will deal. If I then use humour self-depreciating or otherwise as part of that process, that's my prerogative, just as it would be to say get blind drunk, or to rip up my dissertation having a hissy fit. \n\nIn other words thank you for your feedback!",
