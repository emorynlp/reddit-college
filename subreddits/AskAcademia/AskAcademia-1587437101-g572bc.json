  "text": "I am thinking of applying for a PhD in art history in the near future. I love my field of study and have already decided on a project I would love to work on. However, I worry that I will get too engrossed in my topic of research. It will then cause me to become less socially aware of the world and to forget that there is still life outside of a PhD. Has anyone had that experience? If so, do you have any tips on how to maintain a good balance between dedicating your time to PhD work that you're incredibly passionate about and your other interests?",

At the end of the day, it's easy to get lost in the weeds when concentrating on a small niche topic.\n\nSo for me, it's important to make sure I keep engaging in topics unrelated to my PhD project. Reading outside my field, exploring music and art. Watching films. If I don't do this, I think I'll lose sight of the larger picture and the dynamic fabric of humanity...you know all that mumbo jumbo that gives people purpose in life.",

You want to see productive researchers? Look for the ones who are getting some headspace away from what they are doing. Do *some* people thrive on being 100% focussed at all times on their one interest? Sure, but they are a tiny minority and incredibly unhealthy stereotype for 99% of people to follow. When I have worked with lab martyrs who like telling people how they work a million hours a week what almost exclusively is going on behind the scenes is maybe 4-6 hours of productive work a day, then lots of hours where they are - frankly - not getting a lot done. \n\nCome in, work until you're not being productive anymore, go home and give your head a rest. PI's expecting long hours for the sake of long hours are - in my view - a poisonous cancer. Proper lab leadership should revolve around giving aims and objectives, not \"I expect you to be in the lab 70 hours a week\". Fuck that and the people who say it.",

Conversations with others I would feel really disassociated from. Often felt like they were just talking about random boring things or normal things that i then found incredibly trivial. I found Michael Stipe of REM talk about this once, that it takes him a few weeks after a tour and playing shows in front of a lot of people to get back to enjoying having dinner with people, general discussion, and after a tour the conversation can feel really stupid for a while.  I guess this was also one of the most enjoyable parts of PhD-  intense pressure leading to intense focus. One solution i found was to work in waves.  Let myself get really obsessed with it for 4 or 5 days, work until obsession wanes, and come come out of it for normal life for a bit. Only difficult thing was syncing with other peoples schedule",

At that point, I would try to over compensate and try to look into the topics of our conversation so I would feel more connected.

In that way you still feel engaged and productive, but it prevents the tunnel vision. If you struggle with work-life balance, actively schedule downtime into your days.",

              "text": "Yeah it's maybe not always the same type of intolerance that they're talking about in the comment, but there's definitely  gatekeepers who deem anyone not willing to give up their whole life in pursuit of research unworthy of obtaining a PhD. On top of that, it's not like there's no discrimination against racial, gender and sexual orientation minority groups. And there's tons of PIs who take advantage of their students' cheap labor. I'm sure not every place is that bad but it is not an uncommon occurrence.\n\nBesides that, using the PhD as a guidepost for intelligence is a bad idea. I've seen a lot of people get pushed through the system when they really did not understand the material/ put in the work just because their PIs didn't want a dropout after five years on record.",

Our department throws us happy hours, coffee hours, social and volunteer events, so it\u2019s easy to leave and socialize when your whole lab gets up to go.",
