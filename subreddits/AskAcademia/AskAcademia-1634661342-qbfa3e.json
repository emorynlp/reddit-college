  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently in the process of picking a thesis subject for my AI masters degree.\nI find it to be a difficult decision and am, after elimination of others, left with two projects that I think could both really be fun.\n\nAs such, I think I want to make my decision by minimising possible future regret, but since we're not there yet, I do not know what I might regret so I've decided to turn to the hivemind/internet/reddit and ask you:\n\nWhat do/did you regret about your thesis? \n\nI'm looking for anything remotely related, so please do mention it even if you would otherwise think it is too far removed.\n\nThanks everyone, you've helped me make up my mind!",

The thesis has a job to do, and after it does that job it doesn't have a tremendous amount of value. So keeping the scope of the thesis narrow is really important.",

              "text": "I had a good committee who didn't let my proposal get out-of-hand from the start. Two best pieces of advice I received: (1) \"leave something for your actual career\", and (2) \"do something short that yields results, graduate, and then get into a job where you can make real money\". A lot of people have tone-deaf committees who think a student is content with just being a student in perpetuity and set the target at perfection, I was lucky to not have that and when possible I try to be the reasonable person in the room when I sit on student committees as a research scientist.  \n  \nThe point where I had to reign it in a second time was in what turned into the last six months of my time as ABD in graduate school, where I had the option of either sewing things up and finalizing a portfolio of work for my dissertation or continue to tweak, refine, add experiments, or test-drive new methods or analytics that are constantly coming into your frame of vision from other people's work. It takes courage to tell yourself that it's time to finish - there is a certain amount of identity assassination involved with finishing since up to that point it's likely that the only thing you've ever *been* is a student, and finishing means you have to become something else. The end product is not everything it could be, nothing is, but understanding that it doesn't have to be everything it could be is key.",

But there is no one right answer. The thesis is a project that is part of earning your degree. If you have two good options, pick one, enjoy the process, and know that in, say, five years from now, it is highly unlikely that you will spend your time looking back wishing you had selected the other project.",

So, I knew that topic was my \u201cticket\u201d. The process wasn\u2019t all roses for sure, but at least I liked it and thought it was important which helps a TON with perseverance! I also went into the process sort of blindly- which may have been good. I don\u2019t think I knew all that would end up being involved so I just kept doing the next thing as I learned and was advised. I \u201cdrove\u201d the dissertation process more than my thesis, but of course had committees for both.

      "text": "Maybe it\u2019s not something I regret but rather something I could\u2019ve done better - ask questions and request for feedback!! I tend to overthink and wonder if I\u2019m being annoying if I were to ask something but honestly your supervisor is there to help you so don\u2019t feel bad for using that valuable resource. \n\nAlso, not everything has to be perfect. For the longest time I didn\u2019t want to send anything to my supervisor cuz I felt like my work wasn\u2019t good enough yet. But again, they\u2019re there to help you and once I started sending in drafts, the process got so much smoother and it\u2019ll help w your confidence too.",

      "text": "I wish I was more organised with following up what I did each day, like keeping a little journal. Because sometimes I wished that I could have gone back to see how my thought process was about a particular thing etc.\n\nOne thing I _don't_ regret was choosing something I was really interested in, and challenging myself. My master thesis went on for a year and it's draining enough as it is, so I thought I might as well do and learn about something I love. This did cause me to change project last minute because I didn't believe in the first idea as much.",
