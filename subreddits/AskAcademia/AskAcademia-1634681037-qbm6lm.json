  "title:": "How involved should one be to support a student who was raped?",
  "text": "A student who was once in my class has been raped. She is one of our brightest but has majorly spiraled down mentally and academically since her assault. It is unsettling to see her that way. She is a foreigner and for some reason has chosen to confide in me because \"she trusts me.\" I realize how much being isolated and away from family slows down her healing process. She is seeking therapy professionally.  I have noticed that she has  a sense of security around me and writes regularly \"to feel safe.\" I don't question her intention and realize how terrified she is. However, I am unsure of what my role should be. How much should I engage with her in a supportive role? What would you do or think is an appropriate response? She is not enrolled in my class at the moment.",

      "text": "So, first and foremost, I am very sympathetic to your student and to you. This is an awful situation, and your student deserves so much more support that it seems that she's getting. I'm both glad that you're willing to step into the gap and furious that your school doesn't have a clear route to connect your student to full-time personnel whose job it is to do this work.\n\nOdds are that you are not yourself a qualified clinical psychologist, which means that you do not have the tools to properly help your student. The best thing that you can do is to educate yourself about the resources that are available, and help your student access those resources.  As others have said, you should also document the work you're doing here, both as a CYA and (IMO more importantly) to document your institution's faulty processes for supporting students. \n\nIn the midst of that, there is *absolutely nothing wrong* with expressing compassion and sympathy to your student. She trusts you with this information, and that should mean a lot. Do everything you can for her. This is literally a situation in which you have an opportunity to save the life of someone you care about, and it's okay to make that the driving principle in how you approach this situation.",

      "text": "I was the one who was messed with and when my teachers found out, they got sympathetic. Overly so. I left high-school for correspondence work because their attitudes changed towards me. \nI would have appreciated them to tell me that they were there if I ever needed someone I trusted to talk to if I ever needed it. As well as them just continuing to treat me like a normal human being. Any conversation except for about what happened would have made it easier.\nI never changed, they did.\nI also used to love the distractions with school work. \n\nMaybe if you are comfortable letting them know that you are there for them and it will absolutely not be brought up again unless they do would be good. Focusing on who they are, their accomplishments and their personal goals would be the best way to help. \nMy teachers stopped pushing me towards my goals which hurt... a lot.\nThey just need someone to see them as a human and encourage them to be their best self.\n\nSorry for the hard read. My words and feelings get jumbled when people ask this question. I just wish more people knew.\nThank you for thinking of them and asking for help in supporting them.",

Although you say she *was once* in your class, she is *still* in your institution. Boundaries both formal and traditional still apply to your relationship - ongoing. You have a liability here as you *are* in a position of authority but given the question you are obviously not trained to deal with this and you likely cannot be a friend or even confidant without potentially violating a contract or ethics obligation you have with the institution. However, you *can* refer her to the appropriate resources and do a little research for her.

Reporting that she was raped without her consent is not a good idea because there can be a million reasons why she herself has not reported it yet. Suggest her to report it, and let her do that if she feels. The most important thing here is, she has felt deprived of control over a situation when she got raped, and is probably very vulnerable and the more you let her confide in you the less chances are that she will feel strong again. Talk to her as a friend for sure. But very carefully explain it to her that she needs to become strong. She is taking therapy so you should not worry a lot. Also, let her know that she shouldn't share what discussion is happening between her and her therapist with you (if she does share that), because you are not a trained professional and you can't or shouldn't give advice on those matters. \nDo your bit, but let her take care of herself so that she feels empowered again. Also, take care of yourself too. \nBeing an international student it can definitely get very lonely especially in such circumstances, and what you're doing is commendable! I really appreciate your efforts.\n\nI'm also in a US university and an international student. I too have received some training, but it's always about what the victim decides to do. Also, I'm sure when she met a therapist, the therapist with her consent made a report of it. That report is only for legal reasons and stays between the victim, the therapist, and if needs be a doctor, and some kind of legal coordinator. It doesn't have to be public and even before talking to the therapist she might have gone through a counselor and they would have certainly made a report of it. Now, whether any action is to be taken or not, is entirely upon the victim's consent.\n\nYou should also reach out to your universities division that deals with sexual assaults and such issues, to understand what you can do in case you didn't get any training, because different states have different policies and it's best to reach out. If they don't require, keep her name anonymous.",

      "text": "First off, a lot of people are saying \"mandatory reporter\", however, has the situation been dealt with by a) law enforcement agency b) non-academic misconduct authority?\n\nThese type of situations are extremely tricky. I would personally provide resources about what _they_ can do, be it mental health, legal help etc. but first I would ask if this \"alleged\" sexual assault has been investigated by any of the above as you don't know the specifics around what has happened nor whether it has been dealt with legally or not. \n\nI'm not saying this is the case, but I know a person that spread a false accusation out of jealousy and it was reported by a third party. Turns out the accuser got suspended indefinitely for frivolously spreading a rumour and the other person was found not in violation of sexual assault - the accused suffered severe mental health decline from the tedious process with no support or representation. In my opinion, these types of cases should be always dealt with by the justice system with adequate legal representation. If found guilty, the university should be notified and therefore internal disciplinary action sought.\n\nI'm not a fan of universities taking a stance on a situation before legitimate legal authorities have investigated, charged and tried a person before a judge and jury. There's no professional, legal representation for either party and this is people's lives and health at stake... you wouldn't report a murder to the non-academic misconduct authority before the police, would you? Although this is slightly different, the severity is almost similar and long lasting - the label paedophile, rapist etc. sticks regardless of outcome\n\nJust my two cents and people may disagree, but the person who was acquitted nearly committed suicide from the stress and trauma of being processed as a sexual assault offender.\n\nEdit: processed as a potential sexual offender*",

They can help you talk through your options and understand your specific university policy. \n2. A referral for academic accommodations through the disability services office. The student can get accommodations for the trauma they experienced without formally reporting to the university.\n3. If you do find that that you\u2019re a mandatory reporter, let the student know immediately. Let the student know they shouldn\u2019t disclose specific details or names to you in case you are required to make a report.\n4. Connect the student with off-campus resources who can guide them through their options, provide counseling services, safety planning, etc. Usually a \u201cfamily justice center\u201d is the best resource for this. \n5. If you\u2019re unclear whether or not you\u2019re a mandatory reporter, you\u2019re probably not the only one who could use clarification. Reach out to your Title IX coordinator and ask for a faculty training. It is essential that everyone receives yearly training on university policies, reporting options, supportive measures, etc. Help hold your school accountable \u2014 trainings are absolutely necessary and should be conducted annually.",
