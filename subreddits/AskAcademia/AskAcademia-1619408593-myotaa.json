There are about 300-350 of them per year, so excluding those still puts us at 400-470 (and some of the medical PhDs are research based, so I think we're still above 500 \"real\" PhDs.\n\nJust checking a few other universities in Germany: for example, Heidelberg graduates 1200 PhDs per year (in terms of number of PhDs, Heidelberg is the largest university in Germany), Hamburg has been at around 800 per year. I did not find statistics for the number of medical theses, but for Germany in general, about 22% of all people enrolled in a PhD are in medicine, see [https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bildung-Forschung-Kultur/Hochschulen/Publikationen/Downloads-Hochschulen/promovierendenstatistik-5213501197004.pdf?\\_\\_blob=publicationFile](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bildung-Forschung-Kultur/Hochschulen/Publikationen/Downloads-Hochschulen/promovierendenstatistik-5213501197004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) ; so even if one takes into account that a doctorate in medicine takes less time than one in other subjects, the fraction of medical PhDs is probably less than 1/3 or so).\n\nSince I have found the statistics and /u/Eigengrad was commenting on the number of enrolled researchers doing a PhD,  the numbers for larger universities in Germany (more than 4000 researchers doing a PhD) are: Heidelberg: 8300, Freiburg: 4800, Tuebingen: 5400, Erlangen: 4500, LMU Munich: 7900, TU Munich: 7000, Hamburg: 5000, Aachen: 6000, Bonn: 6400, or Dresden: 6000.  And before you think this is a purely German statistic: Amsterdam has around 4000 PhD researchers,  Toulouse has 4300 or Complutense in Madrid has 6400 students. So, yes, it is not too atypical to find universities outside of the US with a large number of PhD researchers.",

Based on the lack of a research requirement, I personally wonder if \u201cmaster\u2019s degree\u201d should be either redefined (so as to generally not require research) or perhaps replaced with a more accurate term, like \u201cprofessional certificate\u201d.

Lots of MA programs don't have a research or thesis requirements. Infact traditionally, the MA was coursework. The M.Phil was the thesis oriented degree. That system is still followed in a few countries, even though the M.Phil has become somewhat obsolete in the UK for a lot of programs and has been removed.\n\nHonestly, I don't really think it matters that much. At the end of the day the somewhat universalist language of degrees is always going to be undermined by the highly differentiated nature of each field. Most lawschools in the US don't require their faculty to have PhDs (unless they be non-lawyers teaching subjects like Legal History) but they do expect a shitton of research and publication experience from JDs wanting to teach. It makes sense that in that situation the LLM became vestigial too. Its actually a good program for Law schools to integrate foreign scholars, since their initial training will obviously be highly country specific just as they are in the US. \n\nIf the MA continues to serve as a bridge degree between various programs and industrial outcomes as it currently does, I'd say its serving a unique purpose between doctorates and bachelors degrees. Might as well let it continue to do that.",

      "text": "I'm assuming this is PhDs across the entire university. I'm not sure why that would be so surprising. The relatively small intake of Universities in places such as the US, EU and the UK is not prevalent across the worlds. Many universities in smaller countries, especially countries which don't have the same depth of higher education that the wealthier nations enjoy typically take in much higher numbers. This is due both to much higher population density and the relatively lower number of individual institutions which puts a greater burden on each. In countries like India for instance, each program in a PG university might admit anywhere between 10-30 PhD candidates. Now consider that old style, full spectrum universities offer degrees in dozens of subjects, an annual graduation of a few hundred PhD scholars isn't unusual at all.\n\nThese sorts of numbers are quite routine for a vast swathe of universities across the world, though typically associated with poorer national economies.",
