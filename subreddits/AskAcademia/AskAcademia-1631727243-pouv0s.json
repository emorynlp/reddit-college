  "text": "Title - I'm a postdoc interested in becoming a staff scientist. I love the scientific process and dread the thought of being a PI. My ideal job would be working for/funded by a PI with aligned research interests to mine, doing bench experiments, and applying to grants when I have a good idea but not constantly applying to survive.\n\nI would like to apply for my own funding to make myself more competitive. I was initially going to apply to an NIH F32, but I'm realizing that the commitment to being an independent researcher is a core component to that funding mechanism.\n\nShould I apply to an F32 anyway? If not, what funding opportunities should I pursue if I want to support myself, but not achieve complete scientific independence?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I'm not in the US so I can't help at all; I just wanted to say that as another post-doc with zero ambition to become a PI/lab leader/fully independent scientist, I wish you luck! I wish there was a more obvious career path for those of us who want to continue doing research at a reasonable level without necessarily climbing the ladder. I'm lucky to have a supportive PI at the moment who is happy to keep me on while he has funding, but I think in a few years max I'll probably leave academia because it doesn't seem like a sustainable path.",

      "text": "You can apply to an F32, but that's only going to cover your salary for 3 years during your postdoc. But it would look pretty good on your CV. (Also, you might need to lie and say that you want to become a PI to get the funding)\n\nBut you don't need any funding to become a senior scientist in an academic lab. You just need some skills, get along with the PI, and maybe help out with whatever the lab needs. But you're probably going to be pretty dependent on the PI's funding, and you won't have a whole lot of job security. \n\nAn alternative would be to jump ship to industry in big pharma and join an exploratory department where you can stay as a bench scientist. You'll prob have more job security in this role.",

      "text": "I'm not in the US though from what I've heard of there should be plenty of option available as research officer employed under federal gov/national lab. Usually you're not required to apply for grants, you will work using the research fund provided by the workplace (at least in my country, not sure bout US). \n\nThe salary is usually slightly lower or higher than postdoc depending on years of experience, skills etc. But at least there's a job security, balance work hour and workload than academia. I think they value more of your analytical, scientific skills and research management skills than your ability to grab a funding (well, at least in my country).\n\nCheck out the group \"The professor is out\" on Facebook. There are plenty of sound advice for those moving from postdoc/academia into federal/gov related role (yes research related too) in the US in the group. You can try asking there too. Good luck!",
