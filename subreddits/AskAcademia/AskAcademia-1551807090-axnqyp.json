              "text": "This is an important distinction -- in the US, most PhDs require getting an MA included as part of the PhD program itself -- my first two years of my programs consisted purely of coursework and another eight-ish months of comps/quals that are required as part of the program, and was granted an MA as a result (at which point several of my cohort left the program). As a result, most US PhDs (at least in my field) are typically 1-3 years longer than their UK counterparts that don't include MA coursework and they are given funding for those years that typically isn't available for UK MA programs. Even if an admitted PhD student has a masters already, they are usually required to do a second round of coursework and get a second masters.\n\nThere are separate MA programs in the US that are typically unfunded (or minimally funded), but they are often \"consolation prizes\" for applicants who applied to the PhD program but didn't get in, and so students who pay for their MAs at a university that offered a funded PhD are sometimes considered \"cash cows\" for the university and given less attention/mentoring than their funded, PhD-route counterparts.\n\nIf OP is looking to avoid paying for their masters, looking to US PhD programs is probably their best bet, but lacking a masters while applying to UK PhD programs is definitely an uphill battle (though I can't say how much).",

Integrated masters graduates do better in the graduate job market than bachelors graduates too, so there's no concern that getting one might be a waste of time if they aren't keen on acadaemia.\n\nSo a good proportion of the graduates considering a PhD already have a masters. And while a masters isn't a requirement, if a BSc and an integrated masters graduate are interviewing for the same PhD position, the masters grad has a year-long individual project they can talk about.\n\nSo people who don't do an integrated masters need to do other things to be competitive. That could be a separate Master's degree, but it doesn't *have* to be. They could also have done a year in industry placement, or have worked in a lab for a couple of years after graduation.\n\nIt's a bit of an arms race really!",

So the two systems are quite different (and I think UK and Europe share similar structures).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the US, graduate programs usually pool from applicants that have completed their 4-year bachelors. However, it is not unusual for applicants with masters degrees to move onto a PhD program as well. US PhD programs typically involve \\~2 years of intense coursework that would make up (approximately) a masters degree in a particular field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn UK/Europe, students specialize far earlier and often get awarded both a BA/BS and MSc/MRes/etc. by the end of their 4th year. A BA/BS in the UK is a 3 year program usually. PhD programs in the UK expect applicants to have a masters degree by the time they move onto a PhD (and this seems to be the case in Europe). There are some exceptions though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome PhD programs in the UK follow a 1+3 program, where the 1st year is a masters program (involving coursework and examinations) then move onto the PhD (3 years) phase after successfully completing the masters. These are called Doctoral Training Programmes (DTPs) or Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs). I was able to get into a CDT/DTP with a US bachelors degree and go on from there. Many of my colleagues (in the same program) already had an MSc or MA by the time they were admitted, but most had only a bachelors degree.

In my case, the experiences I gained doing a MS left me much better prepared to undertake a PhD.

That said, two other guys, went straight from school to bachelor to PhD.\n\nI don't know about your subject, but almost everyone I know did an Undergraduate Masters, which basically is a 4 year undergraduate course, where the final year is mainly taught, but there is a bit more focus (~30% of credits for the year, though might be different depending on institute) on a research project. Though from what I saw the people that stopped after 3 years were generally the ones who got lower grades and wanted to leave the field and get a job ASAP, so of course if very few of them apply, there will be very few of them doing PhDs, so its not exactly a good representation of your chances. \n",
