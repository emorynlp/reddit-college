  "text": "Hi.. I'm sorry if this is unrelated or has been raised before by someone but I've been struggling with this for quite some time. I recently finished by Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and got a job as an academic instructor at my university. I'm currently inclined to pursue my career in an academic route, as a research engineer and probably as a lecturer. I'm currently stuck with the question of whether to do an MPhil. or an MSc in Engineering. Which would be a better choice for me to pursue a PhD later in the future and what are the downsides of doing a MSc instead of an Mphil, if there are any? \n\nThanks in advance.",
