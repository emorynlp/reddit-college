  "title:": "What is it like being in a PhD program while being in a relationship with someone who is not in school at all or doesn\u2019t know much about academia?",
  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m not sure if this is the right page to ask this sort of question on, & if you have suggestions for what other page I can ask this sort of question do share below in the comments. I am starting a PhD program in the Fall that requires both my significant other & I to move to a different state. I love them so much & am extremely grateful they are supportive of what I am choosing to do with my life & willing to move with me. My s/o & I do not live together, but we have been together for a few years & have spent enough time around each other to know our habits/routines. We alternate staying at each other\u2019s apartments for X amount of days. He graduated from uni years ago & has been in his career ever since. My partner is a pretty self-sufficient person, but I still worry that grad school will consume me & I will not have any time for him & our relationship. I would just like to know other people\u2019s experiences of what it is like being in a committed relationship with someone who isn\u2019t in grad school. I\u2019ll take all the advice/opinions/thoughts that I can get. Thank you SO much in advance!!",

      "text": "My fiancee is not in academia and I am *extremely* grateful for that fact.\n\nFor context: I met my s/o in the middle of my PhD and we dated for the last \\~2 years of my PhD. When I got a postdoc in another city, she moved with me, and we're still going strong two years later.\n\nHaving a non-academic s/o has helped me maintain a much healthier work-life balance than I see of many of my colleagues that are (single or) in relationships with other academics. She works the same hours every day, which more-or-less forces me to work the same hours every day, too. We wake up, leave for work, come home and go to bed at the same times. In the evenings we have dinner together and relax, or go out and see friends, or whatever. (I mean normally, not during the coronavirus pandemic, of course.)\n\nI'm much more productive in the daytime, and much more relaxed in the evenings, and I sleep much better, than before we started dating. It's a lot harder to be suckered into staying up all night working on research, responding to emails, etc., when you're spending time with your non-academic s/o who wants to do normal-person-things with you.\n\nAnother benefit is that what binds us is non-work related, which is great therapy. When I'm stressed about research/teaching/all the other academic b/s, I can put it all to rest and just enjoy my time with her.\n\nI do want to pick up on something you said:\n\n>I still worry that grad school will consume me & I will not have any time for him & our relationship\n\nIf you don't have time for your relationship, either (1) you should not be in your relationship, or (2) you should not be in academia.\n\nDespite what people like to say, it *is* possible to be successful in academia and maintain a healthy relationship. You just have to avoid being consumed by it, and accept that you might not achieve perfection but you can still do very well.",

We have very different kinds of stressors in our life and generally run in very different social circles (though I\u2019m a vet, too so there is some overlap there). We keep each other grounded and lend each other perspective. when I have two papers due in the same weekend he cooks and cleans and keeps our son busy. When he\u2019s been on a patrol that ended with a late night SAR case, he comes home to find his uniforms ready for the next day and some food and beer in the fridge. We respect each other\u2019s chaos, pull a little extra weight when the other needs it, and give each other some grace and understanding when we don\u2019t necessarily understand the source of stress but can see it\u2019s real. Neither of us thinks the other has a more or less important job. We understand that different seasons of life require different sacrifices. I\u2019ve slowed my career development in the past because of the military and he is avoiding promotion right now because it would require us to move out of state and mess up my research. Things have no always felt equitable in the moment but, as corny as it sounds, we approach life as a team and decisions are made to protect the *long term* success of that team. \n\nThe key to a healthy relationship is respect and empathy.",

For me it\u2019s the same except not necessarily in terms of work balance. It\u2019s more that I need to escape the stuffiness and pressure of academia on a daily basis. Even having drinks with my colleagues can be exhausting because it feels like you are in a courtroom guardedly watching your every word so you don\u2019t offend someone or open an hour-long lecture/convo. I would have a meltdown if I also needed to come home to that after \u201cclocking out\u201d of the academic sphere for the day. \n\nI love having an SO I can just joke around with and say stupid things in front of and not have to worry about having a debate. Also, this is why I really miss my buddies from back home as well as the people I am surrounded by here in the field (fieldwork). Just regular, normal people. I can just let loose with them.

It is also nice that he is not a poor academic so we can have normal people luxuries like an adult apartment or restaurants in weekends. The most important thing however is how he keeps me grounded in the real world and helps me see what is normal or not outside universities. This makes it hard for me to fit in with pure academics however.",

I don't think it matters whether the partner works in academia for that though. In my case, my partner and I studied fairly similar subjects (which is how we originally clicked), and he is very much interested in my research, understands its importance and wants to know more about it. Sure, he doesn't necessarily know all the theory behind it, but he can provide me with an additional practical, down-to-earth perspective that I need sometimes and I often find clarity in sharing new discoveries with him, because he challenges me to reflect on them and put them in the bigger picture of my research.\n\nSo I don't think it is an academia / non-academia discussion, but rather an issue of whether a partner is interested and willing to engage with our research.",

      "text": "I'll just throw in a different perspective here. \n\nI work in academia and have for about a decade. My spouse and I were married a few years and had a young child (3ish) when I started in a master's program part time while I was working full time. She worked part time. \n\nAbout a year into my MS she changed careers and decided to go back to school full time and get an MA. \n\nAs another commenter mentioned we were in very different disciplines which was probably a good thing. We could read and copy edit each other's work focusing on clarity, without getting too in the weeds technically.\n\nThis isn't a direct response to your situation, but a related situation. On the one hand neither were PhD programs. On the other, I worked fulltime and was a part time student. She worked part time and was a fulltime student. Between the two of us we had 3 fulltime occupations. And a child to care for.\n\nIt was incredibly stressful as well as a major commitment of time and money. While living together, owning a home, and raising a family we often didn't see each other several nights a week. And often the nights we did, would consist of work, dinner, get the kid in bed, then put on a pot of coffee and study/write until 3 or 4 am. Then get up to get to work and the kid to day care.\n\nWe usually took one night off a week as a date night to ensure we still had some time where we weren't consumed by school work.\n\n\nThe conclusions which relate to your situation are:\n\n- Both partners need to be patient and supportive.\n\n- Whether your significant other is in academia or not, they need to understand what the demands and limitations are, hopefully early on. Also what the trajectory for a Phd program is. \n\n- It's also really important to be supportive and understand that the academic program isn't forever. This phase looks one way. A post doc will be a different program in a different place with a different schedule. So the current normal and the future new normal will be (and should be!) different too. As will any future research, industry, or academic appointment. \n\n- As all of those changes occur you both need  to be willing to grow together in new directions. \n\n\n- You will need a support structure in your life, especially if kids are involved. We could not have succeeded without support from family and friends; such as babysitting, day care pick ups, etc. \n\n\nA final thought, good luck and good perseverance!  The difference between a successful academic and not (in my experience) is wisdom and perseverance. I know plenty of brilliant people who wouldn't choose academia and probably couldn't see a terminal degree through to the end. I've also dealt with enough folks with terminal degrees that aren't actually all that bright but were diligent and dogged in their persistence. Most I've met were both; smart hard working people who sought the challenge of research and academic discipline for themselves  (because we're certainly not in it for the money!)",

Imagine explaining to your working class parents that you plan to be a student for another two years to get another graduate degree. But then you\u2019re going to stay in school for another 4 to 10 years to get a ANOTHER graduate degree. Then maybe you\u2019re going to get a post doc degree. All of this means you still don\u2019t have a professional title like they would in a company where by now you might be a vice president. Here is where it gets really wacky. After being a student, if you are very lucky and very talented, you can become an assistant professor. And then if you\u2019re even more talented and more lucky you become an associate professor.

My research is in public health law, which isn't quite what he does (he's a tax lawyer), but since we've both got the law background, he understands my work really well and has been a great sounding board over the years. From a financial perspective, it was also great to have him practicing law while I was going through grad school.  The less good part of the story comes when we had kids. Because I was seen to be available when I wasn't teaching and I mostly work from home (which is near the kids' school), there were some times of resentment when I picked up significant amounts of slack on that front due to having a more flexible schedule. It got bad a few times, to be honest. But now that the kids are older and more self-sufficient and he's made partner so he's pushing less hard at work, things have reached a good balance.",

My first 2 years had such heavy coursework that I barely had time for anything else. I met my partner after that period, whose getting a PhD in a neighbouring uni. His workload has been consistent through his degree and pretty much works 9-5. I cannot do that and graduate on time. However, on date nights I make an effort to spend my focus on him and when he's off adventuring on weekends, I get caught up on some readings.\n\nI think it really depends on whether your partner is willing to support you if you have a busy semester, which will include rough days for months at a time.",

Back then her salary was 3 times my stipend, so at the beginning I made it clear to her that for several years I'd be very limited in what money I could spend on holidays, trips, etc. She didn't give a shit about that, so all good on that side.\n\nAt times it was frustrating for both of us, in different ways, that I just couldn't seem to switch off from my research the way she could switch off from her work when we both came home. That was something I should have worked on much more at the time, but failed to do so. It was something overlooked for a while, though, that one of us was doing a job to pay their share of the bills and the other was fulfilling a life's dream in getting that qualification, and that 'coming home' for both of us meant different things. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nAt my writing-up stage I already had a full-time job, so I would work for 5 days and spend one day at the weekend back in the lab writing-up. That was a period of time that was tough on both of us, spending only one full day together per week, but we got through that too. By then I'd learned that when I got home, I left work and PhD at the door, so that helped a lot.\n\nTo respond directly to something you said:\n\n> but I still worry that grad school will consume me & I will not have any time for him & our relationship\n\nYou need to *make time* outside of your research for your home life. Do not let it consume you, get good at closing the laptop for the night or for the weekend and leave the desk. Dedicate time to you, to your partner and to other aspects of your life in the same way that you will dedicate chunks of your week to your studies. Be very strict with yourself!",

My wife and I have a system in place, and i think thats been helping me cope with this whole ordeal. Whenever i have crazy ours, or i go to the lab on weekends, or something like that, she forces me to ask myself (or she asks me) if it can be done tomorrow/monday, so for instance, taking care of the animals after a surgery, that has to be done over the weekend whether we like it or not, re-plotting data, can be done on monday. Finishing a presentation for the next day, has to be done even at crazy hours, filling the documentation to archive, can be done tomorrow, and so on.\n\nAnd also, be honest and tell them how you feel, the whole academic world is weird and its hard for people to understand it. Every PhD experience is different, but in my experience, the most crucial thing is that your partner is ready for the roller-coaster that is this thing, when you feel like the king of the world one week, and an useless POS the next one.",

      "text": "I was in a very similar situation as you - we got married at the end of my undergrad and then moved with me for graduate school. It was a great decision - she kept me grounded during graduate school so that it felt more like a job and less all consuming. The extra income was also nice! We will be celebrating 13 years in 2020, if we are ever allowed to leave the house. (FWIW, I'm a professor now.)\n\nRelated: Not sure what you are going to graduate school for, but it is much different than undergrad. For me, my undergrad experience felt like a 24/7 job. There was always something to do, either for classes, extracurricular, Greek, etc. Although you can still be crazy in graduate school, there are far fewer hard commitments. Much easier to have a reasonable work/life balance. Don't let your boss rope you into 80 hour weeks - 40-45 hours (including classes!) is fine.",

Thank you for your input, it seems that is the common consensus that having a significant other outside of academia helped them remain grounded & not become heavily consumed in their work. I\u2019m getting my degree in clinical psychology & currently work full-time as a research assistant at the university I graduated from. I\u2019m glad I made this post, it\u2019s been great reading everyone\u2019s responses!",

      "text": "I am so glad my fiance is not in Academia. We met during the 2nd year of my Ph.D., right in the middle of coursework for me. He is a software developer that has a normal 9-5 job. Dating a non-academic forced me to create a schedule that made time for him. He also gives me perspective about my work and encourages a healthy work-life balance. Sometimes, when I am having an Academia-specific problem, it can be frustrating, because he can't always understand what I'm going through. But he's always there to listen. And knowing that he is rooting for me keeps me motivated on the days I want to quit. He makes me want to do my best so that I can finish, get a real job, and build our life together. My biggest advice is to treat school like a job. Make a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Take at least one day off on the weekends so that you two can have some quality time. And remember that you are more than your work.",

It keeps me incredibly grounded to have someone who works 9-5. It allows me to also strive for a similar schedule and to make sure I build in free time to be able to hang out with him or do other activities I enjoy. If I wasn't married, knowing my personality, I would probably let grad school take over my life. Having other important things in my life reminds me to make sure I balance the professional and personal.",

      "text": "Honestly, it can be a good and a bad thing. There\u2019s balance to it. I\u2019m married to a businessman who is very successful in the steel industry, and although he has an MBA, he doesn\u2019t know much nor does he care about academia. He doesn\u2019t understand why someone would put so much time and effort and money into pursuing a PhD. He doesn\u2019t see the ROI, and would rather be out in the business world making money. Whereas I could care less about my potential wage and I see the pursuit of a PhD much differently.  On the other hand, it allows us to have something \u201cseparate\u201d to ourselves. We share basically every aspect of life together and similar, so this allows us to have our different \u201cthing\u201d.  As long as they\u2019re respectful of your pursuit, and you\u2019re respectful of their pursuits...it works fine.  You\u2019ll find friends and coworkers who share the academic interests and it\u2019ll give you guys something fun to talk about.",

      "text": "My spouse is the academic, I'm the spouse who never went to grad school. I've always been independent and I like a certain amount of space and alone time, so my spouse's busy schedule has never bothered me. His workaholism inspires me to be less lazy and push myself more, while I help him relax and try to find some pro-life balance. We really balance each other out in many ways.\n\nWhat are your plans post-PhD? Something that hasn't been mentioned yet in this thread in that if you choose to stay in academia, you will not have much choice in where you live. There are so few jobs in academia that you will have to move to where the job is, and the job could be located far away from your friends and family and/or in an area where you and/or your partner don't want to live. Also, most academic jobs are temporary (postdoc, visiting assistant professor, etc.), so you could end up moving several times in several years, especially early in your career. There's a very good chance that you will never get a tenure track job. Your partner may be willing to move now, which is great, but later on he might want to settle down in one location, or perhaps moving will be detrimental to his career. The good news is, since your partner is not an academic himself, he likely has more flexibility on where he can live and work than the average academic would.\n\nIt's very important to communicate with each other  early and often about both you and your partner's goals, priorities, and expectations, to make sure you're both moving together in the same direction and prevent \"two body\" problems. If one of you has to compromise much more than the other, resentment will inevitably build which will be detrimental to your relationship.",

      "text": "In my experience it\u2019s very difficult, but manageable. A PhD requires you to be very selfish with your time - plans get delayed and canceled. Meetings/project commitments/travel opportunities come up and you aren\u2019t really in a position to say \u201cno\u201d to most of them. There is time off, and you need to prioritize that time with your partner rather than individual activities. But still, you\u2019d need a very understanding partner to make all this work. \n\nExcelling in a PhD program requires you to make it the most important thing in your life, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that can be done working 9-5. Weekends/late nights/off hours happen, and that\u2019s just part of the game. If there was a period in your life where you should really buckle down and grind, this is it. \n\nWith all of this said, I\u2019ve made it work and many others have. Communicate when you\u2019re overwhelmed and short on time and make the best of the time you do have.",
