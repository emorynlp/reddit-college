There's a double edged bias going on here.\n\n- Someone who makes it to or through graduate school is likely (but not guaranteed to be) quite different from the average undergrad.  Their own internal experience will probably be biased toward overlooking or missing handholding.\n\n- The pendulum swings the other way as soon as one hits a teaching role; the bottom 10% of students and the most demanding 10% of students occupy 80% of our attention.  Self-starters, by definition, seek us out less and so are observed less.",

      "text": "My unscientific observation from a too-small sample:\n\n* A lot of them, though not all, wait for me to tell them what to do. Not the overall assignment: each detail. I can post things in our LMS, and they don't read them because I didn't specifically tell them to read them. I can label those things \"Sample paper for you to follow\" or \"List of common errors you should avoid,\" and they won't read them unless I say \"Your homework is to read 'Sample paper for you to follow.'\" I think a lot were brought up on a steady diet of **Do Not Do Anything You Are Not Directly Authorized To Do!**\n\n* They're a lot more afraid of anything negative. They're afraid to ask a question, because someone in the room might think it's a dumb question. They're petrified to take a test, because they might not get every answer right. I'm even seeing more students just not turn in papers, take zeros on them, because they're afraid I'll mark mistakes on the paper. Of course, they're also sick with fear that they'll get a zero on the paper, so they're a bit stuck.\n\n* This is me being a grumpy old man, but they do tend to tell me \"I'm not comfortable with ...\" a lot more often than previous cohorts did. I have to bite my tongue not to say \"Who on Earth ever told you you got to go through life staying comfortable?\" every thirty seconds.\n\n* They have a much harder time with simple computer doohickeys like Powerpoint. Powerpoint baffles them. I thought they learned how to do a basic Powerpoint in K-12, and I know for a fact that they *used* to. Now they want things to be as streamlined and simple as a smartphone app, so they get overloaded by the options on Powerpoint and tell me they have no idea what to do.\n\nOf course, I'm talking about the ones that catch my attention, stick in my memory, and take up my time needing some fairly intense help, so it's not really the case that they're representative. But I definitely am not talking about one or two outliers; everything I list above is pretty common.",

          "text": "From the perspective of a 20-something undergraduate, I would have to say I agree with many of your points. However, from my own anecdotal experience, I think I might be able to explain some of them a different way.\n\n\\- I would agree that your first point is true; I think many of us weren't given much independence in prior schooling, and most of our assignments were laid out in an unnecessarily rigid format. Anything not directly indicated as \"for the assignment\" wasn't, and you might even lose points for bringing up something \"irrelevant\" or \"unnecessary\". Rubrics are a comfort because you can be sure you are doing what is desired and you have something to refer back to if you think your assignment is graded unfairly. It's pretty clear that this is a fear of risk and failure, which I think results from the high pressure environment that college has become. See below.\n\n\\-  A lot of our schooling involved the remnants of the 90's \"self esteem\" education, where we all were going to become president. It would follow that a lot of students think their self-worth is reliant on how well one does academically, or even more simply, the grade one gets. Not doing the assignments sounds something like a shitty coping mechanism-rather than try, fail, and be a bad person, better to not try at all.\n\n\\-\"I'm not comfortable with...\" is too vague to interpret out of context. If they're saying they're not comfortable with the information and are requesting help with understanding, sure.  I say just give them the clarification they need. But if they're refusing to do assignments because of discomfort, well, I'm not sure what to say to that other than \"you get out what you put in\".\n\n\\-As for powerpoint though.... I don't think I've met anyone who doesn't know how to use it. That's really strange to me. Really weird. What are they having trouble with?\n\nI think many of the changes over time have resulted from changing motivation. Students nowadays are raised to go to college by default, and it is now the most basic requirement for a reasonably-paying job-no longer a more optional addition to one's education. As such, students coming in may be most interested in standing out (so they can get that job everyone's fighting for), and if they don't or can't, then what's the point? It's hard to stay motivated then, only the reminder of the crippling debt you're going to be in after you graduate keeps you fighting.",

For a long time, students found that one of the easiest parts of the class, but just in the past two or three years I've had students either mess it up terribly, or just approach me after the assignment is given and tell me they have no idea how to use Powerpoint. The change came so quickly that it really caught me off guard. This year, I had twenty students in that class, and seven or eight of them struggled with putting together a basic Powerpoint.\n\nI say all of that to say that Powerpoint isn't too hard to learn, and by the time I or a classmate helps them through that assignment, they know enough for most subsequent classwork. I suspect other instructors downstream aren't seeing this, and I am, just because I catch them when they're newly arrived on campus.",

Our LMS allows us to restrict file types for uploads, so I just set it to powerpoint only. Then I tell them if they don't submit through the LMS they get no credit. They'll figure it out eventually, and I make the first few assignments low stakes so they can screw up and still be OK.

High school system where I live is insanely strict. You get told everything to the letter, including how to do margins and headers on your loose lined sheets of paper. This was prevalent both within the materials (dictated by the government's ministry obviously) and in the behavior/discipline taught by professors. \n\nThen in my first year of university I realized things were much more loose and freeing than I was used to. Just the simple fact that there's no internal messaging system, everything's done by email, the administration is archaic and professors are much less supervising, I felt I decide for myself how to do things and that reinforced academic autonomy. But I had to be aware of that. Others aren't because school, from 1st grade to the end, is strict and barely leaves place for pushing intellectual barriers further.\n\nAnd yeah, everyone's afraid of the negative because all our lives we're told to aim for the job and whatever it takes to pass so you can get work. We don't want to make mistakes for the sake of learning. STEM jobs were pushed down my throat at 13 years old and failing to have these \"options\" was such a humiliation coming from all sides (parents, school, friends...). I'm so happy today I get to have so much freedom to take risks in my papers. I can use Greek original text in a paper and feel okay if I make grammar mistakes with it. I can cite papers in a style that doesn't feel robotic and squared like I had to in high school. \n\nI personally feel some things you can find in university have been sacrificed at earlier stages of education for the sake of other goals (practicality? forming *workers*?) but I can't put my finger on what it is and why.",

In my experience-- 25+ years at selective liberal arts colleges --this has gotten dramatically worse and more widespread in the last decade, to the point that we had to created a required \"college transitions\" course (which used to be limited to community colleges) and there are still students who barely make it through the first semester due to fear.",

Everyone is always watching and cataloguing your mistakes to use against you later. Even beyond the whole \"living in the Panopticon\" thing, constructive criticism and nuance are de-emphasized. Freshman having to learn to accept nuance or grey areas is nothing new of course, but it's like there's less of an expectation that there should be such nuance or uncertainty. Students must always project perfection, and any deviation from perfection undermines students' self-worth and the next step should always be 100% clear with only one right answer. It was definitely worse in 2018 than in 2013, and the number of times students would just give up in frustration and demand to be told the next step after one or two attempts is really disheartening.

There is far too much emphasis on memorization and objective testing in many high schools (I assume because it's easy to \"teach\" and easy to score mechanically) and far too little emphasis on critical thinking, writing, and problem solving.  Since we encounter kids from a wide range of schools it's clear that the problem is not universal-- I've had kids from IB schools in particular that are as good as any I've seen in my 25+ years of teaching --but the median has fallen far below what it once was.",

Think about that for a second, and about the bureaucratic mindset.

Second, I think high school is not preparing us for real life the same way it was for other generations (or at least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard). There\u2019s so much pressure on studying and getting good SAT/ACT scores that we don\u2019t get exposure to....literally anything else.

That's good. And we (institutional \"we\") should be meeting everyone where they are and bringing them along the path together. But it appears that many of the \"traditional\" students (i.e. white, suburban, middle/upper-middle class kids of college graduates) are demonstrating the same behaviors and lack of preparation. So while I'd agree that some of the struggle is a result of broader access and a more diverse population of students, the challenges are more widespread than that can account for.",

My grandfather, a chemical engineering prof, once said in the years prior to his retirement that he felt the classes got dumber and dumber each year.  The truth in the matter though is that this didn't really change much, or at least not likely - engineering in Canada is accredited so we monitor changes in student outcomes fairly regularly, and it's not like the theory got easier in that time.  What did change is that my grandfather had taught many of those courses 20-30 times by that point, and the concepts became simple in his mind, whereas an undergrad who's just started learning a topic would be understandably unsure of things and would treat things as though they were foreign.  I think that is important to remember here, and something I keep in mind when I TA that although they might ask redundant questions, or use poor theory, it's important to their learning process and they will come into their own soon enough.",

I've taught over two dozen different courses over the last 20 years, in multiple departments/programs, and have had a fair amount of pedagogical training along the way. I'm pretty confident that this dynamic is relatively uncommon, at least in teaching-oriented institutions. I know I've become a better teacher over the years-- I know a lot more now about learning theory, pedagogy, blended learning, etc.  than a did even a decade ago --but the students are clearly less well prepared and less resilient than they were even just a few years back.",

I would answer yes.\n\nTo support this claim, I would like to point to sources that highlight that many students entering college are not prepared for higher ed.\n\n\"The vast majority of public two- and four-year colleges report enrolling students \u2013 more than half a million of them\u2013who are not ready for college-level work, a Hechinger Report investigation of 44 states has found.\n\nThe numbers reveal a glaring gap in the nation\u2019s education system: A high school diploma, no matter how recently earned, doesn\u2019t guarantee that students are prepared for college courses. Higher education institutions across the country are forced to spend time, money and energy to solve this disconnect. They must determine who\u2019s not ready for college and attempt to get those students up to speed as quickly as possible, or risk losing them altogether.\n\nMost schools place students in what are called remedial courses in math or English before they can move on to a full load of college-level, credit-bearing courses \u2013 a process that is a financial drain on not only students, but also colleges and taxpayers, costing up to an estimated $7 billion a year.\"\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/colleges-enroll-students-arent-prepared-higher-education\n\n\n\"According to the College Board website, the study found that many students entering college for the first time were not prepared for college-level courses, no matter how well they did in high school. More than half of the students polled said that college courses were more difficult than they expected, and nearly one-quarter stated that they were required by their colleges to take non-credit remedial courses at the beginning of their college experience.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/are-high-school-graduates-ready-for-college-studies-are-dismal\n\n\n\"Only 37 percent of students are prepared for college-level math and reading\"\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/high-school-seniors-arent-college-ready-naep-data-show",

It's increasing slowly now but will hit the \"demographic cliff\" in 2025. Since the recession people have quit having kids at the rates they did before. Moreover, the birth rate decline has not been evenly distributed, but in fact is concentrated in certain geographies and demographic groups. New England and the Midwest are in sharp decline, while the west coast and SE are growing slightly.  Social class and race are also significant factors, so the college students of the future will look like or be like those of a decade or two ago. They will also be fewer in number.",

They're *really good* at number crunching, but at the same time they seem to lack an intuitive understanding of what the math they're doing actually *means*. Like, they can resolve derivatives and integrals much faster than I could, but they seem to look at me as if I'm some kind of sorcerer when I ask them to compute acceleration when I give them an equation for position (literally just take the derivative twice). That lack of intuition with respect to physics just baffles me.\n\n2) Their computer skills are **extremely** lacking, although I think I know why this is. My generation (millennials) were used to having to troubleshoot on our computers, because we lived in the era where programs wouldn't be guaranteed to be compatible across platforms. We actually had to have a degree of understanding of computers in order to actually *use* a computer, and we also had to have some ability to fix machines electronics back then barely functioned at times. Fast-forward to today, where everything magically works, and when it doesn't you send it in to the manufacturer, and then they either fix it, or they send you a new device. The increased ergonomics and ease-of-use of electronic devices has resulted in a generation that treats electronic devices as unknowable magic.\n\n3) One that's simultaneously humorous and horrifying; digital clocks in schools have led to an inability of many Gen-Z kids to read an analogue clock. This doesn't seem like a bit deal until you get into physics and engineering...where rotation is defined as clockwise and counterclockwise. So I'm supposed to be teaching them that finite element method is a thing that exists, and I'm having to stop to teach some of them how to read a clock face.",

The problem isn't that the work is *hard*, the problem is that it's *open-ended*. If a student asks me for help with a set of equations, I can do that easily. If they ask me for help in developing intuition, that's much harder and maybe it can't be directly taught at all. I can't tell them \"do XYZ and you'll intuitively understand physics\", which means they'll have to take wild stabs sometimes and get things wrong in order to learn. \n\nHigh school now is also much more cutthroat and it doesn't foster learning, only memorisation, so they're absolutely *terrified* of the idea of not having a detailed rubric to follow. University admissions are based heavily on grades and class rankings. Good grades are only distributed to the top X students in a class, who are frequently earning >95%. If your assignment or test is 20 points then you cannot afford to even lose *one* mark. Memorisation can get them 20/20. Taking risks and developing their intuition might get them 15/20.",

I have superstar students who are truly fabulous. But the vast majority of my energy is spent on the small percentage of students who are not succeeding. How can I scaffold them better? How can I prepare them for this field? How I can find a way to help them adequately learn this material? Announcements I make in class, announcements I send out on Canvas, are typically revolving around those types of questions, even if they represent a relatively small fraction of my actual students. \n\nThese students were largely not present at my undergraduate institution, and if they were, the actual number was small enough that I think there was more ability to stop someone after class (versus making an announcement). That is just not possible with the sizes of my classes (although I do try to reach out via email with mixed success). \n\nLooking at my graphs of student grades, it's really only about 5% of students who are *really* struggling (at least based on their grades). I would guess that without my scaffolding, that would be higher, but if giving you the tools to succeed is enough to help you succeed, I am happy to do that. \n\nBalancing out the best way to do that/not creating disruptions for students who are on target, though, is definitely a challenge.",

There were probably epic failures going on in your undergrad peer group that you weren't aware of. As an instructor, you see everyone's performance directly, good, bad, and ugly, which can be eye-opening.\n\nAlso, it's easy to subconsciously ramp up your expectations for beginners as you yourself get more experienced. My memory of what I was equipped to handle as a first year undergrad is probably much more charitable than reality, and I'm guessing I was hand-held more than I remember.\n\nIt's possible there's a longer term downward trend, but objectively comparing the memories and impressions of your own undergrad peer group to what you perceive in younger students now is tricky at best.",

I'm the same age as you are and I am AMAZED at how much these students need every assignment to relate to their personal lives. They are given lists of questions they are allowed to choose from for the class discussions, and 90% of them pick an opinion-based question rather than an academic question that would allow them to discuss the reading assigned.\n\nMany of them will write entire essays and post them to the discussion board where they CLEARLY have not read the first page of the assigned text. It's pretty ballsy to decide you're going to go all in and try to bullshit a PhD prof about something you didn't bother to crack the spine on.\n\nMy poor professors have had to post notices in response to student outcries that the reading is too difficult (in subject matter or complexity) and remind them that they will not round grades up at the end of the semester. I posted an opinion that was contrary to the googled answers of my classmates, and one of my classmates attacked me and told me that I should have just agreed with everyone else and given them compliments instead of posting a differing view.\n\nThis university is actually much higher caliber than my original undergrad. My undergrad was NOTHING like this. You are not dreaming - it's getting weird out here.\n\nETA: I also have a master's in an unrelated field. I see a lot of people here saying you may mis-remember undergrad, but I didn't get hit over the head with a crowbar since graduating so I definitely would remember something like this.",

This has helped me to keep up high GPA. I personally know a lot of students who have lower GPAs just because of not asking questions, not listening to lecturer's 20min explanations of an assignment, even though some of them know more than me..\n\nI am pretty sure knowledge of ''how to solve assignments' has a huge impact on GPA. Sadly very often GPA means a lot when you are looking for a job and the way this college/university system around the world work is that GPA depend a lot of being able to 100% understanding the assignment. You can't solve an assignment correctly if you dont understand it 100%.\n\nP.S.
