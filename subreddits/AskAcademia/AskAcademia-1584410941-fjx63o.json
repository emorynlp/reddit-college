There are \\~4,500 colleges and universities in the US and we are  fast approaching a demographic cliff (c 2025) that will reduce the overall population of degree seekers while those who remain will be different from the peak population (more first gen, more LatinX, lower SES, more concentrated in the SE/SW and West).

Why would fewer non-first gen students be applying to college?\n\nHuge drop in birth rate after 2009, esp among traditional college-going demos. It's not that fewer \"legacy\" kids are not going, but simply that non-college-educated parents are having a larger share of the kids overall. Google \"demographic cliff higher education\" and you'll see that admission folks and admins have been in a frenzy about this for 5+ years at least-- it's real, it's serious, and there's nothing we can do about it without a time machine.

There are no defensible reasons for the #50 or #100 Ph.D. program in any humanities field to exist...they are there to provide a pipeline of cheap labor and to serve the \"needs' of faculty who enjoy teaching grad students. (Which I very much enjoyed when I did it as an adjunct, it's much easier and in some ways more rewarding than teaching 100-level undergraduate courses.) Cut the oversupply and you'd address half the problem.",

Or were actively complicit in exchange for pension bumps and increased wages for Full Professors.\n\nAnd ultimately they're highly paid professionals who don't want to either pay taxes nor share the wealth. In my department the luckily newly hired tenure-stream employees make around $80K. There are people in my department, many, who haven't published in two decades who make near triple that.

      "text": "It killed most academic hiring for two cycles; many searches were called off mid-process in 2009 and entire cohorts of graduate students saw their careers derailed. Massive budget cuts at public institutions-- particularly in red states --gutted some systems permanently. Happily, my SLAC president decided to do the opposite and we landed some very good colleagues in that period, most of whom stayed. Enrollments shot up and we hit our all-time record in 2010 as people were looking to education as a way to get a job, or student loans as a way to ride out the recession. A goodly number of my older colleagues lost large chunks of their retirement savings though, and as a result ended up working to 70+ which meant fewer hires c. 2015 than we would have seen otherwise. We had a bit of belt-tightening but made budgets and got 2-3% raises every year from 2008-2011.\n\nThis thing with COVID is going to be far different. Schools are starting to refund room and board, which will hammer already tight budgets. The admission season has been cut short and many high school students are likely to be afraid to go far from home in the fall, so schools that recruit nationally (like mine) will be in trouble. Revenue from all our auxiliary operations is quickly falling to zero...NCAA playoffs would have brought in $$ and now we likely won't even have graduation. Staff are being sent home (faculty and students are gone) and I fear won't be paid at all after the month is out, so we'll lose many of them for good. Fall enrollments will be lower, budgets will be cut, positions will be eliminated, and we'll all wait in fear to see if there's a resurgence of the virus and we get closed down again in November. Study abroad is collapsing as well, we've canceled all summer programs and some fall already...even before students start withdrawing on their own.\n\nIt's going to be rough, and I expect will drive some more marginal institutions over the fiscal cliff into closure or merger years before they would have been otherwise.",

      "text": "I started my PhD in 2004 and so by 2008 was pretty deep into the dissertation-writing process. The change overnight was just stunning. I went to a grad seminar I was taking the day after the biggest part of the crash and the professor just looked like he had been hit with a hammer. \"You should all just find a cave to hide in for the next 5 years,\" he told us. \n\nTenure-track jobs got pulled off the market. Some got turned into part-time gigs. Many did not. \n\nUniversities started offering up \"early retirement\" to (expensive) older faculty. Many took it. So many took it in the field of history that it changed the average age of the employed profession, disrupting the normal retirement cycle.\n\nWhat happened to my cohort? About half of us eventually got tenure track jobs, though we had about 4-6 years of postdocs each, so everything career-wise is a bit delayed (I'm going up for tenure next year, a decade after getting my PhD). The half that didn't generally went on to do interesting and fulfilling work outside of academia. Only one of our eight is I think somewhat under-employed (they also never finished the degree for whatever that is worth). So it wasn't terrible, but this was _the_ elite school, which is also the top school of our discipline as well. So this was the best-case scenario. Some of those people who got jobs got them by the skin of their teeth. \n\nOne friend of mine in my cohort was offered a TT job, was told he could tell others he had accepted it, but before the paperwork was signed the dean eliminated the program it was in (the faculty already in it got assigned to other departments), and with it went the job line. This is what we call an academic horror story, but it really happened. (And is why I was desperate to get my paperwork inked ASAP, and why I tell people today that it isn't really a job until you and they have signed the contract.)\n\nMost optimistically: the intellectual effect on me, personally, was a serious realization that I needed to do something very different from everyone else in my field if I was going to stand out of the mass of people applying for jobs. (This is still the case today: every job we advertise gets ~200 applicants \u2014 and we are not the most prestigious institution \u2014 and there are usually less than 10 TT jobs in my field each year. Even people with \"great\" CVs need something extra or something very lucky to stand out. Being from a great school, having a few publications, having a great advisor \u2014 none of these are enough by themselves, they just get you under consideration.) I ended up going in some very experimental/risky directions that paid off, and ultimately (with a lot of luck) got me the job I have today. All of the advice from my advisors was basically to be relatively conservative prior to the crash, and that clearly wasn't going to cut it, and I'm glad, in retrospect, that I was forced to try new things. But it was all very stressful at the time. And the opportunity costs have been huge \u2014 it's only been in the last couple of years that we've been financially fairly stable.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that STEM schools do better during recessions because people get economically scared students/parents think that STEM degrees are better bets than liberal arts degrees. I am currently at a STEM institution (though I don't teach STEM) so I am not _too_ acutely worried about our institution in the long run, though we have been on a big spending spree the last few years to try and make the overall place more recession-proof, but we haven't quite finished it yet (we are pretty highly leveraged without all of the payoff, yet). One never knows \u2014 it all depends on what the students do, in the long run. Fingers crossed for all of us.",

Things slowed down, but like a lot of state schools we always have to deal with scarcity. We didn\u2019t hire the first two years because we were philosophically stalemated about who to hire in terms of speciality (lots of 10-10 votes - my discipline is fractured). But we hired one TT a year after that - since they were in new fields and people of color I don\u2019t know if we really could have absorbed more than that because of the stress on department culture. I would have loved to have found out. Look carefully at the type of institution you wish to teach at, then make your decision about your employment strategy. Academia has always been resistant to generalizations, but the bottom line in my experience the last 20 years is we are always slugging it out with similar institutions in our region for the same 4 or 5 folks out of application stack of 3-400.  Nobody wants to talk about that in this business, but that\u2019s the way it is.",
