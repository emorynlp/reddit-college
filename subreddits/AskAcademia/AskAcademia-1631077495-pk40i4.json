  "title:": "Any academics work with MSWs on their research projects?",
  "text": "I asked this question over in the education thread of the social work subreddit, but it wasn't getting much traction, so I thought I'd try my luck over here! **I understand this question is geared toward MSWs, but I'd be grateful to hear from any academics who work with MSWs!** \n\nI'm currently in the first year of my MSW program and I am loving it. I am also working as a research assistant and will hopefully be first author on my own paper by the time I graduate. My question is - are there any MSWs out there who are conducting academic research (something other than an internal evaluation program) in addition to their field work? If so, how did you get into that and who funds it? *I know some federal grants are not accessible unless you have a PhD.*\n\n  \nMy ideal work environment would be to do some research and some field work based work. I am not opposed to getting a PhD, but it seems like most social workers with PhDs no longer work in the field. I recognize I could always work in the field for a while and eventually go back and get my PhD, but I wanted to see if there is anyone who is working in research at the MSW level. From what I've gathered, this is not super common so I'd love to hear from people who have found a way to make this work. Thank you so much!",
