  "title:": "Graduating incompetent PhDs",
  "text": "This question is inspired by the story of a professor acquaintance, who is currently line-editing an advisee's dissertation because they are unable to write coherently and don't understand the sources they're citing. They're hoping to sign off on the dissertation at the end of this academic year, meaning the student will graduate with a PhD despite (from what I understand) not having the basic skills that a PhD holder is supposed to have. I've heard a similar story before from people in real life and online. So I'm sitting here a lil rattled and wondering: is graduating incompetent PhDs, like, a thing?",

She couldn't write anything on her own and barely even understood her own project. \n\nWhat gets me is though is that the quals should be weeding people like this out. She did not do well on her quals at all from what I've heard - couldn't answer basic questions like what the antibodies she was using stained for, or the cell types - as well as other basic reasoning questions. I don't know why they ended up passing her, especially as many of them knew she was an incompetent and low performing student based on other presentations and interactions (i.e. this wasn't just \"exam jitters\"). It seems better to fail them at the quals stage after 2-3 years than to let them linger on for 6 years before graduating them because they \"put the time into it\". \n\nShe was having a lot of trouble getting a job after her PhD though. So it's not like she was floating by on the merit of her degree. ",

This begins by giving Unsatisfactory or Fail on their research (assuming they have to enroll in some sort of Graduate Research type course, graded on a S/U or P/F basis). It begins by giving them C or B- in graduate seminar classes. Also, if they have any early research projects that have to be completed as part of the degree, like a first year or second year project, fail it. Also, if the program has comps or quals before a student can become a doctoral candidate, fail them.  \nBut the problem is no one has the guts to fail grad students, we let it slide. Faculty probably don't communicate with each other, so a professor for a grad seminar gives a B when s/he should give a C, assuming the student is doing fine with research, but if s/he talked to the student's advisor, would realize this isn't the case.  \nSo yea, then it looks bad if all the faculty have been signing off on this student as making satisfactory progress toward the degree, and then 6-7 years in, you realize they never were.",

In much of lab chemistry and biology in the US and some European and Asian countries most professors tend to have as many PhD students as they can fund and fit into lab space, which for very prominent professors can be up to more than 20. It sort of works because they have lab managers, staff scientists, technicians and/or postdocs helping out with everything including supervising students, so such a professor usually gives very little personal supervision to each student - during most of the PhD such PhD students may have a useful conversation with the professor every 2-3 months if they are lucky (and master's and undergrad students may have it just at the beginning and end of their stay).\n\nOn the other hand, my advisor has just students and postdocs, and the extent to which I can be taught by postdocs is very limited by language issues, and most of us don't have so much or so good previous research experience, and my advisor wants to advise everyone more directly and communicate with each of his group members when needed and at least every 2-3 weeks, so indeed us 2-3 PhD students (and about 4 postdocs) are sometimes already a handful.",

I do think edging toward the discuss of how universities use international students as a funding source (which I think is exploitive and shitty) causes a certain amount of freak put because reasons.\n\nFor all students, we could talk about the way certain segments of society just shit all over academia and have championed turning universities into training schools with less emphasis on critical thinking and more on \u201cjob skills.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s also the wholesale destruction of the US public school system, this insistence that so many career paths require a BS/BA for entry but not for the actual work. We could mention that we also offer grad degrees in fields that just don\u2019t make sense (lookin\u2019 at you, Ph.D in \u201cLeadership\u201d). We could also investigate the raging anti-intellectualism that permeates the US. We could look at how critical thinking skills are actively discouraged through standardized testing. And so on.\n\nBut it\u2019s not wrong to look at how universities are monetizing education, and part of that is looking at international student bodies. (And we were talking about Ph.Ds, so yeah, grad students but, sadly, no all grad students in the US are funded. Gone are those days, according to my friends in academia and those who are pursuing Ph.Ds (and really shouldn\u2019t be because they are incompetent). Those guys are native grown sons of the Midwest as well.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying, inelegantly, is that the universities are monetizing every aspect of every student. And that extends to international students (all those rep offices in the MENA region and beyond exist for a reason). \n\nSo, is there one reason, uh, no - but that should be obvious. Should those passionate about the issue investigate all possible reasons? Hell yeah. But I\u2019ve exhausted my limited passion and thumb-typing capacity. Again, excuse me for any typos (massive thumbs on mobile FTW) and good luck with your student. (And check put Michigan\u2019s feeder office in Knowledge Village, Dubai, UAE to see how the marketing is working over here).\n\nEDIT: Good luck to your friend re the student. Re-read OP comment.",

After failing to match one round of residency, he became \"tainted goods\" and failed to match in future years. He became depressed having wasted all his time and seeing no way out, so he made a permanent solution to his problems.\n\nNow in this case there was not a case of incompetence - by all accounts the man was above average, but had used a bad strategy the first time around. When he tried to apply to a larger number of less competitive fields the second time around, they held his previous interest in his original field against him.\n\nThat opens up a bigger discussion - is everyone who goes to Med School \"owed a spot\" practicing medicine? If he was not competent (and in his case he was, but let's just say?), shouldn't they have failed him rather than let him continue? If MDs are owed jobs, why not PhDs? \n\nI don't see the trend reversing, unless we start to fail people earlier. That's actually an adage in business - \"fail faster\". You don't want to spend a decade in a failed business model - and you shouldn't have to spend a decade in a failed academic stream. \n\nBut I'm getting pretty off-topic.",

Let me explain.\n\nNowadays, when you want to switch jobs, you find yourself unable to use much of your education to translate \"horizontally\" to another field.\n\nFor instance, while back in the day it was ok to have a BA/BSc in basically anything to become a teacher, I've looked into requirements recently, and oooh boy are they complicated. Basically, unless you happen to have majored into a few of the \"teachable majors\" that they have, you're SOL to enter teacher's college. And they won't count your grad school credentials, either!\n\nSo you can be in a situation where you are literally a PhD in Physics, expert in the field, but if you took engineering as your undergrad, they won't let you go to teachers' college to teach physics to kids.\n\nThis applies to tech positions in my field, which I won't get into - but basically you're asked to take a 4-year degree in underwater basket weaving, and if you don't make it as a basket-weaver, you have absolutely no portability of your degree, even if you've learned largely the same material.  \n\nThis is another problem, because you can get all the way to the top of a degree before failing, and then have no way out, nothing to show for it, but still be carrying that debt.\n\nI'm very concerned for the future of our education system.",

It is a requirement that a PhD thesis does include results; it is not a requirement that a PhD thesis excludes old and well-known results. Defining matrix multiplication was always admissible in a Princeton math thesis. \n\nIt was always also the sort of thing that is usually omitted, but can be kept if it suits your rhetorical aims. This isn't just about PhD theses. Off the top of my head, I've certainly heard or read things by Cheeger, Diaconis, Gromov and Katznelson that started at similarly elementary places (in at least 2 of these 4 cases, somewhere even more elementary). They are making a rhetorical point by doing this sort of thing, not asserting that they think there are a bunch of professional mathematicians who have never heard of e.g. matrices. It is pretty clear that Piper is also making a rhetorical point by doing this sort of thing - indeed she says so many times in various ways. It was also clearly quite a success in some ways, as her thesis has been read by vastly more people than it would have been had she chosen a more typical style.\n\nMoving backwards in the post: it is obviously \"fighting words\" to say you think somebody plagiarized a thesis (or indeed any paper). You can do it, but you shouldn't do it casually unless you actually have some information about this having happened. FWIW, I would be quite surprised if it were plagiarized. As others have said, this sort of thing does happen semi-frequently even at very good departments... but it is usually essentially an open secret. I'm around Harron's age and have chatted casually about her work with people who intersected with her at grad school, and have not heard these rumors. Of course this is not proof, and I haven't gone digging.\n\nSorry for the long post, but this sort of Harron-bashing gets under my skin a little. Her story doesn't need any sort of nefarious explanations: she figured out some problems that came out of discussions with her adviser, and never really \"broke through\" to doing really exciting independent stuff... just like a very large percentage of math PhDs, even at good schools.",

They have really strict standards here (at least in my department) when it comes to papers, and advisors usually do a good job of making sure that students turn out novel work. Just this past week some senior graduate students and I were grilled on our project by our advisor because it seemed too similar to earlier work from 2016 in our subfield. We eventually convinced her of some novel applications to new devices that the earlier paper never took into account. She remains skeptical, though...\n\nAlso Princeton has really strict rules when it comes to graduation time. Students are considered \"part of the university\" for 5 years as a PhD student and then are allowed to stay for 2 more if they need the time and the departments/their advisor approves. It's not uncommon to see people take 6-7 years, especially in STEM. However, after 7 years, all students MUST graduate or have made significant progress on their dissertation. All funding is forfeited after the 7th year. I'm not sure how the person you're describing took 12 years to do her PhD unless she took an extended leave of absence or was able to somehow prove that she was indeed making progress for each of the additional five years beyond the seventh. Or perhaps this rule was instituted recently because of her... ",

Few objected, because other half of the package controlled the purse strings for our school.  Additionally, despite being attributed a sterling reputation, superior start-up funds, and a minimal teaching load (1/4 of the typical professor), this person failed to conduct any research or even set up the lab; equipment left behind after this person blessedly jumped ship was still boxed up and covered in dust.  One might think this person was a great teacher, but her students mostly despised her class and an advisee of mine told me by the last quarter of the semester only a half dozen students were still attending while the rest studied on their own.  On top of this, attendance at faculty meetings and functions dropped to zero; don't even try to get to know your colleagues, since we're obviously beneath you.

      "text": "Maybe the student is just incompetent at writing? (Not fluent in the language of writing? Dyslexia or/and dysgraphia? A history of poor or overly-focused education?) At least if they are in a STEM field, if the student is good at something else (research, technical skills, oral communication...) there still could be non-academic PhD-needing jobs for them. An international student may still even get an academic job in their native country if they can write better in their native language.\n\nIn my school getting students who can write well in English (the language in which we all need to write our thesis, reports, exams, assignments, and publications) - or even learn to do so by the end of PhD - is actually quite rare. I suspect it is so in many fields also in most other schools in countries where English isn't an official language, and in some fields also in some schools in the US (because with higher criteria for English they wouldn't be able to enroll enough PhD students).\n\nMy advisor used to reject/drop students bad at written English, but that's probably the main reason why he wasn't able to keep a PhD student in his first 6 years of professorship, i.e. until me (I am obviously not too incompetent at written English, but I am/was incompetent at almost everything else, which is probably worse). Now he is trying to make us learn - take writing and communication courses, tutor and check each others, and rewrite until he is satisfied - but that's also hard and time-consuming work both for him and for us.",

My PhD adviser spoke English as a second language and could write well according to the latter definition, but always needed a heavy touch of editing to polish her grammar and sentence construction. It was still clear what she was writing about and she could still describe and articulate complex ideas that anyone could understand. Students who can't manage to explain or argue for something cohesively, or do so verbally, are a different class of problem. ",

Bad chemists getting through was definitely far from common there and it's one of the biggest programs in the US...

And you think you can get to polish their rough edges by the time they graduate, but perhaps you don't have enough time to commit to that single student and nobody to delegate it to, and perhaps the times at the lab are so pushed that you fatally let this promise to yourself slip, hoping that by being in the lab, the student will catch on on their own... And time passes, and experiments go adequately well, until the moment you ask them to write their thesis - then the issue gets very real, but there isn't much time to \"polish\" any edges anymore. And they worked hard, and had results, so it'd be weird not to have them graduate (weird on your side at the Department, too). They couldn't have done it without you being their brain, but you wouldn't have published without them being the hand, either. And so it goes.",
