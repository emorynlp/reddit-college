  "title:": "Anyone working or worked as a scientific editor after PhD/Postdoc? What's your experience on the job? Is it worth pursuing?",
  "text": "After PhD and/or postdoc, one usually have three directions to go to. One leads to a tenured academic position, industry related to the field or third where one changes the field completely. However, recently, I came across other jobs that require PhDs, and specific fields but is not a typical industrial position. \n\nScientific editor seems to be one such position. I have seen openings for this position on the Springer, Elsevier, Wiley career sites. How is it as a career path? Is it a rewarding career? By rewarding, I am referring to both intellectually and financially.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.",

      "text": "Not an editor but have friends who are and work with some. \n\nLike any career it depends what you want, but from observation it's a job that keeps you very close to the science. There's a lot of reviewing papers, working with authors to improve the papers, and working with peer reviewers. You get to see some of the newest most exciting research, and depending on the area you also get to get involved in a lot of the ethical debates and issues. There's also commissioning work, which means identifying hot topics etc. It's a job that requires good knowledge but you also need to be able to step up from the weeds of a paper and see the bigger picture.\n\nIn terms of career trajectory. The publishing industry is a multibillion dollar industry. There are many career opportunities and different directions you can travel in.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your detailed comment. Do you think it is a good career path for a postdoc student who is no longer interested in staying in academia?\n\n Initially, I wanted to be involved in research as a research scientist in industry, but jobs are hard to come across in my field (mechanical engineering). I just want to stay connected to science and not leave the field completely.",
