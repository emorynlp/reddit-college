  "title:": "How long to keep answering old PI's student's emails?",
  "text": "I finished my PhD in 2018 and had one paper left over from it. It was a bit like pulling teeth but we finally got it accepted somewhere. The difficultly in submitting was that my PI kept wanting it submitted to very high impact journals and it kept getting rejected. It was accepted at a lower impact journal, the one I originally wanted to submit to. My annoyance now is that one of the current PhD student's in my old PIs lab keeps emailing me questions about data included in that paper. She has access to all the data because it is all saved in the lab's drive and she helped write part of the final paper. I've told her where things are in my old folders many times. Additionally I don't have access to some of it since I left 3 years ago.\n\nI'm currently in a residency program (It was a dual degree PhD) and busy with other things. I also just don't want to deal with my old lab much anymore. Plus it's been three years and all the information she needs is already there. I've directed her to things before and sometimes it feels like she asks the same question. She's not a new student either, she's been there for 3 years.\n\nI feel guilty for not answering her emails but I just can't deal with this stuff now. I published 5 papers with the lab, I feel like I did my fair share and can be left alone.\n\nI'm really torn and don't want to be a jerk, I also don't know if this is to be expected?\n\nEDIT: wanted to say at the top that I\u2019m very appreciative of all the advice! Sounds like I\u2019m not the only one who ran into this situation and it\u2019s reassuring to know that I\u2019m not being unreasonable :)",

      "text": "It seems like she means well, but is maybe being a little bit lazy? Wait 2-3 days (or more) before you reply and be brief and direct\u2014hopefully she gets the hint. You could also try coming at it from a place of concern: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that you still approach me with these questions three years after the project. My memory of the data is hazy at this point and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not the best resource for you. Are you not able to ask these things to your mentor?\u201d \u2026maybe that would alert her to this being a bit abnormal? Tbh I\u2019m concerned about why she only (seemingly) feels comfortable asking you these questions.\n\nEdit: I want to add that if her response to your polite rejection is disrespectful, do not reply. That is where any conversation ends as it is no longer productive for either of you.",
