  "title:": "Do I have to use my university email?",
  "text": "I am starting a new degree at a new institution, and already have an affiliation with a lab at a different institution, and I'm getting a bit annoyed by how many email addresses I have to check, esp. since the platforms don't all play nice with each other. So I am just wondering if I should even bother using my university email for correspondence with profs and collaborators if I am only going to be at this new institution for 3 years. I have a gmail I was already using for professional stuff before I went back to school, and it seems much easier to have all of my collaboration and networking conversations in one place if possible. Also both of my institutional emails are Outlook/Microsoft, which I hate, and neither one plays nicely with gmail.\n\nObviously I'll have to use my institutional email for certain things, but for the most part I'm wondering, like, do I have to? Do people really care if the address they're getting an email from is from a .edu? I feel like it would kinda suck to have all of my stuff in one email for my masters, then another then another for my Ph.D. program, then another for my postdoc/first professor job/(s?), and then another for my tenure track job, and then another if I switch institutions, and so on until I retire.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone who made great points about institutional policies and external/non edu address filters! I\u2019ll definitely be looking into this at both my institutions.",

I don't know who owns it or who has access to it, and FERPA is no joke.

It's really a rule that exists to protect students and professors.",

It's about the fact that organisations with proper security (and many US universities don't have adequate security) require you to use the enterprise solutions they provide. It's not we suffered, it's we use these tools because that's what's best for the organisation and good practice and you need to stop thinking about yourself alone and realise you're part of an organisation and that comes with some responsibilities. \n\nI've worked in academic orgs around the world and some would be fine with you using personal email, but those organisations tend to also be a shitshow of viruses, ransomware, phishing and so on and they also aren't protecting their student and employees personal data or their IP properly. Anywhere with any level of data governance will required you to use organisational email.",
