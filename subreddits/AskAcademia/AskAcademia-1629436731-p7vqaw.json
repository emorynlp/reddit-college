My acknowledgements for my PhD thesis are in no way professional, they're filled with in jokes about the academic people I've acknowledged, plus thanks to some friends and family.\n\nThat isn't to say you can't dedicate it to him, but your acknowledgements can be perfectly personal.",

NGL dedicating it to your supervisor sounds a bit cringe to me, but you do you. The only thing I'd caution about is if they are marking it, in which case absolutely do not do it.",

Honestly, it's so rare to just get a nice thank you, it generally means the world to people. Lots of people even have folders to save emails where people have been nice.",
