As soon as you hit send, the site will build a graph of related papers. It will also allow you to find prior works (These are papers that were most commonly cited by the papers in the graph. This usually means that they are **important seminal works** for this field and it could be a good idea to get familiar with them. Selecting a prior work will highlight all graph papers referencing it, and selecting a graph paper will highlight all referenced prior work).\n\nYou can also find a derivative work button with the  (papers that cited many of the papers in the graph. This usually means that they are **either surveys of the field or recent relevant works** which were inspired by many papers in the graph).\n\nTry it, I find the website highly relevant to all my academic activities.",

(2001). Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication) and then search for that on Google Scholar. Then you have the option of \"Cited by\" (most research that relies on multimodal discourse analysis will probably refer to the source you picked), you have the option of searching within cited articles, where you can enter additional search terms to find stuff you're particularly interested in (like, I don't know, gender, advertising, whatever gets you closer to what you're looking for).",

That's the drudge part - you sit at your desk, fire up your favourite browser, point it to your university's library site, and begin downloading all the articles from each journal under review, for all years (say, 25 years). You also download all the metadata associated with each article (ie author, author-university, title, abstract, keywords-by-author, keywords-by-EBSCO, etc). That metadata goes into an excel spreadsheet, one for each journal.\n\nAnd then you search.\n\nA paper that I presented last year at an academic conference was the product of the research that two colleagues and I performed on the top ten marketing journals, from the past 25 years. We catalogued all theories that were used in articles focused on channel marketing, and analyzed the frequency of use of these theories.\n\nIt was manual work: if you want that detail, you have to do the work.",
