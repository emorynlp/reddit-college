But how is it in academia? Especially in the computer science department when deciding whom to hire for tenure track position or whether to grant tenure to the tt track faculty or when deciding whom to admit for the competitive phd program.",

It's one thing if you are 65 and applying for a TT job, but otherwise more experience is better. It's honestly hard to hire people that want to work for an academic salary when they could just pivot to industry for 3-4x the pay.\n\nAlso, I work in a highly functional department, so it kind of makes the pay differential worth it -- great students too. DM me if you have more specific questions.",

The young crowd (PhDs younger than 30) have to deal with a lot of ageist remarks, but absolutely no one cares. Oftentimes people are told to \"look older\" (by smoking, growing a beard, etc.) or leave their undergraduate graduation dates off of their CVs before they apply for jobs.",

I had teaching and research experience already (including publishing), which probably made this doable at all. \n\nBut man, the ageism pressure in industry climbs pretty fast and becomes un unrelenting. Note that I had done the management track, had started and run my own companies, etc., so I wasn't just bumping along in a \"job\" expecting promotions to come to me or whatever. Still the \"up or out\" pressure became intense, which is one reason I prepared and made the jump to academia.",

You'll need to rely on demonstrating your ability to teach and show good publications and research work -- all three. With that you should be okay... but you'll likely still face people wondering about your age, etc., from time to time.",
