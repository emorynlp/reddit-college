  "text": "I know maybe some will say that I'm beyond hope. I know this might be too late to ask already. But I encourage myself to ask here because I really want to dabble in this career.\n\nI had always been an industry-oriented person, so back in my undergrad I only had one thing in mind: get the degree and get a job. Last few years have been mind-changing for me though. For one reason and another, I took a great interest in academia.\n\nI eventually decided to take a master 2 years ago. I took anthropology. Have always been fascinated with this field, but I had different priorities back then. In the first semester I still had to work because I had bills to pay, but eventually I resigned in 2nd semester because I wanted to focus on my academic life.\n\nUnfortunately that wasn't the wisest decision. Covid age isn't the easiest time for me because most academic activities are done online. I only met my classmates briefly, I barely had enough time to have a good discussion with the faculty. I took a topic that is of a great interest to me, but I mostly work on it only with my supervisor. I didn't know that there were thematic workshops and conference for grad students! I didn't get the chance to network with peers to develop my thesis and get myself more accustomed to the field and the people around it.\n\nI'm not blaming anyone but myself here; there are lots of webinars and workshops but I feel like I'm not in the loop to get that information readily. I don't even know where to get scholarship; paid most of the tuition myself. Which in retrospect is very dumb because I didn't know that scholarship matters in your academic porto.\n\n2 years passed and here I am now already with my degree. I'm completely clueless what to do next. I missed all those opportunity to network back when I was a grad student. I asked my supervisor if there's a research assistant or teaching assistant opportunity, but there's none. I have only two publications. I'm out of the loop with my field - no peers, no colleagues. I'm still in the country where covid has struck heavily so I can't go to anywhere abroad.\n\nI just looked through a new faculty member in my uni. Dang, she's 25. Great porto too. Lots of publications and experiences. Was a teaching assistant in Ivy League! 7 years younger but she's way above me. Great for her, but I just can't shake off the thought, \"where the fuck have I been? Why didn't I do better?\" I'm 32 years old and am still no one. \n\nIs there still hope for me or am I fucked? I really wanted to pursue a career here. What do I have to do?\n\n**TL;DR: Got my master, still 100% clueless about how academia works. I missed my opportunity during my master. What can I do?**",

      "text": "First off, stop with the age comparisons and what things you should have done at what age etc. Academia, and life in general, is not measured by hitting certain milestones at certain points in time. You are never too late to enter academia. I personally know many people in their thirties to fifties who started masters and PhD and then transitioned into a research position without a problem.\n\nNext, what do you want to achieve exactly in academia? Are you looking for a tenured professorship or just any research position? To get into the former, you will definitely have to think about doing a PhD - not only will it give you the formal qualifications to enter academia but you will also have 3+ more years to build your scientific network, get scholarships and grants and just get an insight into what academic life might really be like.\nUnfortunately, even if all you want is to be part of a research lab without big aspirations at being a long-bearded eccentric professor, having a good network is key (although in this case a PhD might be optional depending on your field). Start attending those conferences, write emails to researchers you can see yourself working with and don't be afraid to just ask for advice. Academics are generally supportive and delighted to receive interest in their work, and they might be able to help you get your foot in the door if you are still unsure where to start.",

              "text": "One thing is your negative attitude is an absolute killer. I think everyone here is a little annoyed with the age comparisons, your descriptions of yourself as insecure, clueless, hopeless, dumb. Honestly who wants to spend time with someone is is dumb and clueless, let alone employ them? I'm sure you think you're being honest or something but firstly, that's your subjective assessment of yourself and secondly it's relentlessly exhausting and unappealing to listen to. So even if you can't stop yourself thinking these things, try not to say them out loud. I'm not saying it to be harsh, I'm saying it because you're sabotaging yourself, and no matter what you do if you spend your life going round telling people you're stupid and your work sucks you'll fail because why shouldn't people take you at your word?",

              "text": ">I feel like I'm not smart enough no matter how much I read.\n\nThis is unfortunately a VERY common feeling in high-achieving careers like academia, where you are surrounded by brilliant people on a daily basis. Imposter syndrome can kill off your greatest aspirations, and it is very difficult to stop comparing yourself to the most visible and successful people around you. But remember that we often compare ourselves to those who have more, but ignore what we have already accomplished ourselves. Sure, there will always be that one person who seems smart, beautiful and easily succeeds at anything (I'm sure we all have such an \"arch-frenemy\"). But don't forget that you yourself are also already in a place that a lot of other people can only dream of! Think back to probably just a few years ago, what wouldn't you have given to have a master's degree? Upward comparison might be good to keep your goals in sight, but downward comparison will keep you sane and preserve your self-confidence. \n\n\n\n>I think I'm mostly clueless about this aspect. So... how does this work? If I see a couple of researchers with topic similar to my interest, would I just write to them all, hoping some will stick? Like applying for jobs?\n\nPretty much, yeah. They don't know you yet, so it's a cold introduction very much like an unsolicited job application.\n\n>And... what is the end goal of the email? Am I writing the emails to simply cite and discuss their work? Or can I ask for research assistantship? How do I get into an academic's circle?\n\nThis is the key. Any email you write should have a clear goal or call for action for the recipient. You want to send an email that gives the recipient a good idea of what you expect them to reply or do. Just a \"hi, I read your stuff and I like it\" won't suffice. Be proactive. Research grant opportunities in your country or field and offer them to the person. Not sure where you are in the world but most often, you would get funding not from the university directly but from external funding bodies. Like NHI in the US or Marie-Curie in Europe etc etc. Google that stuff (at least to get an overview, but you can also ask your researchers of choice for pointers)! Then you can approach a researcher with a goal. \"I would love to further my research experience in your lab. Would you be interested in applying for grant xyz with me to work on project abc?\" If you already have an idea for a project you would like to do, give a brief outline (do NOT go into much detail). Or ask them about what they are currently working on and whether they are considering taking on more research personell on that project. Ask if they have any new projects coming up.\n\nIt's admittedly tricky and scary, but the most important thing is that YOU have at least some idea about what you want to get out of it. Other people cannot plan your career for you, so it's up to you to do the ground work and see what's possible and what you even want. Then you can go out and ask people for specific actions.\n\n>What sort of advices I can ask, can I ask about where to get scholarship? Can I just dumbly ask \"what should I do after master\"?\n\nYou can ask what scholarships might be available, sure. But the question about what to do in general is more something for a career advice service. Your uni probably has something like that. If not, there are several websites online for that specific purpose.",

I am 40 years old and I'm just starting to learn how to network professionally because I did not receive any mentorship in this area and I always felt like an imposter, and did not have confidence in my own abilities. I'm finally waking up to the fact that networking and bringing your ideas to the table is important, and I went through a period of regret about not having started earlier, but starting today is better than starting tomorrow. Join mailing lists, email people, show up to (virtual) conferences and start talking to people. \n\nYou've gotten your masters, you seem interested in your research topic -- keep that success and passion in your mind as you move forward.",

Thank you for your kind words. \n\n> I am 40 years old and I'm just starting to learn how to network professionally because I did not receive any mentorship in this area and I always felt like an imposter\n\nThis is precisely how I feel. Once I attended a breakup room in one virtual conference and everyone there seems like they already know each other. It got super awkward, I had nothing to say.\n\nDo you mind sharing how did you learn to network professionally? What was the first thing you did? What sort of emails you write to people? Did you write simply to discuss your common interest, or did you write for research assistantship? How do I get into an academic's circle? I'm completely clueless about this.",

              "text": "I'm not sure if \"network professionally\" was the right term -- I didn't mean to sound like I'm a \"pro\" at this or that I am an expert at it. I just meant \"doing more networking in the professional/work sphere,\" and with how I was before, I feel like any step I take is an improvement. I have started encouraging myself to do it both within and outside of my discipline. Here are some steps I have taken:\n\n1. I took the initiative to start a research/writing group on my campus. I pitched it to as a safe space for people who don't feel confident about their own writing. I recruited a few close friends who then invited others. It has reached more people than I thought it would because it turns out a lot of people don't feel confident.\n2. I wrote to my dissertation advisor and wrote about some of my anxiety/fears with respect to my research, and asked for help. This is something that I did not admit to the whole time I was doing my Ph.D.\n3. I signed up with interest groups and email groups that I found out through some of the professional associations in my discipline. You should check with yours, too. \n\nAnd yes, I hate that feeling of being in a space where everyone already knows each other. You are going to run into that situation a couple of times, but don't let that discourage you from trying. Maybe 3 out of 10 times, you will have nothing to say, but the other times you will.\n\nIt seems like what I am doing may not specifically apply to your situation, but I'm hopefully getting across the point that you should do something, anything. As long as you are polite and considerate about other people's time, I think you will get more positive responses than negative ones. As you no doubt have read in this sub, academia can be a very isolated place, and people are looking for connections.",
