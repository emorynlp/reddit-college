  "title:": "How to structure an academic job talk when changing field?",
  "text": "I am a post-doc, and later this week I'm going to be giving a seminar/academic job talk to associate faculty as part of a fellowship interview. I currently work in human genomics and immunology, whereas this job would be in microbial genomics and spatial epidemiology. I gave a practice job talk to my colleagues today, and had structured it mostly like a normal seminar- a bit about my background, and then the results of some of the projects I'd worked on with a nice 'story'. However my colleagues think that instead I should be emphasising my analytical and bioinformatics skills, how they relate to the field I want to transition to, and why I approached datasets in a particular way. Since I'm mostly presenting to bioinformaticians, they probably don't care about the actual results. I think my colleagues are right, but how on earth do I structure my talk to do this??",
