  "title:": "How do you deal with imposter syndrome?",
  "text": "Hi everybody. I'm in my second and final thesis year of a Masters program in Melbourne, Australia. Towards the end of 2018, I frequented a bunch of seminars and tried mingling/networking with my cohort on a regular basis. I aim to do the same in 2019.\n\nHowever, imposter syndrome has me very anxious. A majority of these events are attended by PhD academics, lecturers, and others far smarter than me. They dress better, they have more interesting viewpoints, and they simply appear more comfortable. My aim is to carry my research into a PhD but I'm not quite there yet. I think this shows.\n\nWhat are some ways in which you've overcome these anxieties? I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but I generally have nobody else to turn to.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for replying and sharing your stories. You've definitely put things into perspective for me.",

      "text": "I definitely don't feel qualified to give any advice because I also feel \"imposter syndrome\" pretty hard.\n\nBut one professor I was able to be open with enough to talk about it told me something I try to keep in mind. It was right before my PhD qualifying exams and I, not even thinking, casually joked about how intimidating it is to be in a room with 5 people smarter than me judging me. The professor, usually a jovial guy, got really serious and said:\n\n\"Stop that now. That's bullshit. We are not smarter than you. We are not better than you. We are not smarter than anyone else. All we have is time and experience. That's all. You just don't have that time yet.\"\n\nI try to remember that often. Hopefully it helps you, too.",

I see their publications, awards, projects, industry experience, languages, etc. and I start to wonder if the adcoms are just laughing my application with pity. \n\n\nWhat helps me with imposter syndrome is:\n\n\n1) Going the extra mile with studying concepts. I hesitate to write this because I know too many students who run themselves to the ground doing this. But while I sometimes question if I really needed to dedicate so much time and energy to a certain task, I rarely actually regret doing so. It gives me more confidence.\n\n\n2) Having a strong support network of people of people who raise me up time and time again. They see good in me, fight for me, and they trust in me even when I beat myself up. That love is invaluable. Give it to others when you can!!\n\n\n3) Embracing that most people experience imposter syndrome. The shared, inherently flawed human experience. I\u2019m not alone. \n\n\n4) I believed that the rewards from trying and succeeding were great enough that for a chance to have them, I could live with feeling scared and inadequate. ",

In it, the narrator admires this man-calling him \"fakir\" which is a Russian colloquialism for a street magician derived from a Franco-Arabic term for a saint or miracle-worker -he is charming, intelligent, tactful and throws the best parties, where erudite and interesting people exchange deep ideas.\n\nAs the story creeps forward it becomes obvious the narrator is not a great person--mostly focused on how rich everything and everyone is, and the fakir remains an object of idealization, but the narrator comes to suspect and realizes that the fakir is poor--the parties they throw are arranged while house-sitting, their academic job pays nothing and their nice clothes are all used and just carefully assembled through good taste.\n\nThe audience can see that the fakir is still great, maybe even better for pulling off what they are pulling off despite not having the means, but the unreliable narrator feels so superior to them, and the story end with them gloating over their perceived superiority to the fakir--who was always just faking being \"truly\" amazing, by being actually amazing.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to interpret the story, which is at least somewhat about imposter syndrome, but the one I choose is to embrace imposterdom--be a trickster, realize that academics don't survive because they deserve to be there by blood, or wealth or any other firm factor, but through discourse--the stuff of air and bullshit--alone.\n\nDon't punish yourself for not belonging, reward yourself for getting away with it. Have a giggle and a celebratory drink every time you pull the wool on some esteemed colleague's mind, instead of being anxious about not really belonging--you don't really belong, no one does.

      "text": "I was just having issues with imposter syndrome myself. I have a link to a letter written by Richard Feynman bookmarked for such occasions. A former student of his wrote to Feynman to congratulate him on winning the Nobel Prize. I have copied the letter below. \n\n>Dear Koichi,\n\n>I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the Research Laboratories. \n\n>Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.\n\n>You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert Hibbs) whose thesis was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to correct it a little.\n\n>I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depends on the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child\u2019s toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years on it without success). Plus all the \u201cgrander\u201d problems of quantum theory.\n\n>No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\n\n>You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself \u2013 it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your na\u00efve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher\u2019s ideals are.\n\n>Best of luck and happiness. \n\n>Sincerely, \n\n>Richard P. Feynman ",

Because it's not Impostor syndrome, it is your own self trying to tell  you that you don't really fit in. It never went away in my case. Not after my MA, not after my PHD, not after books published and two postdocs. Sometimes you are just not cut for the academic life, and pushing yourself to fit in is a recipe for a miserable life. \n\nMaybe you're just a bit insecure, like everyone else. It will pass. But ask yourself from time to time, *really* ask yourself: \"is this what I want to be for the rest of my life?\". Because maybe you really are an impostor, but one trying to fool him or herself rather than others. Don't do what you think you should. Do what feels right. And if it never really feels right, maybe it just isn't.",

I know a lot of people who *really*, genuinely, enjoy from the bottom of their hearts \"nerding out\" on their discipline with people at the pub. I could never stand that. I'd find excuses to take myself away from any such academic \"socializing\" because I simply found it exceedingly dull, or indeed mortifying and depressing (sitting with people super enthusiastic about topic X while you really would like to do something else is really not an edifying experience). Look for these sort of clues: not just how much you know as compared to your peers, but how much you care and how much enthusiasm you've got as compared to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust trying to be frank, I don't want to depress you. I wish you a shining and satisfying academic career.",

Meanwhile I'm three beers deep at the bar chatting with the bartender about which museums I should hit tomorrow while I'm skipping conference talks. This might also be because I still don't really have any academic friends. I have some grad school pals but they're in different disciplines and we never talk about our research. Or maybe I don't have any academic friends because I'm not meant to be an academic? I definitely know less and care less than my peers and am always thinking about when I can get a job and start applying my knowledge to something useful.

I'd feel out of place and somewhat bored, but still my stuff was well-accepted, my papers published, people had very good opinions of me and so on. So I kept going. But what slowly happened is that I quite simply stopped caring about the discipline, but years and years of training towards being an academic made it impossible for me to say it out loud to myself: if you don't care about this, why did you waste over a decade of your life?\n\nBut it happened nonetheless. You notice the small things: one day a friend/colleague sent me a link to a review of a volume I edited. A few years before I would have immediately clicked on it, eager with anticipation, excited about my work being recognized. What I actually did was reading it only once I came back home, browsed it quickly, shrugged and forgot about it. I just don't care anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrictly speaking, I am not out of academia yet. I don't want to go into details, but I have one year left of a frankly well-paid post, so I'm just going through the motions. At the same time, I'm looking elsewhere for an idea of what do to \"when i grow up\". It's scary to be over-educated and unemployed in your 30s. But at least I'm not lying to myself anymore.",

After talking for a while I let it slip that I'd always dreamed of going to one of the top two unis in the country, thinking she would laugh at me. She simply said \"why not?\", And I explained that I'm just \"not the sort of person who gets into those places\". She said \"and who *is* that type of person?\". I admitted I didn't really know, I just pictured some group of intellectual elite. She explained that I'm perfectly capable of getting into those places, and when I said I get quite bad imposter syndrome, she said (and this is a woman who is doing amazingly in her field and editor for a big journal) \"So do I, we all do. It doesn't stop no matter how high up your get and how much experience you have. But you have to focus on your own strengths and don't compare yourself to other people. There isn't an 'elite' group of students who are destined to get those top places. *you* are a top student, and *you* can get a place.\"\n\nI have never felt more motivated in my life. Since then, I have applied for both schools and already have an offer from one. No doubt if I go I will have intense imposter syndrome while I'm there, but her words will stay with me forever.

Even as a TA for undergraduate students I get stuck in situations where I am unable to answer questions but that doesn't stop me from saying,\"I never paid attention to this when I was your age cos I didn't think it was important. If you can google it up right now we can look at it together if you want to.\" Gotta give up the image to truly learn something in the moment from people different from my age and different from my experience.

Even the people who are brilliant and have it all together. This really drove it home for me.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a 1st year MA in a public university in New York who plans on spending their second year doing research instead of the alternative practicum. I tell myself everyday that I deserve to be here; I\u2019m doing it right and I\u2019m doing it well.\n\nAt data sessions, I don\u2019t know the lingo and I get corrected a lot, but I keep asking questions. Because of that I\u2019ve developed a rapport with Emeritus professors, tenure tracks and ABD\u2019s. I am probably one of the more well recognized MA\u2019s in the department. Sometimes I\u2019m scared but I decided \u201cScrew it, I WANT to be here\u201d and I fight for it. That trumps everything else on the bad days. \n\n",
