  "title:": "Should prof intervene with sexism between students?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in a super small department where there are about 40 students the departments upper year cohort right now (most people take the courses as electives). Including myself, only 3 of the students in my cohort are women. I\u2019m a mature student who had a career before returning to school in my 30s and I often feel as if I have an obligation to speak up as the other women are in their early 20s and they sometimes seem uncomfortable rocking the boat. \n\nA course this term was almost entirely group work and our grade was a split between a group project and participation. The groups were assigned and I later learned the prof intentional put one of the women in each group because he didn\u2019t want it to seem like he thought the women could only work together. \n\nMost of the department (students and profs) is wonderful but there are a few men in their early 20s who seem to still have the opinion that our discipline is \u201cmen\u2019s work.\u201d  I had one of these men in my group. \n\nI\u2019m near the top of our class and am fairly confident in my abilities so I don\u2019t pretend to be incompetent but I also work to be inclusive and am happy to follow follow someone else when they take the lead on something. When our group got together I tried to do some team building by asking people what they wanted to work/their area of interest and said it would be great to see if there was any over lap between us. \n\nTwo of the men engaged with me in this conversation but the third guy shut me down and said it wasn\u2019t important to talk about this. Over the next couple days he either disagreed with everything I said or out right ignored that I was talking. He didn\u2019t do this with the other men. He also stated that \u201cmen just intuitively  got [our discipline] in a way women didn\u2019t. \n\nWe had due date deadline and divided the work. I said that if anyone needed help I had some free time. The rest of us committed to a time when our section would be done and this guy just said he was busy but he\u2019d get around to it. I did my section and didn\u2019t hear back from him so I did his in case he flaked. \n\nNot hearing from him the group submitted a few hours early with the stuff I did. He got pissed the next day saying he had done it only to see we had submitted it already. He only addressed this to me and not the other members who were part of the group chat convo. \n\nThe drop date was the next day and I figured I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with him all term so I dropped the class. The prof is a sessional but he seems to be sticking around and I\u2019ll probably have him again so I sent him an email basically saying it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me. \n\nI explained what went on and how I didn\u2019t feel like it was my responsibility as one of the few female students to teach young men that women are people. I also said that as he can view the group communications and the grade is heavily weighted to participation he could considered looking at how the male students interact with the female students when making his assessment. \n\nHe responded that he looked at the chats and agreed that the student had treated me differently and poorly. However, he told me that there really wasn\u2019t anything he could do. Basically some guys are like that and hopefully they\u2019ll group out if it. He also mentioned that as a sessional he was more vulnerable to bad course evaluations and he wanted to make sure he was well like so his courses would continue to get good enrolment. \n\nI feel that that\u2019s a bit of a cop out and I do think that male instructors have a responsibility to teach male students to respectfully work with their female peers. Are my expectations out of line here? I not saying he should fail the guy or call him out in front of people but I do think it\u2019s reasonable that he would have a word with him privately or even vaguely talk to the class about dealing with biases.",

      "text": " I wish you would have communicated with the prof before you dropped the class.\n\nOf course he should have talked with the young man. I think the instructor has an obligation to help students learn to work respectfully with others--male or female.\n\nSince you've already communicated with the instructor and he agreed with you about the young man treating you differently and poorly but he either wasn't interested or able to do anything about it, I think you need to go upstairs. I was a chair and I would want to know about this. Since there is chat evidence of how the student treated you, I'd have a conversation with the young man about appropriate and inappropriate behavior toward other students. I'd also have a conversation with the adjunct about his response to you and point out to him that if he didn't think he was able to deal with a disruptive student he could always talk with me and I'd help him out. I'd also point out that positive student evaluations don't trump expectations about his professional behavior. If it was the first time this kind of thing happened, I'd likely continue to hire him but if it occurred before, we'd be done. This is one reason why I'd want to know--to be sure it's not an ongoing pattern of behavior in the adjunct.\n\nI'm sorry this occurred.",

Fortunately, I have a very \u201ctake no shit, do no harm\u201d personality and will happily counter that mentality. \n\nThere have been moments in my time in academia where a student has been blatantly sexist towards me and I cannot think of a single time in which the Professor hasn\u2019t made a comment about their behavior. \n\nI understand why people are saying \u201cwhy did you drop the class? You should have stayed and made his life a living hell!\u201d I completely understand that perspective in theory. \n\nI\u2019m, actually, in full support of your decision to drop the course, not because of the other student but because of the Professor. I\u2019m sure the Professor wasn\u2019t being malicious in his decision, but being in a class with a sexist student is already hard enough\u2014 being in a class with a sexist student who isn\u2019t checked for his behavior by the Professor is a whole other can of worms. In my experience, even staying in classes in which the sexist person is reprimanded is already hard. You likely saved yourself a good deal of frustration.",

              "text": "This behavior is not just prohibited by [Title IX](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html), this is also prohibited under [Title VII](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964). Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination for many reasons including sex. The Affirmative Action Office at your university (assuming you are in the US) handles these complaints in addition to Title IX (which is often used as a blanket term). \n\nI'm not advocating a course of action here, but I want to be clear, this student's behavior is a clear violation of both IX and VII. Additionally, your instructor likely had a duty to report this (there were some changes to mandatory reporters in 2020, check your school's guidance to be sure, many schools chose to keep stronger reporting requirements than the federal minimum, just because mandatory reporting requirements were changed, the fact that this is prohibited behavior did not). Once you brought the situation to the instructor they likely had a responsibility to bring it to either the DH or your AAO. They failed spectacularly, in that they didn't follow through and that they acknowledged inappropriate behavior and directly told you they would not report it. While I understand the terrible position adjuncts are often in, I still find their behavior here inappropriate. I know it is hard to square, but your needs are as important as theirs. Further, it sounds like your DH may handle this well. If the instructor won't act, it is not at all inappropriate to take it to the DH if you'd like. \n\nThere are a number of potential actions once the behavior is reported, including you declining to pursue the matter, but you've just described a classic scenario that these laws were designed to prevent. If you'd like to talk further, feel free to ask questions here or DM me. Also, it may be useful to search \"Your University's Name Affirmative Action Office\" for more info. Again, I'm not advocating one way or the other for you to take action, or not, on this, but having been on the receiving end (starting over 20 years ago and lessening but not entirely stopped today) and on the responsible end (as a prof who saw or was told about this sort of behavior, not as one who perpetrated it) what you describe makes my blood boil.\n\n*edit* to correct roman numerals and clarify",

I think you need to explain to him that, guess what, *that actually is part of your job*, buddy! If I were you, I wouldn't feel comfortable with profs like this in my department. Have you talked to your PI/advisor and explained what happened? If I were you, I wouldn't have dropped the class- is there a way to add it back? You definitely need to talk to someone, may it be your PI or head of your department. Maybe you can even get put back into the class. This is really upsetting to me. I am in STEM and thankfully have never gone through this.",

I can see where they were coming from, but putting women by themselves in a group of men (or any other minority in a group by themselves) is known to make those people perform worse. I think it's called \"stereotype threat\" (I always get the name of this one mixed up). Don't have the refs on me right now, but there's been a fair bit of research into it. Even just having eg 2 women in a group instead of 1 reduces the effect and the women perform better than if they were the only one.",

I've experienced the same thing with the course I'm TA'ing this semester and if it continues to happen I'll be speaking to the professor. \n\nBefore the midterm none of the students had seen my face and I have a distinctly male name - all emails were polite, I got asked regular questions about the course material, students agreed with me on my marking decisions and assignment solutions...\n\nProctored the midterm, all the students saw my face. Immediately during the midterm (me being the only non-male TA) I got no questions where the other TA's got 20-30. Afterwards, no more questions about the assignments, when I had questions about my marking of the midterm the students were argumentative and rude, and after posting the solutions to an assignment yesterday I've already received several rude and angry emails about my solutions down to a single negative sign that completely depends on choice of axis and would be correct in either the + or - result... and I haven't even started marking the assignment yet. \n\nI've never experienced this before as my department (physics) is fairly evenly split between men and women, but now that I'm TA'ing an engineering department course it's jarring. I hate it. I applied to TA this course again in the summer and if I get the job I'll likely tell the professor I won't be showing my face while proctoring because of the difference in attitude.",

Four of my family members are engineers so I don\u2019t mean this to sound like I think engineers/engineering student are universally difficult but boy some of the stories I\u2019ve heard from a friend studying that are wild. Just the level of infallibility expressed by some of the guys in her program is next level. They\u2019re undergrads but will challenge their TAs and profs as if they\u2019re the authority. \n\nI really feel for one of our TAs. She was TA\u2019ing another class with this prof a while ago. It was a 200+ student second year course and it was completely out of control. People were heckling and calling out really consistently. It the point where a few of us were just meeting for coffee instead of going to the lectures because there was no point. The prof didn\u2019t have control of the class and didn\u2019t even try to bring it back together. He\u2019d say thing like \u201cyou guys are so spirited today.\u201d Establishing any sort of order was left up to the TA. She\u2019d have to get up and raise her voice and tell people off. Any sort of email reminding people that they needed to be considerate came from her. At evaluation time the prof gave us time in a lecture to do them and I over heard a couple guys talking about how they couldn\u2019t forget to add what a bitch she was. The irony is that she was one of the most understanding and compassion people and would tons spend extra time out of class helping people if they were confused. These guys weren\u2019t in the department so I don\u2019t the department and it was just an elective for them so thankfully none of the other courses have been that bad.",

But after, him ignoring you could be because he just didn't like you (for whatever reason), this is the problem. With sexism cases, you have to prove that things are sexism. Obviously what I quoted is sexist, and we all can tell he is a twat from that, but him ignoring you and doing no work can be independant from this. Since your group seems like it was 4 people, 3 men and 1 woman, him not doing any work also affects the other men. So his quote is sexist, him doing no work is just being a dick.\n\n>he could considered looking at how the male students interact with the female students when making his assessment. \n\nThis is also sexist. Considering how male students interact with female students would be sexist unless they also see how everyone interacts with everyone. Just one way is pure sexism by definition.\n\nI'd say your professor could look into it, but it would depend if things are \"no doubt sexism\". The student being a dick could be because he is a dick, and that can't be tackled from a sexism point of view. Even if he was being a dick to your whole group because he is sexist, it would be hard to prove since his actions affected men more than women (2:1).\n\nI am quite harsh at people in my classes who are sexist, racist, homophobic... anything. I once kicked someone out of my class because she called someone a f\\*gg\\*t. I've given a couple of warnings to people for \"low level\" things too. In my experience, sexism in academia happens quite often (I have experienced it as a man in STEM), and it only really gets tackled if it's blatent and exteme. This example wouldn't even be looked at imo. I wouldn't and I am pretty tough on it in my classes and I wouldn't touch it because there isn't much to go on (even if it's obvious to you, it's not obvious to anyone who wasn't there)",

Honestly, wouldn\u2019t have an issue if a prof also looked at how female students interacted with male students, especially in the case of historically female dominated areas (I used to work as a student advocate we had to deal with a male nursing student being targeted for \u201ctaking up a spot\u201d and several other things because it was a \u201cwomen\u2019s profession\u201d). In the case of this area it has historically been a boys club. It is culturally shifting the department demographics aren\u2019t moving that fast so while it man only be a few guys making comments the silence makes them easy to hear.  \n\nThat\u2019s not the only comment he\u2019s ever made but it was an already long post. There have been plenty of comments about what is and isn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d or \u201clegitimate\u201d area of research (anything that wasn\u2019t stereotypically associated heterosexual or masculinity was \u201cfrivolous\u201d). He also taken a very similar position with the types of primary sources we use. As in material culture is \u201cfrivolous\u201d evidence but written sources are infallible. Then there are the comments about which scholarly works and academics are logical (male authors) and which are too emotionally driven (female authors). In one discussion the first name was ambiguous and he praised the author\u2019s ability to reason and addressed her with male pronouns. When prof pointed out that the author was a woman he asked \u201care you sure?\u201d \n\nTo clarify what I made a bit ambiguous, when I say he shot down what I said what I mean is I would state something verbatim from the textbook or lecture slides and he would respond \u201cno that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Then when it would come up later in the conversation and one of the other guys would pull up the same section and say the same thing he would say \u201cyeah that\u2019s it.\u201d He would disagree with me even on zoom calls while I was holding a book to quote from it and say I think you\u2019re reading that wrong. \n\nIn terms of ignoring me there were a couple things. The standard cutting me off while I was speaking and the cutting me off to say what I was already saying. However, the weirdest one that happened a few times was that I would make a post about something that we needed to cover or account for in our project components and other people would be replying directly to it and then about five minutes later he would then post the same question copied and pasted and add something like, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d He never did any of that with the other guys and I would even say he was very respectful of them. This also isn\u2019t an issue of established group dynamics as we all had the same passing familiarity with each other. We know each other from the department but have never worked together. When I mentioned to one of the other guys that I was about to drop the course his response was \u201cyeah... I get that.\u201d\nIf it were just the occasional cut off in a zoom call I\u2019d probably assume just awkward tech problems but there was never that \u201coops sorry you were lagging for me\u201d moment.",
