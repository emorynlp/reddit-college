  "title:": "Academia Jobs in Math/Physics VS in Engineering?",
  "text": "Hi, I am wondering if there's a difference in engineering research vs math/physics research on the aspects of job stability, income and teaching.\n\nI talked with an aerospace engineer who's a research associate at my uni (Quebec, Canada) and he told me that he had a stable income and that no researcher on his team was forced to teach unless they wanted to. This guy was also simply recruited by his prof on his last year of PhD.\n\nHowever, when I look at the math/physics people on Reddit, I saw a lot of them talk about how hard it is to stay in academia or get enough grants, and how they are forced to teach to make a living. Is the difference between what I've seen due to my location (since a lot of people on Reddit are from 'Murica) or is it due to differences in engineering academia vs math/physics academia?\n\nPersonally, I'm a rising 2nd year mech. eng. student and I'm just researching what mech. eng. academia jobs are all about, but I'm getting really confused because I don't know if the work conditions people discuss about academia pertains to math/physics specifically OR to engineering too, or those work conditions mostly concern people in the States.",

      "text": "This will also vary a lot based off of who you talk to - some people are happy with uncertainty and some people aren't, for instance. Reddit is a much more pessimistic place as far as these things go than in real life. At the postdoc level (for a few years after the PhD like perhaps the aerospace engineer you mentioned - is that person in a permanent position?), yes, I believe there is less teaching in Canada than in the US. It's about the same afterwards though, I think.\n\nEven within math you'll be more likely to get an academic position if you do something applied probably. A research-focused position in math would probably involve teaching 3 courses a year (maybe 2 your first year or if you have a grant). Such positions are very difficult to get, though there is less of a focus on getting grants beforehand (i.e. in order to get a permanent position). You want to publish papers and have a larger research program that the experts in your field are excited about, at a minimum (hopefully some not directly related experts are also excited about it).",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply :) Also, the aerospace engineer I talked about has a permanent position I think, considering he seemed to be happy about the stability of his job. I didn't want to base my view of research in engineering solely on his experience, so that's why I'm asking elsewhere. It's just that on Reddit, most of the stuff I see about research pertains to math/physics and not engineering, so it doesn't *exactly* concern my career path.\n\nOn a side note: isn't the whole gotta-get-a-grant problem on the professor's shoulders? What I mean is the aforementioned aerospace engineer is a research **associate** under a prof, and he never talked to me about searching for grants or whatnot, he just got constantly paid a regular salary.",

              "text": "I don't know - those types of positions don't exist in math (my field). Well, never say never, but it's not like people have labs they need help running. There are positions called 'research assistant professors', but those are postdocs. You're probably right about the grant thing. \n\nI really like the day-to-day of grad school and get to spend almost all of my time on research-related activities, but there's definitely a lot of uncertainty. Almost noone skips the postdoc entirely in math, and 2-4 years of postdoc is most common. You should have an idea of the type of position you'll be competitive for before then, but not in any great detail. \n\nI saw that you asked about salary too. In math I'd say 20-30k for PhD, 50-60k for postdoc, and 80-100k for tenure-track positions at research-focused universities. All of these can be higher for fancy positions/fellowships and depend on cost of living to an extent.",

      "text": "The struggles are overall similar, but it's just a lot worse in math/sci compared to engineering. In MechE tenure-track jobs are hard to get, but if you're good (and willing to move) you'll find one. The pay in engineering is much better at every level. Sometimes you can even find postdoc positions with OK pay. Getting grants is still hard, but opportunities are out there. \n\n\nI think a PhD in MechE is a great idea if you want to do research. If that ends up being in academia, that's great. If not, you have lots of good options elsewhere too.",

A math dept needs to staff all those Calc I classes, but we just don't have as many sections.\n\n\nIt always varies, but everywhere I've been a \"Research Associate\" working at a University is a soft money position. Sometimes it can be like a postdoc but with better pay. The job may not require writing grants explicitly, but people in this role may aspire for a tenure track job which will require grant experience. And while those grants are on the prof's shoulders, if the money runs out the research associate is still out of a job.",
