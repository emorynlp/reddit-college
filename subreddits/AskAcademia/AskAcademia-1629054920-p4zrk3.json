  "title:": "Should I work of a paper 6 years after leaving a lab?",
  "text": "I have never posted here before but I need some advice from some strangers who have no involvement in the situation because I am starting to think I am going mad. I am not going to go into exact detail, though I suspect the people involved will be able to tell who I am referring to if they see this post (I am honestly beyond caring what they think). Apologies for a long post but to understand the current situation involves going back through the last 11 years of my time in academia.\n\nI finished handed in my PhD over 6 years ago. It took about 5 and a half years but my scholarship only lasted 3 and a half years so the last 2 I was not getting paid. My PhD supervisor admitted that they were purposely delaying approving my thesis so I would stay and help get papers out. Expect the supervisor also would never actually read the paper drafts or give me any guidance on what she thought was needed to actually submit the papers. So I was basically trapped.\n\nI have never admitted this to anyone (somethings are easier to tell to strangers I guess), but I was considering suicide as it was the only way I thought I could get out of the situation.\n\nI only managed to leave because I got a out of the blue job interview, which led to amazing postdoc in another country. I can say with all honesty that I love the people I work with. They are like a second family and I have nothing but respect and admiration for my current supervisor. She has told me multiple times she thinks I am a great postdoc who generates high quality data and specifically praised my writing skills. I have been here almost six years and have gotten multiple first author papers out here and I should have at least drafts of another couple by the end of the year. So I have to believe I am a reasonable scientist.\n\nBefore I left my PhD I finished writing a draft of a first author paper. I have sent multiple emails to my old supervisor asking what they want me to do in order to get the paper out. At first they complained it was my fault it was not progressing because I was not bugging them enough (as I remember it their words were: \u2018I choose what to work on based on which of my student stand at my office door and nags me the most each morning\u2019). So I start emailing them once a week. By my third emailing they are completely ignoring me and not responding at all. After about 6 months of this they write me an email saying they are not going to work on it at all until they get 5 other manuscripts out first. At which point I give up on ever getting it out.\n\nAt the start of this year I notice a call for papers on a topic that overlaps with the paper. So, while I still don\u2019t have a great deal of hope of getting this paper out, I just send a link with it my old lab just to see what happens. For some reason it works and they think it is a great idea. Finally, progress! But then a week later they emailed to say they can\u2019t meet that deadline (this 4 months before the deadline). At this point I have made all the figures and there is a rough draft of all the sections. It is not an impossible deadline, but they make it clear they have no plans to work on it at all until June (which is after the call for papers deadline).\n\nI don\u2019t really hear anything again from them until last week, at which they send an email saying the paper is done and ready for submission once I check it for typos. They make a big fuss about how they want to submit it on a certain day (about a week after they sent the email) because they got an extension from the editors but it is several months past the original deadline. They also specifically state it only needs to be read once for typos and critical errors before it will be ready for submission. But they also have a list of stuff they want me to do (fixing references, making new supplementary figures etc) that is realistically going to take me 20-30 hours (plus I would usually dedicate a full day just to carefully read the draft a few times before submission and to check the correct papers are referenced), which is huge ask given I am already swamped at work and as I said before they wanted it done within the span of a week with no notice. \n\nSo I opened up the files they sent to assess how much work it is going to take and it turns out they have completely rearranged and re-written the draft I had written 6 years ago. Which in itself would not be a problem, but it is genuinely the worst paper I have ever read. It reads like whoever wrote it has absolutely no idea what they are talking about and does not even really understand why the experiments were completed. The introduction in particular is a mess and just reads like someone copied and pasted lines from different papers. They also rewrote some of my original intro, but somehow changed it in a way that introduced a lot of inaccurate statements. There are some sections in the results that clearly show whoever wrote it just fundamental does not understand the experiment. I showed that section of the results to my current lab and it is just gibberish to anyone that does not have first hand knowledge of the experiments.\n\nI am pretty irritated so give myself a few days to calm down before responding (like I said I was swamped at work so had no time to do anything anyway). During that time I thought about that awful intro and it occurs to me there might be a reason it seems like it is cut and pasted from other sources, so I google some of the sentences. It takes me 5 minutes to figure out 3 sentences from the first paragraph are obviously plagiarized (one sentence is copied exactly and the others they changed one word of the sentence). I doubt they are the only sentences in the paper that are plagiarized, and in fact that section of the results that I mentioned sounded like gibberish also has some lines I would argue are plagiarized (basically they took some sentences of a similar paper and changed that papers gene name to their gene of interest). At this point it became pretty clear the only way I can be sure it does not contain plagiarized text is to rewrite the entire introduction and a large chunk of the results.\n\nSo my question is: do you think it is even worth making these changes? It will be an incredible amount of work (basically rewriting \u00be of the paper) and they have made it pretty clear that they don\u2019t care about this paper so I would have to do it all. They specifically said that it doesn't matter if it is terrible as the special issue editors are desperate for papers. But at the end of the day my name is going to be forever connected to this paper. Honestly, my biggest motivation is that it would mean I never have to talk to my ex-supervisor again. I can already feel my mental health backsliding and I am increasingly convinced it is not worth it.\n\nI sent an email back pointing out the plagiarism, the fact that it is an impossible deadline and a few other things. I worked hard to make the email as neutral as possible. Since then I have gotten another email from a postdoc in the lab but obviously written by the supervisor. In that email she says the supervisor does not want to email get emails from me unless they are civil. To be clear while in the lab this supervisor used to swear at us (and then tell us we don\u2019t get to be upset because they were swearing at the situation and not us). They would ask impossible questions in lab meeting (e.g. ask about an acronym in a procedure we had not done 4 years) and when we could inevitably not answer yell at us and just general embarrass us in front of the lab. They would say that none their students were actually smart enough or knowledgeable enough to be Phd student. If anyone took time off they would go to all the other PhD students and say that individual obviously was not serious about ever finishing their degree. The only \u2018uncivil\u2019 thing I have done it stand up for myself and make it clear that I am not going to be bullied by her anymore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other important things that may be important to know about my time in the lab (you can probably stop reading now but it will give you some more insight into situation):\n\nWhile in the Lab my Phd supervisor ordered me to do some luciferase experiments with 5 internal repeats and then throw out the two repeats that fit least with their theory. At the time it felt wrong to do this, so I did my best to ignore this order (and they never checked our raw data to make sure we were obeying them). I later learned what they were asking for was p-hacking. While I can say I did not p-hack my data, I strongly suspect other PhD students in the lab did.\n\nDuring my time PhD I grew worried about the western blots one of the postdocs was producing. Specifically her loading controls looked incredible faint given the amount of protein she claimed to be loading. Also when she went on maternity leave I was asked to run some of her samples and she straight up told me to run an unrelated sample as a untransfected control (to my relief at the time that western completely failed). I was so terrified of her and my supervisor that I went along with it despite my concerns. Years after leaving the lab I talked over my concerns with an Associate professor here and she gave me the courage to write a very polite email to my previous supervisor saying it might be worth double checking those western blots before submission (this paper that has come out of the lab since I left that I am second author on). The supervisors response was to write an incredible angry email calling me am idiot for doubting her and saying she was 100% sure her postdoc data was perfect.\n\nBefore that email I had always been incredible polite and just accepted any verbal abuse she threw my way but on that day I cracked. I spent 10 hours going through all of the versions of that figure I could find and found concrete proof her loading controls were faked. Specifically one of the loading controls had been rotated 180 degree and used twice in the same experiment (not something that happens by accident). I sent a response back including this proof to her but have never received thanks or an apology or even an acknowledgement of that email, though the westerns did get removed.\n\nThe two PhD students that went through after me straight up plagiarized parts of my thesis to write theirs (specifically parts of the introduction and methods sections).\n\nI have been taken off the authorship of two papers after leaving the lab, without consultation even though they are still using my data. One of them I only got added back because a reviewer complained. In that case they claimed not to realise that it contained constructs I had made even though there was a line in the paper specifically stating I had made them. Also when they mentioned in passing they were submitting the paper I offered to proof-read the methods section in case it contained on of the constructs I made (and I sent a list of the constructs I made that I thought it contained).",

Up until now a always thought it could help my career, just because it shows my PhD was actually productive (I actually missed out on some Postdoctoral fellow grants and the specific reason they gave was the lack of first author publications during my PhD), but it has been so long since I finished and now I have had other stuff come out. So maybe I should reconsider what publishing it will achieve.",

Once you move on the thing before the thing you're doing now fades in significance. I think people won't care so much that you didn't get a publication from your PhD if you've got a bunch of publications and maybe a fellowship or grant under your belt. To prove my point, if you had a load of PhD papers but nothing in your postdoc that would look much worse.",

      "text": "It goes without saying that don\u2019t put your name on a paper that you suspect contains research misconduct. If you\u2019re the first & corresponding author and your old PI is very hands off, is there any reason why you can\u2019t submit your old (better) version to the journal? Maybe keep a few of your PI\u2019s changes but not the ones you don\u2019t like. Maybe your old PI will just be happy with it once it\u2019s accepted in a good journal. If they ask why it\u2019s different than the version they gave you, you can just blame the reviewers, say they asked for those changes. Your time is money and if you think this paper isn\u2019t helping *you* then don\u2019t work on it. You don\u2019t owe them anything. Be prepared though for your old PI to submit it without your name on it if you go no contact. I\u2019ve had former PIs give my nearly completed work to other students to finish after I left the lab (on good terms!) and the student who replaced me became first author and I was not on the paper at all.",

          "text": "Thanks. My main concern was if I changed back they would just refuse to accept any of the changes and send it back. But, between me posting and now I have gotten another email from that lab. They are now saying something has come up and they no longer have any time to work on it at all. Basically they said I can make any changes that I think are necessary for submission and then send it back to them can so that they can proof read it and then submit it. Which somewhat implies I could send them the old version (with a few for their changes) and see what happens.\n\nI did not get into in my post (I thought it was long enough already), but something I read implies their university was trying to get rid of the PI's job/lab. The University is using Covid as an excuse (budget cuts) but they have no grant funding right now, so I suspect that is the bigger reason. They are probably under huge pressure to get anything out right no to justify their existence to the University and I suspect that is why they are is a rush to publish. I wonder if that is why the new paper is so terrible: they decided it needed an entire rewrite for reasons that are beyond me but did not take the time to do it probably because of the pressure they are under.",
