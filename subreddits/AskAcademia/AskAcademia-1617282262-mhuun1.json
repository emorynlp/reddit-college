  "title:": "Does anyone think universities are going to divide into a North v South* type response to coronavirus in the fall?",
  "text": "*let me preface that it\u2019s not strictly north v south, conservative v liberal, I think it\u2019s way more complicated than this I just need to fit it in the question!\n\nSo with enrollment kicking off I\u2019ve seen college marketing kick off and there seems to be a distinct divide. Many community colleges seem mostly virtual, many northern colleges seem to be emphasizing still maintaining Covid protocols in the fall (emphasize \u201csafety\u201d) whereas many southern universities (including mine) are advertising \u201cback to normal\u201d, no masks or distancing required.\n\nNow....a whole lot can happen between now and then. The pandemic could die out, the pandemic to could rage up again, vaccines could be as easy as to get as just walking into a CVS. With multi-million dollar music festivals announcing September dates, I feel rather optimistic for a rather complete return to normal.\n\nFor the record, my university is a major vaccine distribution site, so I have zero doubt that any student who wants one won\u2019t be able to get a shot come summer orientation time even. \n\nBut does anyone think we are heading towards an odd divide between less cautious and more cautious schools..and whatever political/social divide that may cause.",

Heck, many students never took the pandemic very seriously (see a decent portion of Greek life) to begin with. I do think however, schools should require a vaccination before being allowed to return to campus. Online offerings may need to be a thing for this reason alone. Until we are fairly certain the virus is stamped out, those without a vaccination should not return. Hopefully by 2022, this will be the case. Anyway, a vaccine requirement may fall along partisan lines.",

Im not sure there are many large universities that could withstand those two pressures, and then add in the desires of many conservative state legislatures. The only institutions that will be able to resist, IMO, will either be the elites like you said who can afford to ignore these forces, or very small colleges who can cater to regional preferences and whose smaller student population makes them more flexible.",

For us, it would almost certainly mean continuing hybrid instruction and therefore some amount of entirely remote students (if allowed by our accreditor). Our leaders are coming around to that idea, but I'm not sure students have processed the idea that Fall 2021 might be on a 33-50% rotation.",

I don't think that's being overly optimistic. My at-risk mother and I both have the first dose and are getting the second dose in a few weeks. After that...what else am I supposed to do? Covid is never going to completely die out. It'll circulate through the population just like the flu and the common cold. I know that sucks. I know that's scary. But it can't be helped.

I took my last class in the Fall which had a hybrid option for students to attend either online or in person if they wished to. This gave me total anxiety, since I was still expected to go to campus at least two days a week to do experiments, and students weren't that scarce due to the hybrid setup and the in-person undergraduate lab courses.\n\nI hope the hybrid option still exists in the future so students can be comfortable with whichever format they prefer. I haven't seen my family or more than one friend outside my lab mates for over a year which sincerely breaks my heart every day. However, the ability to watch lecture videos and write my dissertation at home in peace alleviates some of that.",

But they probably will be cautious about keeping events under a certain size, urging moderate social distancing, maybe capping occupancies in older or less well-ventilated buildings, at least some of them. Their bread and butter depends on proximity, contact, intimacy of scale--but their clientele are mostly people who've been following public health advice fairly religiously. \n\nCommunity colleges already had virtual learning as part of their approach, to compete with for-profits in terms of offering courses and certifications to adults who can't be full-time students going to a physical campus and back; they'll keep doing that. \n\nBig public universities are going to be influenced somewhat by their state legislatures and state politics--they already have been. Public universities in very very red states are already under attack by their own legislators and they'll likely shed all remaining pandemic precautions. The only complexity they'll likely face will be athletics or other interactions with institutions that may be in states urging some continued precautions, but NCAA is going to likely push hard to get everything back to unrestrained normality--the spice must flow, so to speak. \n\nThe other complexity that all institutions across the board are going to face is interaction with international students and study abroad programs. That's why I think most universities and colleges are going to try to keep vaccine on hand for themselves if they can in August and September, in order to vaccinate incoming international students. (I think everybody is waiting with great anticipation to find out whether Sputnik and Sinovac seem to have been effective in actual usage and also whether or not taking two different vaccines is contraindicated or not.) I think there are going to be countries that WHO deems to have been ineffective in vaccination (say, Tanzania under Magafuli's rule, though that might change now) that will be on a watch list that will cause problems for travellers and will likely be off-limits for study abroad.",

Like 15% or more down from a year prior. My SLAC was only down 1.5% last fall. The closest state comprehensive was down about 5-6%.  I think there's a core economic factor at work here; our SLAC students come from families with a median income of about $150K. My guess is the CC students are 1/3 that and were the most likely to see job/income loss from COVID, so they probably just aren't in school at all.",

Also social factors: lots of our students are parents, who now have kids at home all the time. Or they\u2019re taking care of *their* parents. And frankly, I think a lot of students made the right choice to prioritize their family obligations rather than try to juggle everything and inevitably do poorly in class.",

Because 1) we're doing it now and have been all year, and 2) another year of major hits to auxiliary revenues (i.e. room and board, events, etc.) would be very damaging. This year we had 5-10% cuts to budgets and raises were cancelled. Quite a few people were laid off. That was *with* students in dorms and on campus for in-person classes. Those cuts were as \"limited\" as they were because we used reserves to balance the operating budget. Those reserves as gone now, so unless we get $25M from the federal COVID funds we'll be even *more* financially vulnerable in fiscal year 2022.\n\nSo we *need* our students to be back on campus this fall. Vaccination gives us an excuse, though we don't really need one since we've been on campus since last August anyway.

I think it\u2019s time we get back to normal\n\nEdit- also the almighty dollar makes it so we will be in person regardless of what happens. University can\u2019t afford the level of drop we had again next year. I\u2019m sure they will make whatever bullshit excuse they got to make to get back to normal (our studies show that more students Feel more safe on campus than at home.... blah blah blah. They will open schools back up even if it\u2019s not safe and convince everyone it is).That\u2019s just my two cents though",
