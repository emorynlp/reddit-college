  "text": "Do you see it as a reflection of unfavorable recommendations when a postdoc applicant\u2019s referees send in their ref letters to the potential employer on the deadline date? I applied for a postdoc position at a National lab. The PI told me that my referees took a week to give their reference letters while the PIs of the other person he is considering sent their ref letters within 24hrs.",

Excluding an applicant for a silly reason could hurt their odds of finding the best candidate and they know that. \n\nIn all likelihood, they don't even know what day it arrived unless they really looked for that info. They just see a pile of PDFs to wade through.",
