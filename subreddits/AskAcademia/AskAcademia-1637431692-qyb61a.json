  "title:": "First Campus Visit Felt...Off -- Advice?",
  "text": "I had my first campus visit a couple days ago for a tenure track faculty position at a small liberal arts college. I went in incredibly excited at the possibly working there. By the time I left, I felt off. Because this is my first interview, I can't tell if this was due to the visit being poorly planned or if I somehow bombed without realizing it. Any thoughts or advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe visit was short. I took an uber \\~1hr from the airport to the hotel the night before. I was picked up at 8AM where I immediately met the faculty in the small department (\\~5-6 individuals) for my first interview (no coffee or breakfast provided). After answering around 5 questions, they asked if I had any questions for them. I had a few lined up  but had been hoping to speak with new faculty separately to ask how the adjustment to the university was, chat more personally about some of the work coming out of the department, etc. but never got a chance to do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I had an hour long meeting with the Dean (which went great). Next, I had 30 mins to myself to prepare for my teaching demo. I did the demo to a live class and really enjoyed the students. After, I ate lunch by myself in a room for about an hour. Then, I met three students for about 30mins. After that, I met with the Provost for about 20mins (which also went great). Then, spent an hour with an undergraduate student from admissions showing me around the campus (though he  just stood and talked to me about the campus rather than showing me for some reason). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe visit ended with a quick chat with the department chair before taking another \\~1hr uber back to the airport. I never got to chat with faculty in the department so I left the visit feeling like I couldn't make the connections I wanted to, have the informal chats I had hoped to have, etc. The longest meeting I had was with the random undergraduate student from admissions \"showing\" me campus. I didn't even get a chance to ask about the courses they wanted a new faculty member to teach. I was really thrown for a loop. Only one faculty member commented on my teaching demo. Did I somehow bomb this? I thought perhaps I didn't use the 2-3mins walking to the few meetings wisely enough to make some of the connections I had hoped to. But either way, I left feeling incredibly disconnected and off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps because it was my first interview, I was unprepared and hadn't planned well for very limited time to talk with faculty. Maybe I was a sympathy candidate visit so they didn't put in any effort? I notice that all their new hires are from the same institution prior. Given that they are a small department and this is their 3rd year interviewing candidates for new positions, maybe they were just exhausted? How would you even read what happened here?",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t jump to thinking you bombed it. I work at a SLAC and some thoughts:\n\nOne thing is probably COVID. I know pre pandemic we used to take candidates out to lunch and dinner but recently we have only been doing small lunches and no dinners. There are still less people on campus than normal due to the pandemic. Everyone is burnt out so maybe less engaging. The last candidate talk I went to there were like 5 faculty members present and that was the only opportunity I had to interact with the candidate.\n\nIt could have been your travel plans. One interview I did in person my flights were tightly scheduled around the day and they were making sure I did everything I needed to and then got back to the airport.  \n\nI would try not to assume the worst things like they aren\u2019t interested. You never know what\u2019s going on and unfortunately the wait and see is never fun but try to just stay positive until you have a reason not to and move forward with whatever else is going on.",

      "text": "Does sound a bit weird. I had a similar experience many, many years ago, where the Dept was obviously not involved with the visit whatsoever. I asked the person driving me to the airport what the deal was, since it was so odd, and she very candidly told me that the campus was under a hiring freeze unless they brought in a diversity candidate to interview. They had no interest in hiring me and in fact they didn\u2019t think I was going to come but since their last 67 hires have been white males they had to at least invite someone more diverse. They had no intention of hiring me. Would not have wanted to be there anyway. Sometimes there are things going on that we can\u2019t know about. They may have a favored internal candidate, for exp, and are just required to go through the motions. Good luck!",

Breakfast with the chair, teaching demo, one hour meetings with each member of the committee (usually five people.) There\u2019s always two big dinners, an hourlong meeting with the Provost, campus tour, driven tour around the city, individual meetings with 5 or 6 other faculty, a social where any faculty can come meet you\u2026 your experience sounds off.",

If so most of us in strict lockdown areas have lost some social skills for sure. \n\nSecond the older I get the more I trust my gut. While you don\u2019t want to dwell on an off feeling. Based on your odd experience at the visit adjust the lens you are looking at this opportunity with. I would scrutinize communications and weigh all my options. \n\nDo you have any insiders at the college who can tell you what it is like?",

Individual meetings are key at all the places I've been. This isn't an issue with social skills, it's an issue in how they structured the on-campus interview.\n\nI agree that they either have big internal issues (terrible organizing skills?) or have another candidate in mind and so put the bare minimum into the plan for your visit.",

The people were so much more friendly and welcoming. I ended up taking the job with the second university and heard later about some really toxic work practices in the first place.

Being able to talk one on one was important to you, it doesn't have to be a deal breaker but I think rather than see it as somehow your failing, you should see it as a sign this organisation isn't a perfect fit for you. Having values and boundaries is good and you should listen to that inner voice. I think all of us can point to occasions during our career where we ignored our inner voice warning us and lived to regret it.",
