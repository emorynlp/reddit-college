  "text": "I have two offers and need help\u2026\n\nOffer #1 - Lecturer at the same R1 where I got\nMy PhD. More money. May not be renewable next year.\n\nOffer #2 - Teaching Asst Prof (TAP) at an R2. 1 hour-long commute. Very likely renewable. \n\nIf my eventual goal is to be a TAP (or Professor of the Practice), would taking the Lecturer position be a bad move for my career?\n\nIt seems like Offer #1 is better for my family.",
