  "text": "I'm a first year UK PhD student in meteorology. Currently, I'm trying to write my first formal progress report which (if you don't know) is just a summary of my project, my progress up to yet, my methods and my future plans.\n\nI'm having a bit of writer's block - maybe it's the impostor syndrome but I feel less able to write a good piece of work. I'm doubting everything I write and struggling to come up with a good way to start and finish my writing.\n\n**So what are your best academic writing tips?**\n\nOne thing I picked up from a Nature workshop is to make your reader understand why something is important, rather than saying \"this is important because...\"\n\nFor example:\n\n* \"Identifying flaws in weather models is important because it enables meteorologists to make direct improvements.\"\n\nvs\n\n* \"Identifying flaws in weather models equips meteorologists with the knowledge to make direct improvements to the forecasts, which could increase the lead time on evacuation decisions.\"",

      "text": "Idea 1:\nMake a presentation, with the intro, methods, results and you conclusions/ future work. About 30 slides. Then each slide becomes the subject of a paragraph or two. The slide pictures can become the basis for  your figures.\n\nIdea 2:\nFree write with no editing for a set amount of time. Leave the typos, don\u2019t worry about flow. Just put Ref where you need a reference - look it up later. Edit for the same time again. This should get you out of writers block.\n\nIdea 3: put together your result figures. Start by writing the methods that support these figures. Then write a description of the figures (aka the results). Add in the conclusion sentences (as in your example). Then what does someone need to know to understand your results (intro). Finally where do your results fit into others work (discussion).\n\nIdea 3 is how I write now, 1 and 2 how I did it when I was younger.\n\nYou won\u2019t write perfect sentences first time. It doesn\u2019t matter. You make passes through the document picking up things each time. Try and have an activity when you proofread (updating references or finding acronyms).\n\nFind your writing hour when you write best. Guard it and use it. Do easy things like figures and proofreading when you are tired.\n\nPlease excuse any typos I\u2019m on a phone and this was a lot to type!\n\nIf imposter syndrome sneaks up tell the voice - fine maybe I shouldn\u2019t be here but that\u2019s not for me to decide. If they let me stay they know better than me and so I deserve to stay. You have better things to do with your time than judging yourself - such as writing!\n\nEdit: you can fix bad sentences once they are written. You could go through and check for the \u2018mistakes\u2019 the nature course told you about - after it\u2019s written. Write first, edit second.",

          "text": ">You won\u2019t write perfect sentences first time. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThis is so important. When I get stuck during writing it's usually because I keep starting and deleting the same sentence trying to write the perfect sentence right away which is almost impossible to do. Writing one or two bad sentences down and improving from there is so much easier. I will even sometimes write a deliberately bad sentence because it takes away all that pressure. I can only go up from there and starting is really easy because the first step is just making it gramatically correct and then you are usually already coming up with a way better sentence or a good follow-up.\n\nAlso, if English isn't your first language, deepl.com is really helpful. I don't suggest you write in a different language and then translate to English. But sometimes you write a sentence that just seems off and it's hard to put your finger on why. If you let deepl translate that sentence to your native language, it will be much easier to spot if you used a suboptimal word or insinuated not quite what you were trying to convey. This also really helps when you have a hard time simplifying an overly complicated sentence.",

Sometimes that requires 'big words', but usually it doesn't. When somebody starts using fancy words in an effort to seem smart it usually had the opposite effect, and the reader will have the feeling that the complicated writing is hiding a lack of important information. Overcomplicated scientific writing is a relic of an elitist, bygone era.\n\nAs a small example, when using a word like 'utilize', stop and ask whether 'use' would have worked. In most cases, 'use' is the better word. \n\nWhen people say they're stuck trying to communicate something in writing, I ask what it is they're trying to say and they can usually say it to me simply, eloquently and clearly off the top of their head. Just do that, but in writing. It's that simple.",

          "text": "Your examples do not illustrate active versus passive voice, but they do illustrate the importance of using simple descriptive verbs focused on action versus using helper or state of being verbs (which tend not to add meaning to a sentence other than grammatical meaning).  \n\nActive and passive voice constructions refer to whether a sentence construction puts an entity capable of being an agent in the main subject positon versus using an inanimate object (usually to conceal agency of the actual agent).  Both the original and your revised sentence use an active voice construction: \"Scientists are...\" versus \"scientists identify....\" Identify is better because it carries both grammatical and semantic meaning.  \n\nFor example:\n\nI broke the vase (active: I is the main subject noun and is a person capable of breaking something).\n\nThe vase was broken (passive: vases do not break themselves, eh? This construction conceals who broke the vase, to escape blame perhaps.)\n\nMany sciences prefer passive voice to describe experiments to give scientific writing the appearance of being unbiased by human action (e.g. A regression analysis was run to determine...).  \n\nOf course, there is an even better option that sidesteps this whole debate entirely which is to put the most important information in the main subject and verb:\n\nIdentifying flaws in weather models improves forecasts enabling officials to make critical evacuation decisions earlier during adverse weather events. \n\nI also removed or slimmed down a bunch of extra clutter in the sentence - which is my favorite tip for improving academic writing - get rid of the words that don't add meaning to a sentence:)",

IMO it's important to consider *why* the feedback was given, so that you can do it better next time.",

Pay attention to how writers in your field write introductions/conclusions, how they integrate evidence, where and how they refer to sources, how they transition between ideas, stylistic choices like 1st versus 3rd person, active versus passive voice (and where and how these constructions are used), etc.  What seems pretty universal in writing in your field? What aspects show variation in style and what is the range of variation?  Then imitate and practice.  Can you write an intro. that uses the same strategy as your favorite writer in your field? Then try a different strategy, then combine them, and so on. This will help you be more conscious of your writerly choices and the allowable range of expression for your own discipline.\n\nEdit: also, no one writes a good first draft out of the gate, so relax and be nice to yourself.  In my field, we have a saying: \"writing is revision.\"  A shitty first draft is ok, desirable even (I  am stealing the phrase shitty first draft from writer Anne LaMott  who says that the shitty first draft is what leads to brilliant 3rd drafts:)",
