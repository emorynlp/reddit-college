      "text": "> Does everyone actually contribute equally while writing the paper?\n\nNo, of course not.  This is a really inefficient way to write papers.  It's quite typical that one person does the vast majority of the writing, with the other authors providing advice, contributing text related to their own expertise, or editing/proofreading.  The other authors are usually there because they've been involved in the research work that is being described in the paper.  You can find examples of authorship requirements by searching online.  \n\n\nAs to your title question: \n\nAsking someone to explain their \"contribution\" comes across a bit hostile - it has overtones of forcing them to defend their contribution, so you can judge whether it was valuable.  This kind of language is typical when people are being evaluated, and if you're inexperienced enough in this area that you're asking this question on reddit, you're probably not in a position to evaluate people.  If you want to ask this question in a more appropriate way, I'd recommend asking how they got involved in the work, and which parts of the project they worked on most.",

It can also be that they contributed a specific part and then did not pay much attention to the rest. Sometimes they just forget.\n\nI am on papers that I contributed something very important to early on, like a set of model runs or something, and then ignored for the rest of the project.

How is \"what is your contribution\" any different than \"what part in the project did you work on\". The meaning is the same, and the difference in wording is to just smooth one's ego. Papers literally use the word \"contribution\" when stating cofirst authors, so are they being aggressive and should I be offended by them? \n\nIt's always the people who knows that they don't deserve to be in a certain position that then get offended when they are being asked or challenged. If anyone ask why I deserve to be first author, you bet I can talk for hours about why. Do I get defensive about it? No. Not at all. Because I don't have anything to hide. When I asked why my cofirst author is sharing the title with me despite me doing majority of the work, and they get defensive about it rather than stating their position, then that's honestly their own insecurity. If they are happy going around taking credit for the work of other people, then that's on them. \n\nThat being said, most people have enough self awareness to answer that question honestly. Most of my experiences, including myself, have been \"I did this one assay/service/item and I'm happy that they put me on\". It's the ones who don't that then make it a huge problem, like you have just doubted their entire existence or something.",
