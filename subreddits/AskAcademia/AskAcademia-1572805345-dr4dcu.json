To me, that point, especially in terms of challenging Science's frequently unstated philosophy of teleology, is a point worth musing on, and one I would plead to you, that makes his book worth giving another go.",

                      "text": "So I'm going to say off the bat I am in favor of feminist and intersectional approaches in science, and I think Kuhn's book can contribute to thinking about it, which is why I say it's worth reading.\n\nKuhn's book is interesting philosophically because the implications of \"past forms of knowledge\" moves beyond science, but also towards philosophies in general, including more activist forms of critical theory.\n\nFor example, within progressive theoretical circles, there is a conflict between second-wave feminists and LGBTQ+ theorists, over the role of patriarchy in male to female transitions.  \n\nFeminist thinking from the 1970s rightly raises the issue of patriarchy as a form of the exploitation of the bodies of women by the men in power.\n\nHowever, gender theory now raises the issue of the power imposed by conservative societies over the control of what counts as \"normal\" sexuality.\n\nThis becomes a problem when the two philosophies clash over whether there is inherent patriarchy involved in someone who is a male-to-female transition.  Second-wave feminists argue that the person was still born male, and so benefitted from patriarchal power.  Queer theorists argue that this is patently transphobic and intersectionalists point out the fact that second wave feminists tend to be predominantly white women highlights a secondary racist and economic class division beyond patriarchy.\n\nFor an interesting illustration of this problem, check out the debate over the Michigan Womyn's Musical Festival, over whether male-to-female transitions should be allowed.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Womyn%27s_Music_Festival\n\nI'm not suggesting any answers, but I raise the example because it is illustrative of the point Kuhn is trying to make: what do we do about past forms of thinking that were valid in their time, but aren't now?  Is the denigration of the past inherent, or only stylistic?\n\nEDIT: And to make the analogy clear, in this particular situation, 2nd-wave Feminism is the \"past form of knowledge\" and LGBTQ+ and intersectionalism is the \"current form of knowledge.\"\n\nHis raising of the point (independent of any easy answers) is why I recommend you take a second look.",

The event was built, staffed, run, and attended exclusively by women; with girls, boys and toddlers permitted.Michfest's stated policy of admitting only \"womyn-born womyn\" and excluding transgender women led LGBT advocacy group Equality Michigan to boycott the event in 2014 and drew criticism from the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the National LGBTQ Task Force.
