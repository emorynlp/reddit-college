  "title:": "How do I turn down a research offer from a professor I contacted?",
  "text": "Earlier this month I reached out to 6 professors about potential research opportunities in their labs this year and after speaking with 2 of them( let\u2019s say profs A and B) I decided I wanted to work in prof B\u2019s lab. His work just interests me more, but prof A has also offered me a position this fall. How do I decline it politely and humbly especially since I reached out and talked about how interesting his work is (it really is, I just feel B\u2019s is a better fit for me)?",

      "text": "You can more or less say what you said here: that you were in the fortunate position of having multiple offers to work in research labs and while you were very interested in the work that Prof A does, the other lab felt like the best fit for you. Most likely, they won't think too much of it--they might feel mildly disappointed, but I don't think you're likely to experience anyone's wrath, have them bad-mouth you to colleagues, or anything like that. (And in the unlikely event that that happens, that's their fault.)",

I got in contact with a pretty well known dermatology professor who offered me a list of projects to do. None of the project was what I wanted to do (all were related to AI and dermatological cancer). So I apologized to her and stated where my interest truly lies. She said ok and wished me all the best. Simple as that.\n\nTo be honest, I will be more glad learning that a student is uninterested rather than having them start a project and ruin it because of lack of motivation.",
