  "title:": "How do you manage your literature and references?",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have many PDFs (articles, reports and other literature) in various folders, and most of them are also in Endnote, which I have always used as a reference manager. However, the references in Endnote are not linked to the PDFs (most of the references were downloaded from journals' pages, but Endnote can find the PDFs for only \\~30% of the references I have in there) and I do not have any 'tag' for the papers. My plan to fix and have a more organized library is the following:\n\n* Re-download references directly from journals (hoping that Endnote this time might find the PDFs for these)\n* Link remaining PDFs manually, putting all PDFs (including the ones from the point above) in one folder\n* Link PDFs to NVivo, so to add different tags to the same article and to search more easily through the literature\n\nHowever, this manual process seems to me very slow and easily prone to mistakes. Therefore, a few questions:\n\n1. Can this process be automated somehow? Looking into the future, how do you go with downloading individual PDF and references and keeping the literature tidy?\n2. Are there other options for having all PDFs in one folder (possibly with file names corresponding to \"author year title\"), linked to a reference management software (Mendeley, Endnote, or Zotero?), linked to NVivo?\n3. More in general, **how do you manage your literature?**\n\nThank you!",

Why did no one ever tell me?! It parses all info with the browser plugin, throws it into your pre-specified folder, including doi and the PDF. No manual work required, except possibly fix an all-caps name here and there. I'm thoroughly sold on it.",

              "text": "Zotero is like a resource manager, you can install it as a plug-in on your laptop or pc. Once ran, depending on browser, such as chrome, there is a \u201cZ\u201d bookmark tab. Every website and journal that you have full access to can be saved into Zotero. You can organize them into specific folders to group together journal papers. You can then generate bibliography for each of them automatically according to whatever citation style you need. There are editable entries where you can make notes about the folder or the journal you found. Whenever you need a certain journal, you can easily search for it within zotero, and zotero will pull up pdf version of the journal (so long as you have full access to these journals)",

It works well enough for me, but I doubt it would be legible to anyone else. If a paper has been sitting somewhere for longer than a couple weeks, often it's just easier to use the search function.",
