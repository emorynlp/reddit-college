Trump has made a number of comments about de-emphasizing clean energy and emission mandates. I think of all areas of research, that's the most sensitive to this election. \n\nAs for other areas of research, it's all a mystery. He hasn't elaborated on it much. Perhaps the only silver lining is that maybe DOD research funding would be salvaged? \n\nEdit: I have included some articles below, which include commentary and/or speculation about science funding.

          "text": "> Then you have a couple of years of post-doc. So even with a two term Trump, you would likely enter the world as an independent scientists under a different administration.\n\nIt's really, *really* important to caveat this with a note about what field of science in which OP may consider pursuing a PhD. A Trump Presidency threatens not just depressed funding levels, but a re-structuring and re-incentivizing of research prerogatives. For instance, it's not unlikely that the EPA is gutted or eliminated if Trump sticks with Myron Ebell to head the agency. He's made it very clear (and he has support from Lamar Smith and other House SSTC members) that NASA will be directed to focus their energy away from geoscience research, and ultimately be minimized to make room for commercial space industry. NOAA will almost certainly be directed to focus on weather in lieu of climate.\n\nWhat this means is that if you're an up-and-coming climate scientist, you could be in serious trouble. The next-generation observational platforms and measurement campaigns which would support your PhD, post-doc, and maybe even early-career research appointments may simply not happen. The pot of money will shrink, and competition will increase. That makes pivoting harder. A colleague of mine yesterday evening joked about applying, on a whim, for an open faculty position in our field at McGill. Then another did. Then another half dozen or so did. Turns out they weren't joking. \n\nBut there's still great opportunity, like /u/manova mentioned, for non-traditional research career paths. While the House SSTC members *hate* climate science, they **love** meteorology - so if you can pivot into a focus on weather and data, there's a ton of potential. And things could re-align quickly, so it may be worth the risk in jumping in and hoping for the best. But there's more risk than ever in pursuing a PhD and academic research career today.",
