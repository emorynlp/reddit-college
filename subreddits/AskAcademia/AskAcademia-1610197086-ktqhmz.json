  "title:": "I read everything out loud to understand a text. Should I stop doing this when starting a PhD?",
  "text": "The title sums up my question. I am now doing my second MA (the Research Master European Studies) and I am planning to apply for PhDs afterwards - either in humanities or social sciences. Ever since I'm a child I could only understand texts if I read them out loud. Only when I would be super interested, I could occasionally fall into some kind of \"trance\" and forget that I was no longer reading out loud. But this happens like 5% of the cases.\n\nI have tried to study differently by fast-reading several times throughout my academic career because I envied my friends who read an academic paper sometimes 5x as fast as I do. But in the end, I would always retreat back to my old habit. I also enjoy it more than fast-reading as it makes me more confident that I understood what the text was about in a nutshell.\n\nKnowing actually nobody in academia who reads as I do, and knowing that I am actually planning to make reading my life career, I started to get insecure about whether I should keep my way of reading. So far, my grades are good and I generally receive positive feedback from my professors when I tell them I want to do a PhD. In other words, I so far managed academia pretty well by keeping my old habits alive. But I also know my study schedule will enter a wholly new level of intensity when starting a PhD, let alone when becoming a fulltime teacher. What do you think?",

      "text": "I have two suggestions: \n\n1. Do what works for you. If reading out loud helps you gain a deeper understanding of what you are reading, do it. It doesn\u2019t matter what other people do. Most other people also don\u2019t get PhDs, so you will already be in the minority. If it works, it works. Academic reading is necessarily different from and deeper than \u201cnormal\u201d reading anyway. Don\u2019t stress about it.\n\n2. As a convenience, you can still work on developing the ability to silently read deeply by reading out loud \u201cin your head.\u201d Think about the sounds of the words without speaking them out loud. Don\u2019t focus on speed, just focus on doing it internally (as most people do). I have a feeling it is something you will need to practice. But be aware that some people apparently just lack that internal voice, just as some lack the ability to internally visualize objects.",

This can quickly get expensive and out of hand, so I'm intentional about it.\n\nAt the time of my reply, none of the top responses had recommended getting assessed by a clinician or talking to a school's Disability/ Access Services. A few had mentioned ADD/ADHD.

      "text": "I'm a PhD student in the social sciences, and I read almost everything out loud. My suggestions are:\n\n1. When you apply for your PhD program or shortly after you are admitted, ask about graduate student work spaces. Your department may have a small office that you could use on your own or share with one other student. I had a small office space that I shared with another student for the first 2 years of my PhD. I came in early in the morning (7 am - 9 am) and on weekends to do the bulk of reading out loud.\n2. Now that it is COVID times, I do most of my work from home. This works well for reading out loud.\n3. Reading out loud definitely takes more time than not, but I think you may end up doing better than your peers in terms of comprehension. You may realize that you do not need to read every word of each article that you read. For example, I am currently working on a systematic review of literature with my advisor, and, for that paper, I have read more than 150 studies. For this project, my advisor and I decided that I could skip the discussion sections of most of the articles. Have conversations with your advisor early on about the expectations for your reading load and schedule out your time.\n4. Reading for classes can take up a lot of time. You may not need to read every page of the assigned reading. At the beginning of the semester, think about what you want to get out of the class, and read assigned textbook chapters and articles that relate to that. I would say I did 95% of the reading for my classes in my first year, 80% in my second, and 60% in my third, and still managed to have all A's and A+'s. The later years of your PhD, you want to focus more of your reading and writing time on manuscripts/publications and milestones (comprehensive exams and dissertation), and less time on reading for coursework.\n\nEvery program and department is different, but I hope this helps! And, definitely apply! You'll be great.",

      "text": "I have a friend who i think is a great academic who had a lot of trouble reading, and just wanted to share about that \n\nIt might not be relevant to you, and navigating something like doing PhD and becoming a great researcher or whatever you want, is such a personal mission that you have to find what works for you. \n\nI just wanted to share that he used to always come to me and go \"ah, damn i don't know how you read this, why can't i ever read like that, it takes me 10 times that amount of time\" etc. \n\nThen one day when we met for coffee he had told me he had begun some reading training program. I personally honestly don't know exactly what it was. I *honestly* at this point thought to myself \"lol don't you just read more dude?\". \n\nI'm *absolutely* no wonder or prodigy, but my mom put me in this book-club thing as a kid, and sat down with me every day for like a summer and the habit stuck, and succes-experiences in that little arena set me up with that. \n\nHe reads *way* better and faster than i do now. As in waaaay better. We're a nerdy pair of guys and so we often read scientific stuff together, that we have a shared interest in and he's just completely different about it now. \n\nThere's something about reading that becomes so intimate for us, that i think we become WAY too personal about it. Somehow we don't *want* it to be too trainable a skill. We want it to be kind of like, you \"acquire\" reading, and then you *have* it and you don't have to worry. It so doesn't work like that.  \n\nSo my point is this: Whatever you end up deciding is \"your way\"... Whether it's doing handstands while someone plays a flute close to your calf muscle, or you just sit normally at a computer screen - practice it. It works. Even if it's some combination of listening/reading try stuff out and practice it. \n\nAnd i don't mean practice it as in read more. \n\nMuch like running, again because of how *much* and how *automatically* we do this thing, we end up not improving much with each iteration. \n\nWhat we need for  improvement is SERIOUS, ATTENTIVE, FOCUSED, GOAL-DIRECTED, practice. I can't stress this enough. You need sit down with it and have real thought about what's happening and not be in \"the comfort zone\" but putting conscious effort to individual parts of the action.  \n\n\nSometimes we might even need someone else, like i would definitely benefit from having a running coach run around with me for a few hours and give me pointers.\n\nThat's all man. Good luck with the PhD, you're gonna wreck it.",

      "text": "For me at least, I think it depends on what your reading for. If you're doing dissertation research, reading for a candidacy exam, or general academic reading, it isn't so important to fully understand what the author is saying just what the general thrust of their argument is and how it fits into the contours of various other arguments. You can always go back and re-read (and I do read aloud for really complex stuff) when you're actively using a text when writing or when you just don't get it.\n\nYou don't need to fully understand every argument, just be aware of generally what they are saying and how it fits into the field. \n\nI really like the SQ3R method.

Many of us students have different learning styles, I silently read and make notes, my classmate skim reads and learns through conversation in class and another listens to a text reader and creates mock presentations. \n\nThere are certain things you may need to change in order to help organize an increased workload but you cant change how you learn. And considering the mental strain you will be under, I would suggest not trying and redirecting your efforts into streaming the system you already have.",
