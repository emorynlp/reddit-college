  "title:": "I feel horrible for rejecting a paper that I was refereeing",
  "text": "Title says it all.\n\nIt was my first time being asked to referee a paper. Reading the paper for the first time, it was clear that the paper was not up to the standard of the journal they were submitting to (not enough new stuff, a bunch of claims that were more like hunches, missing a lot of important points, etc etc). I wrote my report and recommended a rejection.\n\nThe editor of the journal told them to resubmit with changes and half a year goes by and I saw the changes they made along with their response letter. The authors was very professional about the criticism from the referees and they had clearly put in a lot of work to get some extra results and make some changes. I would say the quality of the paper (in terms of writing, additional results, clarity) improved a lot.\n\nHowever, I still felt that there were a bunch of stuff that were not addressed and things that were missing. After taking some time to think about it, I put my hand on my heart and decided that I had to recommend a second rejection, despite the amount of changes that was made (which looked like it took a ton of effort). \n\nAs I typed out and submitted the report, I just felt horrible cause I was reminded of being in that position myself and about how crushing such a situation was.",

It's probably terrible for someone's effort at curating a prestigious journal/conference, but venues with <10% acceptance rates benefit nobody but careerist jerks and very very few papers are actively bad (wildly unsupported claims, indefensible design, etc.). Point is, if a paper is legible and a reasonable swing at science I really don't think it's my place to decide what gets published. People may disagree with me, but if there's even a shadow of a doubt as to whether a paper should be accepted or rejected, I lean towards accept and let citations/impact/the world decide if the paper's good or not.",
