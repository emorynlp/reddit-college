  "title:": "Professor Refuses to Sign My Internship Papers. What should I do?",
  "text": "Sorry, English is not my first language.\n\nHi. Before anything, I am an undergraduate student who wants to become a professor myself. Due to COVID-19, not many internship positions were left and our university allowed students to be an intern by working with their professors. I agreed to do a mini-research with one of my professors. The research topic was about molecular biology for some reason and I'm an aerospace engineer. I had no place to refuse because of the coronavirus. The agreed working days were 20 and I spent more than 40 days on it. I made a very detailed report on it on Overleaf by using LaTeX. I explained every single detail. I sent the link but got no replies. I was getting impatient but I didn't want to disturb him. About a week later I decided to fill out an internship form that our university requires and send the form to him so that I can secretly check back on the report that I sent previously. In this form, you have to explain what you did that day and get the signature of a supervisor. It started so long ago that I couldn't remember what I did exactly and I did a sloppy job of filling out the form. That's my bad, I understand that. The reason why I did this is that I thought the form just as a formality and the true work I did was proven in my research report. Moreover, there is quite a lot of time until the form's deadline---two months as of now. My professor sent an angry email. He said that he would expect more from a university student and would not sign the form under any condition. He said to me that he was busy and I should never contact him again. I find this extreme and I'm not exaggerating his responses too. That's what he said verbatim. It turns out he never opened my research report according to Overleaf.\n\nI feel terrible and almost cried because I spent day and night on this project that had nothing to with my major for more than a month that was supposed to take 20 days. I practically wasted my summer. Should I contact the university or do you think that this is my mistake and I should learn something from it?",

My university requires internship before geaduation and was forced into this type of situation. For the first time, they allowed professors to take interns. That's why I hesitated to question the subject at hand. Why is he so interested in drug release in tissues? Beats me.",

              "text": "Hey! \n\nApologies on my part. Those previous, now deleted responses were very pointed, and I just assumed that they were from the OP without checking.\n\nYour situation sounds very precarious, and I understand your desire to play this as neutral as possible. The sad reality is that Academia can be a very political, very unfair industry, so you do not want to rub people the wrong way. Especially if this is the University where you want to work one day.\n\nI still don't understand what the internship agreement was, and why you were not competing something in your field. Internships need to be documented in Universities, and it seems crazy that someone in aerospace engineering would have something to research in microbiology.\n\nYou obviously would have completed courses in this faculty (where this professor works.) Do you have a professor in that faculty with whom you have taken a few classes? At this point, because the situation seems to complicated to advise on without all the details, I would say that it might be a good idea to make an appointment with a professor who knows you and likes you and understands how you think, and works in the same faculty.\n\nApproach the situation like you think a misunderstanding took place, and you don't understand what happened and what went wrong. But make sure that you do this with someone who will understand that you are only doing this as a means of self-improvement, and you are just looking not to make the same mistake in the future. \n\nDon't come at this like you are filing a complaint about anyone. Just that you want an insider's opinion about where things went offrail.\n\nI hope you figure out what happened. I'm happy to talk to you about this further if you want to message me.\n\nGood luck!",

For example, I was already working on ODE solutions when he sent me the fourth email requesting a literature review. However, his tone seems angry in a way too. In that regard, you make a very good point. I never realized it but I suppose he was upset with my work for some time now. Although, like I said original text is a lot calmer than the direct translation. For example, \"Summarize it\" is definitely a wrong translation, but I didn't tinker with the translation because I didn't want to alter it into my point of view.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

Just remember to stay calm and don't get upset. I am not sure how Turkish universities work, but here in New Zealand I would go to the head of the department. So if it is the science faculty then every subject should have a HOD. Reach out to them with your concerns and be careful not to lay any blame.

If anything I assume you did a literature review and wrote an \u201cintroduction\u201d describing the project. \n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming you were going to put this as an internship on your CV and flaunt it like it was a summer internship? \n\nAdditionally, if you spent day and night, you should clearly be able to describe an average days work. There shouldn\u2019t have been a sloppy form sent. However, this still doesn\u2019t warrant the professors behavior. \n\nSorry for being skeptical.

My University requires internships for graduation and they had to allow professors to take interns for the first time because of that reason. I searched for articles that had similar solutions and search concepts that the papers introduced in textbooks/articles. Finally, I labeled the problem and went on to learn a simple method to solve it.\n\nThe problem was there weren't many similar articles so I had to search for other subjects but similar solutions and see if they fit the bill.\n\nThis is not actually internship I'm aware of that but that's what the school had to do.\n\nSpending day and night is exaggerated. I'm sorry about that.

Don\u2019t work so damn hard on something you aren\u2019t getting paid for or aren\u2019t getting paid much for. In my internships I had no pay but was given very clear instruction of what to do and was in constant contact with the research heads. I also would never have worked \u201cday and night\u201d as you said just for an internship, and certainly never for double the time allotted. \n\nAlso I do not believe you are discussing everything truthfully or fully because what you have described would be considered a scam- no self-respecting university would want that sort of label. If somehow this is accurately stated then make that professor\u2019s life very difficult by discussing with his supervisor. If you can prove that you did indeed have some form of contract and had done what was asked then you can make a great case for yourself.

      "text": "Oh man I'm having trouble with the internship supervisor too and she doesn't fill the required forms although the internship is a shitty one but I had to take the opportunity since it is covid-19. She does not respond to my emails i don't know why everyone is being shitty these days. I had bad days that made me cry but crying doesn't solve anything. I just decided to do an intersting project related to the internship that might benefit me. Now all what I think about is finishing the internship to get the credit for my program. My internship director says you should choose something intersts you and don't do it because you just need to do it. Well he might be from mars because if he lives with us on earth he would know how hard to find intersting internships these days. I would say just talk to your internship director about the forms and he might contact that professor to sign it for you. If you can get another internship in the future it would be better. Good luck and stay strong",
