  "text": "Hi all!\nThe title might sound stupid but it is what I exactly feel right now. Please delete if it\u2019s not an appropriate post.\nI realised that because of a break during my studies(bad mental heath issues), I lost a lot of opportunities. And then the pandemic hit when I was supposed to start my PhD and left me in a huge mess. Cut to 6+ months later where I still don\u2019t have any position despite applying for every academic position I\u2019m interested in.\nNow I want to completely focus on preparing for jobs as a Data Scientist(preferably in my field) by starting a little from scratch and prepare for another 6 months.\n\nWould the gaps in my profile affect my applications? How was your experiences, if any? Any advice maybe? \nThanks!",

If someone appears to just be coasting or skipping from school to school or job to job\u2026ehhh. But usually people will openly disclose the issue.

Be open and honest and let the people interviewing you know how you are taking  steps towards \"fixing\" the problem. Don't feel like you have messed up your academic life. This pandemic has screwed with everyone. I'll be suprised if a substantial amount of people won't have gaps on their resumes.",
