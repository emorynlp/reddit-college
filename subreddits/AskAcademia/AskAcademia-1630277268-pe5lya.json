  "text": "I am applying for a predoctoral fellowship with NIH. I am including my journal articles, but have also written video scripts on a variety of scientific topics for a popular science communication TV show.\n\n**Is it relevant/acceptable to include them in \"My Bibliography\" and/or \"Contributions to Science\" for my NIH BioSketch?**\n\nI'd love input from anyone, and especially from people who have *written* or *evaluated* similar fellowship applications with NIH BioSketches.\n\nBio: Molecular and Cell Biology, 6th year PhD/MPH, USA",

      "text": "I asked my spouse, a successful F32 recipient. They say they think it could make sense to include a couple of the most impressive works in a subsection of Contributions to Science, with an explanation of how it reflects or highlights qualities you possess as a researcher. If you do include, it should go towards selling who you are *as a scientist/researcher*, which is what the institute will be deciding to fund or not.",

      "text": "Honestly, for the NIH, my inclination is to maybe mention this is your personal statement but I wouldn't write about it in the my bibliography or contributions to science sections. I think they are looking for more scientific (hard science) things. I don't see it helping. If it were the NSF, this would be very nice for broader impacts. I think it is unique and should be disclosed, but I think it frames your passion for communication science as a person more than your ability to perform and contribute to scientific progress.\n\nEdit: full disclosure, I had an F31 fellowship, submitted a F32 (scored but I chose not to resubmit as I had other funding), and currently have R series funding. Also, ask your advisor!!! They know your field. One warning... 6th year is really late to apply for a F31 fellowship (like you won't get funding for 6 months at best and reviewers will pick up on that).",
