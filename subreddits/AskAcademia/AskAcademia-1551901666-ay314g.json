  "title:": "Defending my PhD soon. I'm honestly terrified to leave academia.",
  "text": "I'm defending my PhD in May. I have decided that I do not want to do a postdoc then attempt to get a faculty position. I believe I could be a good academic, but I don't want the early-career instability of an academic career.  \n\nI have a well-paying job lined up that, frankly, many of my peers are jealous of. The job is open to me specifically because I have a relevant PhD. Despite this, I am terrified of graduating. I find myself wanting to delay graduation or find a postdoc last minute, which I know is crazy. \n\nSome of the things that are worrying me:\n\n* **Reporting to a boss**: My advisor is really chill, and let's me work on what I want. I don't feel like I have a boss. I feel like I work for myself. I am scared of having to come in every day and report to someone.\n\n* **Lack of authority**: I feel like a well-respected member of my lab. I formally and informally mentor undergraduates and early graduate students. My advisor and collaborators respect my opinion, and I am treated as a regular scientist. I have earner this respect with hard work, and I am worried about again being the most junior researcher.\n\n* **No ownership of work**: I generally found my thesis work interesting. Even when it was not interesting, it was at least *my own work. I am having a hard time imagining working on something that is not my own. \n\n* **Inflexible Schedule**: I love being able to work from 11am - 9pm if I want. This is certainly not acceptable in industry.\n\n* **Anonymous Scientist**:  In academia, there is always the (remote) possibility of being the next Einstein, Newton, whatever. There is a shot at being a prestigious, well-known researcher. I feel like I'm giving this up to be some cog in a machine at a company.\n\nI'm sorry in advance. I'm sure this all comes off as entitled and naive. I just cannot shake off this nagging fear that I am setting myself up for a horrible career when I could be an academic scientist.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your kindness and support. I am starting to feel better.",

      "text": "There's a lot of undergrad tall tales about cubicle hell here. Have you ever worked outside academia?\n\n> I am scared of having to come in every day and report to someone.\n\nYour degree of autonomy will vary (although it usually increases with seniority), but reporting to someone doesn't have to mean that you have no freedom or that you have to come in every day. Surely, as a grad student, you also have deliverables that are beholden to your PI/the grant agency/whoever else is paying for your space and materials? It's kind of like that, more or less.\n\n> I am worried about again being the most junior researcher.\n\nThe same would happen if you moved to another lab or another university. \n\n> I am having a hard time imagining working on something that is not my own.\n\nThat one's fair.\n\n> This is certainly not acceptable in industry.\n\nWhy so sure? When I was working, that's what I did. Many jobs have flexible schedules today, particularly those that require a PhD. You're not going to be working at a coal mine. You won't have a punch card.\n\n> In academia, there is always the (remote) possibility of being the next Einstein, Newton, whatever\n\nI guess there's also the possibility that I'll lose 50 pounds and be discovered by Guillermo del Toro to star in his next auteur horror movie, but I'm not building my life around that.",

It might just be my experience but for me:\n\nI got to design the entire research infrastructure. I got to pick what tools we use and how they get rolled out. \n\nI get to mostly set the research agenda. I\u2019ll get questions for quick one off analyses sometimes but for the most part I\u2019m pursuing questions I want to investigate without the hassle of getting it published. Of course I have to sell it to the company but it\u2019s basically just like a more formal conference presentation. The other part of this is that no one really understands things we take for granted like x predicts y or significance testing. So, you get the benefits of teaching people how questions should be investigated according to your preferences. Confidence intervals for lyfe. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to be loved. This one is a little weird, but one thing that sticks out in retrospect is the amount of skills we learn in a PhD program relative to the pay off. Since everyone else in academia is  more or less equally skilled, no one gives a fuck. At my job, Producing graphs is magic to most people. One of the engineers I work with told the senior Vice President that I do magic. All I do is stats and graphs in R. \n\nNo one really cares if I arrive at an exact time or leave at an exact time. Occasionally I don\u2019t come in. Once I didn\u2019t want to go to work so I told my boss I was sick and was going to take a sick day. He told me to work from home. Later I told him I didn\u2019t do anything so I\u2019m just going to take the day (everything was on the up and up!) and he said \u201cyou do plenty of work\u201d and told me not to record it. \n\nHonestly, in the era of Trump it is super nice to not have to think about politics as a profession all the time AND be afforded the freedom I get in my job. \n\nIt may be that not all jobs are like this for phds, but I\u2019m totally comfortable where I am and never feel any of the (tremendous!!!) stress I felt in grad school or while teaching. \n\nEdit: I should add that I still get the space to learn something every day. Right now I\u2019m working on a project involving network analysis, which I didn\u2019t learn in graduate school. ",

I couldn't easily find a full-time job in my field after I graduated Sept. 2018 (mostly due to being restricted to a specific city that didn't really have that industry), so I started doing freelance work (cutting-edge comp sci stuff). Now:\n\n- I have clients instead of bosses. In some ways it's like reporting to a boss, because ultimately they define the work to be done, but for the most part I'm the expert who is telling them what needs to be done.\n\n- I have full authority over my work, because my clients have specifically hired me to be the expert who designs the project.\n\n- It is my work, and I'm the one who signs off on it before turning it over to the client. I don't own it (the intellectual property), but I am solely responsible for it. It is my work.\n\n- My schedule is whatever I want it to be. I charge by the hour, and those hours can be whenever I want. Outside of the occasional phone call, there are no restrictions.\n\n- I'm not going to be the next Einstein, but I've incorporated my own company and there is no limitation to how much I grow it. I'm 2 months in and already looking at my first few hires (with 100% ownership, no outside investors).\n\n- I'm making 3x the income that I would in a defense job, even with a PhD.\n\nObviously the job you have lined up is likely quite a bit different and this won't all be possible for you, but my point is (kind of like /u/thegreenaquarium said) that industry doesn't have to be cubicle hell. While a PhD is often seen as overqualified for a lot of industry jobs, it's a gold star when you're marketing yourself as an expert. Even if your new job turns out shitty, there are many opportunities out there with a lifestyle much more similar to grad school.",

For the first time since starting my bachelor's 10 years ago, I have to report to a boss and work 9-5 without being able to set my own schedule. I'm terrified. But, on the other hand, my boyfriend (MSc) works in a company since 5 years and he is very happy with the job. He at least doesn't work weekend or late evenings, has way better benefits than I had as a PhD and he doesn't define himself over his job (I definitely define myself as a PhD and academic until now). So, maybe it's mostly in my head.\n\nAnd on the other hand, I think, if in a year or so you want to go back to academia, it is still possible and you might even be able to sell your job experience as a unique selling point. That's at least what I keep telling myself ;) ",

      "text": "Sounds to me like you're on your way to be kind of a unicorn - a happy academic who doesn't have to wait out for anyone's death or retirement, whichever comes first, in order to get some job security.\n\nI work in my industry too, though I haven't finished my PhD yet. (Which has a lot to do with the fact that I started working in the industry while doing my PhD, because my grant was over before my research was, and I don't particularly like camping in the park.) I work with a friend from college, though, and the two of us are the whole team, so I can't answer some questions you have here. (Those about authority, reporting to someone else, not owning my work - we kinda just pull together to build something, and my only concern is to pull my weight, because things need to be done, and there are things I'm the one to do.)\n\nI can answer you this: the **one** thing I resent compared to my years working solely on my PhD is my schedule flexibility, and having to wake up early in the morning (I'm fiercely a night owl, I'm often useless before noon). I mean, of course it's not like a corporate job, there is actually a lot of flexibility in my hours, I can take some hours in the middle of the day if there's something I have to do, or somewhere I have to go, I can take days off with very little notice - but I still have to, you know, be careful not to push it into leaving the impression that I'm slacking. I miss being able to go to an exhibition, or a museum, or the library - whenever the idea crossed my mind.\n\nBut then again, it's a game of pros and cons. I work in the field I've trained in for the past 17 years, with a friend, it's not an impersonal work place at all. It's not completely aligned with my specific previous research interests, but it's in the field. The money's not great yet, but it will be, and nowhere in the field, including academia, would it be much more. It's got great potential to be a really long-term thing I can actually participate in building and growing.\n\nAnd yes, I do have unresolved longings for academia. I wish I had managed to align my performance with the circumstances, when opportunities arose. But it is what it is, and where I am now is not half bad. Aside from my early start inconvenience, the only real problem is I can't really focus on my personal work on the job, even when I could in good faith. You did a good thing, finishing your PhD first.\n\nI hope it works out wonderfully for you, and your peers have good reason to be jealous. :) Best of luck!",

What I can tell you is that my supervisor flip-flopped from academia to industry and back again. He made more money in industry which made sense when he had a young family, but he eventually came back to academia because he loved the freedom it provides. You should make the decision that makes the most sense for the next five-or-so years. If you go into industry to make some money, you can still make your way back into academia AND you might enjoy it more than you do now after seeing the other side! My supervisor is not the only prof I know who spent some time in industry (I'm sure it must be common), and it doesn't commit you to never going back to academia.",
