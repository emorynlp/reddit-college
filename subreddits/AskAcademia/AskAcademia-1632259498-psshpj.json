  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently in my final year of grad school (entering my 6th year, STEM, US). I have finished enough papers material for a thesis, but I haven't written any words yet. I am applying for the postdoc this year, however, I have been feeling sick and incapable of doing what I am doing for a while, and applying postdoc just because I am scared of pissing off my advisor. I have been trying to see what else I can do, but my coding experience is limited (took a couple of classes, had a bachelor's with a minor in CS). My Machine Learning and Data Science are zero, I mean I understand things and can repeat like a parrot, but I have no business intuition as well as my skills on building model on the computer is limited. I randomly applied to many internships and industry jobs with the hope that they can take me and give me a chance to learn on the job. I did get a couple of interviews but they all told me I don't have an internship or my research seems not fit into their needs, which I understand. \n\nI got a postdoc offer through connection, where I will be doing 100% things different from what I am doing or my background. I am feeling super demotivated in it now, as hardly feel I can pick up and learn and perform well to get further into my academic career (I don't have any collaborations that could help me push out more paper in a postdoc, most of my works were done alone, hence I assume going into this postdoc, I will not have time to do any of my background research). I feel like I do not want to do this, but super hesitant to say no.\n\nThere is one science consulting company that has an interest in me, mainly through connection (they believe in a Professor that I have a close connection with in the past), and expressed interest in hiring me. However, the works seem super hard as it varies on many different topics, each requires complete active research on them. I would say it is not harder than my research, but given the state of my mind and how not confident and burnt out I am, I am super scared of being fired on the job and messed up even further (I am on a student visa). \n\nOverall, I just wake up every day feeling like a waste, as no matter what I pick among these too, I see 95% of failure and my life is rather wasteful. I feel okay about teaching, not super up-to-date with all the trends of active teaching or fancy method in education to be a hot hire for a teaching position. I have been thinking about going back home where I am from, but finding a job with decent pay is even harder, as I lost touch with pretty much everyone there, and the pressure of \"Oh look at A, he has a Ph.D. in the US, and now he is so terrible, he must be a fraud, blah blah\". I can be okay hearing those, but my parents probably gonna be suffering terribly, and I don't want that.",

Writing that thesis can be cracked with an outline and some dedication.\n\nBut trust me, what you need is a long deep breath and probably some good food and then a plan to crack on. You are doing good, hang in there! :)",

      "text": "How is your relationship with your advisor? Apart from other services your university may offer - I think your statement that you are scared of pissing off your advisor may be worth inspecting critically. The majority of advisors do actually want their students to pursue fulfilling careers, and they will almost always appreciate clear communication from you on what you're struggling with. This transition period - either for a postdoc or industry - is a tough one, but they have seen it before, and giving advice is sort of what they're there for. If they're really not the person you want to talk to, try reaching out to some peers in person as well, or maybe some postdocs, if that makes the barriers lower.",
