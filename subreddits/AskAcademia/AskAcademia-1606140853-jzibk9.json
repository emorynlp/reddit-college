  "title:": "Thoughts on Mid-PhD life crisis/supervisory issues.",
  "text": "Long one...Sorry folks! I have two issues hanging over my head as a PhD student, and I know I\u2019m probably not alone. \n\nDo you ever feel like you\u2019re just not cut out for the Academia route mid-PhD but then freak out and wonder what this all means then? I am motivated by the research but disenfranchised by the politics and lack of job security. I\u2019ll never be the best in my field, nor do I think my current lack of balance/mental health is worth it. Has anybody had any experience with this, and perhaps gone a non-academic route post PhD that they\u2019re willing to share?\n\nTo make matters worse, I feel constantly at odds with my supervisory team. I feel like we communicate on two different planes (I\u2019m the sensitive and overly nice type, they\u2019re the direct and/or somewhat aggressive type/s). They question my progress and negatively skew a lot of our interactions (highlight what I do wrong, and not what I do right). Which is in turn hindering my progress more. Does anyone have any experience or advice (and no, I don\u2019t have the opportunity to change supervisors) on how to manage this? I\u2019m at the point where my meetings with them is causing me large amounts of stress. I\u2019m basically losing confidence by the minute in my abilities. If I successfully complete, I wonder how much this aspect of my PhD is impacting my overall negative attitude of Academia - I have heard of more positive experiences in external labs. \n\nI have a committee I will meet early next year to assess my progress and normally you would bring up these issues with them. But I am in such a niche field and I know my committee would know my supervisory team very well - I worry it might be bad taste to voice my concerns. \n\nThanks brains trust!",

I feel no motivation anymore, I am completely disenchanted with academia, and I feel like I\u2019m getting nowhere with my project.

I am also delving into daytrading stockmarkets and crypto daytrading. Mathematics and having a very analytic mind is very useful for that. My ultimate goal is financial freedom and be able to make big stacks behind my computer with daytrading for myself and me only. First gonna learn how in industry.\n\nI don\u2019t care about academia. Like I care about physics and mathematics but the professors and university environment is something that you don\u2019t want to stay in after PhD graduation. It\u2019s just toxic. I will always keep learning, by myself at home, science topics of my interests, like particle & astrophysics, I will delve into that for sure. You don\u2019t need those professors after you get your PhD.\nLiterally, yare an independent researcher. So keep that in mind and stay strong.",

COVID means that I haven't seen my advisor in person since last year and the people I spend time around for my day to day work in the lab are not enjoyable to work with or are really mediocre at what they do to the point it affects me.  Plus one of our lab techs is borderline abusive (although my PI has helped to resolve that a little bit).  Also the couple of grad students in my field at my university that I was friends with have all graduated as of last week.\n\nI'm switching labs next year and am going to see if I have a better situation there, but I'm seriously jealous of my friends that didn't go to grad school and am wondering if I will never find a job that makes me happy in academia.",

Add political \"turmoil\" (to put it lightly) to the pandemic and unforeseen and unprecedented work styles and expectations: we're all facing higher levels of stress and lower levels of motivation.\n\nNow add that to the fact that (anecdotally) the majority of people I know who earned their doctorate had periods of time in grad school where they retrospectively classified themselves in fairly serious bouts with depression and/or anxiety, and you've got a recipe for disaster.\n\nYou're not alone and you actually have more reason than me and my former colleagues did to feel the way you are, and we all felt that way too. Everyone's situation is different, and sometimes the best decision really is to leave academia, but know that we have mostly felt the same way as well.",

      "text": "Mid-PhD life crisis are common, I definitely had one during the later part of my PhD near write-up. I pushed through. I left my PhD being pretty sure that academia wasn't the path for me, sharing similar concerns to you, but also not liking the fact I'd transition out of the lab into a management role. I still wanted to do research on my topic (which had reached an exciting point in its history) and had a few last doubts and so decided to do a post-doc. Not the greatest financial decision, and that alone has aged me over the last 6 years.  I'm now just wrapping up that post-doc and got a dream job in industry. That door opened purely because of the work I published in my post-doc, so that alone makes it worth it. The post-doc didn't change my mind about academia in fact it reinforced it, I like wet lab work, I don't plan to spend the rest of my career writing grants. \n\nThe truth is, the bulk of people doing their PhD's don't stay in academia long-term, its not a failure - there's simply not enough jobs for the amount of people that want them and truthfully in the end it can be a thankless job. Most of the graduate students in our lab have no intention of continuing on academia - its far more common than you think.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel stress from the way your supervisors interact with you, I'll echo another person saying that they most likely are doing it for your benefit - constructive criticism can be hard to take. However, you should think about having a discussion about them about what you find helpful about their comments versus what you find harmful, to negotiate a healthier way to exchange their concerns with you. I did this early in my post-doc when I felt my supervisor was treating me more akin to a RA than a post-doc, having the discussion was positive for both of us and improved our relationship.",

      "text": "Coming from another sensitive person: the way to get through this is to harden up and stop giving a fuck.\n\nHowever, actually doing that is really difficult. I'm still in the process myself.\n\nMy recommended strategy:\n\n-Figure out what you want from them, and set your own agenda based on that. Show up to meetings with your own agenda items.\n\n-Realize that they will respect you more if you are confident and competent..\n\n-Respond to criticism by asking for specifics (i.e., putting the mental work back on them). They say \"you didn't write this paper correctly\", instead of feeling bad, say \"can you be more specific?\" And they say \"well, here's a laundry list of what's wrong\". Then you respond here by laying out your constraints, and saying \"what should I do, specifically, to address that?\". Then, if their solution doesn't work, say \"well, unfortunately, that raises the problem of xyz\", and keep pushing them to think of a better solution, where they lay out specifically what you should do, not what you shouldn't.\n\n A lot of times, people who criticize aren't seeing the full list of constraints. They see that there is a flaw, without realizing everything you've done or the actual cost of addressing it. So if you reveal the issue to them, then they contend with reality for a second. (Even if it's \"okay, so you want me to do this new project. This week, I'm also assigned to work on these other five projects. How would you like me to prioritize those?\", So they realize that you can't just drop everything and do this.)\n\nIt's possible they will have a solution, but a lot of times they won't. This either ends in them giving you a feasible solution (that you can do and then point back to in the future if it fails), or in them realizing that your solution is fine, or in them saying \"I don't know, figure it out\", and you realizing that they aren't as competent as they'd like to pretend. Also, if they do have a specific vision, having them spell it out for you helps avoid later issues.\n\n-don't assume that you're wrong just because people disagree with you or that you're worthless because they aren't kind. A lot of cruelty masks insecurity and incompetence. Also, a certain amount of narcissism helps academics succeed. Just because they're ahead of you doesn't mean that they're right, or better than you.",

          "text": "Yes, all of this! One of the things that may help you the most, OP, is to realize that your supervisor is not a god but a human being - and that, as two human beings, you can have a perfectly productive conversation in which you challenge his assertions and ask questions. All of the strategies here are excellent. Start with an agenda - I started bringing an agenda to all of my meetings with my supervisor probably after my first or second year. I still bring an agenda to my one-on-one meetings with my current manager in industry, and my most successful team members bring an agenda to their meetings with me.\n\nThe only change I'd make, though, is instead of asking your supervisor to suggest a solution, I would propose solutions yourself and get their feedback - or do a mix of the two. You don't want to get into a situation in which your supervisor feels like they always have to tell you what to do to fix things. I'd only ask for a solution if your supervisor is one of those folks who likes to poke holes in everything without proposing any kind of fixes.\n\nAcademia carries a lot of rejection with it (and quite frankly, so does working outside of academia, especially if you have any aspirations of leadership). Learning to carry yourself as a person who recognizes your own inherent self-worth goes a *long* way.",

Nothing is worse than a criticizer who offers nothing of value.\n\nAdditionally, it's always been helpful to me to make sure you share a vision of what you're about to do.

Or they could just be a miserable person with a negative outlook on everything. I have seen *both* happen - professors who were hard-asses and really did care about the progress of their students, but had no idea how to properly express that; and professors who didn't and used \"tough love\" as a way to abuse their students. I've seen both happen *at the same time*.\n\nEither way, though, let's be clear: this is bad supervision, even if they have the best of intentions. It is if course a supervisor's job to give students negative feedback so they can improve, but that is not the *only* job of a supervisor, and there are more and less successful ways to develop a student.",

      "text": "I had a major mid-PhD crisis (STEM). I was convinced that academia was not for me, though I loved research and wanted to do it for a living. I almost backed out of a dream post-doc towards the end, and only went because my supervisor flatly declared that they had taught me all they could and it was time to leave (we still have a great relationship). I went. I survived. I thrived. I still felt I didn't belong and didn't know if I was cut out for it. The politics was execrable. I just wanted to do research.  I got a job. Worried I was no good. I climbed the ranks at a world-famous US institution in what, I am assured, is record time, but to me feels glacial. Still worried I'm failing. \n\nIt's normal. It's ok. You are trying to do something hard. One of the hardest things to get used to in research is uncertainty. We embark on multi-year projects that have a medium/high chance of failure, and invest a huge amount of work in them. You'd be crazy not to worry. As a group leader, now I worry that I'm hanging other people's fates on my decisions, not just my own. Fun. \n\nCriticism in academia is often pointed and aims to find weaknesses in argument and evidence. That sometimes comes across as negative, or overly critical, especially to students. We aren't always the best at talking to the person behind the data, and consequently softening or contextualizing our comments. Some people seem never to have been adequately socialized, and they are really tone-deaf. I guarantee you that what you see is nothing compared to the level of criticism you will get as an independent scientist. People pull their punches with students (usually). Remember, they are talking to the data, not to you. Remember also that part of the task is to identify the limits of your knowledge, and that requires pushing and prodding. This isn't an excuse, it's an explanation. Of course we should do better.\n\nIt took me years to realize this level of engagement is a form of compliment, albeit a bizarre and back-handed one.  When people engage with your work, analyze it, prod at it, tear it apart and put it back together, they are taking it seriously. They are taking \\*you\\* seriously. When you get no feedback, just a shrug and an \"ok\", it is time to be discouraged. It usually means that the work in question is such a mess people don't even know where to begin. Or that giving feedback would take so much work they just don't want to do it. They just ... can't. \n\nI never thought I'd be like that, but I am now. I have limited time, and many obligations. I can't always un-fuck someone's stuff for them. It's not always my problem. I know if I start, I'll be volunteering to do something I don't have time for. So ... I shrug and say \"ok\" sometimes. And read my email.\n\nLike I said, it's ok. You should speak up for yourself if the feedback isn't useful. I would suggest you not complain that it's mean, or unhelpful. Ask more pointed questions about actionable items. Train your commenters into giving you feedback that you can use. Manage up, manage across, manage back. Manage.\n\n(sheesh, I'm in a very Beckett mood today. It's rainy and dreary here.)",

Thanks for sharing. \n\nJust to preface: I agree with a lot of your sentiments but felt it necessary to recognise that a few of your conclusions would benefit from more context. \n\nI completely understand this is not unique to me, hence my reason for posting here. I was also intentionally vague as I do not feel it appropriate to share a lot of contextual information. \n\nI do believe being direct is beneficial in a number of ways. But supervision, much like any leadership position, is best when you consider the interpersonal style of all of those involved. If someone benefits from being told where they went right, as well as where they went wrong. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of time or effort to do just that. Perhaps I need to learn to be more direct myself, it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be here if I wasn\u2019t trying, and despite never being the best at anything I don\u2019t just quit because of it. I use it as a a way to always keep me moving forward. But in a field where funding is really tight, I do think it is appropriate to consider whether I can remain competitive in my field. \n\nI am also aware there are a number of options available to me after my PhD. I was merely sharing my frustrations with academia in particular because of course for a lot of us that was a real ambition for us entering our PhDs. I think it\u2019s equally important to respect that it is a bitter pill to swallow for a lot of us that academia won\u2019t be for us and we can all process this in our own way. \n\nThe rest I won\u2019t comment on as I really feel such judgements need more context which I am not willing to give. But thank-you for sharing some insight into what it is like from the other side. All the best!",

The academic lifestyle didn't fit the way that I wanted to work or the kind of work I wanted to do. I ended up becoming a UX researcher for a tech company after graduation and have never been happier.\n\nThe type of management style you comment on is relatively common in academia (and outside of it, too, although perhaps to a lesser extent). What to do kind of depends on what you want out of this experience.\n\nDo you even *want* to finish your PhD anymore? Do you need to? Are you feeling like you're not really made for academia because of some soul-searching on your own part, or because of the constant stream of negative feedback that you're getting from your supervisors? When you really get down to it, do you want an academic job, or not? Because the easiest answer - if you don't want to work in academia and you don't need a PhD to do whatever alternative you would do - is to leave. It's not that easy, and often you need to go through a psychological process to emotionally detach yourself from the PhD and all that it meant for you. But it's good to know whether you actually want to leave or not, because if you do, then you can begin that process.\n\nWhy don't you have the opportunity to change supervisors? A lot of people think or believe that they don't, when really it's that they could not *without significant effort*. You can always change supervisors - the nuclear option is to just leave your program altogether and start over somewhere else. Your supervisor is not holding you hostage.\n\n**ETA**: Also, it's important to note that there are not fewer politics or necessarily more job security outside of academia. There's still a *lot* of politics working in industry. As long as you work with people, there will be politics. It's just different.",

I am not sure how you will be affected if things don't go accordingly, so be careful. Professors talk and I know this from experience,e so the idea here is to do what is best for you, which is to get your degree with as few obstacles as possible. If the committee brings up mental health or your interaction with the supervisory team during the meeting, you should indicate your concerns in a polite and non-confrontational manner. If there is a specific person on your committee with whom you have a better rapport, I would suggest you seek them out and speak to them one on one and see if they have some idea. Often advisors and professors find it easier to talk to in no-pressure situations as they don't want to speak negatively of one of their colleagues in front of other colleagues.\n\nThere was a Professor in our department who used to cut the hourly wage of his international Ph.D. students (he knew they won't retaliate like American or PR) if the work was not up to his expectations or if the students made mistakes such as grading errors etc. However, his students started speaking to other students, and over 2 years the word had reached other Professors and the department head, and ultimately this Professor was ultimately fired.\n\n**\u200b Here is my story**\n\nI got into my Ph.D. field due to various personal reasons that outweighed my academic interests in pursuing a Ph.D. Additionally, my master's advisor pursued and encouraged me to do the Ph.D., and I believed in my personal academic abilities.\n\nMy Advisor is nice and friendly, however, he lets me do my own thing which is not something I am very fond of. There is no structure or boss-employee dynamic. I receive little to no mentorship or advice, which makes most of my work completely based on my limited knowledge. To make things worse my advisor is also not very familiar with my area of research so I do not get that advice or guidance that you might get from an experienced mentor. And this area of research is something my advisor is deeply interested in getting into, so it is not something I brought up or dragged him into.\n\nI was frustrated with this aspect and I became aware that my work was substandard by attending conferences and seminars in my area. I realized the ability to grow in my field with my current advisor is limited. I further realized this while doing an internship in my area of research this fall.\n\nAnd for better or worse the COVID-19 situation has put most of our grants on hold and my funding is ending next semester. All this motivated me to give my prelims in November and I might end up graduating between May-August 2021. So it would mean I would complete my Ph.D. in less than 3 years. I sincerely wanted to stay and do more work at my advisor's lab but I am not sure how feasible that will be.\n\nAt this point I am assuming, the best-case scenario will be if I can get a full-time job or postdoc. I was expecting to grow and become better in my field during my Ph.D. but unfortunately, that did not happen and I feel I grew very little since receiving my master's.  I can't legitimately pursue academia with the few papers I have, so a postdoc might be good but I am sure the hiring folks will be skeptical about my Ph.D. too. So ya not an ideal situation all in all. Thanks for reading the ramble.",

      "text": "Hi Greensourgrapes\n\nHah, I think what you're going through is a pretty standard PhD experience. Midway through mine, I got a bad review meeting (kind of like a mid-way PhD defense, not sure if you do that outside of Australia), was totally overworked, burned out, and definitely not feeling on the level with my PhD colleagues.\n\nI think you need to keep a few things in your mind:\n\n**(i)** Nobody 'accidentally' falls into a PhD. It actually takes a fair amount of work, and a lot of resources for a university to keep you there, so your self doubt is more likely to be imposters syndrome.\n\n**(ii)** Your supervisors sound a lot like my own. Direct, maybe even a bit cold. But, having done a few journal reviews since having a 'bad' committee, I can tell you that committees, reviews, academic appraisals... they're all direct, no-nonsense, and even a bit adversarial. It's not them and it's not you, it's just a confronting process. If you really sucked, they wouldn't bother giving you feedback at all, they'd move on and invest their (very valuable) time on another student.\n\n**(iii)** Think about the big picture. Your PhD is more likely to approach a very narrow, specialized problem. That's the deal for all of us. Years of our lives to nudge a tiny \\*bump\\* at the frontiers of knowledge. But, what's the bigger stuff you're talking about? In its broadest sense, what does your PhD look at? We call it the 'pub test' here... if you had to tell a stranger in a pub what your research was really about, how would you do that? I think if you thought about it for a little bit, you'd find that your research was much more important, relatable, and applicable than you think... and that's coming from an anthropologist!\n\nStick in there GSG. Submit it and quit it.",

      "text": "Not a phd student (yet). Currently working as an RA. During the interview, I told the PI that I want to do a PhD (not neccessarily in his lab. In fact I am waiting for news from my masters advisor and also looking at other labs that does things more aligned with my interest).\n\nShe told me that she would be happy for me to work as an RA at her lab and maybe consider doing a phd with her (or someone else) afterwards.\n\nSounds great, but turns out, she's a very toxic person. Every meeting with her feels like a war. There is no trust and she constantly micromanages. Would always try to point out my mistakes. Even things like how I email, how I plan my experiments, how things are progressing slowly (with applications) due to covid. It is all my fault. She constantly brings up the fact that I wanna do a phd. Then says that if I want to do a phd, I need to work harder and therefore she is harsher on me. \n\nI thought it was my fault initially and believed what she said about me wanting to do a phd, until I started hearing negative things about her from people outside the lab and in other facilities. I now realised that many past postdocs have left abruptly because of her toxic nature. \n\nFortunately, a lab manager from another lab gave me the contact of a new PI just setting up his lab,and told me to leave as soon as my contract is up. I am now just looking forward to a formal interview with said PI and hopefully be able to finish up my contract in peace. \n\nI really wanted to work hard and gain as much as I can. But it's been getting way too tough as the days pass. I find myself caring less about the research, the lab. I even question myself, my capabilities. If I should even remain in academia or research at all.\nI am constantly exhausted and unhappy. \n\nSorry, I have no advice, I am too, trying to figure things out. But you're not alone on this.
