  "title:": "Maintaining motivation when redoing or starting over the coding process.",
  "text": "I completed half of my coding in about 2-3 months. During said coding process I have gone through a few rounds to check if its accurate. Of course, mistakes are bound to happen I understand that but recently i discovered that I have made a few more errors that went unoticed. I am halfway through and redoing the process is making me anxious because of the time it takes and fear of identifying new errors.\n\nI have spoken to my supervisor about this and she told me it is normal and that it is expected to do a few more rounds of coding. She also told me that it doesn\u2019t mean that my work is a total loss, and it\u2019s good that Im making the effort. \n\nI myself try to think that at least I\u2019m doing my best to be as accurate and honest as i can with my findings. I want to have the peace of mind knowing i did my best. Plus even the best researchers make errors and  have their errors published so I try to calm myself thinking that.\n\nHaving said that, I am having trouble with motivating myself and managing my anxiety to go through the process of correcting the errors. Of course, I still need to face this nevertheless. \n\nDo any of you have some tips on how to manage this or have been in similar situations?",

      "text": "At the beginning of this year I had to check and redo my entire set of codes because of errors and I spent close to a month in the redoing process. I don't have any words of advice on how to maintain motivation. But know that it's completely normal and that is also what my advisor told me. It's all a learning experience. Just don't try to rush through a lot of codes in one day. Take adequate rest after dealing with a satisfactory number of codes so that you don't make mistakes due to eye fatigue. And keep faith that everyone goes through this and it will come to an end.",
