  "text": "I just started a faculty position at a university in the UK. \n\nThe first week as an online training event with partnering organisations across EU. And tomorrow is going to be a faculty induction and the day after that the department induction. I understood this to be a sort of orientation (I think they gathered some food preferences etc)? But I am not sure what else to expect? Should I wear some nicer clothes? I have so much to sort out that I really haven't had time to think about that. I would prefer to make a positive first impression (and not under or over dress). \n\nAny sort of insight would be much appreciated!",

What would you wear to a conference?\n\nFor the first day I'd wear more or less what I'd wear on a normal day but perhaps a bit more 'dressy' but then I basically wear business casual on a day to day basis so wearing a suit (without a tie) isn't exactly onerous",

No need to be super smart but business casual is probably safe.",
