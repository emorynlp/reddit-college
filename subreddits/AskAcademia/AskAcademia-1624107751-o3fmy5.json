  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am have been working on a social science thesis (MA dissertation, 100p.) for a year now. And sadly, I could never focus on this topic given many factors. So far, I feel that I only have a decent draft proposal as well as various number of books regarding the topic. \n\nI recently took 2 weeks off to take care of family, but now I am facing the same problem again. The worst thing is the sensation of cluelessness, like when you kind of forgot how to jump back into the topic anymore.\n\nDid it happen to any of you, any advice on how to re-familiarize yourself with complex work again?\n\nGrateful for any advice, hope you are all doing well despite these bleak times.",

                      "text": "OK.\n\nWell, one thing that helped me get through may or may not be something that is not applicable to you.\n\nBasically, it was suggested to me that for the empirical portion of my thesis, I replicate an empirical study that had already been done (also in social sciences). So somebody had done a quantitative analysis in a book I had read of a fairly straightforward phenomenon.  This empirical analysis was related to the basic concepts I wanted to write about. And so I essentially copied/replicated/re-did that analysis, but using data that I collected. \n\nThis was helpful to me because I was having a hard time coming up with an original study that seemed meaningful. Once I got that figured out, I was basically able to collect the data, do the analysis, and then that provided a concrete thing to shape the rest of the paper around.\n\nUntil I had that empirical portion figured out, I was aimless -- I couldn't find the meaning/purpose behind what I was writing about (even though I had a general idea that I knew I wanted to write about). Some people might think I'm an idiot for not realizing I needed the empirical part figured out to write the paper, but my thinking at the time was kind of backwards -- I knew the point I wanted to make, but I didn't know how to actually do a feasible empirical study to support my argument. So finding a study that I could replicate made it easier to get past that mental block.\n\nThe other thing I'd suggest is that whenever you get stuck and feel like you don't know what to write, pick up one of the books or articles that is especially important to your research and start re-reading it -- especially, re-read the piece that closely relates to whatever it is you're supposed to be writing about at the time.  So I found during the process that when I had some kind of \"writer's block,\" I would often solve this simply by going back to the writing by others who were writing about issues around my topic and just spending some time re-reading (not with a purpose to find some idea to cite, but just with the purpose of re-ingesting their words and getting my mind churning about the topic again).",

      "text": "I don't know how useful that advice would be, but my go-to way is a brute-force one. That is, choose an entry point in your literature (if you have been far from the subject for long enough, all entry points may feel equally vague) and start trying to understand at a level enough to explain it to somebody else. It helps to imagine that there will eventually be a student that you would have to explain all this to and you have to guess what questions they will ask. I have found that this helps because 1) you force yourself to not accept anything without some sort of justification, 2) you don't let yourself get lost in a never-ending descent in the literature because as soon as you hit some sort of a justification you can keep going. Finally, if you encounter questions that you cannot find an answer to after intense reading, write them down (these questions are usually highly non-trivial and they can often be worthy of a paragraph in a publication or even be the spark for a new project).\n\nOn a larger scale, writing a one-page document a week, summarizing what you have learnt, could also wrap up things quite nicely in your head and act as a future reference. (It will also provide some comfort as it is a testament of your progress).\n\nOn even a larger scale, in times of trouble, a quote a senior researcher told me in grad school comes to me \"Research is how to struggle efficiently\". \n\nI hope all this helps.",

I can\u00b4t say it for all social scientist, but in my opinion, social science is a bit different from STEM since most of the time once you go PhD you have basically locked yourself out of the private economy. You must focus on a path towards academic, which can be hard to do given the stressful workload. In addition, some aspects of social science can be a bit doom and gloom, so I imagine some of us would be rather depressed by their topic. Say you must focus on the study of workers exploitation in India, and that topic can really drag you down if you are too attached to it.",

      "text": "My first Ph.D. thesis draft (material science + manufacturing technology) was an absolute disaster. During the skype meeting (during 1st lockdown), my supervisors said; \"we've read your thesis, there are some interesting results, but it does not look like a Ph.D. thesis\". looking back now, they were absolutely right tearing it to pieces. It was overly bloated, lacked a logical structure, and contained a lot of completely irrelevant stuff that didn't advance my argument.\n\nIt was hard to comprehend at first because I had \"fun\" writing that crap. It took me a while to regain some confidence to get back to re-writing the entire thing. I was probably depressed, felt totally helpless, but I knew I had one more chance. The very least I can do was to give my absolute best. And thankfully, it had worked out.\n\nIn terms of getting back to writing, few things helped me enormously. The first was, unsurprisingly, LOOKING at other Ph.D. thesis's. Do not underestimate the importance of structure, especially in a long master's/PhD thesis. And it's not always obvious, as I once thought. It also helped me to improve my technical language skills which were lacking. As my supervisor used to say \" you write like you're having an informal coffee talk about your research\". \n\nSecondly, my supervisors gave me an online lecture to watch about Ph.D. writing styles. For a lot of scientific/engineering-based Ph.D.'s, we have this thing called a \"Paper Format Thesis structure\". It's a bit more compact, more to the point than your traditional Thesis structure, and splits individual bodies of work into individual chapters, that are presented in the format of a journal paper publication (of course they all have to be cohesive overall). This made writing a LOT easier because it split the work into individual chunks. Not sure if you can do this on a humanities thesis though.\n\nLastly, but not least, have a genuine passion for your project. But don't treat it as a\"hobby\" like I did. Treat it as work. Set yourself strict timetables. 4 hours in the morning, 4 hours at night. But make those 4 hours count. No music, no procrastination, etc. It'll be a pain at first, make no mistake about it. At least it was a pain for me. Getting back to work, re-writing an entire thesis just felt horrible, especially when I thought I'd never been good enough. But I got there partially through brute force :P. You'll get used to the brute force, and then start to even enjoy it. But don't go looking for an easy fight, like a hobby or something. Achievements are built on sacrifice.",

I don't formally set minimums, but a couple paragraphs per day is good... Thursday I did three pages, so I was pretty pleased with myself!\n\n* wherever you stop, leave a note telling yourself THE VERY NEXT THING you were going to write - this can seem obvious when you stop, but usually isn't when you actually open the document up a day or two later\n\n* eat lunch\n\n* if I work after lunch (I have kids, so it's not always an option), I don't aim to do writing, but something else useful for the project - read an article or part of a monograph, look up stuff in the databases",

I just started in a social sciences PhD about three months back after a few years working and it's been a real mixed bag of experiences so far, even just in terms of finding my feet in study again.\n\nI fully get that feeling of struggling to get back into it even after a short break. Same, honestly. I def don't have a solution, but I've got two suggestions that helped me so far (and I wish I'd done during my MA tbh).\n\nFirst, if you have a good relationship with your supervisor talk to them before launching back into any sunstantive work. Like, a casual conversation. Not to talk about how you feel, but in my experience your sup is often (or hopefully) the person who makes you feel interested in the topic and even just a casual chat night help you feel re-grounded in the topic. If they're gonna get on your back don't do this ofc, but if they're the kind of person who makes you care about your topic it could help.\n\nThe other thing is to try and start (even if you're way in already) a solid note taking system. I use the zettelkasten thing that seems to be popular at the moment with Obsidian, and its been great. A lot of the literature on how to make it work is pretty science-based, but I'm doing a theory heavy sociology thesis and it works well for me, you just find how it works for you as you go.\n\nAlso remember what you're doing is real hard, let alone that you're clearly having to deal with a bunch of other shit as well. If it's getting to your mental health it's so much better to reach out sooner than later.",

If so, yes. I recommend reading Deep Work by Cal Newport. The book talks about how there are people that work in long time spans instead of working on multiple projects simultaneously in short bursts of time. \n\nDoing so lets my subconscious brain make sense of the things I've been working on. When I work on other papers, there are a lot of things that click with my thesis and when i come back to it, I always have more things to add. I also almost always come back with a refreshed perspective about my thesis.",

They arent helping  In particular tell the perfectionist to go F itself. The only perfect thesis is a finished thesis. All others are imperfect. Therefore if worrying about saying it correctly is stopping you, then the perfectionism is imperfect. (That should make it explode.)\n\n2. End each session with the question/s you *want to answer next time, not simply need. Write them down. Having questions keeps you thinking and when you learn the right level of question will drag you back..not too specific, not to broad. Go with a couple levels at first.\n\n3. Work in smaller bits. Stop working while you are sti interested. You wont come back if it is an unpleasant atmosphere. Make it a nice one.\n\n4. Use classical conditioning. Find an inspiring instrumental only song (I used theme from the movie Chariots of Fire). Play it at the start of every session and only then. 35 years later it still triggers a deep focus.\n\n5. Make it fun, interesting whenever and however possible....it is a puzzle to solve, a challenge to beat the reviewers, a fantasy...you have been called in by x group to save the world and it requires finding every spelling error in your paper. Whatever works for you. Make it reinforcing to work on it. May take a different mental set for each section.\n\n6. Be stubborn.
