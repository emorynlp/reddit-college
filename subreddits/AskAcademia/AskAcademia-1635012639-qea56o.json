  "title:": "How difficult is it to get into a decent humanities PhD programme?",
  "text": "I'm on the verge of applying for a PhD in English and am interested to get a sense of my odds. On paper, they seem pretty bleak to be honest. Most top 20, top 30 programmes seem to have a roughly 2-5% acceptance rate. However, is this really the full story? Presumably, a chunk of the applicants aren't really competitive in terms of their grades and experience, or haven't really got a strong fit between their interests and the specific programme. So, I imagine (and frankly am hoping!) that these numbers are a little misleading. Does anyone here work in admissions for such a programme and can give me a fuller picture? What would you say the odds are for a student with, say, a 3.7 or so GPA, publishing and conference experience and a good institutional fit? Thank you.",

      "text": "Not to dash your dreams, but the job market for humanities PhD is a hellhole right now, especially English. Before applying to programs, you should define your career goals and figure out what you want to do with your PhD once you finish. You don\u2019t want to end up with no job prospects once you\u2019re done, that is, if you plan to enter the tenure track job market. Also to add, grad school *can* be a miserable place and you honestly have to ask yourself whether you want to put yourself through this emotional torture. Many folks end up with mental health issues and debt.",

Whenever a student asks me about grad school, the first thing I do is launch into all the reasons not to do it (I got similar speeches as an undergrad but ignored them). Students often do not have a good grasp on just how much they will have to sacrifice for an academic career and it\u2019s better for them to find out before they\u2019ve sunk a lot of time and money into it than after. Academia and grad school are great for a very specific sort of person and absolutely horrible for everyone else.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply Semaforic. And for the warning. My professor where I'm doing a masters currently has mentioned the long hours, but their attitude has been very different - much more positive, even a bit complacent about (1) my ability to break into academia, and (2) the academic lifestyle. But then again, she has a vested interest. I've only just started the programme and could plausibly still drop out: telling me it's a fools gamble could mean one less student.\n\nHonestly, I'd be happy to do a PhD and then get a job doing something else. What I'm really looking for is to have 5 years or so doing a bit of teaching and then reading and writing a book - which in the humanities is essentially what a PhD is. Then, I'd be fine with cashing in my book contract, publishing and doing something else, just continuing to research as a hobby. \n\nI know this isn't what you commented here for, but since you're an English professor, I'd be interested to get your take on the whole odds thing. Here's a summary of my profile. Equivalent to 3.7ish GPA at British university. Have published 2 articles in peer-reviewed journals and done a conference presentation. Have good letters of recommendation and a good fit with the handful of schools I'm applying to. Based on that, is it plausible that I could get a place somewhere (I'm going for mid-tier schools). Or is the competition so stiff that with my profile, it doesn't even justify the application fee?",

A graduate degree and dissertation is a mix of obligations -- to yourself, your advisor, possibly a funder, and a body of knowledge. You're not the only vote on what you write. \n\nPublishing outside the academy is of course a thing. But editors need authors who \"make sense\" -- they have to explain to their bosses why this given author is reliable to publish a book whose sales exceed the money put into it...and exceeds the revenue another author under consideration might generate. In making that explanation, they'll hesitate over anyone without recognized expertise, recognition that comes with something like a PhD but, more commonly, with an existing audience.\n\nEither way, publishing is an assemblage of people beyond the writer, all needing buy-in to the idea that the writer's writing is worth the risk of putting money into that they could instead put into something else.\n\nSo: get a PhD if there's a good reason to do it besides the plan to write a book, or write independently if you see a way over years to build a publisher's confidence.",

                      "text": "In my field (history, not sure if its any different with English) the tenure clock is 7 years. Youre expected to have published your first book by then. I have known a few tenured and TT profs who've done it in less. A friend of mine had his book under contract before he even defended, and itll be about two years between graduation and publication. And thats with Covid! He also wrote nonstopped till he gave himself a breakdown, and now hes a stay-at-home dad who doesnt have to work full time and can focus 100% on his manuscripts and articles, when hes not looking after the little ones. Other profs of mine have done quick turn arounds, usually in the 4-5 year range. But most of our TT profs recently have barely squeaked in under the clock. So frequently has that publication been an issue that the department no longer considers book publication a must, it is good enough just to have the contract. As with my friend, a contract is still a year or two away from publication, and can even be signed before the manuscript itself is done! I would say about 50% of our recent tenure decisions here was done for profs with no published book. So thats 7 years from defense to tenure decision without the book. \n\nThis is all because your dissertation isn't a book. Its a dissertation. You write what you need to write to please your advisor and get yourself through committee. If you havn't done one its hard to understand what that means. A good committee and a smart advisor will push you really hard to make your dissertation book-like. But ultimately you have to use the materials you have on hand, you include sections to please committee members, and then they ask you to consider weird tangents or expand in detail upon specific concepts. Publishers want brevity and focus, and your peer reviewers will expect your research to be buttoned up tight. It can be a real ordeal to modify you dissertation, which if youre not smart can get *quite* lengthy, into the specific thing a publisher will actually want to contract. And of course the path from dissertation->book->thing someone wants to read, and then -> bestseller, is a fraught one indeed.",

It\u2019s not a money thing per se. It\u2019s no tenure track jobs. There is research and data on hiring trends and available positions online. The data paints a horrible picture. OP if you still want to do it after understanding the crisis in higher ed hiring, you should of course still pursue it. Just go in with your eyes open. Understand the risk.",

But I do also feel obligated to make sure they understand what they are signing up for and what they will need to give up if they really want a career in academia. If I feel they understand the risks and sacrifices and still want to do it, then I'm more than happy to support them.\n\nBut they need to know that the job market is not just bad but abysmal, and that they are likely never going to get a secure job in a university. They need to know that even if they can secure a job, they will need to give up any control over where they live, as there are dozens of jobs posted every year but thousands of applicants, and most jobs are in rural areas. They need to know that academia is changing rapidly, that tenure is disappearing (Georgia just voted to more or less dismantle it last week), that universities increasingly rely on poorly compensated contract labor for teaching, and that humanities programs in many universities are being cut or eliminated entirely. And they need to know that grad school can often be miserable, that it's five to seven years of living with no money, working long hours every single day, and often being treated poorly by the university and others in the profession because much of the culture in academia is downright toxic and admin sees you primarily as cheap labor.\n\nNot telling students and not being honest with them would be cruel. I've known too many grad students who didn't realize until several years into their program just how bad things are and how poor their prospects are. Many students lose their partner or spouse in the first couple years. I've seen two suicides and many more attempts. I've listened to many graduate students talk of how unhappy they are and of their regrets. There are limits to how supportive you should be of people's dreams.\n\nIf OP understands all that and still wants to go, then I wish them the best of luck and would refer them to my comment about what admissions committees tend to focus on. I heard all this when I was younger, still decided to go, and was supported the whole way. But there's a reason so many people in academia reflexively discourage people from going into it. For most people, going is a mistake, and most people will not realize this until it's far too late.",

They were so frustrated with the resulting job search and all of the toxicity in academia that they started looking into private high schools and highly ranked specialty high schools (think magnets and such) instead. Supposedly, the compensation and conditions were light years beyond what any university was willing to invest in a humanities faculty member. They currently seem to be really enjoying their lives and have more intellectual freedom than they ever would have expected in a high school. May be something to look into if the English PhD is something you are determined to do and that no one can talk you out of it.",

When grades do matter is only in the earliest stages when they are trying to cull as many applications as they can to make them more manageable. In order of importance for most humanities it's:\n\n\\- Writing sample (if published, all the better)\n\n\\- Letters of recommendation\n\n\\- Statement of purpose\n\n\\- GRE scores (usually only used to filter people out)\n\n\\- Grades (also used as a filter)\n\nYour chances do depend on other factors as well, such as whether the sort of research you're interested in is hot at the moment, or whether you happen to have connections with people in the program via one of your letter writers or via conferencing.   \n\n\nThe numbers I suspect are entirely accurate. I know in my field the top programs get hundreds of applicants every year and accept maybe 5 - 10, and we're one of the healthier of the humanities. Generally I think determining the odds is all but impossible. There are too many factors to account for. You just need to apply to a bunch of schools and hope that one or two of them accept you.",

That really is a massive achievement. \n\nRegarding US, I'm applying to a handful of institutions, most mid-tier and then a few aspirational ones. Best play I'm applying is Yale, which I recognise is a very long shot, but I have an eerily strong fit with the department and some specific supervisors I want to work with there so thought it was worth a crack.

My proposal was very good but that\u2019s only because a lot of different potential supervisors had looked at drafts. \n\nI think you can get by with a 68 with a good dissertation grade.
