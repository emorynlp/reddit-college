  "text": "If you could pick again would you choose going for a doctorate or pursuing a corporate career? Please share your field as well and if you would like, the reasons for your choice. \n\nI am in Marketing and have an offer to continue in my job or start working as a research associate at a University. This would mean a paycut and I am wondering if it would pay off in the long run.\n\nP.S. - I am asking only because I love both and am passionate about my work AND my research. Which is why it is hard to choose.",

      "text": "I would say it depends on your goals. Unless you have a PhD it's very difficult to get promoted in academia outside of administrative positions. Some labs may hire lab techs and the like but that's a very small number if jobs with no/little promotion track. \n\nIn my field at least (environmental science/engineering), private sector jobs are by far better paying than any possible academic career, especially if you can code/do data analysis. For example, my wife, in a similar field, earns about 50% more than what a tenure track assistant professor at the better paying public R1s make and received bonuses and other benefits (both starting salaries).\n\nThat said, I chose to stay in academia after some agonizing consideration. My personal values and end goals are most aligned with this path, with public sector being a close second. Kinda chose to split the difference in the end and did a postdoc-like fellowship with the US federal government to learn new skills/expose myself to policy side. Much better paying than a postdoc and not ultra tied to an academic career path (the faculty job market is not great)",

      "text": "I worked in marketing before beginning an unrelated PhD. I derive a lot more satisfaction from academic work and I don't regret it for a second, even if I had to take a pay cut for a while. I also figure I can go back to the former if I need to. \n\nIf you're equally satisfied by both that makes the decision harder. In that case I'd assess the pros and cons beyond the actual work itself: work/life balance, location, opportunities for travel, colleagues and working environment, where you could get to in ten years, etc. If one comes out on top, choose it. Academia is a lot more competitive and unstable, so if you don't love it a lot more than your corporate job I'd think twice about going all in on it.",
