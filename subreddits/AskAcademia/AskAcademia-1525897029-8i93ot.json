  "text": "Academia is for the rich. This isn't to say you can't succeed no matter your income level or class background, but you'll still face dismal grant funding rates, endless postdocs, and soft money or adjunct positions. If you don't need the money, these hardships are easier to bear. Trying to pursue a successful research career from a poor or even middle class background is a feat, and can often end in wasting years of your working years with nothing to show for it.\n\nIf you look around, you'll notice that many of the most successful professors you've worked with came from privileged backgrounds or had high earning spouses. This is initially disheartening, but it's really just a matter of perspective. For example, I already \\*know\\* that becoming an artist is not really a career, and would not be surprised if I failed to earn money writing or painting. I suppose I naively thought that academia was a career rather than an endeavor, but I've finally accepted that being a professor is more like being an artist than an engineer, physician or salesperson.\n\nIt's sad, but also a realistic perspective. What do you think?",

      "text": "This is a matter of perspective.\n\nI come from an underprivileged background - there were time in my life when my parents had to make tough choices and, and there were times when they were worried about money for groceries was going come from. \n\nHaving said that, I am now an assistant professor at a small liberal arts university in the US. And the thing is, I am surrounded by colleagues with very similar backgrounds to mine. \n\nYou are absolutely correct when you say that many of the people I worked with came from comfortable, privileged families. In my mind, and in my field (the life sciences) the reason for this is many-fold. Those with money are sent to the best schools from an early age, providing the kind of academic pedigree the elite universities look for. They are also conditioned, for lack of a better term, to be aggressive in their career and forgo hobbies and other unnecessary pleasantries in favor of advancing themselves. They are more likely to live to work because of this. \n\nOn the other hand, those of us from less than wealthy families have a far different perspective. Me, and the people I work with, make time for things outside teaching and research. Likely because our view is that we work to live, rather than living to work. ",

          "text": "I also came from an under privileged background (which is also a relative statement) both economically and mentally (very toxic family, alcoholic father etc.) I find, however that I rarely relate to my colleagues in that way. Most of my colleagues have come from backgrounds totally different than mine. It's very weird that they're buying houses, totally paying off their student loans etc. Those things to me are pipe dreams. I'm so far in student debt I can't imagine ever not paying on them bc my parents couldn't help me in any way. I had scholarships and worked two jobs in undergrad but that was a drop in the bucket. \n\nSo for me it's the total opposite. I can't make time for anything outside work bc that's totally foreign to me. My colleagues travel. They do things. I don't have the money to do any of that because, even though I've \"made it\" all my \"extra\" money goes to the debt I accrued just to survive many years ago. I was paying my car off while my colleagues had their parents buy them one. I am paying down credit cards while my colleagues use them to build their credit. So even now, years later, I am unable to do anything fun. It will take years before we can do anything like what my colleagues do. ",

Grad school has a lot of soft costs and hidden expenses, even when you have \"full funding.\" what's more, you have to pay those soft costs in order to build up your CV in the way that the job market now requires. Conference presentations? It can cost $500 to go to a conference, and even if your school will pay for it, it's usually in the form of a reimbursement - so you need to be okay with $500 missing from your bank account. Journal articles? In my field, that means you need to spend at least one summer before prelims in the archives, digging up the raw data- you might get summer funding, but $2,000 won't cover your summer rent *and* the cost of 3 weeks in a foreign country. Student fees? My school reimburses tuition, but they want $1,000 every semester for fees, etc. It just snowballs from there - better CV leads to more success on the job market, which means less time in adjunct hell, etc., etc. ",

The hotel and flight are booked in advance by an administrator and paid before you leave.  Were you with any full-time faculty from your institution?  There's an unwritten rule here that you pay for sustenance and local travel (taxis, day trips etc) for your students - hardly matters, we eat/travel together and I'm reclaiming it all at the end anyway.  If anything, finance are happy they only have to work through one disorganised wad of receipts.  If you're travelling alone, I believe the university will loan students/faculty money to cover up-front expenses, then automatically deduct it from the next pay packet after they return and re-claim their expenses.\n\nBased on the talk in this thread, I think this is definitely one of the things we do right.",

The speaker was someone who had enjoyed a reasonably successful career during golden years of money and funding and came across as a privileged rich asshole. \n\nOne of the things he said that pissed me off to no end was his answer to the question regarding how to negotiate salaries with start ups and companies when you bring in a high level of skill. His answer was something to the effect that \"money isn't important\" and \"it's all about being part of something larger than yourself and making an impact on the world\". He only wants to hire people who have \"transcended\" to this idea that impact is more worthy than income. At the same time, he says that he looks for people who have \"guaranteed loyalty\", like family already in the area or some clear and compelling reason that ties them to the area/job. Like being ready to kill for a high paying job with good benefits (and kill again and again to keep it) isn't loyalty somehow. OK. Definitely not an asshole I would ever want to work for if \"the job is its own reward\". \n\nThe speaker the month before him was just as bad. Some dude flush enough that he's bounced around from start up to start up, some flopping, and telling us all to \"not worry about the money, just the job, and it will all work out.\" \n\nAnd the overall message these people are peddling is, \"You have to be able and willing to take risks.\" \n\nWell you fucking can't if you're living paycheck to paycheck like most of us in my postdoc cohort/generation, and the outgoing graduate students seem to be in a *worse* situation. \n\nThe only *relatable* presenter we had during the series was a minority woman who came from a lower middle class background and whose career trajectory clearly reflected her financial situation/desperation and was all about clawing her way forward and perseverance. \n\n\n",

Most PhDs never achieve a full time academic position, as you say, but most (at least in the biomedical sciences) manage to find a decent-paying position in industry, or contracting, or regulatory affairs.  In the 5 years I was working on my PhD, I was living entirely on my stipend of 28k in a slightly expensive COL area.  My salary in biomedical science was pretty standard.  Not rolling in cash of course, but i paid all my bills on time without anxiety, ate out when I wanted to, saved enough money to travel for 6 months after I graduated, and still have my IRA and separate emergency fund.  So, I don't really think I was \"falling behind\" financially during my graduate school years when I compare myself to my peers (it's hard to make a space for yourself in the world). 48K is the standard now for postdocs in my field (thankfully) and while it is not great pay, it is plenty for the lifestyle I enjoy and value.  \n\nI think it really is different in STEM though, where they actually pay you enough money to cover your bill.  I personally would not have started down the PhD road if i was not paid for it along the way, so I don't always understand the motivations of people in the humanities who continue working in destitute financial situations.  I do things out of love and passion, sure, but with a touch of shrewdness.  ",

I recognize that 50% moving to tenured professorships is pretty high (most are at smaller schools; two at major R1s), but the odd thing is knowing the backgrounds of my peers, only two (maybe three) came from really privileged backgrounds and two of them are not in academia (the other is the one with the health issue).  The rest of us were middle class at best and most were classified as being from a \"disadvantaged group.\"\n\nThe common thread among the professors in that group are meticulous attention to detail and the ability to plan and to adapt.

The large majority of labs in my graduate department had at least one post-doc paid with full benefits (even if the salary was pretty low). Humanities programs simply don't have the same large incomes to support as many postdocs. Thus, many grads are forced to take low-paying adjunct or instructor positions to make due until they potentially land a professorship. This is really only tenable in the long term if you have some form of safety net (i.e. this is for the rich).",

Increasingly, postdocs are becoming necessary in the humanities and social sciences as well. Plus, that the postdoc is necessary is exactly what I mean: you're underpaid and overworked, you're in a precarious situation job-security wise, you have to move every 2 years - and you're trying to tell me this is somehow better than being a VAP?\n\n> A VAP position makes it very difficult for STEM PhD's to continue with research productivity, which is why those who wish to continue as researchers (as opposed to predominantly teachers) will opt to be full-time researchers (i.e. postdocs).\n\nOk, but that's just discipline difference. Few humanities *professorships* are research-only, much less postdocs or VAPs. Humanities scholars don't have labs and 0/1 loads and, even at R1s, teaching is a necessary component of the job. I'm saying that in practical terms, the two positions aren't that different. ",

But, in my field at least, I can see clear distinctions in the workload and responsibilities of grad students/postdocs/professors, and I think that it makes sense that there is an intermediate step between students and faculty, to build up research experience and experience of applying for grants and funding \\(which, to speak for my own field again, in particle physics is no small feat, we apply for millions of pounds/dollars per grant\\).

I never went on a plane until my first academic conference. I never really went anywhere further than 5-6 hours drive of my hometown until I was like 25. I didn't know anything about other cultures, languages (except Spanish), fancy food, etc. But 99% of the people in my cohort did. They were all world-travelers and the vast majority were international students that spoke 2-3 languages. The American students were the only ones that came from not-wealthy families, but even a lot of those students did.\n\nOne time our lab had a little pizza party thing. There was a lull and one prof asked 'so does anyone have any funny travel stories?'. Another prof told this story about getting lost in Italy and finding the Tower of Pisa. Then they asked the students. I got a little annoyed by this thinking 'I ate peanut butter and honey for dinner twice last week. No I don't have any fucking travel stories about getting lost in Italy.' But I was really surprised to hear other students having stories about getting kicked out of a sushi bar in Japan, missing connecting flights, etc. I remember feeling kind of like an outcast in that moment. I felt like I was really out of place socially. This feeling has only been exaggerated through the years when I go to conferences and I sit down at these nice dinners where people just leave wine bottles on the table. Everyone looks to be so comfortable and I always feel the opposite.",

My PhD is funded enough to live (I need to be careful, but I don't need extra source of income, unless something goes catastrophically wrong - and coming from not-rich background means that I know to live on this amount of money and not feel deprived), and so are many other chemistry PhDs almost all over the not-very-poor world, especially in good schools (to the point that generally who didn't get into a sufficiently funded chemistry PhD, shouldn't do a chemistry PhD at this time). My industrial alternative would almost certainly have been at least for the first year unpaid or insufficiently paid internship, likely even preceded by up to a year of unemployment - hopefully by doing a PhD (and postdoc(s)) I can at least avoid that stage or save some money to afford it (though I think I would prefer to afford a career change, which seems much less likely to be possible).",

Children from well off families are more likely to graduate and are more likely to have a high GPA. Those are all important things for starting a phd. Once you get to the phd point, the skew just shouldn't be there. Maybe there's a little bit of skew from rich kids knowing the decorum of professional situations where non rich kids need to learn on the go, but academia is not filled with the mega rich. It would be if it was due to the things you mentioned and not the things I mentioned. Paying your child's life expenses for over a decade post high school is just not something anyone with a reasonable level of income can do. I know my family couldn't, and classifying me as coming from anything but a privileged background would be wrong (dad used to work in silicon valley and has been a c level executive multiple times). Fact of the matter is that you make enough money to live off of the entire way post undergrad (in stem at least).",

He compared that to many international students where a 20-30k stipend was more comparable to their current wages/lifestyle. He went on to argue that these students play a large part in competing down what an acceptable stipend would be.\n\nI'm certainly not saying US students have it harder, or that international students are a problem.
