  "text": "I am been trying to secure a masters by research position and writing to professors. After taking my time to re-evaluate my approach, decided to post an example of an email i wrote recently. Would be glad if i could get proper criticism on it.\n\n\"Dear Professor ___ ___, \n\nMy name is ____, and I am a Civil Engineering graduate (B.Eng.) specialising in sustainable structural engineering and currently in my third-year post-graduation at a structural engineering consulting firm.\n\nIt was interesting exploring some of your past research on Digital Twin applications to construction. Have you considered extending in the direction of applications to construction waste management? \n\nIf feasible, I would love to know if there are research opportunities or possible collaborations opportunities within your research group at the _____ of Science and Technology currently or in the future.\n\nRegarding this, would you be able to take some time out of your busy schedule to discuss?\n\nI have also developed a research proposal for a study I would like to conduct under your supervision if the position for a researcher in your current projects are filled.\n\nI hope my past work and research skills make me eligible to carry out research work under your guidance. I am willing to undergo any selection process if required.\n\nAttached to this mail are my research proposal, CV, transcripts, and some of my award certificates. If there is any other information you would like to know, I would be happy to provide it.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\n_____\"\n\n\nI tried my best not to be brief. Is this what a professor wants to see, do I put more? Do I put less? I am really passionate about becoming an academic and I feel like I am failing my first steps. I will appreciate some criticism so i can get back to writing professors.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all so much. I am glad I sought out help here. Please feel free to drop as much advice.\n\nI made an update below, I hope its good enough.\n\nDear Dr _______\n\nI am a planning on pursuing a master's and I have a research proposal In the application of Digital Twin to construction management, which I think is interesting and you will be a great supervisor for because of your research background and recent publications on Digital twins, Sustainable Construction and Wearable Sensory Devices. \n\nI find your research on Digital twin-driven framework for improving ____ of _____ risks fascinating, and enjoyed learning about the ___ ____ used for data collection to the digital twin as well as your publication on sustainable construction where you highlighted the exclusion of work place safety in the ____ aspects of sustainable construction.\n\n I am curious about these research areas and wondering if you plan to take master's students in the next year? If so, I would love to discuss the opportunity further.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n_____ ____.",

Tell them you have a proposal in area Y that you think is interesting and that you think they would be a good supervisor for because of their relevant publications a b and c. Any email needs to have a specific goal in mind and at the moment it's not clear what you are even applying for.",

The admissions process may require an application through the university.",
