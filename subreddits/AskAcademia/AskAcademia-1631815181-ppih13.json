  "text": "I would like to start running experiments  online. I'm generally doing  RT studies like the attentional blink. I've  heard that labs have  started running experiments on Mechanical turk. But  I don't have a clue  how or where to get started. Can anyone give some  tips on how to do  this? Also I'm on a budget so the cheapest method  would be the best.  Any tips I could get would be really appreciated!  Thanks",
