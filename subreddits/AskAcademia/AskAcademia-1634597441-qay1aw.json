  "text": "Hi there! I\u2019m looking for some inter/multidisciplinary PhD recs. Open to English, Comp Lit recs as well.\n\nAbout me: My primary background is English literature, and I have two Master\u2019s degrees, one in 19th-Century Lit and one in Media Studies. My ideal PhD will focus on Black American speculative fiction in 19th literature/contemporary film. My main idea is to approach my research from the disciplines of literature and film, so I\u2019m less interested in African/African American Studies, Ethnic Studies, etc. \n\nI\u2019m definitely still applying to \u2018traditional\u2019 English departments, but I\u2019m curious about other programs similar to Stanford\u2019s Modern Thought and Literature PhD. For instance, I know that certain Comp Lit programs lend themselves to media studies. All in all, would love to see what the Reddit community comes up with as I finalize my list. \n\nThanks in advance for your recs!",
