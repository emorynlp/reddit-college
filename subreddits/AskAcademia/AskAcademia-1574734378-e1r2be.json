  "text": "This is a super random question but was just curious what other people in academia thought. Lately it seems like he goes on Twitter and tries to rain on everybody's parade with science. While I can understand having this attitude to pseudo-sciency things, he appears to speak about things he can't possibly be that extensively experienced in as if he's an expert of all things science. \n\nI really appreciate what he's done in his career and he's extremely gifted when it comes to outreach and making science interesting to the general public. However, from what I can tell he has a somewhat average record in research (although he was able to get into some top schools which is a feat in and of itself). I guess people just make him out to be a genius but to me it seems like there are probably thousands of less famous people out there who are equally accomplished?",

He comes off as a complete narcissist which is doubly bad when he is (frequently) talking about shit he doesn't understand. \n\nMy favorite example is when he mentioned to Joe Rogan that there are multiple sizes of infinity which is technically correct. Then he went on to \"explain\" several examples of this, each of which was completely wrong and/or utter nonsense.",

Their behaviour drastically changes when they are with peers. I saw Dawkins at an evolutionary biology conference and it was an eye-opener. He was so much more humble and quiet. I don't have anything against Dawkins or Tyson, it is just curious. Hell, selfish gene was the book that made me want to study evolutionary biology. That being said, I cannot stand their arrogance. They have to chill. Not everyone has a chance to pursue a scientific career, so it is only normal that not everyone is aware of some scientific facts. Being humble just makes people more receptive to their message, in my opinion.",

Dr. Tyson's work is surely legitimate in the sense that it is able to be peer-reviewed by the academic astrophysics community at large. His PhD is legitimate in the sense that it was issued by a reputable institution; that is not the question. Stating someone is legitimate or illegitimate is making a claim in regard to the authenticity of their credentials, not their quality. You seemed to have conflated to two in your response.\n\nYou said that the [discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/7p6ddh/ndt_on_zeno_effect_and_uncertainty_principle/) posted on r/physics was poorly-informed nonsense. That is not exactly useful to say because you don't explain why you think that. Could you please explain why? I thought many of the comments had a lot of good points, especially addressing how Dr. Tyson tends to mix up concepts when attempting to explain things and which often leads to him being incorrect.\n\nAs to his publications, he has his name on thirteen research publications, the latest being eleven years ago. I am not familiar with the field of astrophysics, or physics in general, but that seems quite a low number and a long time ago for someone who still brands himself a scientist, or any type of academic for that matter. \n\nI genuinely don't know what you mean when you said his stature as a researcher is perfectly decent. By what measure? Public opinion? Citation frequency? I am genuinely curious. I realize fields can be quite specialized and just because you aren't cited by thousands of your peers, it doesn't mean your work is bad. I also realize that He doesn't have *that* much research to be cited.",

He's not a scientific researcher, so there's nothing there to criticise really.\n\nBrian Cox on the other hand is still a researcher and is actively involved in publishing peer-reviewed research. Carl Sagan apparently reduced his research load a lot after Cosmos came out, but he was still publishing from time to time even in the 90s. NGT's recent publications are basically all about science communication and outreach. And that's fine - it's useful, and it's important. It's just not astronomy research.",

If someone asked him about the Indus Valley Civilization, or women in China in the 1930s, he would probably try to answer their question rather than simply saying he doesn't know the answer. \n\nOf course I don't think people would ask about *those* things, but rather science things, but he's done this so he can become the \"face of science,\" or one of the faces of it. It is a successful strategy, but it has ultimately led to him being incorrect sometimes when people ask him about topics outside of his wheelhouse. It has the added effect of making him look like he thinks he is an expert on science, when in fact such a notion is ridiculous. I don't think he means to come across this way, but he does anyway.",

But they are extremely different. That's not me /r/gatekeeping, of course you can be extremely knowledgeable as a postdoc, but rather a retroactive explanation for the simple fact that he gets basic physics wrong ALL. THE. TIME. Astro people can have a reputation for not having the strongest knowledge of basic physics, but to be honest I am still legitimately amazed how he at one point must have gone through comps and yet how bad his knowledge is.\n\nJust really basic stuff he either says really wrong things about or just clearly doesn't understand it himself. And it's that that is most fatal. If you don't have a deep well of knowledge to draw from them your ability to explain things is extremely limited. Only if you understand the full picture can you confidently prune things down and adapt. Otherwise you end up with \"wikipedia-ese\" where someone is clearly just parroting something someone else wrote that they clearly don't understand too well. And that's IF he actually wrote his own stuff, which I assume most of the time he's just a \"talking head\" at this point.",

It's definitely good for those fields specifically, but whether or not the fields are really worth all the money they get is questionable (less so string theory because they more or less just need paper, computers, and man power). People really don't realize how ridiculous the scales for these things are. eg \"Hadronics\" will never be a thing because the energy scales are too extreme. At best you get some super specialized detector and magnet improvements. Those aren't worthless, but they come with a pretty big basic research tax.\n\nAs for NDT in general, I think it's pretty obvious that he's at best neutral. He embodies the \"condescending physicist\" stereotype, and unsurprisingly people tend to not like condescending people.",

Getting into a top school is mostly random; what little it tells you about a person is confined to high school success, which does not really correlate with understanding, or novel thinking. On the other hand, his limited research record is entirely irrelevant. I think it is good for an educator to do a PhD, and do some research (a music teacher should have played an instrument) but research and teaching abilities don't correlate much.\n\nGreat researchers and great teachers both need to understand the fundamentals of a subject on a deep level. But a researcher's goal is to push the boundary of the field, and has no need to understand how a non-specialist might understand or misunderstand the basics. On the other hand, a teacher doesn't need to think about how to push the boundary, but must consider someone else's understanding of a topic and develop several different ways to approach it (a very difficult, but different skill). There are some exceptions in both directions: Terry Tao for example.\n\nWhat's troubling about NDG is that he weighs in with authority on topics he doesn't understand, and also there are allegations of sexual misconduct against him that have not been resolved to my satisfaction. His employer conducted an investigation and refused to make a statement other than they had concluded the investigation and decided not to fire him.",

I was part of the Exhibitions department and was one of the team responsible for the computer-driven and interactive exhibits in the new Rose Center, for which he was (and still is) ultimately responsible. At the time I didn't really know much about him, other than the fact that virtually every museum staff member treated him with near-holy reverence.\n\nI found him to be very personable and genuinely interested in everything around him. He wasn't very computer-savvy at the time (don't know if he is now) and would ask questions about the systems we were installing and how they worked and why we did things the way that we did them. It wasn't just a matter of him being responsible for the Rose Center and therefore wanted to micromanage everything; he just genuinely wanted to learn and know what was going on. I never saw him berate or talk down to anyone, even small children. One thing he did to me once was tell me to explain something computer-related to him as if he were on the same technical level as me. I did that, and afterwards he asked me questions that not only demonstrated that he was fully paying attention but that he accurately understood the majority of the major points. \\*That\\* is a rare trait. I saw him do much the same thing to one of the construction people a few days later. I got the distinct impression that the only thing he liked more than learning something new was teaching someone something new to them.",

I'll get to those in a minute.\n\nIf you asked me what I thought of Neil deGrasse Tyson before the allegations, I'd say mostly positive. Being a public intellectual, or someone who communicates science to the larger audience, doesn't require someone to be a *genius* or have a distinguished research record. In fact, outside of academia, none of that really matters much at all. The Hayden Planetarium is probably far less concerned with how many papers Tyson publishes than they are with how much funding and public support he can bring in. Being a good science communicator has a lot more to do with how you can translate the science to the public, and Tyson is excellent at that. It's one of the reason the public loves him: he makes astronomy and astrophysics seem accessible.\n\n(But let's be clear: Tyson has the record. He started attending astronomy classes at the Hayden Planetarium in high school, and he was giving lectures at age 15. Carl Sagan tried to recruit him to attend Cornell for *undergrad*. And he became the director of the Hayden Planetarium just 7 years after finishing his PhD.)\n\nI admit to being a bit of a curmudgeon, but \"raining on everybody's parade with science\" is one of my favorite things and I admire when other scientists do it. (I realize that this does not make me fun at parties.) This, too, you can do without having been extensively experienced in all fields. I don't need an MD to know that the Master Cleanse is a terrible idea; I don't need a PhD in pharmacology to know that homeopathy doesn't work; and I don't need a PhD in...anything...to know that the earth is not flat. Tyson, like many other scientist skeptics, tries to encourage people to be skeptical and use the scientific method.\n\nAnd as a black scientist, I will say it's incredibly meaningful to see another black scientist who is so widely known and appreciated for his scientific prowess.\n\n*However*, he admitted to *at the very least* behaving inappropriately with two women AND on top of that did so in the most pompous, misogynistic, assholish way that I lost a whole lot of respect for him.",

The fact that the sciences or any branch of knowledge are always political doesn't mean necessarily that they are influenced by the process of government or the policies/preferences of politicians. It means that human actions are always a reflection of individual politics. This is a basic epistemological argument. Every human endeavor, even the most purportedly impartial ones, is colored in some way by the motivations and biases of the people involved.\n\nThe reason that the comments are heavily downvoted is because the perspective that /u/InfuriatingComma is communicating \u2014 that there is such a thing as totally dispassionate, neutral, unflinchingly objective science \u2014 is an incredibly antiquated notion that people started deconstructing more than half a century ago. The literature critiquing that point of view is so extensive that the arguments against the existence of total objectivity are rather taken for granted.\n\nBefore anyone responds with something like, \"Well, in mathematics, all we do is, like, add 2+2, and how is it biased that such an equation equals 4?!\"\n\nThe idea is not always that the specific results are biased. It's that the pursuit of knowledge will always reflect human biases. Why the scientist chose to answer certain questions and not others; how they defined their problems; how they chose their subjects and variables; how they left out others; who gets to be part of the team of researchers; what values that team represents; how those values are reflected in the types of issues they chose to address... this barely scratches the surface of the ways in which all knowledge is political. \"Political\" just means the sum of a person's ideas, motives, and ideologies.",

It\u2019s not my contention that people should lie down and let biases overrun their work. I am simply observing that all human enterprises are the result of human decisions that are somehow reflective of human interests, and it is literally not possible to achieve 100% disinterested objectivity. At some level or stage of the process is a decision that was influenced by human interest, and that is often OK, particularly because there are checks in place, as you state.\n\nAs for whether talking about this is doing a disservice, I find that perspective a bit puzzling and frankly somewhat anti-intellectual.

                          "text": "> I think from your comments here and /u/InfuriatingComma's comments that there might be some confusion about what \"political\" means. The fact that the sciences or any branch of knowledge are always political doesn't mean necessarily that they are influenced by the process of government or the policies/preferences of politicians. It means that human actions are always a reflection of individual politics. This is a basic epistemological argument. Every human endeavor, even the most purportedly impartial ones, is colored in some way by the motivations and biases of the people involved.\n\nYou're redefining politics here. That isn't what people mean when they argue whether all science is political. You should pick a better term unless you want to be misinterpreted.\n\n> The reason that the comments are heavily downvoted is because the perspective that /u/InfuriatingComma is communicating \u2014 that there is such a thing as totally dispassionate, neutral, unflinchingly objective science \u2014 is an incredibly antiquated notion that people started deconstructing more than half a century ago.\n\nAgain, there's bias and then there's bias. If you step out my third-story window, you're going to hurt yourself, and there's no reinterpretation of motives that's going to save you. Similarly, the average temperature of the world is increasing and humans are most likely to blame, and deconstruction of why scientists funded by certain governments might be influenced to come to that conclusion won't change the facts they used to come to that conclusion.",

That isn't what people mean when they argue whether all science is political. \n\nI accept that I expanded on the definition of \"politics\" for the sake of making a more general point, but I am not changing the definition. This is simply how the concept is understood in broader terms. The more specific definition is completely acceptable. The other user's comments were rather brief, and I may have interpreted them differently than he or she intended. However, the contrast they made between \"science that is political\" and \"objective science\" (in Econ they \"just evaluate policies by the numbers\") prompted me to talk about biases in general terms.\n\n> Again, there's bias and then there's bias.

This isn't what I was getting at. In your example about the temperature increasing, the point is not about the result (that the temperature is increasing), but about how human interests influence the undertaking in general. The fact that researchers and their funders even sought to examine these questions is influenced by human biases; in this case, the bias can be viewed as a positive one (that we want to study how the earth's climate is being negatively affected).",

OP isn't claiming that all scientists study things that they believe in personally/politically and find things that align with their beliefs (although this does happen).\n\nWhat OP is highlighting is that all scientists have axiological commitments which help them to determine what knowledge is valuable, and worth knowing. Similarly, their epistemological commitments help them to determine how that knowledge can be known. \n\nAll scientists have axiological and epistemological commitments which fundamentally impact how they conduct science. These commitments are without question grounded in their cultural context (upbringing, school experiences, supervisor etc.) To be a little meta, the post-positivistic ideal which you speak of is in and of itself a political ideology in science. \n\nWhat we call science today - certainly has politics. If you are interested, you should read Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. This is a great book that talks about how science is shaped by politics and how it changes over time.",

But critically, the \"cultural coloration\" here makes it impossible to claim objectivity or absoluteness about those views.\n\nFor example - as a biologist, I might e.g. be harshly opposed to invasive neophytes, valuing an idea of keeping ecosystems \"undisturbed\" - but the definition of \"neophyte\" is along an arbitrary temporal line (anything migrating or being imported into an ecosystem after 1945), and the culturally informed view of what makes an ecosystem \"undisturbed\" is equally culturally dependent on our views of \"intereference\" being bad - even though all life just does what it does and thereby changes ecosystems, and even though no ecosystems are ever actually in absolute equilibrium. (EDIT: This is of course a highly simplified, somewhat unrealistic example - most ecologists are nowhere near that naive, and of course ecosystem-conservation is fundamentally important... but I think it get's the point about axiological commitments across)\n\nI will also have culturally dependent views of the value of science itself, and of specific methodologies.\n\nSo my positive valuation of science, of \"undisturbed ecosystems\" and the negative valuation of \"interference\" and my general valuation of (my view of) science will color my research, my reasoning and my conclusions. These valuations are my axiological commitments.\n\nI will further have some (usually tacit, implicit) ideas about how science works, how, by virtue of what and to what degree it confers knowledge. I will have specific views of what can generally count as knowledge and how to evaluate that. For example - I might be a positivist, thinking that we can knowably gain objective knowledge through science - or I might be a falsificationist, thinking that experiments can definitely disprove theories or corroborate them to a certain degree with every test they didn't fail. Both of these views have serious problems - but they will of course inform and color the conclusions I draw from the data I get to an extreme degree.\n\nFurthermore - you can't break free from any and all implicit or explicit commitments to certain value-judgements and to implicit or explicit views about how knowledge and science work... we can critically examine our epistemic, metaphysical and axiological judgements - and it is possible to still do analyses and evaluations based on logic, and still take specific positions... but we have to be aware that we are never free from such commitments, and mustn't underestimate the degree to which they are culturally determined instead of arrived at by \"pure reason\".\n\nFeel free to ask further questions if there's something unclear - I can't promise I'll have time to respond, but I'll do my best :)",

                                                      "text": "Thank you! :) I'm glad if I can help.\n\nSince you're obviously interested - allow me to go a little into one rather important related area of inquiry:\n\nI said that our axiological and epistemic commitments will \"color the interpretations and conclusions\" from the data I gather. But what's even more fundamental - the very data I gather, the very observations I make also depend on a whole ton of background-assumptions - and on things inherent in the very observer-observed dichotomy and the very nature of mentality! \n\nAs Willard van Orman Quine famously quipped - \"there is no observation that isn't theory-laden\". Even naively, our growing minds construct \"folk physics\", \"folk biology\", \"folk psychology\" etc to explain and predict things in those domains - perhaps the first significant implicit theoretical assumption we make is that our sensory experience informs us of an external world, i.e. that there is a world there that accounts for the contents of our experiences. Then we learn stuff about extension, dimensions, weight, texture, haptics and affordances of things in our world - by correlating patterns in experience - touching things, smelling, tasting and gripping things... and so on  and so forth. This also brings us to Immanuel Kant and his central insight: That the very nature of mentality and the observer-observed distinction (which we cannot escape) necessarily impose certain conceptions upon how we perceive the world. For example - space and time are notions that are \"inherent\" in the very nature of perception and the nature and conception of the \"world\" - and thereby, the fact that these are preconditions and necessary categories of thinking about the world means that even if reality could be relevantly different (\"a-spatiotemporal\"), that would be literally not coherently thinkable, so we have to see that some aspects of these assumptions about space and time may be in us, not necessarily in reality (though that might independently still be the case).\n\nBut back to the theory-ladenness of observation in everyday life and science: Of course many of those folk-theoretical assumptions get thrown overboard or refined, as we enter science. But - and here's the crux of the issue - everything from our \"conceptual partition\" to the models we use, the machines we make to make observations of things are \"theory-laden\". An electron-microscope has built into it a significant portion of specific theories of particle physics - which we use both to construct and interpret the readouts of the equipment. So an observation via electron-microscope is always \"prefixed\" with the assumption of the truth of that theory - and comes with the same caveats. Basically - the bayesian truth-likelihood of those observations is always modified by the given uncertainty about the theories we use to make and interpret those observations.\n\nThis is also related to the issue of \"confirmational holism\" - the problem that theories don't come alone - they exist in networks of reliance and support between theories and auxiliary hypotheses. So both the corroboration through successful experiments as well as the negative evidence provided by failed experiments can't be assigned to any single theory or hypothesis in isolation - they have to be \"distributed\" over the network they exist in - proportionally to how much the nodes in that network depend on its linked nodes. Critically, this means that Popperian falsificationism is impossible. An observation cannot uniquely disprove a theory - you can always \"shift blame\" to certain networked auxiliary hypotheses and construct different ones. This doesn't make it a free for all of course - but the result about the impossibility of direct falsification is extremely important.\n\nA few more things to look into are the issues of realism vs e.g. instrumentalism in science (i.e. \"Does science tell us true things about the world, or is it merely a catalogueing and systematization of perceptions without any legitimate claim to describe objective reality?), and related: the ontology of our theories - i.e. the inventory of things they postulate to be in the world and be involved in the mechanisms they describe - the way our theories try to \"carve nature at its joints\". Because, importantly, even if our theories get some dynamics in the world correctly - the ontology, the way they conceive of the nature and boundaries of involved systems can be wildly different, and in fact there is good reason to suppose that our ontologies are not true, and we shouldn't be ontological realists, but can still be \"structural\" realists - i.e. hold that science can tell us truths about dynamics in the world, but we must be aware that our ontologies may be wildly wrong.\n\nFor your general curiosity about philosophy of science - I can wholeheartedly recommend the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu), its search-function and the \"related articles\" section at the bottom of each article.\n\nHere are a few pointers:\n\n* [Theory and Observation in Science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/)\n\n* [Scientific Realism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/)\n\n* [Realism and Theory Change in Science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-theory-change/)\n\n* [Ontological Commitment](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-commitment/)",

And I neither wish to deny the import of their contributions nor of the problems they talk about - but philosophy of science also has moved a lot since Kuhn in the 60s. Duhem, Quine, van Fraassen, Lakatos, Laudan, Feyerabendt, Balzer, Stegm\u00fcller, Sneed, Suppes, Moulines - and the mechanistic advances of the last two decades... all deserve some thought.  \n\n\nI sometimes get the feeling there's either an empirical reductionism or a social reductionism - and neither are adequate.

On the note of tendencies towards reductionism, I suspect it's as most scholars only delve into metatheory for a portion of a single class in grad school.

From there, I think a lot of scholars get caught up in the grind, in which metatheoretical pontificaiton isn't as emphasised.

The point is that every human being has unconscious biases, values, ideologies, etc. that can be reflected in their work or the way in which the work is constructed in the first place. Again, what makes all pursuit of knowledge \"political\" is not necessarily the result of a specific project, but how human differences influence their work. This is simply a reflection of unconscious human attitudes and power structures. It is not always a good thing that this happens, and it's not always a bad thing that this happens. It's just the way human beings work, and eliminating it completely from all levels of intellectual work is simply not realistic.",

For example, cancer research is a field that is widely traversed and many scientists are working to find a cure to different cancers. This is true to the extent that \"finding a cure for cancer\" is used as a popular metaphor for someone who is smart/going to medical school. This is because we as a society have ideologies surrounding the value of preserving life (i.e. living longer is better). This is of course similarly shaped by the resources that are funnelled into this area, which creates more grants, which encourages further science. This all, in turn, leads to more people seeing and assuming cancer research as a paramount endeavour.\n\nOn the other hand, there are fields which simply aren't studied that much because we as a society don't position them as important. As a simple example, more people study human health and how we can live longer than people study the science of happiness. This is again a product of politically-driven ideology surrounding the value of life length versus the value of happiness. \n\nWhat /u/Durendal_et_Joyeuse is not just our 'unconscious biases' (although this is included), but rather, how the politicized structure of human society fundamentally structures and determines what knowledge is seen as valuable, and how we study it.",

We create worlds and categories and whole systems of what makes sense and what doesn't. These are politically contested. For example when green revolution arrived in Bali the Platonic/Kantian/Benthamite ontology of science said that crops needed to be planted at One specific time to optimize yields and produce better welfare for all. It's totally universal and empirical. Plain as the nose on your face. And this was coercively forced on farmers who for centuries had followed a system with a completely different ontology and politics, one that science couldn't make sense of , that seemed horribly backwards and antiquated. \n\nThe trouble was that the Balinese subak system worked and the scientific green revolution system lead to crop failure after crop failure. \n\nUltimately this comes down to differences in world view. The Balinese/Western scientists were trained to see the system as a single optima system in which a few variables (seeding time, fertilizer rates, hybrid seed) would result in optimal yield every time anywhere in the world. The Balinese farmers by contrast were trained in an adaptive, historical, locally optimized system where they that staggering the irrigation patterns and planting times yielded better. However this was attributed to animistic sources not emperical scientific ones. In the politics of the day science was valued not tradition and religion. \n\nYears later an anthropologist trained at the Santa Fe Institute arrived and acted as a translator for the science of the Balinese farmers. It turns out that the different ontology, world view, of complex systems that abandoned single optima systems in it's infancy could describe the systems of the Balinese farmers in a way that the earlier modernist ontology could not. The science could not, for political reasons, see that it's world view was incorrect. The religious farmers understood their system better than science but because their ontology was incompatible with science it was ignored FOR PURELY POLITICAL REASONS.",

They have the goal of saving lives, and they aim to achieve those goals. Is it wrong that they push that agenda? Should they be distrusted because of it? When an EMT says \"you need to put on this oxygen mask\", that is precisely information coming from a source pushing an agenda. But is that a good reason to reject the information?\n\nImagine that a group of like-minded people arose with the intent of seeking the truth of the world, unbiased by human error and the idiosyncracies of our minds. That would be, by definition, their agenda. And if they sought to change politics such that human bias was less present, and objective fact more directly represented, they would by definition become a political party, and \"discover and disseminate objective truth\" would be a political party's agenda. Would that make this endeavour wrong? Should those people no longer be trusted, or would their data be suspect?\n\nThis is the other side of \"everything is political\" - it's not just that our politics influence our actions, it's that our actions *become our politics*. Politics is simply a lofty term for actions, conflicts and collaborations. Whenever a bunch of people want to do A and a bunch of other people want to do B, the political topic \"A vs B\" is born. So *any desire for action*, beyond the most basic things that only affect a handful of people, is ultimately a political thing. Further, since actions are driven by and interact with ideas, this then extends to that space - and thus, whenever a bunch of people believe \"A is true\" and a bunch of other people believe \"A is false\", the political topic \"A or not A\" is born.\n\nScience necessarily creates ideas and judgements. Science produces belief, and therefore drives actions. Thus science must, necessarily, *create* political positions.\n\nTo use your example of climate change - it didn't spring out of the aether fully formed, nor was it dreamt up by a non-scientist who then directed scientists. It was science that produced the agenda in the first place, by discovering information and creating ideas about how the world is.",

You can bring a more rational argument based upon factualities when you are aware of your own frame of mind and communicate said frame to your audience. That's why historians, philosophers and sociologists consider reflexitivity and self-awareness as absolutely crucial skills for any academic. Sadly, many popular figures within media are painfully and obviously unaware of their own frame of mind, let alone theories from within the social sciences that aim to adress this. It's the same reason it can be hard to argue on reddit. While it's true that we can't be subjective, you should at the very least recognize and adress emotionally loaded arguments from your own frame of mind through exercising reflexitivity.\n\nAlso, your mathematics example goes further than that. When we say that \"2+2=4\" that's not some grand natural truth we are uncovering. It's something we have reached an academic concensus on based upon our subjective perception. Any science works through academic concensus, hence why paradigms shift all the time.",

                          "text": "One possible example that may be slightly useful in a way for you is fusion research, specifically with an eye towards power generation.\n\nHow can something like that be political? Well, even if you ignore the obvious \"Fusion is clean, we need clean energy!\" and skip direct to the science, it turns out there are many ways to skin a cat.\n\nThe approach that has taken the lions share of R&D funding has been Tokamak style reactors. These are ones that have a donut shaped chamber for the fusion to take place in. The vast majority of all fusion reactors are tokamak, because they are among the simplest designs mathematically speaking and also \"because it's how we've done it.\" carries a lot of weight.\n\nUnfortunately, for reasons of geometry, tokamak style reactors have a variety of inefficiencies to them which may be one of the reasons we have yet to achieve a break-even fusion event. So there are other designs, like the stellerator, which is a donut shaped chamber that twists along its axis. The math behind the design of these reactors was impossible 30 years ago, we just didn't have the computers capable of crunching the numbers.\n\nBut another fusion design are the \"fusors\", which operate on a completely different system than the other two. Briefly, the other two designs work to try and replicate how fusion works in a star with a combination of pressure (not as much as the sun) and heat (WAY hotter than the sun), while fusors instead charge the atoms such that they are attracted to each other and slam into each other as such a speed that they cause fusion. Note: When you read about child scientists making a fusion reactor in their basement, it's always a fusor.\n\nAll research approaches ALWAYS fight over limited funding, but fusion research has been a bit more constrained than most fields. This is largely because the smallest unit-purchase of a reactor is a HUGE percentage of the total yearly funding for the field itself. What's the simplest way to get more funding? Demonstrate that you are better than your competition. What's a simple way to demonstrate you are better? Trash talk the competition.\n\nWhen your entire career, and possibly industry, is on the line, people can get dirty. Strictly speaking, this still gets limited to academic-science speak, but trash talk is trash talk even if it involves a thousand pages of math and \"reasonable assumptions\" when you are pitching your grant proposals to businessmen and financiers that might very well have been left behind by the title of your report.\n\nTokamak reactors continue to get the bulk of funding if for no other reason than the maturity of the technology and vague (but technically truthful) assurances that if we just keep pushing forward we'll figure out how to negate the inherent inefficiencies of the design without changing the design. Stellarator designs are gradually pushing forward, primarily over in Germany and are very promising. One of the advantages they have is that due to the similarity to tokamak designs, almost every bit of technological advancement in one can translate directly to the other. So even if the new shape doesn't pan out, they can still show a return on investment for helping out standard designs. Fusors...are largely just kind of left in the dust. They don't get much funding, if at all, to explore the possibilities simply because nobody has funded them to explore the possibilities. We don't know if its efficiencies can scale because we have no evidence the efficiencies can scale, so nobody wants to fund exploratory science to determine if those efficiencies can scale. And so it is in a Catch-22.\n\nUltimately once over-unity fusion has had it's Chicago Pile moment, the money will flood in and you'll eventually have startups or spinoffs that will be willing to spend some money looking into the alternatives, but the fight for every dollar right now is very real.\n\nAnd so who you talk to and what you talk about in the fusion world can make or break your ongoing career. Nobody in the tokamak community wants to entertain a fusor upstart when that might mean a reduction in funding, which can result in a downward spiral of lack-of-results which begets additional reductions.",

                          "text": "Hi, I am wondering if you could let me know any places I could read more about this. I think I in principle agree, however it seems like there are gradations and differences in how (or which) politics would influence scientific endeavor. For example, the way that politics comes into the picture seems very different between disciplines, and also within areas in that discipline. Obvious examples would be in psychology or sociology, or that medical knowledge focused on men, or military funding being given to specific fields of science. We can go further and realize that the position that science occupies in our society is inexorably political as it situates certain ideas or facts as 'objective'. \n\nThere are other areas where it seems more tenuous however, and it seems like maybe a little slight of hand is being pulled by broadly defining politics to the point of not saying more than a truism: one's own perspective shapes their understanding of the world. I feel like this is being done with your rebuttal to the hypothetical person claiming that the claim \"2 + 2 = 4\" is an objective truth, void from politics. I can acknowledge that science as an institution is political, but I think as you start to get into actual science being done (in some areas of science), you would really have to strain the meaning of 'political' to apply it. In mathematics for example, there is a 'politics' of the math world that leads the direction of research and suggests questions, however I don't think this is a politics that you could compare to the politics in the real world. I don't think you can compare the 'politics' of the relative importance given to different fields of (abstract) mathematics to the 'politics' of say drug research or medical classifications in psychology. \n\nWriting this out I have had a lot of contradictory thoughts and I can't really express what I am trying to say, as I don't think I totally know what I am trying to say.",

The literature critiquing that point of view is so extensive that the arguments against the existence of total objectivity are rather taken for granted.\n\nThere is *some* truth to this, but I think it's taken rather too far in the popular consciousness at this point. The way we conduct science may be human, but there *is* a world out there, and at the end of the day you're either computing something correctly or you aren't.

There is another used in maths. \n\nMaths is mostly a closed system. You don't need to experiment to find that 2+2 does to some extent of certainty equal 4. It is defined as such. Or at least, you can follow a trail down to where you will find that something had been defined as such. In other words, it stops at some kind of axiom. Or dogma.\n\nOn the other hand you will have to experiment with various objects to find out, how fast they will fall. In a vacuum vs. in our atmosphere. From that your observations you will build a model. Which applies only in the observed circumstances. In this example you would be influenced by atmosphere, elevation and various other factors.\n\nThis kind of methodology will ultimately end in dogma, circular reasoning or infinite regression. Natural sciences usually stop at \"sufficient plausibility\". That is the most you can achieve and that still leaves a lot of room for doubt.\n\nWhich is why you never seem to get a straight answer from scientists depending on their field.\n\nI have only scraped on the surface of the mother-science. Which is philosophy. And I feel this has been neglected in our STEM obsession. And I am speaking as a computer scientist who did a lot of AI. I had to deal with very, very basic questions when it comes to knowledge.

The fact that the politics embodied in a project may not be those of a research tech doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.\n\nFurther, the branch of science one operates in has a huge impact on the influence one has over their own work. If you work in industry, for example, certainly the political decisions that go into driving a project in a given direction aren\u2019t up to you, but the higher-ups in your company. However, if you stay in academia, you have far more influence over your own work. You get the first bit of this influence as a PhD student, and it only grows as you progress through post-doc and faculty positions.",

Here's the actual definition if anyone's curious. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political\n\nInterestingly trying to portray any bias as political is itself politicizing the issue. It is a deliberate attempt to turn any disagreement into a matter of us vs them. It is factually and morally wrong. \n\nAlso scientists are well aware of individual bias. That's why peer review exists. If you are completely clueless as to what that is (like OP) here's an overview of what that means https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review\n\nBut really this does highlight a bigger issue in science. People think they know more about the issue a scientist is studying than the scientists. I see it all the time when teaching climate change. \"It's just the sun obviously, it's hot.\" \"The climate has changed before.\" Really? REALLY? You seriously think scientists don't know about THE FUCKING SUN? you seriously think people who dedicated their lives to studying the climate have never STUDIED THE CLIMATE? Same thing here. \"Science can be biased by scientists individual beliefs\" (politics is a completely separate issue, read a dictionary ffs). You seriously think that no scientist has thought of that? Do you think Newton was the only person to test gravity? Was Maxwell the only person to ever do an experiment on electricity and magnetism? Do you SERIOUSLY think the phone you're reading this on runs off of scientists fucking biases? That no engineer or scientist in the entire course of human history has ever said \"maybe that experiment was flawed because the person who designed it wanted that outcome\"? The negation of that bias is LITERALLY what the scientific method is built around. NO ONE is more aware of the possibility of bias in an experiment than scientists, it is the exact thing the entire field is focused around. \"Medieval History\" might not have that standard but science does, try asking them about science instead of someone who studies the period before science fucking existed. When the entire world was purely individuals working alone without cross-referencing to negate their individual bias.\n\nSomeone isn't intelligent or correct because they used the word \"epistemology.\" Want to actually study knowledge? Stop thinking you know everything and try listening to the people actually studying the thing. Stop assuming everyone else in the world is a dumb ass. Stop thinking your Google search or shower thought outweighs the consensus of CENTURIES of research by thousands of different people across different \"politics\" and biases.",

Neither have any evidence supporting them; neither *can* have any evidence supporting them (cruxed as they are on supernatural processes); oh and the small fact that \"intelligent design\" is just a pseudo-scientific rebranding of creationism intended to get it taught in science classes as a \"thin end of the wedge\"-style attempt to indoctrinate kids into fucking christianity.

Yeah, my guy, that's such a leap of faith from me, to assume that someone doing so would likely be religious. It's not like *c/id* are utter wank and only have any traction with the religious *because they* ***are*** *religious concepts*.

Intelligent design is true. This requires proof in your mind. Intelligent design is not true. This doesn't require proof in your mind. See the hypocrisy? Where is your evidence leaning toward a lack of intelligent design? The evidence for is quite simple... order in nature. It is difficult for humans to comprehend such a mathematical order without intelligent design. Casually calling something false (which you did not do, you called the entire religion false as an absolute) still requires proof that it is false. Prove to me we aren't in a Matrix like computer simulation right now that was created by some guy in his laptop, aka intelligent design.
