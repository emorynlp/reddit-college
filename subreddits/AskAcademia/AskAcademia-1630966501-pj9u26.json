  "title:": "How do academics deal with long distance relationships?",
  "text": "I met my girlfriend at a Canadian MA program, and we've been together for about a year and a half.  I love her a lot.  The problem is that I am starting a PhD thousands of miles away this Fall (a 6 year program in Colorado).  She is doing her PhD in the same Canadian university.\n\nMy question is, is there any end in sight in long distance PhD relationships?  She'll be done in 4 years.  Hopefully she can apply for post docs or jobs in Colorado.  Or once I finish in 6 years, hopefully I can end up somewhere near her.\n\nThe problem is that it's all so uncertain.  We're both in the humanities and the job market is extremely tough.  No guarantee we'll get into any post doc or TT job, let alone in the same school.  What do other academics in long distance relationships do?  Is it unfair to both of us to continue a relationship when we know we'll be apart for 5 years or most likely even longer?  I don't want to give up on us, but it's hard to imagine an end in sight to long distance.",

In my case, my wife is tenured faculty, and I after a few years as non-tenured faculty took a job as a federal scientist which I love, and is a better outlet for the more applied science I prefer (she: Econ, me: evo, ecology). \n\nI have friends who are both tenured, I have friends who are one tenured, one soft money, and friends who went as the previous poster implied with one academic and one who found a better fit for their talents post PhD.  \n\nThe \u201ctwo body problem\u201d is a real and constant problem that many if not most academics have struggled with. There are constraints, there are solutions, like most things. You\u2019ll figure it out. \n\nOr you could choose to over-think it in the early stages of your relationship and thereby destroy any good that might come of it.

What happens if she actually has no intention of looking for a job in the US? You need to make a viable future plan and see if there is any possibility of having a future together that is not 100% long distance. Unfortunately, it is likely that one's career will suffer. It's just a question of agreeing on whom and what the alternatives could be to minimize the impact.\n\n>What do other academics in long distance relationships do?\n\nThey come to visit from time to time, on holidays, etc during my studies. Then once I will graduate, we will relocate where I find a job and they will find a new job at our new location. This has been agreed upon prior to me starting my PhD and we discussed our future at great length when I received my PhD offer before we decided to continue this life journey together.\n\n I have 2 friends who each started their relationship prior to debuting their PhD and both of their respective partners at the time decided to start a PhD in a different country/location. There was a lot of tension in their relationship once they started approaching the end of their studies because of the issues you mentioned and both of my friends ended up separating from their partners. I noticed that many PhD graduates in long term relationships that survived their studies have a partner outside of academia that has a job which makes it easier to relocate. Maybe that's a reason why.",

      "text": "I am in the social sciences and married to a PhD holder (also social sciences). He was able to join me for the final 3 years of his program (my first 3 years) because in social sciences there is no lab, all research can be done remotely. For my final years, I joined him where he got a postdoc. This is very doable in the humanities unless you or she needs access to archives or something specific to your location. \n\nI will say - long distance forever does not  usually work. I think you should try to be together as soon as possible, see if you can do so during the program.",

      "text": "It may be worth it for one to reapply to the university of the other. 4-6 years apart is very long, especially with travel restrictions between Canada and America due to COVID. I'm currently in a LDR but we expect it to end after 1.5 years as I'll be graduating and moving. But it was still hard, especially when we couldn't support each other during stressful moments. I personally know of relationships that worked in 2-3 year LDR, where they worked hard to visit each other whenever possible. I also know a relationship where they were LDR for 4 years, finally relocated, got engaged within a year, and then split up immediately because they realized how difference they were. Hanging out for a week or even a month here and there is more like a vacation than actually living together, and your partner may be extremely different in real/everyday life. However, my other friend was in a 4 years LDR in different continents, lived together for 1-2 years, then LDR again for 3-4 years, married while LDR, but finally moved together and welcomed a new born. Even then, she had to sacrifice a job that she loved to move to be with him because he couldn't find a job in her location. She told me that they were basically LDR for their entire 20s and they had to compromise a lot when they finally lived together. \n\nThe end in sight of a LDR is honestly either a break up or relocating to the same area and living happily ever after. Hearing about other peoples' stories is great, but it ultimately comes down to communicating with your partner because it takes two people to keep the relationship going. Good luck.",

      "text": "I would definitely consider trying to have one of you transfer to the same school somewhere -- 4-6y LDR on a 1.5y relationship seems pretty challenging for maintaining stability and connection. Thousands of miles means you can't visit each other as regularly & coordinating laggy chats across timezones will be trickier. If you really care about this person and are an unusually good match it seems entirely reasonable to modify your career trajectory to be with them. A good interpersonal relationship is way more valuable than a good career, IMO (with the usual caveats that it's hard to disentangle cause and effect here, since success begets more success). I've personally known lots of academic couples at different career stages and they've all made it work, by definition, but they've all been co-located over longer periods of time (some have tenure in the same department, some are postdocs, etc.)\n\nMy wife and I had to go LD for 2y when her lab moved to a new city on the opposite side of the US, and it was pretty rough. Best things for us there were to schedule a regular 1-2h nightly phone call + coop gaming session, as well as more involved movie etc. nights and lots of visits (I spent around 6 months living with her, and she around 2 months with me, so it was really more like 1.4y and not 2). Nowadays I'm doing a postdoc and she a residency at the same school (actually right next door to one another, quite cushy!).\n\nSince you're just starting out, I'd advise focusing your studies on developing as flexible a skillset and assortment of career capital as possible, and being willing to pivot to lots of different roles going forward.",
