  "text": "\nI\u2019m (22F) a first year PhD student in physics, and I kind of absolutely hate it. I know at least some of the problem is my mental health, adjusting to having moved across the country, and a bunch of non-school external stressors that I have been dealing with\u2026 I\u2019m in therapy and I take meds. \n\nBut I wake up and dread my classes. I dread my research. I feel like a disappointment to my advisor who is so nice and puts so much faith in me. I\u2019m skipping class and sleeping and I\u2019m still so exhausted. I don\u2019t think this is what I want to do, and academica was never something I planned on doing after my doctorate anyway. I think I just want it so everyone knows I\u2019m smart. And it\u2019s always been my plan. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know what to do from here. I kind of want to teach. My mom was a teacher and she hated it, but I think I would enjoy teaching math, and it seems like that\u2019s at least somewhat in demand. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice from teachers, grad students, physicists, or anyone would be useful. Thank you.",

      "text": "As a Physics PhD student finishing my PhD in 3 months, my opinion is that if you don't enjoy your field and your research, and i mean truly and deeply enjoy, then you will have a seriously bad and depressing time while doing your PhD. I would say that it is not worth it. Also consider that PhD stipend is not very high and covers only your basic needs. You won't be able to save anything. Based on what you wrote, i strongly advise you to NOT do the PhD.\n\nPhD is generally a good option for people who are passionate about their research enough to sacrifice financial stability and almost all social life for 3+ years.\n\nYou mentioned that you'd be doing the PhD at least partly to show that you're smart. In my opinion, that would only show the oposite. It is not smart at all to sacrifice 3 years worth of savings, time with friends, relationships, etc., just to show the world that you're smart. I'd rather show the world that I'm the dumbest person alive and be relaxed, save money for a house and be happy spending time with my friends.",
