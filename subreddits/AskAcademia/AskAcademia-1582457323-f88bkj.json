  "text": "I am autistic with ADHD so I'm wondering what it's like managing invisible disabilities like these two on top of potentially doing a Ph.D. in a STEM field, namely CS and Info Sci. I also have mental illnesses like OCD, anxiety, panic disorder, depression, and binge eating disorder so that further complicates things.\n\nYes, I take my medications and of course, I go to therapy. I'm aware that graduate school is stressful but so is a job. I'm picking my poison and that is graduate school for now at least.",

      "text": "I feel fortunate that my ADHD doesn't *hugely* impact my life so I can't compare experiences to someone with more serious disabilities (or more severe ADHD... I don't want to speak for everyone who has it but at least mine is manageable)  but I will say that I did learn a lot of coping strategies. It took me almost failing out of undergrad to learn them though. A lot of factors contributed to me getting it together before grad school but some of it was just a learning curve of how to manage. \n\n\\- I learned how to break down my work into smaller more-accomplishable blocks. For instance, I would outline major papers in advance and then focus myself JUST to the task of proving one claim at a time. I would utilize small blocks of time (this was much easier for me... you give me 4 hours to work and I will waste 3 of them) to accomplish smaller goals. I had my laptop with me everywhere. Waiting in the car line to pick up my kid = 1 paragraph. 20 minutes waiting for the color to set in the hair salon = read one section. If I did have a huge block of time, I would have to be strategic about each individual half hour of time and have a goal for it with allowable time for breaks in between. When I took my qualifying exams, I intentionally took it with a proctor who I knew wouldn't be phased when I got up and did squats and jumping jacks at my work station in between responses so I didn't lose my mind. I'm not sure these time management strategies will be perfect for EVERY person but I did learn myself well and knew what I needed.\n\n\\- I was very very very strict about scheduling. I'm pretty type B but you would never believe it if you saw my spreadsheet outlining my study time and what I needed to study and when. The thing was color coded. I was also very strict and consistent as far as what days/hours I worked on what. I knew I needed consistency. Yes, there were a few work crisis situations that came up but overall, I stuck to it. I built in two evenings of fun/family time that I rewarded myself with if I stuck to my schedule and met all of my goals. If not, those were work days to finish what I didn't accomplish. (This was damn good motivation. I think the only days that I missed this were because of illness).\n\n\\- I had my courses that I was teaching planned out in advance so all I really had to do for them was grade. I'm talking lessons fully planned with things printed in advance. I had PPTs completed before the semester even started with what activities we were doing to guide me through class and in advance, wrote notes to tell me what I needed to bring that day so I didn't have to think about anything. I would sometimes change/add to my lectures to reflect current events but the real work was done. It helped me focus my mind on doctoral work.\n\n\\- Because reading for me is either hyper focused or not at all, long reading assignments were harder for me, so I would do spreadsheets to keep myself focused where I sort of \"took notes\" at the end of each section. I would have key words/concepts, what source it was from, a page #, and a very basic definition or key point from that. Even if I didn't retain it all, it was helpful that I could just search my sheet later and know where it was located in my book to easily find it, but more importantly, it forced me to focus on the reading and notice when I was missing important concepts. (Usually if a book doesn't super interest me, I just zone out and miss important things without even noticing.) \n\n\\- I gave myself earlier deadlines than when the assignment was actually due knowing that there are sometimes just \"bad focus\" days when work wasn't going to happen. If they happened to coincide with a major paper, I was screwed. So if an assignment was due on a Thursday, I might make my own due date Tuesday (I actively did not write down the real ones... I didn't want to know because then I would believe I had more time) and then use the extra time to edit it again. \n\nWith all of that said, on the other side of it, having ADHD has probably made me a better professor in a lot of ways. It's made me more aware of how some of my students are struggling. I don't think it's easy but I know it's manageable. I have had colleagues complain about ADHD/ADD students and how they are lazy. I think it's garbage. It might look that way but it's a huge hurdle to overcome. It has made me more aware of busywork and think about which assignments are more tedious than useful. I choose more interesting reading assignments (when possible anyway) because info overload is real even in non-ADHD students and I want as best chance as possible that they will retain it. It's also made me a more lively and engaging lecturer because I have the attention span of a goldfish and I know I couldn't handle a lengthy boring lecture and refuse to teach one. So I guess that's a bonus. \n\nSo I guess in my case, I handled it but I also realize I'm one of the lucky ones who has a very manageable diagnosis. My partner has anxiety and he's an ICU nurse. It blows me away how he has trained himself to just shut off his mind and go into \"work mode\" when he has to. He might avoid entire social events or people but somehow he can push through it when he's on the floor knowing that him overcoming his mind could be the difference between someone's life or death. I'm amazed by him.",

At least where I've worked, those accommodations are updated often throughout someone's education.\n\nThere's this pervasive, ableist myth that accommodations for tests are some kind of cheat code, and it's just not true. If there ARE students out there \"gaming the system\" for a little extra time on tests, they're gaming a good dozen people or more, consistently, including drs/physios, psychs, the exam office, the proctors, etc, and putting up with  the kind of bullying and commentary from misinformed people too. All for the sake of an extra hour, or a standing desk, or a reader/writer, or the chance to eat/take insulin during the test. And at the end of all that, they're still getting about average grades relative to the other students. (though my guess is the ones that do well maybe score a little bit higher, as anyone would whose gone through the processes of getting assessed for accommodations and had learned where their weakest points are).\n\nOf course people with different abilities/strengths are going to function differently in the workplace, and approach their work in ways that are different to each other - someone might use Trello and someone else might use oldschool notetaking and someone else with a carpal tunnel might do better with audio memos and reminders. Undergrad tests are like expecting all of those people to use only one method (like oldschool notetaking) and then judging their relative productivity on their ability to do that one thing. It's silly and unrealistic, but it's something that works \"ok\" and is manageable in a uni environment.\n\nI can't think of any place in the \"real world\" that requires you to sit down and present a wide breadth of your knowledge in a finite space and time without access to any resources (notes, the internet, etc). Comparing a test situation to a real workplace environment just doesn't make sense. Finals are a really specific circumstance that test a really specific method of learning in really specific ways, and they're not analogs for someone's ability to function in the real world.\n\nLike if you can't trust the students, at least trust the myriad professionals and admin behind the decision to set up those accommodations. An if not, well, if those students aren't going to be able to function in a \"real\" workplace, than what's the harm in letting them get average grades in university?",

I do know that all accommodations for every student for every test are tracked, including start finish times, whether they use the accommodations provided, how often, and any unusual activity. Those times are reviewed by the exams office and disability services every time \n\nOf course, it's different in different circumstance - if you crash your bike and break your arm a day before the test they're not going to make you go through a full assessment. But even students with what would be considered straightforward \"physical\" stuff (e.g. taking insulin during the test) still go through the whole rigamarole when they register with disability, as far as I know.\n\nTo be honest I think the whole process is less about the students and more about the higher-ups. The opinion that students are \"gaming the system\" for special accommodations is pervasive throughout the uni and the wider perception. Disability services are constantly on the chopping block for cuts to staff and resources, so it's important they can defend themselves against these kinds of accusations to corruption. (Not that it helps with the perception of it as exploitable and full of fakers, much like any \"welfare\" system)",

What I and many others take issue with is the fundamental premise, that \"equal footing\" equating to \"equal outcomes\" is a sound objective. Why stop with ADHD? Why not give students from underprivileged backgrounds more time on exams? Students have a broad range of innate intelligence through no fault of their own, should we inversely weight exam times by IQ?\n\n\n> I can't think of any place in the \"real world\" that requires you to sit down and present a wide breadth of your knowledge in a finite space and time without access to any resources (notes, the internet, etc).

A person that can accomplish a task 2x or 10x faster than another is simply *better* at that task, and no amount of \"ableist\" re-framing changes that. I once wanted to be a professional athlete, but I simply wasn't good enough. I also dealt with crippling ADHD, and if I had gone the route of asking for special treatment I'd never have been successful in a phd program.",

Giving someone a bike doesn't make them inherently better or worse at getting from point A to point B than someone who started with one. Neither is giving someone a bicycle suddenly going to make them the #1 cyclist in the world, any more than you were able to become a professional athlete.\n\nfwiw, I made it through undergrad and my masters degree (after dropping out in grade 9 and hitting rock bottom) before being diagnosed in my 30s. I have no idea what my life would look like now if I had access to appropriate accommodations as a kid or young adult. I don't think I'd have gone for a PhD or be doing nearly as well as I am now without accommodations (medication is the biggest one), but on the flip side I wouldn't have developed a lot of discipline and drive that's helped me excel. (though, to be fair, a lot of that discipline/drive is driven by negativity and comes at the expense of my own well-being, so I'm not sure it's exactly a positive).\n\nKudos to you for making it through, sincerely, but your experience doesn't give you the authority to look down on or judge other people that weren't able to accomplish what you did with what you had. Just because you'd have been \"spoiled\" somehow by accommodations, doesn't mean others will too.",

If nothing else, if you end up needing some time off or a break it will help that it is for medical reasons. You should also be able to get accomodations if needed. Look for your school's accessibility office and talk to them.\n\nI started my graduate degree with undiagnosed ADHD and developed depression. I ended up on medical leave and started my degree over at a new school. So I would also encourage you to choose a school/environment that fits your learning style. For example: I discovered online classes are really hard for me. If I could go back and do it over, I would have taken classes on campus. A big school vs a little school might have a big impact on how well you manage.",

Autism is obviously not the same, but it effects every aspect of your life just the same. \n\nI don't take any meds and I only recently started reaching out for help because I was having severe panic attacks. The only thing I use to help my anxiety and ADHD is fidget toys.\n\nThere are some things that make me feel glad that I have ADHD though - because it's not ALL bad. For example, I can become very invested in a project and I will see it through to the end due to my obsession over it (of course that can also be very detrimental but so far it has only helped be succeed). My ADHD also gives me the energy I need to multitask a lot of things inside my head without even needing a calendar. Of course everyone is different... but I'm confident that there are things about your autism and ADHD that have gotten you this far and that will surely help push you through. \n\nOnce you can understand those aspects that help you, you need to start being aware of the aspects that are more detrimental so you can manage them. \n\nI cant tell you what sort of treatment you need, but it definitely helps talking to someone on a regular basis.
