So most companies really only do research that has application or development opportunities that will make them money.\n\nOn the flip side, governments don\u2019t want to fund research that will only help one company profit. When they do fund corporate research, it normally comes with stipulations about sharing outcomes and technology, etc.\n\nTo your point though, there are \u201ccompanies\u201d that exist mostly on federal funding but most are funded through DOD and they\u2019re non-profits (RAND, Mitre, Battelle).",

These companies will have full time grant writers, mostly PhD employees, and do lots of speculative research. To win the grants, especially NIH, they need a target product at the end of the research, though.  The companies tend to be small, hire primarily through university connections, pay less than average, and are highly unstable.",

      "text": "A company by law has to be a viable going concern - this means able to generate enough money to pay wages, suppliers and taxes etc. Grants do not cover all the costs of an organisation, so for example wouldn't cover the cost of HR and payroll. Nor should they. The taxpayer shouldn't be paying for a company's corporate functions. No one, research funders or investors, is going to give money to a company that may not be able to stay in business for the duration of the funding plus won't be able to provide any return on the investment by developing a product. Funders want RoI just as much as venture capitalists, just not in financial form back to them (or only indirectly through increasing GDP and then a possible increase in their budgets).\n\nUniversities and research institutes are different, they have multiple streams of income which ensure they are financially sustainable (more or less) and they are there as a public good, designed to do early stage research with some translation activity such as spin outs. Grant funding is specifically designed for this arena and universities and research institutes are set up to comply with the terms of funding and also cover the things that grants don't cover.",

Part of that is that they don't have the typical metrics of success reviewers are used to, like prior publications and a history of grant funding. They also tend to be kind of lousy at grant writing since they don't do it often. \n\n2) There are a lot strings attached to government research grants that companies don't want to deal with. There are a lot of restrictions on what grant money can be spent on, and if the government suspects you're breaking the rules they can audit you. Also anything patentable that comes out of the grant the government retains certain 'government purpose rights' to.",
