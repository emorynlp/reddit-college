  "title:": "I want to get a degree in sociology but work industry. Where could I work?",
  "text": "I want to get a degree, hopefully even a PHD. But reading about academia I don't think I'd fit in that world. Everything is interesting to me. Once I met a German tree grower that had come to Sweden to do business and I spent over an hour talking about trees with him. Academia seems to want to you to find a niche and to stick with it in order to even have the chance of making a decent career. Industry work seem more free.\n\nIt is said that the demand for sociologists is increasing but I'm kind of wondering where? What kind of industry jobs can you get with such a degree? Are there industry research positions? How would you get them?",

      "text": "There's quite a lot to unpick in here. Your post isn't very long or detailed but you seem to be suggesting you want a career where you can flit from one topic to another at will and where you aren't required to go in depth in to the topic. There are careers that have elements of this but I can't imagine a career with all elements. In academia you need to be producing novel intellectual outputs - to do that you need to develop deep expertise which is why you have a niche. However, you can choose your topics and you can have multiple areas of interest. \n\nIn commercial settings you're at the mercy of management and/or the client - you will have to work on what they want that week. You will have to rapidly develop expertise in a variety of topics, it won't be the in depth knowledge of academia, but you will be constrained in what you can look at and what the output is. It can be hugely interesting and when you get senior you can definitely influence the direction of work in the organisation but only up to a point. \n\nI may be being a bit unfair but \"everything is interesting to me\" is a bit of a red flag for \"I'm never going to fully commit to anything\". Finding lots of stuff interesting is fine but I do regularly see people who totally undermine their careers because they are unfocused with the task at hand and the moment something new appears are like a dog seeing a squirrel. You may need to think about a career versus things you can do as hobbies.",

              "text": "An MA teaches the basics of research methods. A PhD is doing your own project over a few years, usually by yourself in the social sciences. Most businesses won't be employing a person to do analyst roles/research/data science from scratch. They'd want you in a team. Hence an MA is usually enough.",

For eg if you want to get a job in a MNC as a kind of demographic analyst, then you might want to specialize in ethnography and fieldwork in your masters and PHd. \n\nP.s. my knowledge concerning this subject is very limited. It would be much better if you ask any subject experts or profs you might happen to know.",
