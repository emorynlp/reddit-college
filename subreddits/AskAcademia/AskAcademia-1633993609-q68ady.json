  "text": "Hey all - thanks for taking a minute to read this.\n\n\\[tl;dr - I have a long history working for a university as staff, and a  terminal degree, but an empty CV because I jumped right to the corporate  tech world. Wondering if I have a shot at transitioning back to  academia/teaching.\\]\n\nFor the past 7  years since grad school I've been working in the tech industry, in a  design/research capacity. To be frank, it's been financially lucrative,  (which doesn't matter, because I have a ton of student loans) but soul  crushing. I'm always looking for ways out, I'm at a particularly un-enjoyable company at the moment, and I'm going through cancer  treatment which adds an extra kick in the ass to all this. I have  hesitated to investigate getting back into academia, but it certainly  has some boons for me, so I'm curious what people with more experience  than me think..\n\nMy background:\n\nI  worked as a computer tech for a Big10 university for 15 years while I  did a handful of degrees. AS Computer Technology, BA Communication, MFA  Design. (some combination of Industrial Design and Interaction Design)  Minors in Anthropology and Religious studies. State budget cuts came in,  causing me to get RIFed at the end, leading me to teach a couple  sections of COM for a semester before getting out into tech design  agency work and then a string of corporate tech jobs. My goal with the  MFA was just to get a job, so I didn't pay much attention to building a  CV.. and my Thesis ended up being some manner of \"non-thesis option\",  even though I still had to write and defend a thesis. The topic was  transformational application of Interaction Design in a brick-and-mortar  retail business. My only research was my thesis, and a paper/annotated bibliography on electronics recycling behavior that I did in conjunction with my Anthropology minor. I did a talk at an American Studies  symposium.\n\nSince then, I have done  UX design (almost exclusively software, though I'm getting into service  design now) and while I've integrated research into my design practice  from the beginning, the last 3 years I've leaned heavier on it, having  UX research specific titles. I define strategy for human centered design  engagements, conduct research with users, lead stakeholder design  thinking activities, create visual design artifacts, and educate company  associates on user centered design.\n\nIn  the spaces between all that, I've managed a college radio station,  participated in community bicycle advocacy, been a bicycle mechanic,  completed a community planning course from the local department of  metropolitan development, and served on a few non-profit boards.\n\nI'd  love to get into teaching some manner of visual arts, anthropology, or sociology, and would especially love to get a job with an  interdisciplinary angle. I feel like the MFA might get my foot in the  door, but the empty, or at least very-nontraditional CV would put the  brakes on anything that started moving. I experienced first hand that a lot of visual arts instruction is just teaching students to use tools  based on a canned curriculum, so I'm thinking, how tough can it be?  ..but then I see job listings that are asking the moon for the most  basic adjunct gigs. (I also realize that it's rough in academia for  everyone right now and for the last while) Alternately, I see jobs that are in my wheelhouse, like \"design thinking instructor\" but they turn  out to require a non-design degree.\n\nAnyhow,  if you've managed to read through all that, I'd appreciate hearing your  thoughts. Is it a lost cause? Is there a path in? How might you  approach this if you were in my shoes?\n\nThanks",

      "text": "As timeaverage says its never 'too late' but there is a question of how much time/effort are you willing to put in to pursue this. Start looking at academic jobs you'd be interested in, apply for some and if you don't get them consider the feedback and make an assessment for what you need to do to be more competitive and whether you're willing to do that (most basic one would be - are you willing to do a PhD?).\n\nTBH based on what you've written I'm not sure how happy you'd be in academia, I think you'd find the silos too constricting for your style but you've got nothing to lose by sending off a few applications and seeing what happens.",

I think my perception is kind of skewed since I ended up working closely with a lot of professors who we're playing in interdisciplinary spaces; \"design\" was a hot topic at the time and they seemed happy to bring me into the fold.",

It will give you a better idea of what you are up against. If you haven\u2019t taught at all, it\u2019s going to be a tough order.\n\nSecond, you aren\u2019t going to be qualified for anthropology or sociology jobs, at least not in the US. Accreditors require instructors to have 18 graduate credit hours in the field, so you are going to need to focus on the area of your MFA.",

Those schools often have demand for practical coursework for that and are largely hiring people whose terminal degrees are things like yours - or they have alternate credentialing tracks because of the nature of the coursework.\n\nThat said, you're right that the entry-level job here is adjuncting and those jobs ask way more than they pay.",
