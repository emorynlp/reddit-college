  "text": "Hi, all. This is going to sound like a weird question. Basically, i\u2019m wanting to teach nursing students and take them to clinicals on a certain day of the week. At the same time however, I have been taking classes at the same school as a post bacc student. Has anyone ever done this before and is there a rule or anything as to being a student and an instructor at your same institution? It sounds a bit weird, I know. Just seeking some input. Thanks.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing. I guess it feels weird for me cause I am wanting to teach nursing, but will be taking classes for another degree that is not related to nursing. If I may ask, does your adjunct faculty position pay just as much as a regular instructor at your school? I know with TA positions they don\u2019t tend to make as much.",

              "text": "I\u2019m honestly not sure. I think they\u2019re technically paying me like a TA because of my grad student status (partial tuition remission and a stipend that I think comes out to $20 an hour for 10 hours of work per week), but everyone else who is teaching other sections of the course I am teaching already has a graduate degree.\n\nWhy the trepidation at teaching classes in a subject that you\u2019re not a student in? If you have the appropriate amount of knowledge to teach that stuff, then go for it. The department where I\u2019m adjuncting is tangentially related to what I\u2019m studying but it\u2019s not what my degree is in. It\u2019s not even a class I had taken before. If they\u2019ll accept you then who cares?",
