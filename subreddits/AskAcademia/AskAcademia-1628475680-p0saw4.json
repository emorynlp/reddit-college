  "text": "I am a master engineering student in Australia (Uni of Melbourne). \n\nIs it possible for me to get a scholarship in PhD with only 75 WAM (GPA 6.0/7 or 3.0/4)? I dont have any publications yet.\n\nI heard that doing some literature review can increase my chances. Where should I start?\n\n Thank you so much!",

      "text": "Hey there, I'm a UniMelb masters alumni as well, though not in engineering but another STEM degree. I graduated with H1 first class honours (81 WAM) and wasn't able to get a scholarship. From what I understand, the universities only accept scholarship PhD students and don't do self funded PhDs. I had better luck applying to other unis, especially in the UK where I did land a PhD scholarship at Edinburgh",
