  "title:": "How do you regain your passion for a subject after a stressful grad school experience?",
  "text": "I am fortunate to have a full time teaching job in my field after earning my Masters. The trouble is I had some bad experiences with my PI and my whole thesis experience being very stressful and not getting the support he promised when he asked to be my PI. I graduated, but never felt confident in my learning. On top of that, my husband died the year after I graduated and I suddenly became a single mom with all the household duties my husband used to do.\n\n Now it's 2 years later and I have a very flexible teaching schedule and the luxury to learn my subject more in depth at a leisurely pace and I find the whole idea of digging into a new project to get better at it just makes me feel stressed out and avoidant. I have undergrad students who are passionate and doing amazing projects while I have imposter syndrome and wanting to do cool things, but lack motivation to roll up my sleeves and dig in to the difficult intellectual work. I feel like I'm just phoning it in.\n\nHow can I learn to love my subject again and put aside all the anxiety and avoiding behaviors? I really want to fall in love again with my work!",

      "text": "Hey OP, probably not the advice you're looking for but you're doing great. Keep focusing on your and the kid's well being.\n\nAs far as enjoying the subject again, i went and bought the books i wanted to read but never had the time to during grad school. Try different mediums too: podcasts for instance. Don't necessarily try to go deep as far as you were before, don't take notes reading or try to remember, just focus on enjoying what you're listening to or reading.",

      "text": "As someone currently suffering from imposter syndrome and working for a uni post masters, I would say to take your time. You've been through a lot, are still going through a lot, and it's 2020 besides. Be kind to yourself. Make space for yourself. Focus on other aspects of your life/job (like maybe working more with those passionate undergrads) or dont-- whatever feels healing for you right now. \n\nI know it might feel like you need to be a thousand miles ahead in the academic world, but says who? If your boss or whoever is in charge of keeping you employed hasn't said there's an issue, I would proceed at the pace that works for you, and try to do things you do enjoy. Maybe you'll discover some new aspect of your work that's more interesting for now. I did. \n\nI've learned a lot by giving things a rest. I've also learned that I was lucky to have any passion in the first place, and if it returns I'll be grateful. But for now, I'm trying to learn patience and gratitude for where I am on the journey. I hope sharing this helps!",

      "text": "Hey OP, I had a similar experience before my last job. I was so insecure from my advisor's behavior that my first year teaching was horrible. I don't think that's your case, what's great already.\n\nBut regaining passion takes time. I felt better about my field when I read good journals or went to good conferences (not an option right now). Being exposed to people talking about their own research actually gave me light on how to repage my old projects and start a new one. I hope you can get back on that horse!",

It's taking longer than I had anticipated. I've found that taking up a hobby or two (in my case cooking and brewing beer) helps a lot. Also reading widely, especially outside your field.",

      "text": "I imagine the best thing to do is to first determine what is the reason that thinking about a new project makes you feel stressed out and avoidant. Is it fear that you will fail? Concerns that others will judge you? Worried about getting attached to something that you won\u2019t be able to finish? Or that you won\u2019t have time to dedicate to the project? I don\u2019t think you can really move forward without doing some excavation of what exactly it is that is holding you back. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to ask yourself whether you really are passionate about these subjects anymore. Just because you were at one time doesn\u2019t mean you have to continue to be. Maybe there are other subjects that are more deserving of your passion and energy now.",

      "text": "You have been through a lot, celebrate the small victories - of having a flexible teaching schedule, of managing a household on top of that, of emerging from a stressful and traumatic graduate school experience with a degree (I know many who couldn't make it to the finish line).  \n\nI had a pretty rocky time during graduate school for similar reasons - academia is rife with PIs who are horrible managers of people, and many of us emerge with various amounts of impostor syndrome, maladaptive anxiety and procrastination / avoidance behaviours that either emerged or were amplified during that experience. What I have found that can sometimes help re-engage is some tricks suggested by cognitive behavioural therapy - try to distance yourself from the negative self-talk in your head that is constantly telling you you are not good enough - learning that that voice is just one part of me, and that I don't have to always listen to it - has helped me to emerge from deep depression where I just thought the whole world was against me - into some semblance of normal productive life. Another way to phrase it is say think of what is the worst possible thing that could happen, and what is the best possible thing that could happen - the reality will most likely be somewhere inbetween those two extremes. I would previously think of the worst case scenario, and then assume that is what was going to happen, which can sometimes be a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nNow I can't necessarily say I have it \"all figured out\" - I still struggle with anxiety at times, my impostor syndrome has subsided somewhat as I've gotten a bit more comfortable (at least with \"faking it until you make it\" / and getting feedback that I was actually good at some of the things I purport myself to be good at); though there are rungs as with anything - once you stop comparing yourself to your peer group, you start comparing with leaders in your field, which is - once again, your contribution to society is judged purely on your own merits, not on some mythical comparison to others - and talk therapy and medication are also things I am not afraid to lean on and use when necessary.  \n\nYou're doing amazing, I'm sure your kids don't see anyone but a supermom trying her very best, and ditto for your students, so keep up the good, hard, work, and you will get to a better place.  Even giving yourself permission to feel the anxiety / live with the avoidance, and not beat yourself up about it further, is a small victory - three years is not that long in terms of getting over a traumatic grad school experience - it probably took me 5 years to crawl out of my post-grad school depression and impostor syndrome and into a better space.",
