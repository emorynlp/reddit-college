  "text": "My undergrad congregation was last week and it made me really emotional\n\nI never got to celebrate a formal graduation ceremony last year when I finished uni because of how strict the rules are in the Uk. \n\nI stayed on at the same uni to do a PhD and physically being there with all my old friends and lecturers made me so emotional that I\u2019m still thinking about it now. \n\nIt somehow managed to be the best and most emotional day of my life and it felt like I finally got to celebrate the degree I earned. \n\nIn a way though I\u2019m sad to have left behind that undergraduate life and I feel the spark I once had for my subject has now started to dwindle a bit. Maybe it\u2019s because when I elected to to a PhD I didn\u2019t realise unlike undergraduate studies, PhD studies leave you on your own with very little assistance. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just being too emotional but I literally nearly cried as I walked out of the hall in my gown and mortarboard lol",

      "text": "No. Absolutely not.\n\nAny \"education\" or schooling before my PhD was an absolutely chore and bore. Only when I first get my \"research\" job, which started as an undergrad Honor project, that I broke out and found what I study, learn, and work actually interesting.\n\nI like to *do* stuff and not sitting through lectures and working on problems with existing, right or wrong, answers. I feel like we don't get the K-12 and undergraduate education quite right. We don't get students to engage in repeatable practice exercises that are actually realistic to what, for example, researchers do.\n\nWhat I would think of as the \"correct\" way to educate? I suppose it will be similar to how military will ideally train their officers. Officers' main job is to war and the existing \"best\" way to do it is war game: to fight a hypothetical war/battle with certain mechanics and constraints. It's a fascinating subject about how officers can be trained with war game and I feel that the civilian world doesn't have quite the same.",
