  "title:": "Should I take a \"B\" level recommendation letter from a (European) \"famous\" professor?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI went to a study-abroad exchange program in Europe two years ago and took a course with a famous professor and got B in his course (it was the second semester after changing my major to math). I really like his research fields and intend to do that in graduate school as well. This year, said program offered online courses and I participated in his \"research course.\" In the research project, I was mainly responsible for organizing and managing the manuscript on Overleaf, communicating with others, writing not-so-technical parts of the paper, and submitting to arxiv. My regret is that I did not write many proofs in this math paper.\n\nRecently, I asked him if he would be willing to writing me a good letter, he told me that he's willing to \"write a 'B' level recommendation.\" I do not have much interaction experience with European professors, so I was wondering that should I take this opportunity to let he write this letter for me?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n*Edit*: I intend to apply to PhD programs in math in Canada, European, and some Asian countries. I may also apply one or two MSc programs.",

They can think they've written a glowing reference only for an American reviewer to think it's a tepid endorsement. Definitely do not get a European \"B grade\" letter.",
