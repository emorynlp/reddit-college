  "title:": "Using rateMyProfessor to get an idea about potential PIs?",
  "text": "I've been experimenting with using RMP as a tool to get a idea about each PI that I am interested in potentially working with, as a way to rule out potentially toxic (sexist, creepy, or condescending) people.\n\nObviously I'm skipping past all the undergrad whining about \"this class was impossible\", and looking at trends of comments about the PI's personality - whether there are multiple people saying \"great guy, passionate, but grades hard\", vs \"unhelpful, unapproachable, condescending, confrontational\". It seems so far the comments about each person tend to be pretty consistent.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else who has looked for PIs/labs to work with, or anyone who is a professor themselves, has used this tool with success to get an idea about the personality/problems of your colleagues? Does it line up generally well with the person's personality?\n\n(To any professors, I mean no disrespect. I'm an international student from a third world country trying to go for grad school in USA, and as I'm from a poor background, this will most likely be my one shot at a graduate degree. I just can't risk ending up with a potentially toxic PI who has major biases or personality problems, or doesn't care about the students they mentor at all).\n\nEdit: I really, really do not understand why this post and every single one of my comments in it is being downvoted. Yes, I am a foreigner from Argentina who doesn't know how US academia works. Is that so bad? Is this not the right place to ask? Have I been disrespectful in some way??",

      "text": "RMP probably won\u2019t have a strong correlation to whether someone will be a good PI. A lot of graduate faculty are seen as (or are) much more approachable and easier to work with as grad students than undergrads, and a lot of them come off as condescending in lower-level courses without actually being condescending (or at least not meaning to).\n\nIt might be useful to screen out the REALLY extreme cases, but anything else and it\u2019s likely to be as much projection on the part of undergrads as anything else.",

It's good to hear many faculty come off as more approachable at the graduate level; that does confirm that undergraduate laziness/immaturity is leading to at least part of the perception :) I'd like to think that most PIs are good people, and good to work with, and it's just a few bad apples in the bushel I'd need to avoid.",

              "text": "I don't think it is necessarily UG laziness and immaturity. Some professors are much better one in one rather than in a large class, and you can take full advantage of that as someone's grad student. Grad students are of course also very interested in the particular topic, and UGs aren't necessarily and some professors feed off that energy. \n\nI also know some professors that are rated the other way around because their GOAL is to be thought of as funny and nice by undergrads but really they just don't care about teaching, whether at the grad or undergrad level. So I would be really cautious trying to separate the signal from the noise in RMP. More reliable to ask current or former students.",

Just reach out to current students & check their recent pubs with the effort you could use looking at people's RMP.\n\nNot all PIs teach, and even so, it may not be a good measure unless it's an extreme extreme case since it's sampling volunteered voices (content ones usually do not post), not to mention that the perceived personality would vary depending on the evaluator of that personality.\n\nThat said, Idk what difference it makes for you intl student. A toxic PI is a toxic PI whether you're domestic or international. Now I'll make this worse and add racism to the list to further make my case above (who knows? maybe the ones praising are of the same race, and vice versa. And no, I'm not insinuating all or even some are. But with the post history of this subreddit containing some interesting people, I'd say it's not impossible). See my point?\n\nIn case of a toxic PI: find another lab, overcome and use the lessons you learned to become a force for good, or succumb and slowly become the monster you fought for so hard against. Even the okay-to-good ones are hard to deal with at their or your worst times.",

But you can definitely learn a couple of things about people there. Say, you see some guy has reviews for over 10 years, and all students are saying that the guy has some issue. I would say there is a good chance that this is true. Specially if the people complaining have good grades for the course.\n\nMy supervisor is a super nice guy. His classes aren't the best, so the reviews aren't glowing. But I could tell from the reviews that he's a caring and supportive person. That proved to be true. And there was a guy who was the opposite. The reviews said bad things, and I didn't pay much attention. Unfortunately, he was in fact toxic.\n\nI would say, read them, but take them with a grain of salt. At the same time, don't ignore the red flags.\n\nAlso you said \" I'm an international student from a third world country trying to go for grad school in USA, and as I'm from a poor background, this will most likely be my one shot at a graduate degree.\"\n\nI'm sensing that you might be lacking some self-confidence. Coming from a fellow underprivileged international student, PLEASE do away with this mentality. That will only hold you back. I know this is difficult. It has taken me a long time to get over that. But try to focus on how strong you have been and how much you have accomplished, not all the fancy training and experience you didn't have access to. They are not any better than you. And please don't say sorry for not knowing how things work yet.\n\nI wish you the best of luck.",

Your comment I feel really understood the heart of where I am coming from, and what I am worried about.\n\nIndeed I'd been thinking of myself lowly for my background, and thinking a certain level of deference would be expected of me, if only for my background and difference in training compared to other students. I thought I'd be lucky to have any chance to get in anywhere. It's so difficult to change when these insecurities are ingrained, but I guess the path to success is to try to show I am as worthy as anyone else, eh :)",
