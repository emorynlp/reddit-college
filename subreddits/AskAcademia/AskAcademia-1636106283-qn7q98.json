  "text": "Hi! \nIn about a week and a half, I\u2019m going to have my first PhD interview, and I\u2019m already nervous/excited about it. I\u2019ve been trying to get a PhD for about a year and a half. However, thanks to corona, every position has had 200+ applicants, so it\u2019s taken me a while to get from shortlisted to having an actual interview. As such, I was wondering if I could get some overall guidance on what to expect or words of wisdom.\n\nAs a background, I have a BA in English lit, an MA in cultural analysis, and an MA in communication for development. The PhD I\u2019m having an interview for is in humanities at a Swedish university. The interview itself will consist of a short presentation about my project followed by Q&A session and an interview. However, I don\u2019t really know how many interviews to expect or how soon I\u2019ll have a response.",

      "text": "COngrats on the interview.\n\nDon't lose sight of the fact that this is as much about you finding out atbout them, as it is them about you. There can be a tendency - because PhD offers are so few and far between - to think that as soon as one comes along you need to jump at it because it;s what's there.\n\nBut you need to bare in mind that a PhD is you signing up to work with a specific person on a specific topic for several years. And when you come out of it you need to ahve hit the ground running and had a positive experience with good outputs if you actually want to take it anywhere. AS such, it is imperative that you ahve a supervision team you can get on with, a project you are genuinely interested in, and a funding and organisational structure which is going to give you the training opportunities, collaborative opporutnities, and netowrking opportunities that make the difference between \"I did a PhD\" and \" After completing my PhD I was successful in gaining a career in the direction I wanted\".\n\nAsk questions. THink about what training opportunities there are going to be. Is the project part of a wider research group? How much control are you going to have on the direction of the project? Are there any projects operating in parallel at the institution that you would be working alongside? What would are the supervisory teams ideas about what a \"successful outcome\" for this project looks like? etc.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask difficult questions.",

I did a fair bit of research on the department before submitting my proposal, and I will inevitably have some control on the direction since it\u2019s not a part of an existing project. But, I think it\u2019s easy to forget that this is also about me figuring out if I would want to work there.",

One thing to note: it is not rare that your supervisor will be far from being an expert in what you exactly want to do. You will have complete control of the project \u2014as long as you meet some national-set objectives checked once a year at the 'ISP meeting' by your supervision team and reference person.",

          "text": "I think all these recommendations are great! As others have suggested as well, use this opportunity to show who you are and what your research interests and ideas are but also to ask questions yourself. Regarding courses, you will likely define together with your supervisory team which courses would suit you best and which ones to take based on your individual study plans, so I would not expect too many specific answers already during the interview, but rest assured that career development is well thought through in Scandinavia (from my perspective at least; I\u2019m Prof in Sweden and before that I was in the German academic system).\n\nIf I may add one recommendation: maybe also use this opportunity to get to know other researchers at the department as well, even if as part of separate discussions. I assume that your presentation is for the entire department (typically the whole collegium is invited) and I personally always appreciate if candidates themselves show interest in getting to know their future potential colleagues (e.g. by asking if it would be possible to know more about ongoing research and if it would be possible to have follow-up meetings with other students). \n\nBest regards and enjoy the meeting!",

      "text": "First, congrats. I am not in humanities but in a Swedish university. I have served in PhD-position interview committees in STEM and have taken a supervision course where my partners were from humanities and social sciences. The Swedish system is very particular. You are by law funded and considered both an employee and a student.\\* This means that your interview is actually as a big deal as hiring a postdoc or a research engineer. If you are successful, you will be treated and expected to participate in departmental activities, e.g. planning days, staff meetings, etc as any faculty would! Also, unlike other countries, it is almost impossible to 'kick out' a PhD student. his means that your interview is actually as a big deal as hiring a postdoc or a research engineer.\n  \nTypically, we do one round of interviews. After all the interviews are done, the hiring committee decides who to offer the position and a 'Beslut' ('Decision') is drafted for the Head of the Department (HoD). The Beslut outlines who got invited to the interview round (or at least provide a number of candidates interviewed), which merits were assessed, and who got the position. For PhD students, there is also an additional step here: the HoD needs to formally accept the student to the graduate program. The Beslut document is made available to ALL candidates after the successful candidate has accepted the position. Typically, you should expect to hear back within a week at most.\n  \nHumanities open most of their position by receiving funding from national grad-school programs. A part of that funding might also be paid by teaching funds, meaning that the student is expected to participate in teaching activities. Unlike the Anglican world, PhD students here not only lecture but can even run entire courses by themselves. In my opinion, you should use the interview as an opportunity to get clarifications on who is paying your funding, if there are any expected deliverables, if you are expected to take courses at other universities, do teaching (and how much), etc etc. It is always good to show real interest to the position.\n\n  \nIn the actual interview, you should expect both 'soft' questions (e.g. why a PhD, do a SWOT analysis, etc) and 'hard' questions (i.e. questions related to your project proposal and previous skills). My best advice is: show enthusiasm and don't try to 'bullshit your way'; just say 'I do not know.'\n\n*Swedish PhD students are much luckier than they think: they get an industry-comparable salary with annual raises, paid vacation, paid sick and parental leave, etc etc.",
