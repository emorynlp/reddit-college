  "text": "I've been in academia a few years since achieving my PhD, and I don't know if I can sustain the level of expected output forever without making huge sacrifices in other areas of my life. So this got me thinking that this may not be a forever thing for me. Is anyone else in the same boat? If so, what's your exit plan? What are your plans for the future?",

That way, they write 1 or 2 articles a year, ended up with several publications, all of them with several citations (this was as much as I could understand by then, almost 10 years ago).\n\nI thought that was unethical. Now I see it's necessary.\n\nThey were all from different countries, so it counted as internationalization and it was published in English, Spanish and sometimes French. Now I appreciate the genius of that collaboration.",

Consequently, SAGE scrutinised further the co-authors of and reviewers selected for Peter Chen\u2019s papers, these names appeared to form part of a peer review ring. The investigation also revealed that on at least one occasion, the author Peter Chen reviewed his own paper under one of the aliases he had created.\"*\n\nThat's quite clearly  much worse than a ring of genuine academics agreeing to cite and co-author each other.  That's also highly unethical, but I'd argue on a very different level to creating fake aliases in order to manipulate the peer review process",

              "text": "Hey! Sorry, I realized I saved this comment and never responded. Check out my response to Ass_Ripper0425 (lol) below about my job search process, which unfortunately felt a little haphazard with a serendipitous ending rather than a finely-executed plan. \n\nI'm now doing work for an EduTech company building digital educational materials and assessments, primarily centered around games. It involves a lot of things new to me - especially a huge shift towards cognitive pysch, the learning/assessment world in general, and working on more rapid deadlines - but also a lot of older skills like experimental design (for coachability testing, equivalence testing, usability testing, etc), data analysis, literature reviews on new topics, writing up papers, and presentation of that work. \n\nThough it's been an adjustment to be working with tighter deadlines when we need a product out for a client (i.e. trying to not let perfect be the enemy of the good), it's really awesome having a tangible product being built, engaging in rapid brainstorming sessions, working with people on other teams (data science, engineering, product management, etc), and frankly (and this probably sounds a bit gross) having those people respect me for my expertise and defer to my opinion due to my degree and background. To me, having a product being made and distributed feels way more fulfilling than writing a publication someone might read every few months. The pay, job security, and work-life balance are all way better as well.   \n\nIn terms of culture, I also like it better. As mentioned, it's nice to feel respected and like I play a role in a team of people with varying skills, rather than feel like I am being constantly judged by my peers. I also think the type of people I work with are a bit more... motivated? engaged? not sure what the word I'm looking for here is, but it feels less lethargic than in academia since everyone is working together as a team on a shared goal rather than atomized individuals doing the same thing in parallel. Obviously YMMV, but I'm a big fan of the company I work at and the focus they place on developing a sense of community and comradery.\n\nAs I said to the other commenter, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Happy to help out as much as I can, even if it's just by sharing my experiences. Good luck!",

              "text": "Hey! Sorry, I bookmarked this comment and forgot about it until recently. Unfortunately, though I wish I had some really good advice to give, I feel like I kind of stumbled upon my current position.\n\nI was primarily looking through job postings for tech companies that needed people with experience in data analysis or experience in psychology, but my hard skills were not always up to snuff (and my lack of industry experience didn't help). However, I generally kept myself open to anything and everything, and searched job boards (mostly LinkedIn) for keywords pertaining to my skillset. A few recruiters for management consulting companies reached out to me, and I interviewed with them as well. I also found a role as an adjunct at a small college so that I could fill the gap in my resume while I continued to search, though I wasn't opposed to seeing if a full-time teaching job would be a better version of an academic lifestyle for me. \n\nI wound up finding an EduTech company on LinkedIn looking for \"learning scientists,\" and my background in memory CogNeuro research and college teaching certification gave me enough credibility to convince them I had something to offer. I love my current job and have learned a lot, and I feel like I am now in a much better place to look for industry jobs should I need to again.\n\nAnyway, I guess my biggest pieces of advice are 1) to keep your mind open to any and all options, and 2) think about how you can reframe your skillset to be appealing to whatever position you are applying to fill. I was recommended a book called [*So What Are You Going To Do With That?*](https://www.amazon.com/What-Are-You-Going-That/dp/0374526214), and though it wasn't quite as helpful as I would have hoped, it did get my wheels turning on the mentality I'd need to have for this paradigm shift, and it gave me a bit of hope that I'd find an interesting application for my skills.\n\nSorry if this isn't super helpful, but if you have any questions please feel free to reach out anytime. Seriously. The transition was one of the hardest times of my life, but I am **far** happier and more fulfilled now than I was doing research in graduate school. Happy to help someone out with this process as much as I can.",

My work-life balance is infinitely better (I really didn't have balance before). My work environment is not toxic (there is 1 or 2 somewhat toxic people but I don't have to interact with them much). My PhD lab was super toxic. The pay and the benefits are also better. My husband used to get on my case about how much I worked before (work at home in the evening/night; go in on weekends/holidays; work at home on the weekend). Now, if I need to go in on a weekend or do something at home in the evening or weekend, he does not mind so much 1 because I don't do this any where near as frequently as when I was in academia and 2 because apparently I am clearly less anxious and more happy than I was before.\n\nMy former advisor was super mad when I left. She wanted me to stay for at least 1 more year in her lab and apply for the NIH F32. I just couldn't take it anymore. So what, my name got burried in the middle of the lab's last publication when I know that I contributed way more than most poeple ahead of me on the author list. At least if someone questions the veracity of the data, it's not my problem anymore.",
