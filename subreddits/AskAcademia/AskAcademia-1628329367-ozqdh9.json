  "title:": "Planning to leave academia after getting my PhD - how to overcome guilt and lack of motivation?",
  "text": "(throwaway account)\n\nWell, the title says it all. I'm a MA who's halfway through the PhD program, currently employed as a PhD researcher by the university. In my country, this is a highly privileged position that will give a promising start to a successful academic career. Until this point, I've been doing it all to gain experience in all important parts of the job - in addition to doing my research and writing the dissertation, I'm also teaching, applying for funding, gaining international experience etc., the usual stuff.\n\nHowever, I've lost my interest in an academic job after witnessing or experiencing the dark and toxic sides of academia. Constant rejection, scarce resources, insane amount of competition, post docs working until exhaustion... The people I work with are super nice, but I've met more a\\*\\*holes than in any work environment or community before. TBH, I'm a sensitive and emphatic person and not interested in hardening myself to endure in this environment. Before starting my PhD, I believed I could handle it.\n\nI have a side business that I can turn into a full-time job with the same amount of effort as continuing in academia. That is most likely what I am going to do after finishing my PhD in a couple of years. After making this decision, I've been lacking the motivation to do anything else than the bare minimum that is required from me. I  feel really guilty because of the former - my voluntary teaching efforts etc. have been greatly valued up to this point. Also, my supervisor has invested a lot of time and energy to secure me this position and a possible post doc.\n\nHow should I deal with this internal conflict? How do I stay motivated through all of this? I can't quit right now because of my contract and don't even plan to.\n\nAny insight into my situation is highly appreciated.",

      "text": "I think you need to reframe the situation.\n\nYou\u2019re not leaving because of any personal failure to \u201chandle it\u201d. You\u2019re leaving because academia is not putting a competitive offer (for postdoc, for a career) on the table. \n\nIt\u2019s the employer\u2019s responsibility to offer benefits to make their job posting a competitive choice. Academia has not managed to do this, at least not for you and many others. The benefits being offered are not good enough for the work that\u2019s required. Maybe if the job were better, you might take it. But it isn\u2019t better. \n\nThe ball is in their court.\n\nAs for your guilt, I think it\u2019s the department\u2019s own fault if they set the minimum standard too low. A lot of PhD programmes have shockingly low standards if you only look at what is strictly required for the thesis. People tend to do more because they\u2019re chasing that academic career, but if that isn\u2019t you, the wiser thing would be to spend your extra time making yourself more employable generally. Businesses can flop so you don\u2019t want that to be your only option. Getting some extra (minor) qualifications in relevant areas or doing an industry internship would be a good idea.\n\nAnd as to whether or not you should quit: a PhD is a very rare opportunity to improve yourself and your employable skills without having a gap on your CV. You\u2019re free to structure your time as you see fit, and since the minimum standard is so low, you can have a lot of free time. You leave with a qualification *and* you have the freedom to focus on other things. So unless you\u2019re really suffering, I think it\u2019s absolutely worth a couple of years of \u201cmeh\u201d to stick it out.",

          "text": "Thank you. I like your way of reframing the situation and it hits the nail in its head - I am still open to potential postdoc opportunities. And yes, the minimum standard is really low and during the pandemic I have felt like I could quit working at all and no one would even notice, lol.\n\nI actually have a third option; I'm qualified for a field in the public sector and have worked there after finishing my master's. I have too many options outside the academia and maybe that's part of the problem.",

This was a disappointment to my advisor who thought everyone should go into academia, but I did what I needed to do to finish my thesis, while concentrating my extra effort on building experience that would be relevant to the career I wanted. I didn't kill myself with 12 hour days in the lab 7 days a week. You're under no obligation to stay in academia.",

      "text": "You definitely should not feel guilty. Everyone understands the current academic situation and no one would blame you. Your advisor also gained profit from your PhD, and you are not going to be the first and last PhD who decided to change the environment. It is important, however that you finish it \ud83d\ude09\n\nAbout motivation. If you really decided to quit, you don't have to be too strategic about your choices anymore. Of course you should finish your PhD, but now you can have more fun with projects. You can take riskier projects, ask more interesting questions, look for more unusual interdisciplinary collaborations. If the unemployment sword is not hovering over your head, you can use this to your advantage to get more professional fulfilment from the academia. Just start playing and tinkering with your own ideas, and the motivation will likely to come back.",

Please note, I don't say you owe it to them to give it your all.  \n\nYou cannot live your life just doing what you think will make other people happy and being afraid of their (unreasonable) expectations. If your supervisor is a decent person they will want you to go and have a career that brings you satisfaction, if they are an AH and blow up at you for not going on to have an academic career, well they're an AH and you can't be responsible for their AH behaviour. \n\nFunnily enough the best revenge and the best thank you are the same thing:  go live a happy, successful life - whatever happy and successful mean to you, not what they mean to anyone else.",

      "text": "I'm in no way opposed to people getting out of academia, but I think the primary question in your case is whether it's absolutely certain you, in your particular situation, actually should and will, in the long term, want out. Having a dip in the PhD is very normal, especially when you start seeing the rotting underbelly for the first time after being relatively starry eyed. But the problem with unfair systems and the assholes that thrive in them, who are everywhere but I do think they might indeed have infested academia in an exceptional way, is when they have power/status relative to you. If you are set up to actually possibly \\*win\\* the competition and get into a strong position, you might (a) have a good time rather than a bad time, and (b) maybe be able to make a difference from the inside. Would it maybe be worth exploring that and quitting only as soon as it's clear you're not going to be one of the \"haves\", or ending up somewhere where you don't \\*really\\* have to change yourself to survive? Having some strategic habits to deal with the assholes isn't a bad life skill to develop in general, in or out of academia.\n\nIt depends I guess on whether you enjoy the core work you'd potentially be doing, if everything goes well, and if you might lose opportunities for the side business if you delay switching to it. Maybe you could combine things initially?",
