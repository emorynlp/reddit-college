  "title:": "How to research a topic when there's very limited literature but one spot-on MA thesis is out there?",
  "text": "Hi all, \n\nI have a very specific question/situation. I would like to embark on my first independent research on my own time, of which I currently have plenty. I also have a PhD and research experience.\n\nLet me explain the situation on a fictional example:\n\nLet's say I'm interested in the topic \"depiction of pilots in 90ies action movies\". I did a first round of  literature search (Google scholar) and found a handful of somewhat relevant publications on \"aviation in media\" or \"the fascination of flying in 20th century literature\". It's clear that it's not exactly a hot topic, but I'm okay with that as I'm doing it for personal interest only, although I do hope to publish it at some point in some form.\n\nWith the available literature, I would probably have to make the connection between \"90ies action movies\" and \"media\" to acknowledge previous works. I can certainly deal with that.\n\nHowever, I also found a recent masters thesis that pretty much did all the ground work on \"pilots in action movies\". As you'd expect, there was a plenty of breadth, but not as much critical reflection or connection to a wider context. I looked up the supervisor and their research interests seem to be tangentially related at best (\"history of media studies\", say). \n\nHow do I go about pursuing my \"Pilots in 90ies action movies\" interest without pretending that thesis didn't exist? Do I cite it? Do I ask the supervisor for a collaboration even though they don't seem to be doing anything related at this time? Do I inquire whether they plan to publish anything about it?\n\nI have never been in a situation where there was virtually no literature except one piece that was almost exactly what I was looking to do.\n\nShould I become much more specific? Say \"female air force pilots in 90ies action movies direct-to-video releases\" or something? I'm hesitant about that approach because going into so much detail when the bigger picture has not been properly described yet seems a bit odd.\n\nI'm grateful for any insight on how to approach this (and sorry for the somewhat silly example).",

                          "text": "I'm also from Europe and I have the same experience. During my BA we were always discouraged from using MA theses as a source in our papers. I think there are broadly speaking 2 reasons:\n\n1. You can't easily judge the quality of a MA thesis. An MA thesis is only judged by a few professors and either that student wrote a great thesis or they barely passed, but you can't know which is the case. Needless to say it is very different from an article you find in a journal that underwent peer review.\n2. MA theses are usually hard to find: even if you cite them, the people who read your paper will have a hard time finding the source.\n\nAt one point I also found a MA thesis that I wanted to use as a source. The thing is, I knew that the person who wrote this thesis went on to have a career in academia. So obviously the MA thesis couldn't have been bad. In fact it was a very well written thesis. I also confirmed this with the professor for the course I wrote the paper for, but I still wasn't allowed to use the MA thesis as a source. They basically told me to use the sources that are referenced in the MA thesis instead of the MA thesis itself and to find relevant literature from these sources: so look at the sources then look at the sources of the sources and continue digging deeper until you have all the relevant information.\n\nEdit: I feel like you could/should mention it though. For example, saying that there is very little information available about this topic except for this MA thesis. I just wouldn't use it to make any scientific claims.",

As you note, those kinds of mappings are not very ambitious and the arguments in them are (appropriately) less dimensional than one that is complex and ambitious enough to motivate and propel a PhD project.",

One notable work is a master's thesis by ___, completed at XYZ University. Their work [describe the paper's overall purpose/research questions. However, [respectfully describe its limitations/how your work is different].\" It provides great context for the work at hand, and I've seen similar things done when extant research is very limited.\n\nLlike others have said, look at the works cited in the thesis as well to get a better idea of possibly relevant  research. It may even spark your imagination on other/different avenues to search. With new/under-researched topics, you have to just do your best with tangential/peripheral work. Think about prevailing/common theories, the topic's major concepts or foci (e.g., media, film, aviation/pilots in popular culture, military pilots - or just military leadership/presentation in general - in pop culture or film, perhaps gender-related issues like your example of female air force pilots).
