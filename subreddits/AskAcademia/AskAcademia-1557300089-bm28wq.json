  "title:": "Am I the asshole (AITA) here?",
  "text": "**TLDR:** I feel like an asshole for refusing to help a junior female researcher simply because she has a jackass for an advisor but, I don't want to be exploited without any adequate payback. AITA?\n\nI am a Researcher (female) (equivalent to a research Asst. Prof) in a Northern European country, in the STEM/Sustainability field. I attended the premier conference of the modelling method/methodology I use for my research last year and made quite a few friends. One of them was a Ph.D researcher (female) who was struggling with her modelling work because she was not getting effective supervision from her supervisor. He was not an expert in the field of quantitative modelling and she did not have enough funding to learn it from anyone or anywhere. The reason why we became friends was mainly because we both used the modelling method in the same sub-field, and I was also able to give her pointers on the field that I am an expert in. I even took a look at her model during breaks in the conference and we exchanged numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this March, she contacted me asking if I will help her by looking at her model. She also mentioned that she was feeling stressed that she won't be able to finish her Ph.D by 2019 November, since she needed this model working for her to publish her as of yet not published 3rd paper. I agreed to look at it, and did so within a week. The model had some issues. Then we had a Skype call lasting more than an hour where I discussed the issues with the model, with regards to the research questions she wanted to answer etc. I even changed the model and ran it and showed her how to do sensitivity analyses and discussed how to meaningfully come to conclusions from the results. Then I asked her if she would actually like me to be part of her paper, and write some sections and do some model runs, since I had done some work for it already. She said she will get back to me after asking her supervisor but also mentioned that he normally does not like her collaborating or working with other people outside of him and would say no. In a few days she did get back to me and said that he had said no. She also mentioned he is a jackass like that, who always tears her down and does not help her in any way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, she is asking for more help, despite the fact that I get nothing out of this. I am busy and I really don't want to help. I feel let down because I also feel she needs to tell her supervisor that she needs my input into this work, instead of just letting him dictate who can be or cannot be part of her work. I know she has a tough time, but I also feel I need to toughen up and let go of things which are not furthering my work/career and general wellbeing. But, I also feel like an asshole for saying no to her. Am I wrong in not helping her?",

      "text": "Wow, this post... really got me. I am almost exactly in this lady's position, even in the same field.\n\nYou are not wrong, in any means. It is quite common that early career researchers end up saying yes to a lot of things that will not further their careers, and stretching themselves thin. It is not unheard of to help other more junior researchers with things that will not necessarily benefit you, but should not be expected of anyone. \n\nI can't say much about her relationship with her advisor and how much of an asshole he is, but I think you have a point in feeling let down. I had to go through some serious conversations and piss off some people to be able to develop the collaborations that eventually helped me further my work in a way that my supervisor wasn't willing to. You can't expect someone to work on your model/article and not offer some form of co-authorship, and that is a fact in academia. Maybe she is in a particularly toxic environment and this is simply not possible, but my experience says that probably she is not standing up for herself as much as she needs to.\n\nIf you really think this is not in your best interest now, I would suggest you do this nicely. \"I am in a busy moment of my career now, and I am not in the position to invest my time in this way. If you are interested in a collaboration in the future, let me know\".\n\nEDIT: Is this other researcher also from Sweden? I did some research there, and from what I know about the general academic environment there, there are so many ways in which she could reach out to other people to intervene in her behalf and help mediate her situation with her supervisor.",

          "text": "Thanks a lot for the advice and the suggestion to do this nicely. I have apologized and told her that I can't invest time on this, at this point. And no, she is not in Sweden. If this was Sweden I would have mailed the supervisor, since like you say the academic environment is very open. Also, she wants a career and has a job lined up outside of academia. So, I feel that she is not fighting as hard as she can for this collaboration and hence my feeling of being let down by her.",

I can't fault you for not wanting her supervisor taking advantage of your work, but you could drop her some hints on what she needs to do about the politics of the situation.\n\nPerhaps remind her that outside collaborations will be an important part of developing her career, and that if she has a dispute with her supervisor she'll probably need to resolve it through her university's postgraduate office or equivalent.",

I very much agree with this comment -- which isn't saying you need to help her again without credit, but instead that she could use a little encouragement to stand up--not just for herself, but for her work. Even though she's leaving academia, fighting for your work is important in industry too.",

She's in this bind and not you, and you certainly have no obligation to help, but she is a real person with a real life, not a prop to effect change in her adviser.\n\nIn general, I don't think throwing the least powerful members of the academic community under the bus under the pretense of resolving structural problems is either ethical or effective.",

It's difficult to handle these situations, but I think they happen commonly. \n\nIt seems from your post that you are an expert in this technique and it is a relatively new development, but are there online or print resources to direct her to? Often students gravitate toward one-on-one help because obviously it's faster and easier to have someone walk you through your specific situation. However,  they could also learn it \"the hard way\" as you might have, and would probably would walk away with a deeper understanding. Personally I am trying to keep the boundary that my student-in-need has to try to learn from certain resources and trial-and-error techniques first, perhaps that might help you as well.",

I'm confused about his possible motive.",

      "text": "NTA. I was in the same position as that researcher. My advisor discouraged me from working with other people who were in the same field, and actively tried to block me from getting good mentors into my committee. Eventually, I was able to get them in and that made an enormous difference to me. I empathize with the researcher, but I also know that as a woman academic, you will always be asked to do more work, especially in advisory and service capacities than the men academics will, and if you keep giving, you will lose time and energy. This is not only time but also emotional labor that is being asked of you. I think you need to tell this researcher that you understand she is in a difficult position, but you cannot really help beyond this point without a co-authorship for the paper. I think, also, recently, authorship has been debated quite a bit, and most people agree that ethically, those who have contributed actual work towards the research and paper should be co-authors, as against just providing funds. In that sense, your contribution should entitle you to coauthorship and it would unethical otherwise.",

      "text": "Oof. I had a similar situation arise recently - \n\nI'm a Doctoral candidate and someone in my cohort (with a jackass of an adviser) emailed me and asked me to give them some analysis scripts I had spent a good deal of time on for some very complex fMRI data.\n\nLong story short, this person doesn't know much for programming and the tasks they had used were very different than those I wrote my script for...such that it would have meant without a doubt me re-writing the script for their purposes.\n\nI consulted with my advisor and asked if it would be reasonable for me to request authorship for this (and agreeing to assist with writing/editing the manuscript) for a third or fourth authorship position and he basically said \"Yeah you would either deserve authorship or they should pay you as a consultant\"\n\nI then replied and basically said hey I'm down to come onto the project as another author but I spent many many hours on this tool and it isn't designed for your task and will require me to put in more time for it to work for you so i'd like to request authorship.\n\nShe then replied to me and said she went and talked to MY advisor and said that he said it was unreasonable. At this point I was no long sympathetic as she had completely lied to me in an attempt to manipulate me. Very frustrating what academia can do to people - she still hasn't published anything (at all) and frankly it isn't surprising after this interaction.\n\nTo actually reply to YOU - No. You're not an asshole. Her advisor is an asshole and has clearly shirked their obligations to the point that its leaking out into the department. That shit is toxic.",

Or know anyone else who knows him? Just wondering if you're aware of him having a reputation that other people can also attest to.\n\nIf it were me in this situation (and not saying you have to do this, as I said I think you've done plenty so far) I would give her one final email about the importance of standing up for oneself and what is needed to get work done. I doubt you are an expert in the procedures within her specific university for getting support when a supervisor is not performing/behaving properly, but pointing out that that is a thing she might want to look into is also something I might recommend. And last resort, send her to this sub to ask for advice; I'm sure a chorus of people all telling her to seek some kind of recourse here would have a better chance of convincing her that what she is dealing with is not right but it is potentially addressable.",

I'm in a similar situation where a female colleague is asking me to be a part of something where I would shoulder some service without my name on a grant or a paper. Part of me wants to say no because I'm pre tenure. And part of me wants to help her bc she would get something tangible and maybe it would pay off later. I hate being in this sort of situation.
