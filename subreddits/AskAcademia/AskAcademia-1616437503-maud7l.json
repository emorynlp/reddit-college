I'm an interdisciplinary scholar, and I've applied to basically everything for which I am qualified.  I am up to 106 applications, with 32 rejections.  I had three first-round interviews, but I got rejections after.  I requested feedback, and I was repeatedly told that my CV is strong, my interview performance is good, but the market is killing me.  For one entry-level position, the committee head told me they decided not to go entry-level at all, and that I was competing with full professors with 10+ years of experience.  At least a couple positions were canceled due to lack of funding, and I get the sense that several positions are waiting to do interviews until they know whether they will be able to hire anyone.",

I don't fit the \"core\" of most programs, so it's just a matter of finding a program that sees value in my niche and will hire at entry level. Rejections are disappointing (some more than others), but I'm not taking anything personally. I could get 100 rejections, but I still only need one offer. I hope to get more than one offer, but I'll hit the ground running wherever I end up.",

I could teach core classes in a law school, with employment and education as electives, but that is a dismal market ov|reloaded with Ivy JDs. For education leadership/administration/policy programs, my weakness is that I was a lawyer who represented teachers and educational staff, but I was never a teacher or principal. Convincing these programs I would be useful is easy; convincing them I can teach a full load of classes is harder, especially at smaller programs.\n\nI am also trying for public policy/administration programs and political science departments. Law and education are specialty topics in these programs, so I run into the same issues, but with the added problem that neither of my graduate/professional degrees are in that field. These programs are already getting a ton of applications from people with PhDs in their field.\n\nI can fit in at any of these programs, but I need to get hired first. I am decently published already, and I have some adjunct experience. I am hopeful that I'll get something. I just can't afford to get my hopes up for any one program. I need to play it as a numbers game until I get in somewhere. Then I keep publishing. Things will work out eventually.",

Sent out 40+ applications this year and 1 for a independent postdoc position, 4 first round TT interviews, 2 \"campus visits\" (last week and next week). Have not heard back from the first one but am hopeful since they liked my seminar a lot, although I had never given a chalk talk and think I did badly there. I have the independent postdoc interview later this week. Overall hopeful since I hadn't gotten interviews previously, but still feeling run down since there is so little feedback and I have no clue if I have a future in academia.",

You might already be asking, but I think a lot of people are either too depressed or nervous to ask for feedback when they get rejected, and it's a huge missed opportunity. There's no harm in asking; they already rejected you. Also, be polite (reputation is important), and keep it short. Don't give them your list of things you think you did wrong. They might not agree that something was an issue, but they will if you suggest it. This is perfect: \"It was a pleasure speaking with you. Could you please provide me with feedback and recommendations for improvement. I hope the rest of your search goes well. Thank you for your time and consideration.\"",

I've applied to at least 5 jobs that I've seen pop up in the last month or so, which I imagine is coming from more optimism about the state of the fall. \n\nI've gotten emails about moving past first stage of interviews, but at least I got rejection letters from other places. I finally got an interview request a couple of weeks back only to have the job search cancelled. But then they invited me to reapply with a different posting?? \n\nMostly, it feels like a crapshoot since my field is quite narrow and competitive for TT jobs. But I'm optimistic. I am currently on a post-doc and am still waiting to hear back from those 8-10 fellowships/VAP/TT jobs i applied for. It seems like many are pushing back their interviews until April for mine, which is later from what I've seen in the past.",

      "text": "This seems like a good of place as any to vent about this decline I got a couple weeks ago. FWIW, I'm in humanities. TL;DR at end.\n\nLast year, I'd applied for a postdoc I was pretty excited about. I know not to get attached to job announcements because our odds are so low, but this one checked all the boxes for my research, values, teaching, mentorship. I was excited about this position in a way that I'm not always excited when I'm just applying just *anywhere* for *a job.*\n\nI spent probably more time than usual on my letter and course proposals, and I guess it paid off! After a month, they emailed me and said I was a semifinalist and wanted to set up an interview. This was week three of March 2019. On the very same day, I received a follow-up email explaining that hiring had been frozen at their university (as happened, it seems like, across the board), and they had to postpone the search.\n\nLater in the summer, after I'd decided to postpone my defense (I had another year of funding available) and hope the job market would get better this academic year. I received an email from the postdoc institution in early July informing me that the search was officially cancelled.\n\nI received another email from the program in January, letting me know the position was posted again and as a semifinalist for the previous, cancelled search, they encouraged me to apply again. I did, updating my materials where necessary (because of the previous year, there wasn't a whole lot to add, but some), but otherwise submitting almost my same letter and proposals. Because of the previous year's luck and their teaching out, I felt pretty confident with hearing back from them. And of course I shouldn't have. Needless to say, my application was declined; I didn't even make it to the semifinal round.\n\nI know they didn't owe me anything, and I know the job market is that much more saturated this year, but this rejection stung more than most. I can't help but feel I messed something up this time around or *something.*\n\nStill applying for jobs, and do have a backup plan, which isn't ideal but doable (as backup plans typically are). It does seem like more postings are trickling in, but this year is particularly rough.\n\nETA: TL;DR: had an interview before covid that got cancelled, didn't make it to the first round this time for the same position\n\nEdit 2: March 2020 I mean? What year is it? It's blursday",

It seems to get harder every year. For small contracts, they are asking ridiculous experience and effort. I am building a start-up company now and hopefully, I can move out of academia. It's just not worth the struggle. A friend said it was a pyramid game but I thought I could make it. Bad choice it seems. \n\nFor those with over 100 applications: how do you even do that? When I look for academic jobs, I really have to fit the profile. If you don't fit at least 80%, you don't have a shot. Also, writing a cover letter and preparing all materials costs time. How can you do that? It's hard to tailor an application to a specific job, you always have to address specific things from the job description that you cannot easily copy into another one.",
