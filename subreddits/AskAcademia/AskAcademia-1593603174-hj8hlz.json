  "text": "Hey guys.\n\nA little context for the past 18 months or so I've been working towards this idea that I would go and get a masters and a PhD starting in a couple of years and then go onto be a professor. I've been confident about this vision for around a year now and it's really helped ground me.\n\nI didn't really see a reason not to want this until a couple of weeks ago when I subscribed to this subreddit and the PhD subreddit, and the amount of posts that have appeared on my front page that have been rather negative has given me cause to rethink it all.\n\nThis has left me feeling unsettled. This past year has been the only time in my life where I've had an idea of what I want to do with my life.\n\nSo, I'm wondering about if it's all worth it? What are the good parts of your job? What kind of person you should be to go into academia? What options do I have if I get the PhD and realise that I don't want to be in academia?\n\nThank you.\n\nIt feels like it might be relevant, so I'll tell you that I'm already a teacher.\n\nEDIT\n\nSo I can't imagine many of those that have already commented will read this, but thank you for your replies, they really have helped. I honestly, wasn't expecting this to blow up like it has, but I'm glad it did. I have some clarity about what needs to be done now.\n\nFor future commenters, I'm from the UK and I'm planning to go into linguistics - second language education and second language education policy specifically.",

          "text": "The \"generic probability\" of being able to land a professorship varies a lot based on the field, the school that get your PhD from, and your location/country. Sometimes, the odds of getting a tenured professorship is going to be minuscule. But sometimes, the odds aren't bad at all!\n\nI'd recommend talking to people in the departments that you'd apply for, at the universities that you would like to attend. You can ask them about what most of their recent PhD graduates ended up doing; how many of them ended up in tenured academic jobs, or government jobs, or doing adjunct work, or in industry? I think it is valuable to have a sense of the baseline probability of ending up in academia, based on the specific department. If no relatively-recent PhDs are now in tenure track jobs, it's less likely that you'll be able to \"make yourself stand out\" enough to be competitive, because you may be missing the institutional support/institutional prestige. But, if many relatively-recent PhDs are in tenure track jobs, then your odds go up a lot. (E.g., out of the last 10 PhDs to work with my supervisor, 8 received TT job offers, so I felt like my chances were pretty good). Likewise, asking what graduated PhDs are doing now will give you some ideas about \"plan Bs\", and other types of options that are out there for people with a PhD in your particular discipline.",

It seems to me in the humanities it is equally true that a PhD is required to become a university professor, and to do research. Being stuck with a masters guarantees you will be stuck as an adjunct - you are not likely to become tenure-track.",

There's a reason Dostoevsky and Welles aren't part of the philosophical canon, and it's not because they've been unjustly excluded.\n\nMoreover, these are all hugely exceptional figures who constitute exceptions to the general observation I made above. Your average 20-something sitting alone in their room reading Nietzsche with zero exposure to the actual discipline thinking they're going to be the next Dostoevsky is, I can assure you, not the next Dostoevsky.",

How is this relevant to that big post you wrote about what it takes to get into an Ivy? It's not. How is it relevant to all those comments about how humanities PhDs are useless? It's not. How is it relevant to your opinion that people in business and law can be professors without a PhD? It's not. You seem to be taking somebody's personal feeling and using it to justify spreading incorrect information on tangentially related subjects. I'm sure you're doing this unintentionally, moreover that you didn't even notice this cognitive glitch - but if you purport to be a research professional, it behooves you to be able to detect this tendency in yourself and cut it off before it informs anything coming out of your mouth.",

And yet, especially in the US, it is facing some of the most fast-moving, potentially calamitous changes now that it has in probably the past 500 years (not exaggerating). The decreasing number of students coupled with costs that have risen out of sight for them, the poor pay and often contingent work for faculty, and now (the real forcing function) the combination of the pandemic and the economic crisis -- neither of which we've seen the worst of yet -- are all going to force *massive* changes on academia. Almost no one, and no institutions, are truly prepared for this. In a year, academia will look far different than it has for the last 20, even the last 100. In five years... there's no way to tell.\n\nI came into academia by the side door, after a career in industry.

I think committees absolutely should be concerned about unconscious bias, though too many aren't. Hiring people you know (with the job announcement tailored just to them) seems skeevy from the outside (I've been hit by it too), but I understand it from the inside: you want to reduce your risk of a bad hire, and get someone who will do well and mesh well. \n\nOne response to that is, okay, become that person: not for a particular job, but in general -- raise your presence in your field with good work, and good works. Be visible, be helpful, do good work. This sort of thing definitely increases your chance of being hired.",

I have a BS in cognitive science (earned back when this was very new - I had to design the major myself), spent 10 years working as a software engineer and user interface designer, and then another 20 as a game designer. (I did some grad work in CS, but noped out when I got a great job offer and was taking a horrible database class.)\n\nI knew I wanted to go into academia at some point, so I took almost a decade to prepare: I started teaching an online course for a European university, and managed to get a few papers of original research published in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences (it helps that I was working in a frontier area, \"social AI\"). \n\nEven with that, it took a forward-looking university to bring me on; several places I'd talked with were interested -- but \"oh, sorry, you don't have a PhD.\" That was the end of that; it was very much a \"union card\" as others had told me. This despite being in an area where there simply *weren't* any PhDs of any rank.\n\nI came on with essentially the rank of a full professor, which makes me an oddball, though not quite a unicorn, here at least. There are some places (private universities mostly, not so much R1 publics) that hire a lot of people as what would be lecturers at many US-based universities, and call them PoPs.  There's no real regulation of the title -- once again I'm on the frontier, or the fringe, depending how you look at it.",

There are of course parts that I don't like or straight forward hate. But overall, I cannot see myself doing anything else. I read, I write, I talk about topics that I feel passionate about. \n\nThere are two main reasons for negativity:\n\n1) The industry is \"doomed\". We have many small colleges in this country, enrolling less than 1500 students. A few is well-regarded and funded. They will probably be okay. But majority of them are small regional schools, operating completely on tuition with little alumni or foundation support. These schools will need to shut down if they lose, let's say, 100 students, which is likely to happen when we hit the expected population decline in 2026-ish. We already have an oversupply of PhDs as colleges keep hiring part-time and/or temporary positions instead of TTs. Guess what will happen when we have newly unemployed seasoned faculty members join the job market... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Teaching has a learning curve. And I don't mean your teaching skills per se. You realize your students are different from you and each other. Most people who end up in academia are your A-students. For us, realizing that a student is completely okay with getting a C and a couple of beers with friends instead of studying all-night for an A is shocking. How on earth do they not spend money on their textbooks but buy the newest smartphones? Once you make your peace with different learning styles, potentials, life choices, you-name-its, teaching becomes more rewarding. You realize even the student that barely got a D in your course is ambitious and wants to do something with their life; it is just their priorities are different from yours. \n\nIt is tough to give specific advice in academia. I am in social sciences, in a public regional university with a teaching focus. I am sure an engineer in my state's flagship research university will not really understand my point about teaching (and I don't really understand their PI/post-doc/R-1/grant discussions). \n\nThat being said, I had to go back on the job market last year again because of personal reasons. I applied for all the jobs in my field in around seven states in the Northeast.... I applied to a total of eight jobs.... I am not talking about getting interviews or anything here... I am talking about job postings...",

I was just thinking about this the other day and how much the tone of discussions here has completely changed. Don't take our word for it here, find a real, live person you trust and ask them.\n\nMost of the comments on the sub are no longer from people who are currently in academia, so I am not sure why they are here since this is supposed to be a sub for academics to answer questions, hence the name.\n\nThink of this subreddit now basically like r/relationships or r/relationship_advice - it's populated by people who love to give their opinions, however poorly informed, and will most likely tell you to take some sort of nuclear option regardless of how small your grievance is or how much you yourself are contributing to the issue. Our \"dump her, block her, lawyer up, hit the gym,\" and \"women aren't worth it, they just lie, cheat, and take all your money is,\" is \"go to the dean, complain about your professor, make sure they are punished; academia is pyramid scheme so toxic it makes Bernie Madoff's look like The Red Cross; leave academia immediately and do anything else.\"\n\nI'm sure plenty of people will downvote me because, naturally, these folks don't see it this way. To them, they are the authorities, not the actual academics, and they are speaking life's truths. But it is not true.\n\nGetting a PhD can be really tough, and not just academically but existentially, but it is like many really great experiences in your life, you have to work and push hard to get the results you need. \n\nAlso, keep in mind, that part of grad school culture almost everywhere I have seen is to just talk about how miserable you are. I think it's because, despite the amazing parts of the PhD process (pretty flexible schedules, lots of social opportunities, a \"job\" that is to explore your own intellectual interests fulltime), you feel so judged all the time. Once you leave, you realize that most of that judgment wasn't there and it was your own insecurities rushing into the void that is left when people just leave you to do your own work, but it can be really tough while you are going through it.\n\nLong story short, don't listen to we idiots on the internet, ESPECIALLY on this subreddit.

Getting a PhD is a lot more of an applicable qualification than spending your whole life only focusing on football, other than coaching or sports writing/commenting, there isn't much else you can do. There is a lot you can do with a PhD that isn't academia.\n\nI do think schools should be better about encouraging students to explore non-academic career paths, but that is an issue of the insularity of the people there. A school is, by definition, staffed by academics, most of whom have never done anything else and aren't equipped to advise otherwise. Students need to explore their career options the way other people do, researching careers, information interviews, networking, etc.",

So the people who are being bitter might actually be the majority of what academia is churning out. I'm now at an R1 school (but not HYPSM) and I try to keep a realistic view -- Not many of my students will stay in academia (although I hope they do!) and even if they do, a lot of them are LAC-bound in the best case, and probably adjuncts and lecturers as well.

The perspective of someone who really feels they have gotten the worst side of the stick all the time is valuable, but for almost everyone to be from that camp? I don't think that is representative or helpful.\n\nI actually count myself as someone who has gotten some of the worst that academia has to chuck at you. I've had postdoc supervisors take my name off my grants, gaslight me, attempt to sexually assault me, bad mouth me around the field, etc. I've had job offers rescinded after I turned down others, I've had administrators refuse to fulfill the contracts I signed and just dare me to sue them and blow up my career. \n\nEven with all that, I don't see academia as the damaged cesspool people here seem to. I had some bad people in my life, but I also made some bad decisions that could have allowed me to make sure those situations were so bad, or even avoid them altogether. I also think I could have prepared better for life in academia as I was going along.\n\nI have probably worked with 35 postdocs and maybe 100 grad students by this point in my career and I never ever encountered anyone as embittered and angry as the average responder here on the subreddit seems to be.\n\nReddit is a weird place. I avoided teaching any undergrad classes for years (I was lucky I could navigate around it) because I saw how undergrads here write about their professors and I knew I couldn't handle people that would despise me no matter what I did. Then my number came up and I finally had to do it. I was so nervous I actually was sick in the beginning. \n\nOver time, however, I realized that my undergrads were great people, interested and interesting. They were not impossible to please at all, quite the opposite in most cases. I believed Reddit about undergrads and that was a mistake. If OP here believes this sub about academia it will an equally jaundiced view.

Tying your identity to your work in an already highly cutthroat and competitive system like academia is, quite frankly, always a bad idea. This is of course easier said than done.

Not having to answer work-related e-mails on the weekend does wonders for one's well-being. My cousin who works as an adjunct professor at a university in Seattle, on the other hand, never misses an opportunity to tear into all of the things he absolutely hates about his institution and the state of American academia whenever we catch up.\n\nLong story short, things aren't universally awful in academia.

This fall I'll begin working as a tenure-track assistant professor at a large R2 university, where in my first year I'll be earning far more than I would ever have made as a teacher. The thing is, for ambitious teachers who want to remain in education but pursue more responsibility and more pay, there are few options aside from administration, which is something I have less than zero interest in doing. All to say, getting a PhD has so far seemed like an excellent career move for me, while recognizing of course that I cannot predict the future. By the way, I wrote a very long comment focused more on  my experience being a PhD student a week or so ago, which you can find in my comment history.",

My institution (private liberal arts institution with some solid grad programs; not a big research school) seems to be solvent, but the combination of these two factors are definitely hitting schools a lot harder than some might think.  I think that a *lot* of schools will be restructuring, reducing programs/offerings, and consequently laying off faculty over the next five years or so.  I absolutely love my job, but it's worth thinking about leaving a stable market (assuming you're already in the workforce) to go to a market that's in a decline.  \n\n\n**TL;dr** Consider the future of academia before hopping in; it might be a wild ride for the next few years...",

Even in the \"good\" economy of ~2010-2019, we started to see the long-predicted examples of schools failing, not just restructuring. And what's underappreciated is how much schools are directly and indirectly subsidized. If those are removed under demographic budget pressures, fewer young people will see the value of college (especially as millennials become parents of late teens), and as they inevitably get jobs via non-college training, the cost/benefit calculation of college will make even less sense. I talked this over a while back with my dad, who worked in the student loan industry and knows the ins and outs colleges' financial positions, and his armchair guess was 1/3 of today's colleges will close or merge over the next several decades.",

I love working with intelligent, passionate students. I love that my days are broken up with all different activities, with some being teaching heavy, some building content, some grading assignments, etc. Being a lecturer, my promotion is entirely based on my teaching evaluations, so there's a lot less stress than if I were tenure-track. I haven't come up with any other job that I'd rather do. \n\nThat being said, there are some downsides that come from the fact that I'm a lecturer and not tenure-track. The pay is crap (I make $50k/year in a low to medium cost of living area). As a lecturer, I get very little say or even insight on how the department is run. \n\nAs others have said, the other thing to consider in deciding whether to pursue a PhD is the job market. There were many times during my academic education that I doubted whether I'd find a position like this. Frankly, you just have to be okay with that. Consider whether a PhD is worth it for you to spend that time and get that experience, even if you end up in a similar position to where you are now.",

      "text": "Phds are incredibly tough. It\u2019s probably a good thing you have a healthy dose of realism. I\u2019d say, as I have said in the past, you just know in your heart whether your an academic or not. This may be an unpopular opinion, but from my experience in academia and talking to academics, we all just kind of know. At the end of the day, we are writing for each other. This of course gets chuffed into public domains eventually, but due to heuristics your typically writhing and thinking in niche nonsense. If you want to be a professor, that\u2019s a signal to start publishing and obtaining grants. To do that you need to know the cutting edge, or state of the art, the main arguments as well as the general overviews of entire fields. Etc and so on. To get this stuff the phd will help, but due to its self study learning style, it\u2019s pretty much up to you to self motivate, upskill, train, study, etc. it\u2019s very very isolative and individualistic as a rest, hence most of the negative aspects in this forum. It can become a bit of a trap for some, and getting stuck in the middle is by far the most common contributor in this. I\u2019d say, a good test would be to reflect on academic books and journals you spend reading in your own time. Do you know what thesis questions you\u2019d like to pursue? Who the key players are? Who you want to work with and publish with in the future? What areas you think are useful to society and knowledge? Etc. in short, it\u2019s not all that bad. You do need to push every day, your standards get higher and higher, but eventually expertise domes arrive, you start repetitions of earlier ideas, then you publish and move on to something else. Professors are all about value added to the department. So my advice would be choose a popular topic with a wider reach in public understandability and exposure, ie, obvious issues, and work to contribute and solving them and Keep your niche parts tucked away. We all have our reasons for phds, but the main reason I hope is to contribute to formal human knowledge during our time on this earth together, sometimes that may not lead to tenure, but it still leads to something human!",

      "text": "\" then go onto be a professor\". If only it were this easy. Originally I wanted to be a professor as well but over time my direction has changed. In my opinion being a professor is worth it if you are truly passionate about discovery of new knowledge. Professors have much much much greater job stability than industry. Professors don't worry about economic down turns and lay offs, once they pass their tenure check and become associate, it is highly secure position. Professors also have absolute freedom to investigate whatever they feel is interesting or pertinent to the field of their expertise. In academia you get more respect as you age, not true in industry where your knowledge is viewed as outdated. \n\nThe kind of person that goes into academia is obsessed. Be honest with yourself, is research your true passion? I found for me it wasn't, I enjoy it and I feel I am good at it, but I enjoy other things like playing guitar, family, friends, travel... etc. Research for me is not the center of my life. The people in my lab going to academia, live breath sleep research. My first meeting with my PI he told me if you want to be a professor you must think about research when you eat, sleep, or have any second of spare time. Here is some good news for people who are getting PhD and have lost interest in academia. There are many job options for those with a PhD. A lab mate of mine joined the CIA as a govt research scientist, another went into policy and is working with a state representative, we had a seminar speaker who used his biotechnology knowledge to become a stock-picker for a large hedge-fund, patent law, and industry such as senior engineer or manager.",

The reality is that it is an industry of passion like video-game development and graphic design where despite being highly skilled, you don't actually generate a huge amount of value per person for your employer. You are usually competing with many people for a few jobs, and many people are willing to accept and tolerate poor management and/or working conditions for the opportunity to do something they love. Furthermore, you often become highly specialised and don't development the kind of 'soft skills' that business like so the longer you stay in academia post-PhD the harder it can be to move into industry.\n\nHowever, as long as you go into it with your eyes wide open you can have a great time doing what you love.

However as a TL;DR, no it really isn't as bad as people make out.\n\nAs a brief bio I am a Professor in a leading UK University, I joined as a Lecturer and was promoted to Professor about 7.5 years into my tenure. Furthermore, I have spent about 3 years in industry including a high-end silicon valley company and a startup. Certainly in my field (CS) it's often hard to find good candidates for academic appointments as most PhDs go into industry. I'm sure this must be true in other disciplines too.\n\nI'll summarize as a series of pros of academia and contrast with industry:\n\nPros:\n\n\\- I still have enormous freedom / autonomy, both of what to work on, where and when to work.\n\n\\- Even given COVID I still have excellent job stability, far more so than in industry where they can pull the cord at any moment.\n\n\\- For the most part, I am my own boss. Yes, my actual boss is the head of department but she/he isn't driving my day to day duties. So long as my teaching, admin and research are in order my University trusts me to do worthwhile work in the remaining time without micro management.\n\n\\- Summers (3-4 months) are mostly my own, apart from Masters and PhD student supervision.\n\n\\- Despite what you read on this subreddit academia in my opinion is a far less pressurized environment. Yes, I\u2019m expected to write papers and obtain grant money but ultimately the amount of each of these activities that I do is driven by internal pressure. Academics tend to pile all these unnecessary activities (like reviewing, talks, committees) that really are optional and give you very little reward. The joy of academia is that you can pick which ones (if any) of these you like and just leave the rest. \n\nCons:\n\n\\- A lot less money - certainly when you compare to a tech job in high-end industry, e.g., FAANG or similar. You really are trading money for autonomy if you work in industry. You have to work out how much your relative freedom in academia is worth, e.g., is your autonomy worth half or more likely a third of the salary?\n\n\\- It's far less collaborative as you often work alone or with your own group that you've had to create yourself from scratch through grants, fighting to get PhD students funded etc. I contrast that with industry where you mostly work in organized teams.\n\n\\- Certainly in tech, the impact you can make is limited given the lack of resources to build and evaluate your ideas at scale.",

      "text": "A couple of things that haven't been mentioned in this thread yet: from the way you wrote \"maths\" I'm going to assume that you're not American. Situations are quite dire in the US right now due to COVID tuition refunds and budget cuts, and universities are literally going bankrupt. Those that are not have imposed hiring freezes and there will be very few positions for the coming years, then there will be way too many job candidates. This is because we rely on exorbitant tuition to keep the universities afloat. A lot of the commenters are American.\n\n In Europe, for example, things are relatively calm because universities are mostly funded by the government. So take what people are saying here with a grain of salt, and do your own research on your own situation.\n\n(This is not to say that securing a professorship in Europe is easy; some countries (Italy comes to mind) just have no jobs, so they were worse off than the US is for many years. And things everywhere else in the world will be bad as well, since the jobless American PhDs will also apply to their job market.)\n\nAlso, a \"professor\" is such a vague term. Do you want to be a professor whose main duties are research, or does it suffice to teach undergraduate students? Being a research oriented professor is competitive no matter where you go, and you need top-notch education, good connections, and plenty of luck. This is just how the system works; you need to be vouched by world class experts to get such a job, and being from a good school or having a powerful advisor will give you a tremendous advantage. Apply that to your situation and adjust. If you just want to be called a professor (i.e. you don't mind being at a primarily undergrad institution, adjuncting, etc.) then it's much easier (although in the US these people are currently getting fired like crazy) but you're not paid well and you're at the bottom of the departmental hierarchy, teaching leftover courses and not getting much of a voice in the departmental politics.\n\nYou seem like you're old enough that you should have done some realistic research. With just what you've written, I'm not convinced that you're serious about this. With such half-heartedness, I don't think that going to graduate school is a good idea, especially in this economy. If this is the beginning of such research (although you said that you've been thinking about this for 18 months), I suggest that you contact some graduate students/postdocs in your field and ask for their outlook of the field (professors often feel that they cannot be completely frank).",

              "text": "How old will you be? I didn't see anyone mention this so let me mention it. I generally have a lot of sympathy for graduate students in their 30s and beyond. Being in grad school at that age is particularly depressing because you see your peers finding their places in the world, and there is so much uncertainty ahead of you. Until you get your permanent position, you literally have no idea what country you'll be living in the next year. It takes a heavy toll on your personal relationships (many of my own relationships fell apart because I moved to a different continent/country/state). In addition you make a pittance around the poverty line and you work a LOT. \n\nIt can be done, but it's a hard road with often no rewards at all. My own personal limit was that I'd leave academia if I didn't secure a permanent position by age 30. Got one at 29, but I was definitely thinking about other options at that point, since so many of my old classmates were already making a name for themselves in the world. You should think about whether this life really is for you, and I'm not asking about the idealized starving scholar type life. This is very real. There's a LOT of na\u00efvet\u00e9 in your post that makes me think that 1. You haven't thought this through at all and your post is borderline daydreaming, 2. You don't seem to have done any research and grad school is about research, 3. Nowhere in your post do I see evidence of grit and passion. \n\nSeriously, think hard about this. The rate of depression is extremely high in grad school and it's not a rewarding road for most people. This is coming from someone whose classmate hanged himself a month after he proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, because he felt that there was no future for him in academia. And he was very good.",

The road is bumpy I have to say and I am aware that in the USA is even bumpier and cutthroat due to the tenure system, which the UK does not possess. I, like you, was also obsessed with the idea of becoming a professor, living the life of the mind and being paid to think about the world's unanswered questions. And, like everything in life, it was not what I had expected. I do enjoy the flexibility, the fact that nobody is really checking on me on a daily basis but there is way more admin to sort out than I would like - I just never thought about what went behind the scenes I guess. I always thought, as a student, that teachers/profs would just get paid to speak to an audience and that was it. The amount of paperwork I have to produce is at times rather insane. Then, on top of this, there are all sorts of other good/bad dynamics that you will have to learn to deal with: student mental health, relationship with colleagues, department politics. It is really a multitasking career and you have to be ready to use your brain in various ways, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I always made sure I had a plan B all the way through (I have a freelance business on the side) just in case and that's what I would suggest to you (and I can see others have mentioned this already). The current market is just so unstable that I would not put all my eggs in the academic basket. But, if you are passionate about it and you don't see yourself doing anything else, then go for it. I guess if something goes wrong you can always go back being a teacher!",

I'm a subject coordinator, and I just have a master's. In English. Thing is, I teach developmental/remedial and *like* it. For better or worse, my university actually has a policy of AVOIDING PhDs for \"grunt work\" (Comp, intro to math, etc) because they're afraid the hire will run off the first chance they get. I teach a 4/4 load because I have administrative duties; otherwise it would be 5/5. Having said that, here's what I like about my job (ymmv):\n\nIt's unbelievably family-friendly. I have an Autistic child, who goes to regular school but couldn't handle daycare/after care. My schedule is flexible so that either me or my husband can both drop her off and pick her up every day. I get very nearly the same holidays as her, including summer. When my mom was diagnosed with cancer, when I had spinal surgery, etc. we were able to come up with a schedulethat worked. When COVID shut down all the schools, I was right there teaching my classes and my daughter at home.\n\nThere's a lot more freedom. I taught pubic high school and worked in the nonprofit fundraising sector. The micromanagement gave me crushing anxiety. I still get the jitters before student evaluations and review with my department chair, but it's not an all day, every day feeling of dread. \n\nI get to talk about the thing I love all the time. I love words and writing and reading and critical thinking. People pay me to roll around in that. They even gave me a linguistics/etymology intro course that is just 3 hours a week of me being a dork about how cool language is. \n\nStudents, when they aren't dicks, are interesting. Getting to know them is fascinating.\n\nAnyway, that's just me. Best of luck with whatever you decide!",

Much of the strife involved in academia is coming up with that TT position, and the years that follow while you fight to keep that position.  \n\nI personally enjoy the day to day flexibility that my job permits. For example, I don't need approval from my boss to leave work for the afternoon to go to the dentist, doctor, etc. I am not required to report to my office at a specific time (unless I have a meeting or a class to teach). I especially like the flexibility that comes with summer breaks.  I like that, at least for my discipline, there are lots of opportunity to travel. I like my students and I like my research. I like the freedom I have with my own research directions.   I also like knowing that when I decide to have children there is a really good on-site childcare, and that's pretty common at colleges and universities. I like that I have access to on-site exercise facilities and programs.  I like the campus community and the events it offers (plays, sports games, talks, art shows).  These are perks of  working within a campus community that I honestly *enjoy*.  That's not to say that I don't work more that 8 hours a day, or work though my lunch, or bring work home-- because I definitely do.  \n\nEverything I mention is \"in the day-to-day\" but to be honest, that's what makes your life feel manageable or not. Every one else has given you big picture, long-term answers, so I'll give a different prospective. Could my college fold? Yeah, it could. We could hit an enrollment cliff. The government could slash science funding and further impeded my (already slim) chances of external funding.  And that would all suck majorly. \n\n But-- I think anyone in basically any field can say similar things.  My husband is a web designer and his old company folded basically because of services like Wix and Square.  My Dad is an engineer and at the whim of budget and government contracts. My bff is a realtor, and that has been super boom and bust for her.  \n\nFinishing a PhD is no cake walk.  Getting the TT offer after my PhD seemed nearly impossible at times, and I have friends who have left science all together after years of failed job searches. Be hyper-aware of that.  Otherwise, no, I do not think it is \"all that bad.\"",

That said, I love what I do. I can study what I\u2019m passionate about, teach content that I design, and I serve the university and profession in ways that are meaningful for me. Every day is different, and I get to decide how to spend my time (except for when I\u2019m scheduled to teach, which is one to two courses per semester). I love working with my graduate students. I think it helps to be an optimist in this career...I receive rejections (for papers, grant proposals, etc.) quite regularly. It doesn\u2019t bother me much because by the time something is rejected, I have moved on to a new idea I\u2019m excited about. And sometimes things do \u201chit,\u201d which is an amazing feeling. I am fortunate not to have mental health problems, but some of my students do (especially in recent years). I don\u2019t know if academic exacerbates that risk or not.",

Granted, it wasn't ALL work (i won't play into that \"every academic should be constantly working\" mindset); I got married in my PhD program and focused on being a great husband over being the best doc student ever. As a metric that is relevant, I graduated with 22 pubs (8 or 9 leads), 50 or so conference abstracts (defiantly not all leads!), and a couple of small grants as a PI (<$50K total). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI landed a great job at an R1, solid start up package and very livable salary (TT).

Part of this depends on your field of research, where you're living (and if you have an restrictions about where you want to live), and what type of school it is (liberal arts college, professional school, R1, etc.). I wouldn't let something like this subreddit discourage you from working toward your goal. As others have commented, I would be realistic about backup plans, but still go for your goal. I mean, my overall goal is to become an astronaut. Sure, it's unlikely, but I found a career that I know I'll enjoy in the event that I don't make NASA's cut. Becoming a professor is a lot of hard work, but it's possible. Keep in mind that the path to professor-hood is not just one straight path. There are multiple ways to get there. \n\nNow to answer the questions that you asked!   \n1. If it's worth it depends almost entirely upon your perspective. I imagine that these highly skilled people would find other careers if they didn't find the academic one (at least partially) fulfilling.\n\n2. Getting to interact with students and expand their knowledge. I enjoy mentoring and I get to do a LOT of it!\n\n3. I'm not sure if there is just one type of person who should go in to academia. We want to have role models of every kind for our students, right? That being said, I feel like it's important to be resilient. It's unlikely that everything will go your way 100% of the time. Sometimes this is your fault and sometimes it's someone else's, but it's important to be able to work through it and to handle constructive criticism well.\n\n4. You can always go back to teaching! As for a more detailed answer? I'd need to know what you plan to study and what your interests are. There are lots of options out there for Ph.D.s, though.\n\nWishing you all the best!",

Unlike what you've described, however, they carry a 4/4 load and start at $52k/year.

That's a completely accurate statement.\n\nBecause most business schools don't have PhD programs (they're professional schools largely targeted at teaching MBAs) there is a relative balance between supply and demand. There are fewer schools supplying PhDs and many schools that have no PhD program demanding them. So much so that many PhD grads (myself included) cross over from related fields (think Engineering, Psychology, Statistics, etc.). \n\nIf you get a business PhD from a top ranked school, you can get a TT AP with a 2/1 or 2/2 teaching load and 150-250k base salary plus summer funding and a research account funded by the school. At a top-50 school where I previously worked, 90% of the placements were like this. At lower ranked schools, teaching loads tend to be 3/3 or 4/4 and salaries tend to be lower though still in the 6-figures. I have not seen or heard of business schools paying less than 100k and I'd be interested to see those ads...",
