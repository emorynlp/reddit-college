      "text": "Scholar and Ph.D. can overlap but they arent the same thing. A scholar is someone who seeks to expand human understanding through careful collection of information and documentation of resources used, in a manner that someone else can duplicate. A scholar submits their work to public inquiry in order to test it. A scholar is a person of scientific integrity, intellectual humility, and seeker of knowledge and understanding. There are many persons in history with the instincts of a scholar but without a Ph.D. Benjamin Franklin comes to mind.\n\nA Ph.D. has demonstrated to other persons with a doctorate that they have acquired the skills to become a scholar. Period. Becoming a scholar is something not everyone is called to do. \n\nIn the academy the term may be used as a courtesy title. \n\nAs faculty have long memories one does not lightly question another person's work or scholarly status. The social consequences are nothing to dismiss lightly as your work environment consists of people with tenure and a level of stubbornness, persistence, competitiveness, cleverness and recall cranked to among the highest in human occupations (that is what it takes to get a PhD). Faculty are separated from one another into departments and even subdepartments for many good reasons.\n\nThe social consequences are secondary, however,  to a realization of the intellectually humble (good scholars): what seems like crazy talk today, may be groundbreaking through tomorrow's eyes. \"Im not in a place to judge as I dont know their specialty.\" The rest get in a tizzy over hierarchy.\n\nSo we all act \"as if\" except for evaluators like a dean. Sorry for the side-trip. Occupational hazard.",

However, OP doesn't seem to be asking about job titles, but rather informal titles or descriptions of yourself/others. In that context, I am basically unwilling to unironically call anyone a \"scholar\", since as I said initially it seems elitist and frivolous to me. Even in the humanities, where job titles with the word 'scholar' are perhaps more prevalent, I would be more comfortable describing their informal title or describing their work with \"researcher in/of X\" or \"historian\" (if they studied history, for example), etc.",
