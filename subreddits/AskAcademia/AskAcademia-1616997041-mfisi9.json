  "text": "I googled my name for fun and the first couple results were links to CourseHero. I checked the links and found that a lab partner from a university course I took a while ago uploaded our group work without removing the names. I really don't want to see my lab work pop up as one of the first results when I search my name.\n\nI'm currently taking a course within the same department, so I want to get the document removed just in case.\n\nI'm not exactly sure if I should file a DMCA request to take it down since I worked on the document with the person who uploaded it.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Thanks.",

Create more content with your name (this is where linked ins are good) so the content you don\u2019t want is less relevant and starts moving down the page. Every time you\u2019re on a different IP address and computer, Google yourself and give clicks to the good stuff, do not click on the bad stuff. You can enlist your friends to help if you trust them not to click on the bad stuff! Once something is off the first page the chances of anyone noticing it go way down.",
