Is it really hard to get jobs as professors? \n\nAny tips would be really appreciated! ",

For most of us, though, a failed search is  an unmitigated disaster that could well result in the department losing a tenure line. So rather than deadlock and risk that, in some places there is a tendency to hire the least controversial candidate instead...often the #3 in a pool who won't do anything revolutionary but also won't piss off either camp too much.\n\nLuckily I've spent my entire career in departments that function well, and every hiring committee I've served on within those home departments has reached an unanimous decision on every tenure-track hire. Not so with the external committees I've served on...it can be really caustic to a department to disagree about such key issues.  Back in the 1990s my wife was in a department that actually split, literally, over hiring decisions to the point that it was formally broken up into applied and theoretic departments with different chairs.",

(For example, at which point do we mark the attrition? Do we count all the \"Little Thinkers\" and \"Little Ballerinas\" or only those with Ph.D.s? And what do we take to be the equivalent of the Ph.D. for ballerinas or astronauts or whatever? Is that a good equivalent? etc. ...) \n\nMy bigger point is probably more on the discursive plane. If Little Billy says to Mom and Dad that he wants to be an astronaut, Mom and Dad probably say something to the tune of, \"Well, that's great, Billy. Here's a toy rocket. It's nice to dream. Have you ever heard of engineering? Well, an engineer does this ...\". Or if Billy says he wants to be a professional football player, Mom and Dad probably say something like, \"Well, that's great Billy. Here's a football. It's nice to dream. You know, you'd make a great coach/teacher/physical therapist ...\". Everyone \"gets\" the improbability of becoming an astronaut or a pro football player. No one \"gets\" the improbability of becoming a professor. And we all keep chasing after that dream long, long after we should have realized to move on down the dream sheet and become \\[an engineer / coach / teacher / whatever your particular analogue is\\].

              "text": "A few reasons: colleges and universities are shifting their priorities. It\u2019s easier to sell professional programs (nursing, IT, healthcare management, business) to students than it is to sell a well-rounded liberal arts education, and the costs of education have risen sharply over the past few decades. What used to be a few thousand dollars is now about a hundred thousand (give or take) so parents want to be assured of a monetary return on their investment. No one particularly likes this trend, but it sells, and college is treated like a for-profit enterprise, even if the institution is technically non-profit or public...\n\nBecause the public investment in education has also decreased sharply in the last several decades. The GOP, fearing the progressive tides that generally accompany the college educated, have made it a goal to deride higher education as pointless, dishonest, expensive to the state. It wasn\u2019t expensive for the state, but the propaganda made it look that way and an anti-intelligentsia sentiment took hold...\n\nIn an effort to sell their product, universities started hiring administrators with business backgrounds. They found out that another way to market the high price tag to students was to furnish the campus with \u201camenities,\u201d technology no one uses, new buildings, sleek \u201clearning centers\u201d that are pedagogically useless, but look really nice on a campus tour. This stuff is expensive and the money has to come from somewhere so...\n\nDepartment budgets were slashed. As professors retire, they replace them slowly (or not at all), class sizes swell, and they replace some of the lost labor with cheaper teachers\u2014a surplus of PhDs means you can hire some of them to work as contingent faculty, adjuncts, visiting lines, non-tenure track jobs that rarely end up as permanent positions. The contingent lines are paid well below market-value (and market salaries for professors are dropping well below the middle class average anyway)\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard.",

I hear horror stories but experienced none. Business is split into a number of fields and subfields. It all depends what you're interested in. I did my MA in sociology before I started my PhD in Management. I chose a school specifically because of their focus on social network analysis.\n\nThere's accounting, finance, marketing, and information systems to name some of the fields. In management, where I am, you have sub fields like organizational behavior (more micro and focused on social psychology), strategic management (more macro and focused on org. performance), and organizational theory (borrows a lot from sociology). All of these areas have their own journals and conferences. I do a lot with social network analysis too, which has it's own set of journals and conferences separate from business schools, but there's lots of overlap.\n\nYou can start by cruising the Academy of Management's page and their journals to see what people in this field do. And check out https://orgtheory.wordpress.com along with their list of links to other sites.\n",

In the humanities data suggest that about half of all History Ph.D.s (my field) end up in full-time teaching positions but not all of those are tenure-track.(See [table #3 in this report,](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2018/the-geography-of-history-phds) which suggests 67% are in such positions which is a high estimate compared to others I've seen.)  In some fields that figure is much lower (biology is about 1/3rd) but they tend to have alternatives in industry.\n\nReality is that unless you get your Ph.D. from a top-20 program your odds are very slim. There are 200-300 applicants for every tenure-track position at my liberal arts college and we only hire one. Lots of candidates will apply to 50-75 positions in a given year and feel lucky to get a single on-campus interview. Further, [as this report illustrates,](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/march-2018/the-aha-jobs-report-the-2016%E2%80%9317-data-obscure-as-much-as-they-reveal) there are approximately four new Ph.D.s in history awarded each year for everyone full-time academic position advertised...which doesn't account for all the candidates from *prior* years who are also on the market. Digging further suggests there may well be as many as ten times as many job-seekers in history as there are positions in any given year.\n\nThe data for English are similar, if not worse. It's not something I'd advise anyone to pursue unless they have a clear alternative path as the traditional academic job market has become such a crapshoot that while there are jobs the odds against any one individual ending up in a traditional academic career look very, very bad.",

My cohort was huge at first: almost 50 people in the MA/Ph.D. program when we started. Of those, four finished Ph.D.s. Of them, I am the only one in a traditional tenure-track academic career. So a 2% rate in our case?   \n\n\nThat said, I started grad school in the early 1990s so numbers were very high coming is due to the recession around the Gulf War. Then the economy took off under Clinton and a lot of my classmates dropped out and took jobs in high tech or other exploding industries in the mid-late 1990s. So our numbers were probably skewed by external factors in ways that won't be representative now. The same program, BTW, now limits enrollment to 13-15 students per year and has a much better placement rate.",

      "text": "The job market was better when I was hired 12 years ago, but it\u2019s been improving over the past couple of years. I think the employment situation is different for each field, but you should ask the graduate directors at each program you apply to about where their graduates are employed (and ask about the job market). Regardless of field, it seems that it you can get into a top 10 PhD program, your odds of an academic position afterwards will be much higher (unless you hope to work at a community college). Also, my advice once you are in graduate school is to keep in mind that everyone on the job market will have the same degree as you, and it is what you do in addition to school that will set you apart from the crowd. To be a professor, you need to be an independent worker and highly motivated. In my field, that is demonstrated through publications. In my opinion, it\u2019s a great job; you get to work on what you find most interesting, there is a ton of flexibility and autonomy, the pay tends to be much higher in reality than the 9 month salary often listed (for example, I always earn 4 months of pay in the summer on top of my 9 month salary), and the diversity of what you do each day prevents it from being boring.

And do keep in mind, it's not like the people who are finding it difficult are not smart: they are the top of their class academically so competition is absolutely fierce. Even in fields with good job markets, candidates can't be very picky about what job they get or where they end up. I was in economics, and everybody in the field knows that if you go to a Top 50, or even a Top 100 school, you'll most likely be able to get a tenure-track job *somewhere*. The problem is, you can't be picky about where that somewhere is. If a candidate is married, has a tie to one geographic location they want to stay in, or anything like that, that severely hampers their options in other aspects of the jobs they get. One person I know graduated as one of the stars in his cohort, interviewed at MIT, Harvard, etc., but ended up taking a position in a lower-tier university in the same city because he didn't want to move at the time.\n\nBe very careful about why you want to do academia, what your options are, and what you're OK with.",

          "text": "> It is hard, but a small window is opening. The Boomers, who dominate the current jobs, are finally beginning to retire. \n\nDon't believe that. The same narrative was popular when I was in college in the late 1980s. There was a major report published c.1989 that projected a huge increase in faculty hiring; in fact, it claimed there would be a *shortage* of faculty candidates by the late 1990s. I and others were literally urged to go into academia by well-meaning mentors who thought the market was going to get better. It did not.\n\nWhat happened, of course, was that many of the people expected to retire did not (the mandatory retirement age was eliminated in the 1980s but everyone expected academics would still retire at 65 or 70). Cuts to public funding for higher ed meant when people *did* retire they weren't always replaced. And of course the rise of the neoliberal business model for higher ed meant the massive shift to contingent labor really took off in the late 1990s. As a result, I and all of my peers rushed into a market that got worse, rather than better, just about the time we completed our degrees in the late 1990s. And of course it's just continued to get worse ever since.\n\nAs someone with now 25+ years experience in the academy I agree that the boomers will soon retire en mass. But they won't be replaced with tenure-track faculty, at least in most fields. At best they will be replaced with contingent faculty. Admins look at those 70+ year old full professors earning $125K and they don't see the chance to hire two new tenure-track junior faculty at $65K each, they see the opportunity to shift $125K to some administrative line (a new VP of Athletic Marketing, perhaps) or to stem cuts elsewhere.

Biological and life sciences PhDs often spend 4-6 years after their PhD doing postdoctoral fellowships at low pay just to push out the papers and prepare for the grants needed to compete for a tenure-track position, and there are still far more candidates than their are jobs.\n\nComputer science and some engineering fields are doing better, mostly because there are lots of tech and other companies that will hire PhDs and pay them well, so there's less competition for the tenure-track jobs. You still can have similar experiences in graduate school, though, and you still need to get the papers and grants to get the job.\n\n&#x200B;",
