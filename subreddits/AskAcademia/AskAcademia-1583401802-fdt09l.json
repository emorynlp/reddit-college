  "title:": "How should we handle canceled conferences on our CVs?",
  "text": "Like many conferences upcoming, a conference of mine was canceled for May due to COVID-19 concerns.\n\nCan I still put it on my CV? On one hand, it was peer reviewed and accepted... but on the other hand it seems a little disingenuous to suggest the work was presented and the conference went ahead as planned. \n\nIs there a tasteful way to leave it on the CV, but reference that the work was accepted but not presented due to the conference being cancelled due to natural event (i.e. coronavirus). Obviously, this is not a new event, but as a junior scholar I am not sure how to handle it.  Thanks!",

This year, I really stepped it up and am supposed to give to 5 talks (3 international) in the next 6 months. This was the way I was going to rehab a slightly weak CV (my pub record is fine).  I'm hoping 2021 will pick up again, but honestly, a lot of them this year felt like pure dumb luck. I know a few of them won't be asked again next year (e.g. one is being paid for off a one year grant, etc.)",

      "text": "I had this happen last year. A hurricane hit where one of my conferences was scheduled to take place. I bounced this question to my chair, who then consulted with the dean and provost's office. As far as our T&P guidelines go, conferences only count as scholarly activity if you actually present, so I ended up leaving it off. My chair and dean wrote a letter that will explain that I was accepted to the conference (I provided them with the program) and that the conference was canceled (I provided them with the cancellation emails). The provost agreed that the conference will not count against me, but there is also an understanding that I try to essentially \"make up\" this presentation. I did that this year by getting two papers accepted at that conference (the organizers were sympathetic to how this affected promotions). \n\nIt was a conundrum, to say the least. This kind of thing doesn't happen very often, but we actually did have a mechanism for dealing with it.",

If I had an accepted NeurIPS paper accepted and the conference was cancelled, I think the expectation would be that I could count that. The actual presentation is an afterthought -- the important part is that your work was accepted.\n\nBut obviously I think that's not the norm for most fields where conference presentations are expected to be less than a fully-baked piece of work that has withstood equal peer-review to journal submissions.",

This does lead to some double-counting, but it also makes it clear if I presented a paper or if one of my co-authors did.\n\nOur papers also go through a full (one round) peer-review process like journal papers do, so maybe it's a bit different than having peer-reviewed conference abstracts. I would only put those under my \"Talks\" section.\n\nThe sections in my CV are \"under review\", \"journal papers\", \"peer-reviewed conference papers\", \"other conference papers\", and \"talks\". Some engineering conferences have papers, but only the abstracts are reviewed so those go under the \"other\" section. In your case, I would keep the conference paper publication, but neglect the talk item.",
