  "text": "I'm a postdoc and am part of a lab that is itself involved in a large scale study with a lot of data. It's a large collaborative dataset and I want to see if I can get involved and analyze some data/write a paper. \n\nHow can I ask my boss for this access? Will it look like I'm not happy with my current tasks? I don't want to seem invasive or demanding, I'm just interested and think I can add the tasks associated with analyzing some data to my current tasks without taking on too much. Any advice?",

You're supposed to be working towards developing your own independent research portfolio so these should be the kind of conversations you're having with them. Just say you've had an idea, you think you can manage the workload, are they interested?",
