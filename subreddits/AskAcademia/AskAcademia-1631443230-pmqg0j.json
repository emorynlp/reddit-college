  "text": "Hello,\n\nWe are going to host a panel on Transitioning A Career In To Academia at a conference, and tbh I am afraid since I know academia has a lot of things that we are afraid to speak about, I am supposed to be the host, but I dont know how I can make this panel genuine to people, the panelist are combination academia, industry... I would be grateful if you can give me some insights do you think maybe relevant or significant to be discussed..",

      "text": "I\u2019ve never moderated a panel myself, but this sounds like a lot of it could just be audience interaction. People generally have interesting questions at this sort of thing. Maybe start out by asking the panelists to talk about why they made the professional choices (academia/industry) that they did, and what difficulties they faced (if any). Branch out into asking what advice they might have for newer researchers, and then, if all goes well, you should be able to grow the conversation organically from there. \n\nI see you\u2019re doing this at ICRA. One thing you can always bring up is about gender disparity and representation being an implicit gatekeeping tactic. Different cultures contribute differently to this issue, so something as international as ICRA should give you many different POVs about this. Good luck!",

In most workplaces people have casual chat about their lives and family, so your sexual orientation does come up from time to time. And sometimes you discover your coworkers are really awkward about it, which makes them not talk to you as much, so they don't get to know you as well as other coworkers. Which means when opportunities come up they're less likely to think of putting your name forward just because they don't know you as well. This is just one example -- difficulty ensuring equal insurance benefits for your spouse (as straight people have) is another common example.\n\nThis is much less common today than 20 years ago, but in some fields (or even just some workplaces) it's still an issue. So when you're a sexual orientation or gender minority person, you always have this worry in the back of your head that your new workplace will be awkward or hostile if they knew about your personal life. It is always very relieving to hear about others' experiences in this.",

This resonated with me, unlike some of the other replies I got from people who seemed angered by my question and opinion.\n\nTo be blunt, still, this seems an internalized anxiety. Since like you said things now are much different than 20 years ago. I know myself and many others would not look at someone any different for being gay. So people should definitely have help with dealing with these anxieties about people knowing they are gay, but like I said in my other comment I believe there are better forums for dealing with these internalized feelings than a professional career advice conference for a general audience. \n\nNot to equate the two, but people with generalized anxiety and social oddness also experience those problems you mentioned. They are also best served through individual and focused group counseling",

                              "text": "It definitely is internalized anxiety, though I emphasize that those fears are realized more often than straight people generally know. Most 30-year-old LGBT people will have had at least a couple moments like that. That's enough to build a lot of caution (and anxiety) as a defense mechanism.\n\nWorking individually with a therapist is a fine way to address that anxiety. But it is also extremely effective to have an LGBT person be involved in panels like this and be willing to say one or two things about their experiences, or even just be present in front of the audience as an LGBT person who has \"made it.\" That's more effective (in some ways) than individual therapy because it reaches many people at once, including those that aren't fully aware that they're experiencing that anxiety (so they'll never go to a therapist).\n\nI suspect this works because the best way to get over anxiety like that is exposure/response therapy, which is deliberately experiencing the feared situation and working toward intentionally adjusting your response to convince your brain it's ok and not actually dangerous. Having a role model stand up as an example can work as a vicarious form of that exposure -- you see yourself in them, so when they show that they've gone through those new workplaces without incident, your brain visualizes it effectively and it functions similarly to a firsthand exposure. The LGBT person on the panel doesn't have to go into therapy-level detail of their experiences, they just have to be there and be themselves and show that they are doing ok.\n\n...Anyway, I'm not an expert, just an LGBT person who's been around the block. I've noticed firsthand that I get an inexplicable reassuring feeling when I encounter LGBT representation in professional settings, and I've always been surprised at the strength of that. Lately my therapist and I have been discussing exposure/response work and I think that framework really makes sense for this issue.",

Hearing from one of our schools highly successful faculty who had/has 3 kids early in her career was very helpful in appeasing some concerns.

                  "text": "I understand there are numerous groups and meetings that deal with exactly those issues. That is the correct forum for that discussion, not in a general audience seeking professional career advice.\n\nBesides, everyone has to deal with microaggressions. For example, you just assumed that these issues are invisible to me as a straight white male. You assume that I am ignorant and uncaring of these issues. That is a micro aggression. I am simply stating my opinion that sexual orientation should be left out of the workplace, and if people are struggling with sexual orientation issues there are better forums than a professional career advice conference for a general audience.",
