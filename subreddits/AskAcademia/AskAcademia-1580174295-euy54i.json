  "title:": "Is it okay to 'take it easy' during postdoc?",
  "text": "I'll be honest, I (32 year old woman, psychology phd) started a postdoc about 6 months ago and I've been pretty lazy ever since. I worked my butt off during my PhD and was very productive (15+ pubs). But I kind of burnt myself out and had to start my postdoc right after my dissertation defense. \n\nI  regret not taking much time off during my PhD, so I've been having a fun time during my postdoc-- I got a girlfriend, have been traveling, camping, developing new hobbies, etc. My postdoc isn't closely supervised and my duties are analyzing data and writing it up for publication, so I mostly work from home. I typically end up working about 35 hours a week, and rarely work weekends.\n\nSo far, my PI hasn't complained because I've certainly been working, just not nearly as hard as I used to. Still, it's probably obvious I'm not as productive as the other postdocs in my lab. \n\nI'm wondering A) how common is it to take it easy during your postdoc? and B) will this come back to haunt me? Thanks!",

Ha! \nI\u2019ve recently started a postdoc and am feeling the same way - I worked SO much during my PhD and now I feel that I\u2019m rolling down the hills, so to speak. This weekend my PI emailed me edits on a bunch of stuff I sent last week and I just...didn\u2019t look at them. Not until this morning. And it was glorious. \nI feel that after a PhD it\u2019s okay to work like a normal human, but maybe that\u2019s just me haha. I also have no intention on staying in academia forever, so I don\u2019t feel that fire to never stop, either.",

      "text": "That's one of the pitfalls of academia, I think. It \"trains\" us into thinking that only those who rise with their science on their mind and fall asleep, exhausted and still thinking about their research 18 hours later, are \"real\" scientists. Publish or perish. Impact Points \u00fcber Alles. \n\nFeynman spent weeks doing things that had nothing to do with his work. Or, closer to your world maybe, Watzlawick was an avid cook and rebuilt motorcycles, often telling his doctoral students to come back in a week when he was willing to think about his research again.  C. Wright Mills suffered from a cardiac condition that would kill him at 45 and, knowing he didn't have as much time as others, he spent only 40 hours a week working on the Sociological Imagination, \"living life at the fullest\" as he called it, on his motorcycle.\n\nOthers, like Rudy Rucker, wrote fiction on the side. My advisor and later PI Rose MacAllen made a deal with her then girlfriend, now wife, that she would never work more than 50 hours a week and would quit academia if she ever had to. Yeah, I sometimes had to wait until the next morning to talk to her about things (there was a \"no science at BBQs\" rule that pissed me off something fierce back then), but when 80% of the department struggled with infighting and burnout she went on to publish on neuropsychology at a slower but steadier pace, becoming one of the greats.\n\nThat we feel like apologizing for only working 40 hours a week... that's academia's greatest scam.",

      "text": "First, you need to look after yourself to do your best work. You won't necessarily be able to keep up intense work schedules of the Phd throughout your career. 35 hours a week and not working on weekends doesn't sound like \"taking it easy\" too much to me. It's not a huge amount of hours, but working smart is the key thing, not how many hours, in academia. There is of course a toxic culture which makes people think they've got to live their work and be doing it 24/7. But this is rubbish; work hard sure, but work intelligently and look after other parts of your life as well for long-term success, IMO.\n\nAnd especially if you feel \"burned out\" from your PhD, it maybe that you need a while to recuperate and, because your pace has dropped, you feel like you aren't working. When in reality you might just be coming back down from working too much, at a rate that is not sustainable.\n\nHaving said that, the attitide of \"my PI hasn't complained\" suggests you aren't working for yourself. In academia, you've got to like the work and the project otherwise what's the point. The salary is certainly not very good for being so well educated. If your driving force for doing work is worrying that your PI might complain, that might suggest an underlying motivational issue. This is common at the start of postdocs because it can feel in a sense like you are back to square one, starting a new project. You've got to manage your expectations and realize it is still a learning experience and that it will take time before you are qualified for your new line of investigation and it's all running smoothly. You go from being the most expert person on the planet on your PhD topic to diving into a new area of research when you start your posdoc (I don't know how much a change in topic it was for you), and it can feel like a backwards/sideways step that can reduce motivation.\n\nWill it come back to haunt you? If you ultimately want a job as a professor, then succeeding in your PhD is important (as you did) but probably even more important is succeeding in your postdoc. You're not going to get an incredibly competitive academic job if your CV has a downward trajectory and your more recent work is not impactful/exciting. So it kind of depends on your goals, but if you aren't working enough to produce exciting work, you probably are hurting your chances of being a professor. But I think you have plenty of time to rest, figure this out, learn new things, become and expert and do some great work. Good luck.",

I do feel that I have some underlying motivational issues due to what you mentioned--it feels a little like I'm back to square one in terms of starting a new project, which feels like a setback after finally starting to feel like an expert in my phd topic. I'm also just not as interested in this project as I was in my PhD projects. I guess maybe I just need to push forward and try to find my path in this new project. Postdocs definitely feel like an \"awkward in-between phase\" on the path to being a professor.",

You've got so many more skills and know how than you did at the start of the PhD that the learning curve and getting up to speed doesn't take nearly as long.\n\nAnd I think the interest and excitement with your new project will more than likely grow as you learn more and get settled in and, critically, have a few experimental successes, \"get the ball rolling\" as it were.\n\nMost excitingly, you get to bring your PhD experience and knowledge and flavor with you into your postdoc, and that will help you really make the project your own; it will evolve from what you and your advisor expect it to be at the start, and you will be the main driving force of that change.\n\nI've gone through the stages from student, postdoc, assistant prof and now associate prof and I can tell you that postdoc is the most intellectually exciting time of the lot once you get over the initial hurdle of again feeling slow and like you can't do anything!

However, you need to deal with 2 issues: i) peer pressure of your specific group, ii) keeping up with what's needed to have a good CV.\n\nConcerning i) there's nothing we can tell you. Peer pressure sucks. Even if you produce 10x more than everyone else in your team combined, if you regularly work less hours you'll be seen as unprofessional. Even if others reddit/tinder 5 hours per day. It sucks. I truly hope it's not your case. I can do whatever I want at work and I couldn't be more grateful. If I need to go skiing because it just snowed I just phone in and I'm set. People from another team that I go to lunch with, cannot take days off, even if planning it in advance, unless it's August, because otherwise it \"looks lazy\".\n\nConcerning ii) this is really a critical issue. Research is like competitive sports. It makes sense to be a researcher only if you're doing world class stuff. And it does require \"producing\" like the other top players. So... If the other players disregard their health and work 80hrs/week it's hard being competitive if you work only 35, very sadly!!\n\nI worked 35hours/week like you for years and I was doing ok, but nothing that could land me tenure or even visibility. 2 years ago I had issues and I decided that I wanted to show what I was capable of. I worked nights and weekends (at home) and got awards, many nice publications, industry partnerships etc... But it damaged my mental health so badly that I was starting to have also physical symptoms and not only psychological ones! Was it worth it? Not 100% sure. Since december I'm slowing down and planning to partially live off what I've done. I wouldn't have gotten here however without working so badly those 2 years.  However my PhD publications were few and sucked... Also PhDs here are short... so maybe you've already produced something that you can live off... Just keep checking what your potential \"competitors\" for a tenure position are producing (outside, not in your team).\n\nAlso, most of my time spent at work is lost between \"trying to focus\" (I'm really terrible at it, I might enter at 10 a.m. and open the actual software I have to work on at 2p.m. after lunch) and being interrupted for questions, meetings, \"fixing the lab devices\" for those that don't understand them, tutoring the student etc... If you don't have such interruptions and you're someone that has an easier time focusing probably 35hours/week are quite a lot.",

      "text": "It depends on what the next step is for you. If your goal is to stay in academia, then postdoc is a transition towards becoming an independent researcher. The expectation from a postdoc is not just to analyse data and publish papers but also get at least some experience with grant writing, supervising students and teaching besides figuring out your research niche (future research vision). So amount of time you\u2019re working doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re \u201cchecking\u201d the to-do list for achieving your professional goals.",

If you are thinking of an academic position for your next step - you will be competing against a pool of post-docs who have NOT been on cruise control.\n\nRemember those other post-docs in your lab who you are not as productive as?  Who do you think will be considered if a position opens up where you are?",

      "text": "There's something to be said for this being the first 6 months, too. Right now you've established a routine of 35 hour weeks in the beginning which should allow you to work well in your lab without burning out and making meaningful progress. \n\nIf you're not making good progress, the 3-month, 6-month or 1-year milestones would be great times for it to come up during either a formal or informal discussion about progress and how you're fitting in in your current role.\n\nI would encourage you to view the post-doc as more of a 'real' job instead of a training position, and expect a bit more from your employer (instead of your college, if you get my meaning). When crunch time for a deadline for papers or conferences, etc, come you can spend more time on your projects, but for now a good work life balance can be very beneficial for your current and future productivity. You probably have access to all kinds of employee benefits that you did not as a student. Time to see what they offer, and I would bet one of those things is advice or seminars on how to stay healthy and avoid burning out.",

      "text": "Well guess I'll be that dissenting opinion. First I totally agree we shouldn't have to work ourselves to exhaustion for this career. But working 35-40 hrs is not the reality in academia....its insanely competitive from what I've seen and experienced first hand.  There are plenty of people out there that will work that hard and they are your competitors. \n\n15 pubs is excellent but your PD advisor will expect pubs soon, even if they haven't mentioned it. If you can be productive only working 35 hours (which I'm assuming you are hired to do 40?), then great. And I totally get wanting a break...but I wouldn't recommend slacking too much if you're trying to get an academic job.  And yes, I would argue working 35 hrs from a 40 hrs a week expectation (correct?) is a bit slacking. But do what's best for your sanity.",

Rest comes (possibly) after you secure one of those - or possibly not until tenure. \n\nIf that seems unfair - perhaps it is, but the reality of it is that your competition has the same pressures, and those that can postpone their break until later will have a stronger record.",

One of the coolest things about academia is that just thinking is a part of the job.\n\nIf you are \"working\" 35 hours a week and spending some other time thinking and whatever, you may be \"taking it easy\" relative to previous times in your life, but that's necessary from time to time.  If you're productive and moving the ball forward, don't feel guilty.\n\nAlso, hours worked isn't a good measure of how hard you're working or how productive you are.  I have a four-year old and have to be out the door by 5pm but many of my colleagues are still here.  I know I \"work\" fewer hours than they do, but I'm as if not more productive.",
