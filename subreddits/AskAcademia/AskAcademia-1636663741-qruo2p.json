  "title:": "Taking a gap between master's and PhD",
  "text": "Hello! I hope this is the right place to post this. Please let me know if it's not and I'd be happy to direct it somewhere else!\n\nI am currently in my second year of a master's program in communication studies. I am 23, going to turn 24, and in the spring will defend my thesis. I've had the opportunity to teach through an assistantship at my school and I truly enjoy it. This experience has helped me determine that I would like to continue teaching at the university level in the future, though I know that a tenured position at a university will require a PhD.\n\nMy dilemma here is that I'm not 100% sure I want to go on to get my PhD at this moment. I am feeling some academic burnout from being in school for most of my life/being completely online last year, and I think a gap could be beneficial. It would allow me to gain some experience outside of academia, earn more money than a stipend, and ideally rejuvenate my passion to be in school. I have a few questions for this community about this idea and would love to hear your insight!\n\n1. Did you take time off between your undergrad and master's, or your master's and PhD? What were some of the pros and cons?\n\n2. Are you still an attractive candidate for PhD funding/fellowships if you've been out of school for a while? My family is concerned that taking time off could cause me to be a less attractive candidate to programs and I may lose out on funding compared to a student who goes straight from their master's to their PhD. Is this common, or a case of overthinking?\n\nThank you so much for creating this community and letting me ask these questions, I really appreciate it!",

As a potential supervisor I absolutely want a PhD student who has experience of applying themselves 40hrs a week and has a better idea what they want to do because they\u2019ve worked and understood what they like and dislike.",

      "text": "In US. I took 10 years off between BA and MS and about 1.5 years between MS and PhD. For me, it was perfect. I had time to work and focus on my family. Now I have a 20 year career and a terminal degree. I have a colleague who is in school and is going straight through. For her, that seems to be an excellent choice. I don\u2019t see any reason why choosing time to advance your career would make you a less attractive candidate. (But, things could be different in your country or area of study.)",

      "text": "Time off between studies is always valuable. I took 8 years off between my BA and starting my MA. In the time between, I was able to teach English abroad in Korea and move to New Zealand with my husband. A bit of life and work experience can be a great break from the books. I also went back to school in my 30s, so I was more mature and had better work ethic to do my master's.",

      "text": "While interviewing for a PhD position in the US, I had a potential PI mention to me that they would prefer I had worked for a few years prior to applying. Definitely not uncommon for people to do, especially if you aren't 100% certain about a PhD. After still moving forward with a PhD right after my MS, I would probably have done things differently in hindsight and taken at least a year off due to burnout and being less interested in my initial research questions than I thought. Good luck with whatever you choose!",
