  "title:": "Does it make sense to do another master, or should I apply for a PhD?",
  "text": "I graduated in March 2021 with a master's degree in International Relations. I am currently working full-time as a trainee but the job does not fit with my studies at all. As soon as my contract expires I would like to pursue another degree.\n\nThe fact is that I am interested in doing a PhD concerning war studies or military history. However, I do not feel prepared at all. The degree in international relations that I got covered a great variety of topics without going into detail. Therefore, I am thinking about doing another master which specifically deals with war, strategy and/or military history. \n\nDoes it make sense? Or should I start reading loads of books and literature reviews in order to familiarize with those topics to finally find a research gap on which I could work on in a PhD?",

What valuable employable-at-a-think-tank thing are you gaining from a master's or PhD in history that you don't have from your IR master's or spending equivalent time working at a think tank or even doing a PhD in IR? In general, a history PhD is going to be training to be a professor in history and you'll have to think about if that transfers.",

You might want to market yourself to some of the elite private schools. You'd be surprised of the opportunities that come to teachers. Many don't have the interest or ability to pursue them, but you seem like you would. I've seen grants for teachers to study abroad, etc. Further, you could get scholarships and professional development funding to help you increase your expertise. This might help you build a bridge toward the direction you want to go. Through all of this, you might land yourself a nice museum job or something. Get a master's in library science, and you might secure yourself a job in a library. And don't think small about libraries. You could land in one of the military libraries or one of many special archival institutes that exist. Good luck on pursuing your dream!",

      "text": "You do not need a PhD of any kind to work as an analyst at a think tank. That is a junior-mid position that many people get with a BA and a couple internships. Your MA in IR is more than enough academic preparation for this type of work. If you are striking out in analyst jobs with your IR MA, this is probably attributable to one or more of the following:\n\n* You have inadequate internship/work experience. \n\n* Your job materials need work (resume presentation, cover letter, interview performance...) Sometimes and depending on the type of analysis you want to do, you may need to scrub your social media also.\n\n* You are simply not applying to enough jobs.\n\nThe broad policy field is steeped in credentialism, so I get where people get the idea that they need infinite degrees to enter, but the number one quality it requires is tenacity. Successful early-career applicants have a variety of degrees of different levels and different prestigiousness, but what they have in common is a strong relevant work history (which for those of us who don't have rich parents requires some tightening of the proverbial belt, working two jobs, living with 5 roommates...) and good networking skills (and probably some zygote of a professional network). Certainly a prestigious master's program can help you access internships, alumni, other opportunities - but the HKSs of the world pump out hundreds of grads who end up never working a day in their field, whereas the actual policy field is simultaneously full of grads of the University of Bosnia and Herzegovina and similar. \n\nWhich is to say, who's to say whether you should do a PhD, a masters, or whatever -but you should def do more thinking about it.",
