  "title:": "Got rejected by a fellowship and found it hard to get friends\u2019 understanding of the disappointment",
  "text": "Thank you for reading my post. \nI\u2019m 30 yo and have gotten a little lost in all aspects of my life. \n\nJust finished studying part-time for my bachelor\u2019s degree, it took me 4 good years, but I finally did it. My goal to get this BA was for me to go to grad school, I wanted to become a researcher, wanted to be of use to my profession(I worked 12 years in it), which is highly practical but lack of systematic organization. \n\nBut along the way, I found that nobody understands this goal of mine, except for my husband. I\u2019m very grateful to have him but I also miss having my friends\u2019 understanding and generally a support system to help me through these difficult application procedures and the far and uncertain goal of mine. \n\nMy application got to the final round at a famous university, but it wasn\u2019t picked at the end. I found that I do not have a friend to talk to about it. My colleagues are all technical people, went to technical schools, and don\u2019t know how universities work; my classmates studied with me for the past 4 years are just part-time students who want a degree to get promoted at work, none of them are interested in studying further. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m stuck alone at a crossroad that the further I go, things will only get harder for people to understand me. I don\u2019t know how to get through this feeling. And I certainly am doubting this goal of mine now because of the rejection and how lonely I feel in it. \n\nAny thoughts of what to do?",

      "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I am not in your situation, so please take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. That being said, from what I understand your conundrum is incredibly common.  \n\nFrom what I've personally seen, most do not aspire towards working as high level researchers, or exploring the upper echelons of academia. And that is 100% okay but it does mean that the further you step into this path, the less you may be able to relate to those who aren't on this trajectory. \n\nThe fact that you have a husband who is sympathetic to your plight is amazing! But the  need to expand your support system is understandable. My only thought is that you need to try and find a support system within this niche. And it could be online platforms like Reddit or GradCafe. If you were close to your professors or grad students they may be a little more sympathetic. But it's also good to talk to your existing friends and maybe phrasing what your going through in a way that is more easily relatable, because they probably care but just don't fully understand what you're experiencing.",

          "text": "Yes for GradCafe! Honestly, you will find some good people on there who are willing to talk to you one-on-one to just hear your frustrations or talk to you. If you look at forums or sites with people who are interested in the same discipline as you, you can find comfort through that community. \n\nAnd by the way, it is completely common for people to not have any close friends who have the same aspirations as you or who will understand what you are going through. It's tough and I was in that same situation. Those who may truly understand you are probably professors and graduate students. If you're close with any of them, I would suggest talking to them.\n\nHave you tried counseling or therapy? I feel they can help you sort out your feelings, and help you figure out what you would like to do moving forward.",

          "text": "Agree. I am now a TT professor and in my phd program i had several friends who applied 2 or more times to the same program (year after year) before getting in, let alone to other programs. In academia rejection is a constant, and many of those who are successful (in publishing, jobs, grants) apply a lot and learn through that process how to fine tune their work.",

It's competitive right now and the more applications you put out there, the better your odds will be at success.\nAdditionally, if you plan to go into research, rejection is a big part of it. It's through rejection that we grow. Embrace it, be grateful for the lesson, and move forward. I wish you luck.",

      "text": "Getting to the final round of consideration at a prestigious university suggests that you have many of the qualities that schools are looking for, and that it's worth the effort to apply to more programs, for more fellowships, etc.\n\nAs for not having people who understand or care about your goals, well... It's pretty common for scholars to find that only a few people are interested in their work, even when the work is important. For that matter, it's not uncommon for a researcher to go through phases where they feel like their own work isn't important. But if you believe your work is important, and you pursue it, you will probably be able to find people who will care about the same issues.  \n\nBeing a researcher can be lonely in many ways, but researchers work in communities of people who care about the subject, so even if your college friends don't care, you can make new friends who do.  (And you can still be friends with people who don't really understand your work or why you do it.)  \n\nYou specifically mention your desire to be of use to your profession, and I am sure that there are people in that profession who are interested in doing their work better and who would therefore be interested in research that seeks to improve it. (And, sadly, I am also sure that there are people in the profession who want to do things the same old way and would hate you for suggesting otherwise.)",

But really I'd tend to say, it's better to keep the personal life and the work separate anyway, except to extent you need good relationships for networking. Things seem better for me, at least, when my \"amateur enthusiasm\" is linked to far more individual activities (with selected collaborators), and I keep the rest much colder and more professional.",
