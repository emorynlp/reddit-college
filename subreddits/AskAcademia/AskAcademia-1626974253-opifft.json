  "text": "I really don't understand. All I want is to study further some science that I feel is not taught at a deep enough level as an undergraduate and hopefully use that knowledge to do something productive for mankind. That's it, that's all I want and I seem to be getting punished for it. \n\nEvery time I express interest about doing a PhD, I have to hear about how I won't be accepted because (i) I am not a straight A student  \n(ii) I don't have publications  \n(iii) I don't have a 340 GRE  \n(iv) I don't have any awards in my life\n\nSeriously, my entirety of my undergraduate is hearing about how doing a PhD is a bad choice. My Professors tell me not to do it due to lack of positions in academia. My friends tell me how it is a waste of time and I'm better off gaining work experience to get a well paying job. The people I know doing a PhD tell me not to do it because of the stress and low pay (stipend). The guys who got accepted to PhD programs tell me that my credentials aren't good enough to be accepted into a graduate school.\n\nI don't understand. Isn't science the bedrock of humanity's technological advancement? Why does it seem like choosing the route to understand nature better like some kind of punishment where I am struggling to survive? Why are there not enough places for us that are interested in learning even though we do not have a stellar record? Shouldn't we be encouraging MORE people to go into science and not less? Why aren't PhD students paid more for survival?\n\nSeriously, from the way it sounds, doing a PhD is equivalent to digging your own grave and wanting to study something further is like some sort of punishment.",

Fewer candidates means more funding per person, higher job availability, and higher pay at all levels.\n\nAnd it's not designed as a punishment, it's a sacrifice. There are just so many people that want to do it that they don't have to be good positions in order to get qualified applicants. You see people go through worse when pursuing more desirable jobs like acting or art, and they have a much lower and much less predictable chance of success. I'm not saying difficulties are good, but they're understandable.\n\nWhat I would like to see is a stricter limit on the number of PhD graduates with an increase in worker protections for student researchers. Make it hella hard to get in, but nicer once you do.",

It's not just studying more and getting a better understanding of a topic, a situation where you could have as many people learning as can fit in the room. It's a job where you do research, trying to discover something new about the world. So PhD admissions is more like interviewing for a job lots of people are interested in (despite the low pay) so your bosses for the job can be really picky and frankly need to be because their success depends on your's and they likely don't have much job security or high pay either.\n\nThe system is very broken.",

      "text": "A year ago you made a post asking if you should do a PhD. \n\n> I would like to do a PhD simply because i want to learn more about the subject\n\nYou were seemingly two years into your degree, meaning you're a third year now. In your last post, you self identified as\n\n> an incredibly slow learner. Despite the sacrificed summer holidays and weekends spent studying, I am nothing more than an average student. The idea of a PhD entices me because I would get to spend time studying and learning new areas of physics and math.\n\nComing back to today:\n\n> All I want is to study further some science that I feel is not taught at a deep enough level as an undergraduate and hopefully use that knowledge to do something productive for mankind.\n\nYou could absolutely do a taught masters degree after your undergrad. You would have to pay to do it. But it would fulfil your desire for further study. More than that though, your desire for study won't necessarily translate to a desire to do research, which is what a PhD is actually about. You're 3 years into your degree with no name on any publications, and you don't mention getting research experience, so it really doesn't seem like you've been trying (I know there's been a pandemic, but there are things you could have done before/in spite of that).\n\nYour lofty \"do something productive for mankind\" ambition also seems incredibly na\u00efve, especially for someone who rates their own academic abilities so lowly.\n\n> Why are there not enough places for us that are interested in learning even though we do not have a stellar record? Shouldn't we be encouraging MORE people to go into science and not less? Why aren't PhD students paid more for survival?\n\nResearch funding is not infinite. Money given to a student with no experience, a poor record, and vaguely lofty goals to study and help mankind, is all money that can't then go to a more qualified candidate. Again from your last post:\n\n> I can't help but think that when comparing myself to my peers, I think most of them are more suitable to do a PhD then I am. They are far more knowledgeable and intelligent than I am.\n\nSo why should someone invest in you getting a PhD? Over and above investing in more suitable candidates?",

I am also 3 years into my degree with no publications and research experience, but the reason is because I am doing a 2nd major and coping with 2 subjects is kind of hard each semester. So on top of that, doing a research project would be even harder.\n\nHowever, I do have a compulsory research project at the end of my undergraduate degree in the 4th year because I am pursuing an honors degree, but by then I would have cleared most of my coursework.\n\nIs this 1 year research experience enough? I kind of feel it's unrealistic for me to dive into research in the 1st 3 years especially since I am trying to keep my grades up :(",

I got my name on two publications from that work. And my research supervisor for those two projects was obviously a really good reference for my applications.\n\nI can't comment on your workload or your grades. If you have great grades then that can compensate to a degree for no research experience. But at the end of the day, if you have two applicants for one position, identical in all respects but one has research experience, who are you going to choose?\n\nI applied to external undergraduate research grants to fund my work (didn't get it my first time but I self funded), but many universities run and fund their own undergraduate research roles. In my group we tend to have 2-4 undergraduate researchers every summer.\n\nAnd I get that this advice is coming late for you, but to anyone else who reads this: it doesn't matter if after 2 years of undergrad you don't know exactly what you want to research. The skills you develop should be largely transferable. So pick something that interests you at the time, and worry about your future topics later.",

You can still apply places, obviously, and you might do fine. It just depends who you're up against. But if cost isn't an issue then you might as well.\n\nOtherwise yes, finding ways to gain research experience, even taking a research assistant position for a year, would buy you that additional experience should you find you need it.

Summer research experience allows the student to (1) concentrate on their work full-time, making them more productive, and (2) do so at a different institution than the one they study at, which expands their network. \n\nFor example, I did minimal term-time research during undergrad since I was already taking a full course load, but this worked out really well for me since it gave me lots of different sources for research-based reference letters (compared to people who worked in a single lab for all four years) and several publications, though most were middle-author.\n\nIt's not completely clear where you stand in your degree or when you intend to apply---if this is the summer between your third and fourth years, it's obviously a bit late to tell you to do summer research starting two months ago. Similarly, if you apply this fall then you would still be in the early stages of your project when you solicit a letter of recommendation. \n\nIf you wait another cycle, a year of solid undergrad thesis research coupled with a strong academic record backed by good recs should be fine to get you into a PhD program, but likely not the best of the best programs. However, it should position you quite well for a master's program if that's more in line with your goals.",

So I spent time helping the university organize those events for freshman. I also tried to find work but in the country I am, the economy was really bad and the available jobs were a bit, how should I put it, out of scope.\n\nIt wasn't until my 3rd year when I had my first proper introduction to set theory did I find my true interest and wanted to pursue it further. Problem is, the area I wanted to pursue was in set - theoretic topology. However, the professor who taught me set theory had was mainly focused in combinatorics. What's worse was that he was the only one in the department studying set theory and he was a pretty old dude.\n\nSo I spent this current summer trying to study set - theoretic topology so that I could do something related for my undergrad thesis.\n\nI know it kind of sounds like excuses but I guess what's done is done.\n\nWas thinking of doing a masters first and then going to do a PhD, but I read in a comment of another reddit post (can't remember which one was it) that US schools look down on masters because it is seen as you being unable to secure a decent PhD program in the first place.

There's an enormous luck factor involved in how quickly you stumble on the topic you want to study and opportunities to get started early, never mind even the mere knowledge that one can/should start early, are hardly available in an equitable way.\n\nIn your situation, I would reach out to set theory professors at other institutions, especially if they've already worked with that professor before, to co-advise your work in some fashion. It's more difficult with term-time work to be advised across institutions, but it helps a lot to have more people to consult when you're stuck, to read over your work, and to write recommendation letters when the time comes.\n\n>I read in a comment of another reddit post (can't remember which one was it) that US schools look down on masters because it is seen as you being unable to secure a decent PhD program in the first place. How accurate is this?\n\nThis sounds like absolute shit advice. I'm sure there are snobs like this out there, but I haven't met a single professor who feels this way about master's degrees and the type is probably not going to go out of their way to serve on adcoms, either. \n\nKnowing that you could be better prepared and taking the appropriate measures to address that, whether it's a master's degree, non-degree coursework, or work/research experience, is indicative of the academic maturity and self-evaluation that is critical for success in a PhD program. \n\nMore so than prodigies and people with the right combination of privilege/luck who are ready to go straight into PhD programs out of undergrad, programs look for reliable people who are aware of and know how to address gaps in their knowledge and training.",
