  "text": "Long story short, my undergraduate students are terrible at writing essays. So bad, that I can't understand a single idea being communicated by many of them. I know that I most likely wrote like this in undergrad, but I'm having a hard time grading their papers consistently. What strategy do you use, and how have you been able to help improve your students' writing?",

Used rubrics for everything and had them turn in outlines, a rough draft, and then a final draft of the paper. A couple students had rough drafts that were good enough to submit as the final with only minimal edits. Also made their lives a bit easier since the term paper was largely done well before everyone else had theirs due along with finals.",

They may have been a bit too strict, but I just didn't put enough effort in it.\n\nSome schools have certain quota's to keep in mind, but I wouldn't hesitate to fail everyone who doesn't meet the basic requirements to start a higher education.

After having them talk through their papers, though, it was really clear that they did have arguments and claims, but they were running into two problems:\n\n(1) They have been conditioned not to take strong stances; which prevents them from taking clear stances.\n\n(2) They have no concept of how paragraphs should work. Students would start a point at the start of one paragraph and reach the end of it by the middle of the next paragraph, where they would then begin another point. Or they would intertwine points throughout. Often, this meant that their sentences made sense, but not how they were supposed to fit together. Also, it meant that often the critical sentence in an argument was buried in the middle of the paragraph.\n\nAfter discussing this with them and going through their papers, the clarity of their papers increased tremendously. It\u2019s still bad...but it\u2019s bad in a way that\u2019s clear and which then allows me to actually give meaningful feedback.\n\nSo...yes, rubrics...but if you have the bandwidth, consider spending some time on what you expect their papers to look like and how you expect them to be structured.",

      "text": "Clear rubrics are a good start, but let's be honest, if they haven't been taught how to write a clear sentence/paragraph, a rubric isn't going to open that door for them. You need to set real (reasonable and high) expectations and help them reach them.\n\nHere are some other ideas to throw in the mix:\n\n* Specific, narrowly-focused writing prompts/assignments\n* Unlimited re-writes. Your students are all turning in their first drafts and just getting them to re-write a second draft will be extremely useful for most of them. No one will do that many draft, the \"unlimited\" part kind of just speaks to the spirit of the process.\n* Give low grades  (Cs, Ds, Fs) to bad first drafts, and give them liberally, but give them clear feedback and allow re-writes. Refer them to the writing center on campus. \n* The #1 thing that will really help them is **one-on-one feedback sessions** outside of class where you go through what they turned in, discuss what's working and what isn't and make sure they understand what they should do. This is a lot more work for you and for them, so it really depends on how invested you are in this mission.\n* The absolute best tip you can give them is to start the second draft in a completely blank new document. If any of them take this advice I guarantee that (1) you will be able to tell and (2) that draft will be 2+ letter grades higher than the first one. Most students will not take this tip because they think they are lazy, when in fact starting from a blank new document for draft #2 is the laziest way to improve dramatically without breaking a sweat.",

You can use previous students' papers (de-identified, with permission) or write one yourself (it takes extra time to do this, but it actually saves you a lot time in the back end). Comment the hell throughout the paper to show what's good, what's bad, what you're looking for, what to avoid. Incentivize the students to look over this example (perhaps a graded assignment/pop quiz just to check that they digested it) and encourage them to employ it.\n\nAnd keep the writing assignments consistent throughout the term. Same number of pages, same internal structure, same expectation, same grading rubric. It'll make grading over time go smoothly and the product will improve.\n\nAlso dedicate half a class to the art of essay writing, lit reviews, whatever you're asking them to produce. It feels like a waste of time  because you'd expect them to know the stuff by now, but as evident, it's not always the case. I usually do this in the beginning of the term and keep drawing them back to the concepts covered in that class.\n\nUndergrads are bad writers because (among other thing) it's hard to keep consistent structure and expectations across courses, instructors, and disciplines.

Did the experiment work? No? Then back to the drawing board. You change your methods and test again. It's your job. To expect to run continual experiments with perfect results is irrational and masochistic. We can make our experiment process easier or more efficient, but we have to be prepared to fail and try again--and probably more often than we succeed. Staying optimistic and grateful to do this work is a good tonic for frustration.\n\nEmpathy is also healthy. Students are giving it all they've got in some sense--even when they're not. Their lack of skill is generally not their fault, nor ours. Are they sleeping? Hungry? Being abused? Did they grow up in a household where everyone spoke Spanish to them and go to a high school that was underfunded and overcrowded? Are the working 40 hours a week to pay for their mom's prescriptions? Are they undocumented? Depressed? Anxious? Autistic? Or just not that convinced that college is worth the loans, which may or may not be true? I find many of these factors impact most of my kids, so I don't take it personally when they can't perform. They don't want to be \"bad\" writers and slackers any more than we want them to be.\n\nOne of my students was strangled. She didn't have her essay done but came on time to our appointment to look it over. I saw the finger-shaped bruises on her neck and the burst blood vessels in her eyes. The fact that she stayed in my class and improved her writing was a fucking miracle. I was ecstatic to grade her work, rough as it was. She stayed in school! I was like, yes, give me all your terrible sentences! Just stay here and stay safe and let me catch a glimpse of you every now and then now that you're not in my class anymore, just so I know you're okay.\n\nWe can control what we can control: Our teaching, our grading process, our attitudes. Doing what we can is not passing the buck, but acknowledging that we work in a rigged system and that we are 100% human. We are also *human:* We can be patient and faithful. We can change systems slowly if we try. And we have an enormous community (like here!) to lean on if we look for it.\n\nWe do good stuff. Our self-love should equal or exceed our critique of ourselves and our students.",

Create a formatting template or require specific formatting guidelines (eg APA)\n\n3. Require students go to the Writing Center or other academic tutoring agency on campus at least once with their paper to get feedback. Make the tutoring a requirement of its own with its own grade or embed the grade in the assignment itself (eg failure to attend tutoring results in a 10% reduction from final earned grade)\n\n4. I assume this isn\u2019t a writing-based class, but consider offering opportunity\u2019s for peer review. Peer review needs to be purposeful though. One of my favorite peer review tactics is to get students into groups and have them read their essays aloud to one another. As the other student is listening, they have to come up with 3 questions about the reader\u2019s paper, specifically areas where they\u2019re confused. The reader tends to hear grammatical errors and other organization issues when they\u2019re forced to read aloud. \n\n5. RUBRICS. Use them religiously. Like the assignment prompt, these need to be annoyingly specific. \n\n6. When you collect the essays, ask students to print the rubric and go through their assignment with the rubric. Give them the opportunity to assess their own work. This might give you insight into if there\u2019s something you\u2019re miscommunicating (Like is they all think they did fantastic but the essays are garbage) or some other issue (like they\u2019re lazy and not doing the work but still think they deserve an A).",

Unless it is a language or literature course, I tend to think grammar and spelling mistakes - or confusing writing - shouldn't detract much from the grade so long as you can understand the gist of what is being said - determine whether that substance merits a particular grade and go with that. Perhaps do so with a note asking them to either come in to see you during office hours, or explaining they had many mistakes and should seek assistance from the university writing center, ask for a re-write, etc.\n\nRubrics can be helpful as others have pointed out, but they can also cause their own set of problems. At times they can be overly arbitrary and result in students getting grades that are too high, or worse, too low compared to the actual quality and substance of the paper. Make sure to give yourself some wiggle room if using one (or use it but don't release it to students). Talk about the issue in class, even if briefly, and say that you'll be grading harder on grammar and spelling on the next essay so students will be expected to proofread better if they expect to maintain a similar grade on the next assignment.\n\nIf it is really bad? Grade it accordingly - one thing I believe grad students, and full-fledged PhDs, have a hard-time doing when they first start teaching is being willing to fail a student on an assignment. But, sometimes it is clear that the student just didn't give a shit, didn't pay attention in class, hasn't read anything and tried to throw the essay together in an hour right before it was due and in those cases they 'earned' an F, or at least a D. If you just can't tell what they are saying at all? Fail them and explain, briefly, why - and ask them to come see you.\n\nIf they engage the material, but seem woefully out of their depth, maybe go a bit easier on them with the caveat that they must come speak with you outside class-time to discuss their performance and understanding of course material. \n\nTwo exceptions to this I would personally make: (1) Junior/Senior courses should be held to higher standards than introductory courses, courses open to all majors, basic pre-reqs; etc and (2) courses where there is a special emphasis on grammar, spelling, clear communication of ideas are going to necessarily require this be a serious component of the student's grade (e.g. literature; history; language; philosophy; education; communications)",

Be honest about the problem with your class and point them to resources to improve, teach general writing skills again yourself (maybe even change your course around a bit to do so) or encourage people to take professional or academic writing classes - there's lots to learn there\n\nThe most troubling thing to me is that it may be the case (as it seems to be professionally) that sadly some people are just poor writers who may still be well educated and intelligent. I don't know if that's just an innate disadvantage or if they didn't receive the training or put the effort in to improve here. My suspicion is that it's a bit of both\n\nUltimately I do believe writing is a skill that can be improved upon, just at different rates for different people and how you incentivise that (via negative or positive reinforcement) is up to you / how much of a barrier to entry for qualification it is is also up to you and your faculty staff. Rubrick's are good as they are an example of both negative and positive reinforcement - you get grades for clearly defined markers of good academic writing, but there are certainly ways to expand upon this",
