  "title:": "Is it worth editing a multi-author volume?",
  "text": "I'm a organizing a conference and some colleagues are pushing me to publish the papers in a multi-author volume. I've found a couple interested journals too. However I'm a postdoc and I'm dubious about editing a volume at this point in my career. Certain people (like Karen Kelsky) hold the philosophy that multi-author volumes are dead weight for those looking for a tenure track job in Academia. \n\nFrankly, my gut is telling me not to. I recently got a couple years funding to do research on and publish my own book. I think I should focus on that. I think the conference volume will be a time zap. And editing is definitely not one of my strengths. I'd consider it if I could just pass it on to a publisher who would do all the copyediting and let me worry about the intellectual content, but it seems like the publishers I've spoken to would expect me to do the heavy lifting.\n\nAs an untenured early career researcher, am I wrong to pass up the possibility of editing a volume? And if so are there publishers that take a more hands-on role with copyediting ?",

      "text": "Your mileage may vary. It can be a useful networking exercise to get your name out there. I did a similar role with a minor (for my field) publisher, and I believe it led to me being asked to TPC a small (but relatively important) conference, as the people running that conference were among those who I engaged with for this volume. That latter role carried a lot more weight toward my service record, so for me personally the multi-author volume was worthwhile. I should note that I only had to review submissions for technical merit; in my case the publisher took care of copyediting.",

              "text": "No problem. In my case it was a Springer encyclopedia, where I was an editor tasked to invite and process submissions for a particular sub-topic. At least the articles were intended to be short and \"tutorial\" level, so it was not a big ask to solicit submissions. I should note that I was a postdoc when this process started.\n\nYou start from a strong position if you already have conference submissions, especially if you can publish the conference manuscripts without extension. If extensions are needed then that's more work for authors but if it's a good journal then it might not take much convincing.\n\nI don't have a sense of the scale for you but it's probably not a single person process; whoever is making decisions to accept papers can be involved. I had another recent experience where we had 2-page abstracts accepted for a cancelled conference (covid) but then we had many of the authors submit 4-page versions as letters for a journal special section. We had almost as many committee members helping manage the submissions as submissions themselves.",

      "text": "I think it is really hard to say without having more information. What is the level of the papers? Do they stake out a new approach or area? And what field are you in? In a lot of cases I see an edited collection and it has no effect on my estimation of the editor. It doesn't seem like a great collection, whatever, someone got a grant for a conference, etc. But some edited collections are just really good, they become the standard reading in an area, etc. Plus, as an editor, you have a chance to really master that area inside out (in my field, I'd be thinking about how carefully reading all the other papers would put me in a position to write not only my contribution, but also a few more papers), and also, to collaborate closely and helpfully with the other authors, who are hopefully talented researchers in your field. Of course, some editors just accept the papers, and I think it often shows. But it's also possible to put your mark on the collection. (I have not edited a collection, but am now contributing to one, and working on my contribution as well as reading and commenting on others' contributions has led to a few other papers and of course some strengthening of academic relationships.) In short, it depends.",

          "text": "Ok thanks for your perspective. You make a good point that it ultimately depends on the quality of the papers. I've contributed to a couple volumes myself and it does certainly help make stronger relationships. With that said, the conference feels more like a side project at this point, since it develops from one niche field of study that interests me highly and which I think rounds out my scholarship, but which does not cohere smoothly with my current book project or therefore my immediate trajectory. But again, maybe I need to see how the conference pans out first before making a decision. Thanks again!",
