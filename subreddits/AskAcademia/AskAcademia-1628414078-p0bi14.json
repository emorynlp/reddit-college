  "text": "I often hear stories of how bad advisors can make one's life in Academia harder, as there's plenty of content regarding this all over the internet. I would like to know more stories about how and when advisors of Reddit have had it bad. Maybe I could try to break this question down:\n\n 1. How your advisee(s) turned out to be undesirable?\n\n 2. How long were you working together when you noticed you did not want to work with him/her anymore?\n\n 3.  How his/her behaviour affected the way you dealt with the situation? \n\n 4. Also, do you regret the way you handled it? If so, what could have been different?\n\nThank you for your time.",

      "text": "The main problem that I have had (over 11 PhD students) are those that treat the dissertation as a homework problem, and treat me like a prof that knows the answer.  Usually eventually students get to a place where they can independently dig into the literature and see what others have done, find solutions, etc. but this can take years and sometimes never happens.  There is no correlation between research ability and mathematical skill (I\u2019m in stats).  In fact, it is more often the students that have a 4.0 GPA that have the most difficulty being creative, trying new things, setting up simulations to test theory, etc.  Some think we have all the answers and come to each meeting wanting new direction, the next \u201cassignment\u201d rather than trying things themselves.  The only other hurdle I\u2019ve come across, is that some students have issues writing up results, methods, etc.  By far the most painful aspect of advising students is editing.  Having said all that, I\u2019ve never stopped working with a student, although I have come close.  They\u2019ve all graduated and most of them are professors in academia.  I wouldn\u2019t redo anything, but I no longer advise students.  I have had former students thank me once they have students of their own and understand the challenges involved\u2026LOL.",

To try things out, since most problems I dealt with were pure maths so I wasn't scared of stepping the wrong way except for algebra mistakes. But it was always my intention to go into more practical physics and I went into engineering (fluids) for my master's, which has a lot of approximating. I'm currently doing mathematical fluid research but I have lost a lot of confidence in my ability to experiment in maths, and in knowing whether steps I take are firstly accurate (i.e. the assumptions (approximations) I make are good ones, and that the steps I take are accurate and will get me where I want.",

      "text": "I've seen this happen in one case, when the advisee became angry and combative at the advisor. Essentially the work load was getting pretty high + personal stuff going on for the advisee.  The advisee didn't feel comfortable discussing with the advisor and started missing deadlines. When the advisor pushed on the deadlines (we need to make these, we are falling behind) the advisee responded aggressively and started copying the department chair and HR on all the emails.  So the advisor no longer felt comfortable offering feedback on anything and the relationship stagnated.  \n\nIt was definitely an everyone sucks type situation with lots of chances to avoid that outcome on both sides. But if the advisor feels that the advisee is risk to their career (in any way) that would cause an advisor to distance themselves from the advisee.",

The advisor was/is very type A and committed to their advisees, but not great at being compassionate/noticing student stress. The faculty member pressured the student to meet increasingly important deadlines, and the student kept missing them. Rather than communicating with the advisor, the student got very angry and started making personal attacks--it was a sucky situation, because the program admin had to step in, as did the department head. I think it was embarrassing for both the student and faculty member, because it ultimately amount to what (superficially) seemed like an interpersonal problem. A more welcoming advisor and larger advising network would have helped, as would have better student support services to help the student navigate their own needs.  \n\n\nI swear.

I would always try to discuss it with her in a respectful way but often got \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. Just do it\u201d or \u201cWhy do you think you know better than me\u201d. I was in no way entitled or believed I \u201cknew better than her\u201d and would absolutely take any advice I agreed with or I felt improved my work. More often than not, it did. However, sometimes there are just stylistic differences, or different trains of thought, and it could be noted that sometimes her suggestions contradicted that which I was taught in my courses or given by my committee members who were more senior faculty members or held more expertise in my field than her. If it was for publication with her as last author, I would make any change she wanted even if I disagreed but for things where I held complete ownership such as my dissertation, presentations for classes or other internal/intramural student presentations, or my progress reports for my committee, I would make the calls myself because I learned early in my graduate career that many of her own colleagues didn\u2019t agree with her style or her assertions and yet I was the one held responsible for the work in that context. As a PI, if you overstate your conclusions/assertions, few of your colleagues will say anything to your face but as a student, they will make it known that your data isn\u2019t strong enough to say this or that isn\u2019t what it says or the statistical test used isn\u2019t appropriate (although my PI would think it was, etc). I can\u2019t defend data or assertions I don\u2019t agree with and I can\u2019t say \u201cI did it that way because my PI told me to\u201d without calling her out in front of her colleagues to her face.",

      "text": "It's tough, and I empathize with this question immediately. I've never had a \"bad\" advisee in terms of attitude, but I've had plenty of ones where the working relationship wasn't helping. As context: I'm in the social sciences where our students have extensive fieldwork and writing responsibilities; we also have structured deadlines, but I'm a pretty generous advisor. This has only happened to me twice, but I remember them sharply. To answer your specific questions:  \n\n\n1. How your advisee(s) turned out to be undesirable?\r  \n It just didn't feel like we were equally committed to the project. I would spend a ton of my time meeting with them, helping them schedule their work, and, eventually, editing their drafts in detail. They'd miss deadlines, resist communicating, and turn in further drafts that had little to no revision. Communication and expectation setting are a huge part of my personal approach, and I felt like it was one-sided.\n2. How long were you working together when you noticed you did not want to work with him/her anymore? Very individual, but generally within two years of advising the specific project--so after they've finished their preliminary qualifying classes. The first year I cut some slack, because we're building trust. By the second year, I generally have a good sense of whether it works or not. I think people who drag out reconciliation tend to tap themselves and building resentment between the student.\r\n3. How his/her behaviour affected the way you dealt with the situation?\r  \n I've never had a student who got combative or aggressive. Lack of honesty and transparency are red flags for me. Also, lack of communication.\r\n4. Also, do you regret the way you handled it? If so, what could have been different? Only in one case--I always try to set the student up with another advisor and/or try to find a way for them to finish/exit the program gracefully. In the case where it didn't work out, I had, honestly, tried too hard to get them to produce something/anything: I set them up for failure, because they were advanced in their program far enough that they had no real option other than to continue past the programs acceptable deadline. And, at that point, no other faculty wanted to work with them. They managed to graduate with a (pretty bad) thesis, but I think it was demoralizing for everyone.",

      "text": "(logging in with a fake account because I don't want my grad students--some of whom know my reddit name--to see this.) \n\nFirst off, I am in the Humanities (which is a different beast from the Sciences--grad students are more Extra Work for the professor than they are Slave Labor for the professor).    I'm also a good advisor... or so my grads tell me, but I've won awards for it, even.   I know at least that I'm a far, far better advisor to my grads than my own advisor was to me.  (!)\n\n\nHonestly, I've had fantastic PhDs, who were smart, self-starters, and most importantly, *passionate* about what they were doing, whether writing a seminar paper or diving deep into their dissertation research. \n\nBut I've also a had quite a few mediocre grads... and that is just draining.  I still put on my happy-and-supportive face, but there are times when I'm reading a draft of their chapter (or going over their qualifying exams) and it just makes my shoulders slump, and i sigh with exhaustion.  \n\nIt's not that they don't have the skills.  \n\nIt's that they 1) don't put in the time  and 2) don't critically look at their own work and/or think of themselves as \"doing something\" substantial... \n\nFirst, I worked hard in grad school.  *Really* hard.  I worked all the time, and I loved loved loved it.  \n...but my mediocre grads all have too much else going on.  They have young kids, or they are working extra jobs, or are having a personal crisis, or whatever...  they just don't seem to spend the *time* that doing great research requires.  \n\nOf course *life happens*.  I know that. Shit, during my own PhD, my mom got breast cancer, and my relationship with the love of my life collapsed.. I still got shit done.  (perhaps throwing myself into my work was a way to escape... ?  probably.)   I had a crazy alcoholic roommate one year who had a total meltdown *the night before my qualifying exams.*   grrrr.    But every grad in the world has faced drama.  Some get shit done anyway... and some don't.    (I see/hear so many excuses on the web... depression/mental health issues, physical health issues,  money issues, etc.  Yes, these can be crippling... but they were no *less* crippling 30 years ago, just no one used them as self-justifying excuses to not spend time on work.)\n\n\nSecondly, and even more, though, getting the work done is *not* just jumping through hoops--i.e. doing what you're *told* to do. \n \nReal work is seeing your professor/committee/seminar *as an audience*... i.e. as people you are trying to *communicate* with, people you're trying to *persuade*, people you are trying to *impress.*    The grad students (and hell, undergrads, even) who frustrate me are those who just do what I've told them to do... and nothing else.   I'll read a chapter closely, offer tons of comments... and then, all of my comments have been incorporated... but in the process, the chapter has changed angle/changed argument/changed evidence... and the grad seems obvlivious to this.  (It's *their* work, *their* argument... and they aren't paying enough attention to see that when I say \"X doesn't work, why not try Y?\" and they try Y, but keep the framing, ideas, etc. of X... well, they're just not getting it.  And not because they're dumb... because they're 1) not spending the time and 2) not imagining me as an audience, and their work as crafting a way to \"reach\" me.  \n\nIn short, they're treating their work like an undergrad essay.   \n\nAnd it's goddamn frustrating. \n\nBut, I'm a Good Advisor, so I don't let them know how Frustrating it is.   I grin and bear it (or grimace and bear it) and work with them supportively... all the while cursing that I ever decided to work with grad students at all. \n\n... but then you get that one grad... that passionate, driven student who hands you their work, which makes you think and makes you excited and even *challenges* you...  and it all seems worth it again.",

If you are not adept in electrician's school, you do not get to become a professional electrician.\n\n   Teaching *grad* students is therefore literally *nothing* like teaching undergrads.

                          "text": "Again as you appear to have missed it - Horrified by the dialogue. And quite rightly so. Nothing to do with you as a person... please take a pause and remember your training in discourse. \n\n>Grad students, on the other hand, are in a program of dedicated professional training--learning a trade--which has indeed a fairly rigid \"mould.\" You either learn the trade, or you do not (and do not get to practice it). If you are not adept in electrician's school, you do not get to become a professional electrician.\n\nI point out that these are completely incomparable scenarios.  Rote learning and graduate school are entirely different. \n Students that work tend to build networks and diversify their skillset. They build their resumes and align their research to other industries/lab groups. That leads to jobs. \ud83c\udf08\n\nThe PhD students that struggle to find work are, in my view, those with research tunnel vision. 30+ year Olds with no work experience outside the academy.\nUpon graduation they are utterly dependant on their supervisors networks and funding. Is that a successful academic? No. They are in the same position as year 1 - just with more skills. This is also where many academics come into trouble if they have had a falling out with their supervisor. Their success isn't merit based - it's confounded by a relationship and it seems you are encouraging that? \n\nYour advice does not at all match my experience. Indeed, those students who did not fit your rigid mould have flourished. They are resilient, creative, strategic thinkers.  I think your advice is dangerously misleading concerning success as individuals and as academics.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that good research requires time. Time is the independent variable for each student and depending on the project context. It seems to me that you are treating time as a constant. Rather than exclude individuals who experience adverse circumstances, we (supervisors) should be creating an environment which allows them to thrive. The difference is compassion.  \n\nAdvocate for proper student salary wages. Advocate for childcare. Pay sick leave. Pay compassion leave. Give people opportunities to spend the time once their difficulties have passed. \nAnyway - I care deeply about equity in academia. So that's just my opinion",

So, while I don\u2019t agree with how this was expressed, I do think things end up this way anyway.  If a student is sick, sad, pregnant, or just burned the hell out, there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix that other than check in periodically.  Either way, I have to let the student find his or her way back to the work.\n\nThis is one reason I avoid getting into the details of their personal lives.  I don\u2019t want to judge if their reasons for checking-out or doing poor work are valid.  I just want to keep an open door and be here when they are ready.  If they let me, I will help in other ways\u2014to a point. \n\nBut ultimately, it\u2019s up to them.",

Just the opposite:  to humanists, grad students are kind of like apprentices.  (?) \n\neven my TAs in my classes often are more of a cost than benefit (in terms of time), as it takes more time to train them than just grading the papers myself.   But grading is a hugely important part of the job, and learning to do it well can vastly improve a grad's writing.",

(?)\n\nFor me, there is such a HUGE difference between a grad student trying to push through their issues (just like I tried to) and get the work done as best they can, \n\nand the student who sees (or even brandishes) their issues as a sort of excuse to themselves or to others.\n\nI've had grads who have faced adversity of a degree that I never had to face myself... and they've done well, come through great, and have my deepest respect.   But I also had struggles--crises of confidence, emotional trauma, deep feelings of worthlessness (still do), and I know how one can (and, in my opinion, should) tackle them. \n\n\nI guess the way I see it (as an amateur psychologist) it that so much comes down to attitude.  A focused, curious attitude (as tough as it can be to maintain in truly dire situations) can really be the difference between overcoming a setback and an \"i can't do this so i expect you to do it for me\" position that is so difficult for professors to handle.",
