  "title:": "New PhD having doubts around passion about the science of my project",
  "text": "Making a throwaway for this one as I'm very open about my project on main and don't want it being attached to me, but need some general advice!\n\nSo I'm a new PhD student in the UK a month and a half into a 3.5 year programme. I'm in a situation where I chose a project and if you don't know, in the UK you just get right on going with the project immediately rather than taking any courses. \n\nI chose the project because I know the industry the research is based on well, and am passionate about improving it. I know the outcome of my project (If all goes well) will be a significant help, and open doors very wide for me to enter a career in that industry (I don't want to stay in Academia). \n\nHowever, recently I have been coming to terms with the fact that I just do not find the underlying science to my project very interesting at all. The analytical methods bore me, and the science behind how they work in relation to my project only mildly interests me - I'm mostly interested in how this might shape the industry as a whole after full integration of what my project achieves (big if, am I right?). \n\nBecause of this I've found myself very unmotivated to do key readings to help understand what my project is actually doing, which is just contributing to my consistent feeling that I know absolutely \\*\\*nothing\\*\\*. You might say imposter syndrome, but I joined from a significantly different subject to my current one, so it is just true that I don't have a lot of knowledge. \n\nI really like planning and doing fieldwork, and while I could see myself very happy / able to shape a career after the PhD, I'm scared my lack of passion is going to stop me dead in my tracks especially when it comes to writing. I already struggle with motivation anyway, and sometimes think I am not the right kind of person to be trying to make 'huge' changes in the world of science\u2026 maybe I actually would like to just spectate while I work a less high-stakes job that pays more, and truly dive into my hobbies.\n\nI suppose what I'm asking is if I'm having these doubts now, should I just quit and maybe revisit at a later time? Another thing is I am very young (22), and literally did my undergrad, master's, now PhD with no break to quote unquote 'find myself', and am worried I've just been following the path of what I've convinced myself are my passions.. I almost feel like this project deserves a student who is passionate about the science of it rather than the end goal. However, obviously I would be letting a significant number of people down if I were to leave now\u2026 Any thoughts?",

      "text": "Passion comes and goes, and every project / research area has its pros and cons. If you don't think you'll be happy in your PhD or with your current project then by all means do what's best for you and find something else to pursue. But I will say that a lack of passion isn't going to stop you from getting a PhD if you decide to do it. A doctorate is a long slog and requires lots of effort but it absolutely does not require a burning passion for your research topic. I think there is a romanticised idea that scientists are supposed to be obsessed with their research topic, but this is rarely true and it shouldn't make you feel bad if you view it as a step in your career instead of some grand personal quest to understand the universe.",

Because I know how difficult a PhD can be from people around me and especially on here and r/GradSchool, I feel like if I don't have that drive to wake up every morning and learn learn learn! about this subject, I won't get through it. I do love research I know that, I suppose I'm just scared. The job I want after requires a PhD, but not necessarily in the area my current project is in, so I'm going to need to work on getting more experience through internships to secure that as a reality. I think I'll keep going at least for the rest of the year and see where I end up. Thanks",

              "text": "Reading papers is dull. There I've said it. Even stuff I really care about, papers are boring. \n\nI'm not saying you absolutely have to stick with the PhD and you do have to be careful chasing some future trade off if the present is making you miserable. That said you seem to have a fairly solid PhD project and a clear view of what needs to be done and what the final product will look like. You don't have to buy in to the myth that a PhD has to be an all-consuming, passion project, and it is your vocation or die. You can see it as job like any other. Put the work in each day and then go home and do something you enjoy. I'm not promising you can get a PhD on a 9-5 but focus and discipline can significantly shorten the work day, says the woman on Reddit right now. \n\nYou also haven't really started the PhD, you're at the read a lot stage. PhDs aren't about learning, they're about research and if you're lucky you might learn something new along the way. Once you really get going, you're not going to read any where near the number of papers you should be!",

      "text": "Losing interesting or passion is not rare, I think. In my research career years (since 2010, Ms.c) many people including me take the science as just jobs, instead of some kind of patriotism to science. I don't think this will be an issue since science is surely collapsing and toxic at this moment. You just make sure that you still want this job or the task(s). Also no guilty for leaving after getting your PhD, if head hunter finds you, just go for open contract. I don't blame people for acquiring PhD for career now.   \n\nTo anyone don't think academia is toxic: think of that a lot of well-educated, well-behaviour (in Germany you got PhD with no crime record), and good endurance people doing long-term part-time job with limited possibility for open contract. Publish or perish is too toxic to maintain good scientific tasks.",

I mostly liked them and saw a potential future impact but to me science is a job not the essence of my existence as I feel it\u2019s often proclaimed. I made it through PhD and Postdoc without that passion and it worked fine for me. So maybe start looking at it more pragmatic. Of course if you hate it by all means do something else but if you only lack that burning passion and are otherwise fine than you are totally in the clear.",

          "text": "Yeah while I don't feel super passionate, I don't hate it by any means. For example my supervisor asked me to plan a project for a master's student who I would then supervise and work with alongside my data analysis. I found the idea of this super inspiring and it is in the same subject area, however I know when the nitty gritty of it rolled around, the passion would be overshadowed by the complacency toward actually doing it, and the feeling of a lack of knowledge to make sure it gets done correctly. Unfortunately because I switched subjects, all knowledge generation is of course independent which I find fine when learning a skill such as coding, GIS etc., but for reading papers? I get tired so fast.",

However since I am in a \u201ebetter\u201c environment no longer the publish or parish stress I feel that I start to like that aspect too. I knew for a long time working in an applied setting suits me more than basic science. So sometimes it\u2019s also context dependent",
