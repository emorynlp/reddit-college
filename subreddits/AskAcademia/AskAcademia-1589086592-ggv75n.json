  "text": "This day could not come soon enough. I pulled several all nighters this week, going to bed at 10-11am writing and writing and taking two hour naps between my instructors edits, but hey it's all done. Fun fact: I ordered chipotle almost everyday for the past few weeks (like that's ever gonna change) \n\nThat being said, it's not the final submission to be bound, but I'd rather be in the stage of making final edits than having to start writing chapters. Look at us, breaking knowledge and what not",
