  "text": "I am a junior history major, Latin minor and I love what I learn. I also suspect that I like teaching, because whenever I\u2019m given the chance to teach somebody about Latin grammar I relish it. I also love writing and am pretty good at it, the brusque style of this post notwithstanding.\n\nFreshman and sophomore year, I dreamt of being a professor; I think my perceptions were of a dream profession where you can learn and teach like Plato\u2019s Academy and it\u2019s a breeze. Through online skulking and talking with my professors, I know this is not the case. In fact, the mental health demands of writing a dissertation and trying to find an almost non-existent job sound like they would be an extraordinarily bad fit for me.\n\nWhat other career and/or lifestyle options are there for me? I don\u2019t want to give up learning at all, but I also don\u2019t want to feel so stressed that I don\u2019t enjoy life.\n\n(I know these types of posts get written *a lot,* so links welcome.)\n\nEdit: typo",

At my SLAC faculty are *deeply* involved with career prep/counseling and have many ties to employers. I'm a department chair and I know, for example, that faculty in my department are far more knowledgeable about the job market and where our majors have gone over the last 20 years than anyone in our career services office. We routinely bring alumni back for job panels (like multiple times each semester) and zoom them into majors' classes to talk about careers and the market.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend faculty as the *first* place to go for career advice in a department like mine, but grant that in a huge school where faculty have no contact with alums the situation would be different.",

You can choose how much you want to work.

Although getting a master's in one of these subjects will be challenging and stressful, it's not overwhelming compared to other subjects. Plus, you'll actually have a job at the end. You could even get a job at a university teaching English in a foreign country.\n\nNote that the lifestyle of an English teacher is more likely to be much, much better in Asia than it would be in either South America, Europe, or Africa.",

They also aren't going to require state teaching certification/licensing (or any sort of education major) as public schools do; an MA and some teaching experience might be enough to get a foot in the door. Many of my friends from grad school (humanities) ended up going that route in the 1990s, and I know quite a few faculty from local private schools as well. They *really* have summers off, vs. college faculty who are usually doing research-- and usually unpaid if in the humanities. The private school environment dramatically reduces the issues with behavior that public school teachers struggle with, and while some parents are still problematic most are really engaged and supportive (at least at the college prep high school my kids attended).  There are lots of job posting sites out there, but I'd recommend [Carney Sandoe](https://www.carneysandoe.com/) as a place to look for info...I have worked with them on leadership searches (private high school headmaster, principal, VP, etc.) over the years.",

      "text": "It's written a lot because liberal arts majors have to look very hard to find uses for their notoriously useless degrees. They survive by adapting - either go for another degree or take any entry level job they can get and then move on from there.\n\nI hope that if you are going into your senior year, you would take a lot of time to think about career choices. You are likely at this point to end up with a degree that will be very hard to sell in an upcoming recession. Check out your school majors and see if you can add in another marketable major that you could see yourself doing. Stop thinking \"I can't do that\" or \"I don't want to do that.\" Start thinking \"I can do that\" or \"I can see myself being okay with that.\" The job marketplace is tough in good times and it will be even tougher with the economy in the gutter.",

However, \u201cusefulness\u201d isn\u2019t a valuable metric for degrees at all. We swim in a sea of \u201cuseless\u201d things like music, TV, and fiction which, while not necessarily helping most of us to survive, do enrich our lives.\n\nFrankly, $70k a year in tuition paid in loans is a bit too much money to fork over period, let alone to focus inordinately on honing my attractiveness to employers. I understand that jobs are harder for humanities, and I will have to make compromises. But I\u2019m not willing to *completely* sacrifice my interests for a well-paying job.",

The \"STEM MASTER RACE\" that exists on Reddit ignores that the unemployment rate for business/STEM degrees is actually about the same as humanities degrees. It's a hard truth, but the reality is that you're not going to work for Google or Microsoft if you went to SW Kentucky State or College of the Northern Ozarks.",

              "text": "I have a liberal arts degree and have no problem calling it useless. If you are proud of your degree and believe I am lying, then it shouldn't bother you. But of course it bothers many people, because the truth is \"where there's smoke there's fire.\" There's a reason these degrees are the way they are. \n\nYou can think it's useful, that's fine. I don't know what your background is. Wealthy people approach the liberal arts differently because they don't have to care about jobs.\n\nKids who are poor or from lower class background don't have the luxury to \"swim\" in a sea of \"useless\" things to \"enrich\" their lives. They're too busy worrying about how to support themselves. \n\nIf you actually paid $70k for a humanities degree, I don't know what to tell you. That's a lot of money not \"a bit too much.\" \n\nI went to what is considered a top school with a very large liberal arts college. The liberal arts majors don't even have a chance to sacrifice our interests for a well-paying job. They took whatever they could, including UNPAID internships after graduation. Several of my friends got jobs serving coffee on campus. Years later they did find a way to get better positions, but it is not a guarantee. Employers want certain skills and they have no problems finding them. \n\n If you are at Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford (or you are already rich/have connections) then all this doesn't apply to you.",
