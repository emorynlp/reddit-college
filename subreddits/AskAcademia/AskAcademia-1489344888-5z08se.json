  "text": "I teach math at an R1 university.  The class I'm teaching now has 45 students, about 40% female.  After grading their midterm, I noticed that only 3 female students made A's whereas 12 male students did.  Curious as to whether this was just a fluke, I checked my grade rosters from previous semesters to find that female students are far less likely to earn an A in my class than male students.  It's unlikely that this is a subconscious bias on my part because I don't even look at names while grading exams.  In fact, the way I grade exams would make it impossible.  I grade problem 1  for all students first, then problem 2, etc.  The exam packet is folded while I'm grading, so I can't see the front page where names are written.  Most homeworks are graded automatically on the computer.\n\nI don't know the source, but I've heard from other colleagues that female students at my university actually tend to outperform male students on average, so my course is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nIs this something I should be concerned about?  Does anyone else see a consistent bias in the grades they assign and is there anything you do anything about it?  I can't think of anything I could do differently in my case.\n\nThis also makes me wonder how faculty in the humanities, etc avoid sub-conscious bias when grading essays/papers, etc for which it might be impossible to remain ignorant to the students' gender, race, etc.",

      "text": "I think knowing the \"type\" of math class is really important when looking at this situation. Is this a gen. ed class that several majors take, or is it a second or third year math class where it's physics/math majors, is there a \"math education\" stream where students are doing math degree concurrent to an education degree? \n\nI'm TAing the non-proofs based algorithms class that engineers and bioinformatics students take. The bioinformatics program is more competitive to get into and has closer to 50/50 girls, plus they take this as a third year course. Engineers take it as a second year course, and I think this is scheduled as an overload semester for a lot of them (so they have to take 6 classes). On average the girls do better, but more accurately the bioinformatics students are outperforming the engineering students. Similarly, in undergrad I saw a stats course with the opposite situation: males were outperforming females, but in this case you had bio students (70/30 female), nutrition students (90/10 female), and engineering (70/30 male) students taking the class.

      "text": "I remember my first \"real\" college math class.  I'd never taken anything like that before, never really done proofs.  I was one of only a few women, and the first day the other students all seemed *so* engaged.  They were asking questions fluently in a language of mathematics that I was just struggling to understand.  It felt like the other students knew it all already, and I was very intimidated.  I didn't want anyone to know how dumb and far behind I was, so I always worked on the problem sets alone.\n\nIt actually wasn't until years later in my first semester of graduate school (not math), I mentioned feeling a similar way in my classes and my professor explained: those students who speak so confidently - a lot of them are speaking this jargon for the very first time.  They are trying on the mathematician (or scientist, engineer, etc) hat, to see how it feels. And I could do that too - there's no entry fee.\n\nLooking back it seems obvious, but as an undergraduate student, it really wasn't.  You probably can't take every student aside and explain it to them, but I wonder what the atmosphere is like in your lectures and the recitations.  Are just a few eager students dominating the questions and discussion?  Do students feel comfortable taking risks and making mistakes?  Do you ever talk to the class about how this stuff can be really hard, and it's okay if it feels hard?  Make sure your class is a place where students don't feel like they have to pay an entry fee.\n\nOutside of that, blind intervention targeting poor performers in the early semester can help all under-privileged students.  Can you offer to meet individually with every student who doesn't do well on the first exam?  Find out if they need better study skills or just encouragement or who knows.",

Students in these situations tend to perform worse. \n\nDo the questions from problem sets/exams/in-class examples/textbooks have any gender bias that might be worth considering?\n\nIt's a good step that you're thinking about these issues and if you do some digging you will find they are prevalent but sometimes hard to suss out.

You haven't provided any answers. I don't doubt that women might gain something from attending office hours or having their own study groups. I simply doubt that the Professors, specifically, have any ability to render that reality. Women who are struggling need to attend office hours or create their own study groups.

Once one engages with these underlying systems, practical solutions can be devised. Things aren't always just the way they are. Sometimes there are reasons and those reasons are worth examining. You seem to be positing that childhood development and social pressure is the main/only underlying cause and is unaddressable at the university level. I disagree and I believe there are good arguments and research to back up my point of view.\n\nPlease read the book I've recommended if you are truly interested in the (long) answers to some of your questions. Professors/teaching staff/departments can (and do) increase attendance/engagement in learning activities outside of lecture time. It is a benefit to ALL students but especially to women who get a chance to make up for their (possible) previous underrepresentation. \n\nEDIT: I can understand your frustration that I am not spelling out solutions to the questions I posed. But my point is more that there are questions worth asking and assumptions worth interrogating to get to the bottom of an observed gender difference in learning outcomes. Once the issues are defined, the possible solutions should be tailored to any number of factors. There are no one-size-fits-all issues with clear solutions.

All of the girls outperform 90% of the boys academically but it's the boys on the equipment so the professors make the effort to tell the girls to assert themselves on the boards/etc. I think it helps a lot, so I think that finding a way to stress for the girls to be around/more active while not making it seem like they're targeted would be beneficial.

      "text": "It is difficult to say for certain, but it might be useful to ask yourself how you (and your TA's) respond to female students in general. The reason I mention this is that gender discrepancies are so deeply ingrained that they often go unnoticed. \n\nI will provide an anecdote that may illuminate my meaning. I am a female math major. I took calc I with a male professor and usually scored 80-90 on exams. Afterwards, I took calc 2, with a female professor and scored much higher. This is in spite of the fact that I found calc 2 to be more difficult. \n\nIf I had to guess why, I would say it was because she pushed me. For example, I remember one exam where I had been battling with a difficult problem. I was tired and hungry and was willing to call it a day so I walked up to give her the exam. The problem was still bothering me though so I decided to ask a quick question, hoping for a typo. There wasn't one of course and I was fully prepared to hand it over but then she asked if I was going to go back and give it another try. Her question was accompanied by a look of such hopeful expectation that I couldn't bring myself to turn it in without trying one last time. So, not really caring about the 10 extra points but not wanting to disappoint, I went back to my seat and gave it another shot. I got it a few minutes later and scored a 100% on that exam.\n\nIt may be little things like this that cause the discrepancy. Perhaps female students are given the impression that less is expected of them? I can almost guarantee that this has been the case at some point in the past. In fact, I would be curious to see if you still notice a discrepancy in semesters where you have had a female TA.",

A good primer is to read Engineering and Social Justice by Donna Riley. A great textbook by a great engineer.

After grading their midterm, I noticed that only 3 female students made A's whereas 12 male students did.\n\n>Curious as to whether this was just a fluke, I checked my grade rosters from previous semesters to find that female students are far less likely to earn an A in my class than male students.\n\nI want to point out something very important here, something very obvious, that you don't address at all in your post. These observations are the *outcomes*, the apparent surface matter, that you describe. Have you considered what factors might be playing a role in the entirety of the classroom experience (not to mention out-of-class experiences) that these women undergo and how that compares with the range of experiences the men undergo, and how all of this *produces* a specific set of \"performances\" (the barest surface of which is reflected by those grades you notice)?\n\nIn other words, I am referring to the well-documented and growing body of literature, scholarly and otherwise, that points to entrenched expectations, patterns of behavior, pedagogical models/relations, and just general social relations that we, most of us, uphold and perpetuate as everyday norms, which in fact reinforce and deepen sexual divisions and otherwise pose unequal burdens for white/male students versus female/of color/first generation students.\n\nNow you may of course dismiss this as bullshit. I'm sorry for you if you feel that way. Things are changing and this is no mere bullshit. Or, you may want to look at those elements which are simply not accounted for in a survey of grades.\n\nIt's not about whether you have internal biases. It's about patterns you may not even be conscious of. You're looking at grades and clearly noting your \"blindness\" toward the student's sex. I'm asking whether you should actually be less blind and consider what leads up to the final exam/midterm/etc.\n\nEspecially given that you teach at a major R1 institution, where these issues are even more pertinent.",

Indeed, the original intent of this post was to ask for advice on how to identify any of those factors that I have control over changing.

Otherwise, I don't really interact with the students.\n\nI would hate it if I was discouraging young women in my courses, but I don't know what I can do differently!\n",

Not sure how your course is structured, but that might be helpful to better understand if your teaching style is less effective for women.\n\n2. the women may be coming in less prepared for the course, if this is the case could you offer an initial assessment of abilities and then recommend some helpful catchup sessions for any student with noticeable deficits?\n\n3. perhaps your style of lecturing is better for males, or women learn better by other means. This will require some homework, but I could see women learning better by more of a back and forth situation. I often worked in study groups where we taught one another, while the men in my program studied alone and sort of reviewed/quizzed each other in study groups before the test. So perhaps allowing for a review session before the test could help for example.\n\nI don't really have a solution here, and it's not my specialty, but I have noticed that the way I and other women approach material can be quite different than males. The same with minority groups, which often have much more supportive study groups. But that's just my person experience. ",

This is, very simply, not true and there are reams of research to show this. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, no one here (or anywhere that is taken seriously, really) is suggesting grading people with different standards. This would not benefit women or men in terms of positive learning outcomes. \n\n\n\nI think this conversation is more about whether every student in a class is on a level playing field within the parameters that can be (at least somewhat) controlled by a professor and/or department. Recognizing areas of pedagogy and classroom/department structure that could be modified/improved can lead to positive learning outcomes for all students and, it has been shown in the literature, especially great gains for women who previously may have struggled.

Well *my* experience in anthropology departments at R1 universities, including with colleagues my age / of my cohort who are faculty at those institutions and others (I'm at a smaller school), is that many faculty are *very* engaged in (and concerned about) these things. Who are you to paint with a broad brush?\n\nMy experience is similar to yours in that folks in STEM do tend to be a bit less engaged with those issues. But maybe it would be wise to wait for evidence of that *before* jumping to the conclusion that someone doesn't care or is unaware of them and intimating that they're just disinterested or inclined to dismiss reference to such things as \"bullshit.\"\n\n>Frankly? I don't care how I come across on an internet forum. And I don't give a shit about respectability politics.\n\nOkay, then don't be surprised when you're met with responses in kind. Immediately turning the dial to \"asshole\" in the context of a conversation is unproductive and tends to turn people off to what you're saying. Tone matters.\n\n>Been there, done that, been dismissed. You have literally no idea of my experience, just as I don't about yours. Don't take it on yourself to make assumptions about me and police behavior.\n\nI'm not making assumptions about you, except what you're presenting in your posts. You're unnecessarily combative given the context, and that hurts the message you're trying to get out. You're right, I have no idea about your experience. And so I have no reason to believe you're anything but a dick with a chip on their shoulder. \n\nAre you actually? Probably not. But in adopting that attitude to people who have given you no reason to do so, what are you accomplishing? Most people don't perk up and take notice-- \"Hey, he / she has a point!\"-- when people are jerks. They just tune them out.\n\nMaybe you're enough of a name that you can act like that in the real world, but in the absence of reputation, you're just another poster. So *immediately* adopting an adversarial stance at the outset of a conversation just makes you a dick for the duration of that conversation.\n\n>Collegiality is a great thing. It's also one of the main things that has kept the academy white and male for centuries. Because people were too polite to speak up.\n\nI'm sorry, are we all putting our genders / colors in our flair now? I don't know what color / gender you are. If you're not white and male, that's great. But it doesn't mean you need to assume that other folks here (who may or may not be white and male) are automatically uninterested in issues of structural inequality. A lot of us happen to be social scientists and are actively interested in (and involved in) working on trying to deal with those structural issues, either in research or through how we approach teaching / mentorship.\n\nI agree that the academy remains overwhelmingly male and white, but that's slowly changing.

Do gender differences exist among the mathematically talented? Do females exist who possess profound mathematical talent? In regard to the first question, contemporary data indicate that girls in the U.S. have reached parity with boys in mathematics performance, a pattern that is found in some other nations as well. Focusing on the second question, studies find more males than females scoring above the 95th or 99th percentile, but this gender gap has significantly narrowed over time in the U.S. and is not found among some ethnic groups and in some nations. Furthermore, data from several studies indicate that greater male variability with respect to mathematics is not ubiquitous. Rather, its presence correlates with several measures of gender inequality. Thus, it is largely an artifact of changeable sociocultural factors, not immutable, innate biological differences between the sexes. Responding to the third question, we document the existence of females who possess profound mathematical talent. Finally, we review mounting evidence that both the magnitude of mean math gender differences and the frequency of identification of gifted and profoundly gifted females significantly correlate with sociocultural factors, including measures of gender equality across nations.\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689999/",
