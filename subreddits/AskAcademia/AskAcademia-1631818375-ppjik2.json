  "text": "I recently finished a research paper in my masters program. The subject area of the paper is Social Sciences. It is closer to a literature review, I do not perform any studies, it is an analysis of existing work evaluating aspects of a social sciences theory.\n\nI read through most papers involving this theory (there are not many) and believe that I condense existing current knowledge in a way that has not yet been done. So while there would be benefit to the field in publishing my paper, I do not feel the need to publish it, especially with the lengthy and complex publishing process.\n\nI'm proud of my work and I received a high grade. I would like to showcase my work on my LinkedIn but I don't think it would be wise just to upload my paper there. It would be more official I think to link to an outside place.\n\nIs there a place where I can publish my research paper to the public? I briefly looked into Arxiv but it seems to have a STEM subjects focus.",
