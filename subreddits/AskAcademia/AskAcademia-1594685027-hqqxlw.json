  "text": "...I'm a postdoc. I'm 6 years since my doctorate in a biological science. The salary and start-up are reasonable for the school but on the low end of the range I told myself I would take. Everything else is good just a little off for my particular situation (teaching load, location, department fit, spousal happiness/job prospects ). But, if I took the job I'd only be treading water in until I could start applying other places. How big of a mistake am I making turning down a reasonable TT job at the start of the worst academic hiring market in a century?  Please talk me out of this or at least try to so I know I've considered everything.",

If you are just as happy working in industry, then turning down the job might not be a big deal. But if you are committed to academia, and you get offered a decent tenure track job offer in a bad economy, then you take it. Going to a potentially shitty location is always part of the deal when you get into academia.",

We moved from a big city in a state we loved to a small town in a state we are a bit uncomfortable with so far. She basically had to uproot her whole life to come here and leave a job she loved. The ONLY reason we are okay with this is because it's temporary. We'll only be here for 5-6 years (hopefully...). OP's situation is less temporary. The academic TT job at the end of the grind is where you're finally supposed to settle down. If you're someone who is flexible and doesn't really care where you live then it's an easier problem to solve. But if you or your partner derive a lot of happiness from your environment, things can go downhill pretty quickly once the realization sets in that you hate your permanent home.",

Especially at smaller or less research focused schools, getting tenure is a often a jumping off point for someone to apply to larger/R1 schools (assuming they want a research-focused academic career). That's a similar timeframe (~6 years) to your scenario, but I do agree that its not as \"inevitable\" as finishing up grad school.",

Realistically, hiring will continue to be tight for the forseeable future, and you're unlikely to improve on your existing offer in the next few years. A reasonable tenure-track position will provide you with the critical opportunity to develop an independent reputation as a PI, and to secure independent funding. If you miss this opportunity, it might be another couple of years before hiring starts to thaw out again, by which time you'll be dangerously close to  the being 10  years out from the Ph.D. without a tenure-track position, which will not feed into the narrative of being a rising star, which is critical to be competitive at the most prestigious institutions. At the end of the day, you're really making a choice between staying in academia, or a non-academic career.",

I knew only an academic job with the right circumstances would make me happy, and those circumstances were pretty narrow. \n\nI also believe there's no point in being miserable if you can avoid it, especially being *tethered* to a job and a place and being miserable. If you can survive on your postdoc income now and you are doing well, and you know you'd be deeply unhappy with the TT job because of the mismatches...eh. It's really a personal decision of what and how much you are willing to sacrifice in order to be a TT professor, especially when there's also the possibility that you could get a little bit trapped there.\n\nBut again, the fullest of disclosure is that I'm a PhD outside of academia by choice - by preference. I have never had the burning desire to be a tenure-track professor, so I don't know what that feels like. As far as I can tell it, though - by observing the folks who do have it - if you have that burning desire and you *know* academia is where you want to be in the long term, then it doesn't make sense to turn down the TT job and you may well regret it.",

That's a blip on the radar. There are a thousand reasons that a person turns down a job and the vast majority of them are likelier than \"this person does not really want a steady income and benefits; they just want to turn down offers for funsies.\"\n\nThis person is, wisely, deciding whether they'd rather sacrifice the things that they currently think they really care about for something else; you have to explore how badly you want it at that point.
