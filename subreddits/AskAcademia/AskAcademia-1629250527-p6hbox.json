  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you're doing great.\n\nI'm an international student recently in my Master's degree (thesis-based) in North America. I'm very interested in pursuing my PhDs but recently received a terrible mark in one of the courses I had, making me disappointed. How much do you think it is important that I wouldn't have such a grade in my transcripts? I'm seeing that everyone around has excellent marks, mostly 90 and more, which adds to my issue's severity.\n\nBy the way, the course was about big data analysis, and I got 79 losing 20 percent for missing a deadline by mistake. I tried explaining to the instructor that it was a mistake, and I was confused about deadlines and missed it (I didn't notice the deadline is not 11:59 PM and assumed it...). To them, it is a matter of generosity to let me pass this course; for me, it is a total disaster in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your comments,",
