      "text": "a clinical psychology PhD program should be fully funded, i would think? in a lot of cases you should not apply to programs that are not fully funded, meaning that they waive tuition and provide a stipend in exchange for teaching or doing research. so, it would not be more expensive to apply out of state.",

      "text": "*Most* clinical psych PhD programs are fully funded. Definitely apply out of state. Focus on applying to any programs that have a good research fit with your interests and make the connection clear in your statement.\n\nCheck their websites to find out if they provide funding over the summer and how funding is given to students every year. Some programs have systems in place to fund students at any level and some programs require students to find their own funding in later years (like applying for grants). It is a less collaborative environment if you have to compete with other students for funding opportunities. You can also clarify this at interviews. Good luck!!",

      "text": "From a financial perspective, it is not dumb to look at out-of-state programs. PhD programs are usually fully-funded anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, not everyone wants to move faraway (or even can). Perhaps you don't want to consider programs in AL, KS, or ID (I'm from your part of the country, and I probably wouldn't), but a program in PA, NJ, CT, or MA might be OK or even great. Depending on where you are in NY state, some of these out-of-state programs might not even be as faraway as in-state programs. Philly is much closer to the NYC area than Buffalo is, for example. Or, perhaps you are willing to go faraway provided the program is a good fit in terms of research and curriculum?\n\nIn sum, just decide how far from home and to what kinds of places you're willing to go (there's no right answer) and apply to any programs in those areas that interest you. There's nothing wrong with wanting to stay close to home, and there's also nothing wrong with going faraway for opportunities. Going faraway doesn't mean you have to stay faraway forever. :)\n\nAs for the interview, I suspect most schools would be willing to do a phone or Skype interview if you can't travel, so don't worry about that.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in Chemistry so still STEM but a different field. It\u2019s absolutely not \u201cdumb\u201d to apply out of state. It\u2019s encouraged that you use your PhD to breach new horizons. You should apply wherever seems like a good fit for you and what you want from a PhD. Also, PhD programs in STEM usually don\u2019t cost nearly anything and you actually get paid if you are a TA or have a research grant. For example, my school has us do TA work for a paycheck that comes out to around 22k a year and all of our tuition is waived. We actually had to sign a form saying that the school would be our only employer/that we wouldn\u2019t be working any other jobs. \n\nSo unless you\u2019re doing a non-paid program, this isn\u2019t something you should worry about.",
