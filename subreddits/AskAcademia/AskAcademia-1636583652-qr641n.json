  "text": "I\u2018m having a lot of trouble with papers introduction. I write the first sentence over and over again and every version seems more ugly and cringe than the previous one, I never know how to write the first few lines without it looking like a bad school essay. It\u2019s for sure the most time consuming part of writing. Also not writing in my native language doesn\u2019t help. How do you do it? Does it get better with practice? Any tips/words of wisdom/words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated",
