  "title:": "Should I report my teacher for sharing anti-vax views during class?",
  "text": "This is a community college alcohol and drug studies class in California. During class today, the teacher went on a rant about how she is refusing to get her kids vaccinated, that it shouldn\u2019t be required and how it\u2019s extremely dangerous. When the class started chiming in with affirming comments, I spoke up in defense of vaccinations. Her response to me was that I should research Bill Gates and what he\u2019s done with polio vaccines in Africa. I was stunned. I didn\u2019t even know where to start, so I just gave up. \n\nIt\u2019s alarming to me that a teacher is peddling this misinformation to students, but it\u2019s the beginning of the semester and I\u2019m scared that reporting this to the college could impact my grade. What should I do? Any advice is very much appreciated!",

      "text": "I think you should approach both the chair and, if the department has one, the director of undergraduate studies. Do this ***after grades have been submitted***. Email the chair and CC the director at the same time. If you only email one person or email them separately, it'll be too easy for them to either unintentionally overlook it or intentionally sweep it under the rug. Emailing both simultaneously means they'll feel compelled to hold each other accountable.\n\nThis instructor not only believes in conspiracy theories--she believes them strongly enough to proselytize this idea. There's no point in raising your concerns again. She had no interest in your rebuttal in class, and she won't have any interest in your counterargument if you approach her in some other context.\n\nIt's difficult (not impossible, but difficult) to disabuse people of these baseless and harmful notions. If someone has a chance of convincing her otherwise, it won't be a student whom she (wrongly) sees as less informed, more naive, etc.\n\nAcademia should always be a place where many perspectives and arguments can coexist. This stance, however, is both **anti-science and actively harmful** for her children and those who come into contact with them. She shouldn't be in a position to teach others. For what it's worth, it's highly unlikely she'd lose her job over this, but hopefully a warning from people she perceives as her equals will make her rethink her boundaries and her beliefs.\n\nSorry you had to deal with this. Good luck with everything.",

I\u2019m going to follow your advice (after grades are posted) so I very much appreciate that, but more than that I\u2019m feeling my self-confidence restored quite a bit. As much as I hate to admit it, the experience shook me up and made me feel insecure. Reading your comment was a very grounding, affirming experience. Rather than feeling down, I\u2019m feeling proud of myself for speaking up during class. Thank you for your advice and for helping me adopt a different perspective on the situation :)",

While I whole-heartedly agree that you should wait until after grades have been posted, I'm wondering if you need to be prepared for questions about why you waited so long to report. I'm thinking that if you simply detailed her poor response to your rebuttal, and emphasized that this is a required class you likely need to complete now to finish your degree in a timely fashion, that should be a reasonable explanation, but I'm not sure. Does anyone else have any thoughts? Is that a significant concern for the OP here?",

OP could consider noting at the end of their email that they waited to report because they felt the instructor would be able to accurately guess their identity (given their statement in class) and were concerned the instructor might retaliate by altering their grade.\n\nAlthough, to be honest, your approach might work better because it's more subtle and tactful. Since this whole situation will raise a lot of negative feelings (frustration about the instructor and frustration about how to address the problem), maybe it's better to imply the issue of grades as punishment rather than state it outright.",

Start by expressing your concerns to her directly: \"I felt uncomfortable during class when you shared your views about vaccinations. These views are conspiracy theories and not consistent with scientific evidence, and I felt that it was inappropriate for them to be included in a college classroom.\" See how that goes. If it doesn't go well, or she keeps peddling pseudoscience afterward, then it may be appropriate to have a conversation with a department chair or someone else higher up.\n\nIf you do not wish to have that conversation with her because you are afraid of retaliation, then one place you can have an impact is in the evaluation. Rate her teaching honestly, and very clearly state that she included anti-vaccination lies and conspiracy theories that were completely off topic during the class.",

We were discussing the history of opium/cocaine and how the medical community prescribed these drugs without fully understanding the effects. This lead her to a rant about all drugs in general, during which she explicitly told the class \u201cdon\u2019t take anything\u201d, referencing all medications. Then another student spoke up and expressed how anti-depression meditation has been helpful for him. At this point, she started back pedaling on medication and said the real problem is vaccinations. That\u2019s when the rant hit. She ended class with telling us all that she wanted us to know that she is not anti-medication and anti-government. She \u201cjust wants us to know that\u201d. Then she jokingly said thank god I didn\u2019t record this class! She laughed and said, \u201cI was going to record it but thank god I forgot!\u201d  That made my skin crawl a little. \n\nThank you for your advice. I agree that going over her head is extreme. I\u2019m still not sure on what to do though. I feel like if I confront her, she\u2019ll try to deny it, especially in light of her recording the class joke. It just seemed like a very sinister joke. I may go the evaluation route. Seems safest. \n\nI very much appreciate your thoughtful and thorough response!!",
