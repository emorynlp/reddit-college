  "title:": "Preparing to defend my dissertation - is it weird to invite colleagues I haven't spoken with in a few years?",
  "text": "I'm preparing to defend my dissertation. I'm excited and nervous. It's in a healthcare field, so in addition to conducting research, I've been providing clinical services for like 6 years at this point. All of this has lead to tremendous personal growth and major changes in my thinking both about the scientific aspects of my field and in my understanding of people in general.\n\nThere are so many people who have influenced my thinking about my dissertation topic, which I've also been working on for about 6 years (my god, I tried to choose something easy, but it just kept getting more and more complex as I continued to write).\n\nWould it be weird to invite old colleagues to the defense? These would be people who I had good relationships with, but who I've not maintained contact with for like 1-3 years or so.\n\nI'm from down home, where people are generally not educated, so the fancy world of academia and scones is still new to me even though I've been immersed in it for a while now.\n\nMany thanks",

      "text": "I think it would be nice to invite them, especially if you tell them that they were an influence on your work. When I defended, I was unsure what the protocol was and I wasn\u2019t aware I was allowed to invite people. No one explained it to me. I wish I had figured it out and asked my family to come.",

          "text": "I had great leadership through my MS and PhD programs, but there were several things here and there I wish people explained over the years. Fortunately, I\u2019m confident to ask questions (admit I was clueless on how some things worked) and of course there is the internet, but there were quite a few times where I thought \u201cthey know I\u2019ve never earned a MS or PhD before, right?\u201d :) I don\u2019t know how I could have, or why I would have, already known some things about the process. I appreciate the confidence they evidently had in me to figure things out, but I really didn\u2019t know what questions I was supposed to even be asking at times.",

      "text": "I say invite whoever you\u2019d like to be there especially if they helped you along your academic and professional journey. Alternatively or additionally, an invitation to graduation or other celebratory event/party may be a great way to include them and be easier or more fun for them to attend. (Sometimes defenses are mid-week and during the workday, or kinda technical to understand. If there is a remote or zoom option that may help people be able to attend.) Your committee may have advice on the culture of inviting guests, but generally speaking, I think it\u2019s your day!",
