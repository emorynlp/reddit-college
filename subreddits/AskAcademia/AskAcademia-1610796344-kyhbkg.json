      "text": "This is a really interesting question! You adress something which in my opinion ought to be integrated into a larger discussion about the role of academia and what we want that role to be. I think arguments can be made for making what is often tax-financed knowledge to be made accessible for a larger audience whilst on the other hand also generating in depth, specialised knowledge.   \n If I would recommend one paper from my field -Public Administration - it would be Christopher Hoods \"A public management for all seasons?\" from 1991. Whilst probably requiring a layman to do a bit of reading around it depending on their previous knowledge about the field, I think it is a good starting point for building an understanding about the following (in my opinion) highly interesting and relevant subjects:   \n1. How our understanding of *what the state should be and do* can change over time. \n\n2.  How states can influence one another and how trends emerge on an international arena.\n\nIt might not be the most up to date - it is 30 years old - but it is nonetheless a classic in the field and I think that even those with no previous academic knowledge in the field might be able to take something away from it. \n\nOne more thing that I would like to adress is that before getting into academia, I held the belief that all scholars understood everything in every article they read. It turns out, this is not the case - understanding everything at all times is difficult, and for me has required in depth reading, several times, googling terms I dont understand, ideas id never heard of before and still having to realise that certain points made where beyond my understanding of the subject. Whether one is in academia or not, I think having an open and curious mind and understanding that sometimes your interpretations might be wrong is a corner stone of reading any advanced literature! Academia has certainly humbled me in that regard, proving again and again that ive got a grain of understanding in an ocean of knowledge.",

We really should encourage these conversations, which you\u2019ve done a fine job at doing here! \nI remember a turning point for me being when a professor of mine in the second semester of my bachelor degree spent an entire 45 minute lecture dissecting one sentence from Esping- Andersen\u2019s \u201cthree worlds of welfare capitalism\u201d with the class. This highly influential paper was like written in a foreign langue to me as I\u2019d tried to prepare for the class. He illustrated the dedication it takes to sometimes understand even one paragraph or one sentence in an academic paper, and he did so with great passion and compassion alike. He taught me that day that knowledge is like working out - you can\u2019t do ten pushups before you can do one, and that even professors come to the boundaries of their knowledge when presented with a new subject.\nYou\u2019re not lacking anything at all - rather all of us are lacking most of the knowledge that\u2019s out there. These conversations help us share that knowledge and that\u2019s what I think academia should inherently be about.",

He was also renowed as an amazing teacher and, if memory serves right, he also worked a lot to disseminate science among everyone.\n\nThe Feynman Lectures on Physics are a guide to the how, what and why of physics. It guides the reader from the very beginning of how physics came to be, using very good examples and almost devoid of math and equations. He tries to explain physics and how everything works using intuition, not deduction, based on careful language, examples, analogy and thorough, yet simple, explanations. It is not a \"light\" read, nor a short one, but for anyone either beginning in STEM or with an interest in physics, his books are a deep pool of knowledge and understanding",

      "text": "A law review article here.\n\nAlright I'm getting prepared for the anti-choicers to come out in full force, but this piece by a Northwestern law professor on why forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies or otherwise making abortion illegal is against the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution - the prohibition against involuntary servitude. No reason a woman's uterus should be treated differently than a man's arms, forcing somebody to use their body against their will and incurring pain, injury and the loss of freedom is a violation of our basic Constitutional principles of liberty. And yes, this applies even if you think a fetus is a person, because there is no other situation in which we can be forced to give of our own physical bodies against our will even if it keeps someone else alive.\n\n Koppleman's piece provides some interesting history of the 13th Amendment and how the amendment has been curtailed even as we've greatly expanded the 14th amendment over time. He has a newer piece also framing his 13th amendment for abortion rights argument in light of American \"Originalism\" jurisprudence, which tends to be a right wing theory of Constitutional interpretation but that would actually support using the 13th amendment as a legal ground of women's reproductive freedom. The 13th amendment for reproductive freedom argument is arguably an originalist argument  because of the history of slave women being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies and control over their own bodies being central to the interpretation of that amendment after the Civil War. There are many law scholars who envision the 13th Amendment in that way. \n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1031%26context%3Dfacultyworkingpapers&ved=2ahUKEwjO-6vyr6HuAhUihuAKHa1tCs8QFjAEegQIDhAK&usg=AOvVaw1765quIj0WITrEKWlbpCbq",

I got pretty in to reading 13th Amendment scholarship a bit back, like Jamal Greene's 13th Amendment Optimism symposium papers from a bit back, and also the book the Lost Promise of Civil Rights is an interesting side by side of the DoJ vs the NAACP's legal strategies that touch on the 13th amendment versus 14th amendment strategy question. Interesting stuff! Also, for more the reproductive rights history and law angle in particular, Mary Ziegler and Kristin Luker are amazing.",

      "text": "I am in the humanities, so I already feel out of place here. On top of that, I study Japan, but I still wanted to add to the list here. What I realized as I was going through my hard drive and syllabi was that I didn't have many articles I felt I could just hand to a 'layperson' because so much of my field (literary studies in a foreign language) requires a great deal of scaffolding.\n\nThat said, I think this 3-part essay \"Throwing off Asia\" by John Dower and accompanying set of images hosted on MIT's 'Visualizing Cultures' site is a great gateway into getting a better understanding of the beginnings of modern Japan. It offers a relatively nuanced discussion of competing cultural currents at the end of the 19th/beginning of 20th century and demonstrates not only the rise of nationalism and empire in Japan, but also importantly how these central efforts by the government were materialized and presented to the public through art. \n\n[1. Throwing off Asia 1 - Woodblock Prints of Domestic 'Westernization \\(1868 - 1912\\)](https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/throwing_off_asia_01/index.html)\n\n[2. Throwing off Asia 2 - Woodblock Prints of the Sino-Japanese War \\(1894 -95\\)](https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/throwing_off_asia_02/index.html)\n\n[3. Throwing off Asia 3 - Woodblock Prints of the Russo-Japanese War \\(1904-05\\)](https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/throwing_off_asia_03/index.html)\n\nThe whole series of essays is really very good - [accessible here](https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/home/vis_menu_02b.html) - I would also recommend Andrew Gordon's \"Social Protest in Imperial Japan\" as well as Ellen Sebring's \"Civilization and Barbarism: Cartoon Commentary & 'The White Man's Burden'\". Read collectively, the entire series will present a solid introduction to social issues in Japan and China in the 19th and early 20th century. Each essay is short and digestible, around 600-800 words or so.",

The only thing the authors demonstrated is that they are willing to push their political agenda no matter what.\n\nThe problems with this article should be evident to everyone who has basic understanding of scientific methodology. As I mentioned, there is a good critique of the postmodern pseudoscience (such as Sokal's work), but this is not it. This is at best a pseudo science, suffering from the very same problems their authors are complaining about.\n\n\nAlso, the reason I mentioned it isn\u2019t a scientific paper is that OP specificaly asked for a paper or scholarly article and this doesn\u2019t fit.",
