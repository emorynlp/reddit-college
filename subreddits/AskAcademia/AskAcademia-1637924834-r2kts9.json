  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo at my current job we had a dataset lying around, which the previous employee had collected. He's indifferent about it, but I and my colleague did not want it to go to waste. We made an analysis and wrote a paper (the guy who collected data is 1st author). There weren't any interesting findings (everything is well established at this point), but it's the first study of this kind in our country. We've been rejected 2 times by now. Both Q2 journals. Should we just give up? The only novelty is the study population/nationality.",
