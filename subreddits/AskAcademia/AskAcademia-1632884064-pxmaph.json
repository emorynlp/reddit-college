  "text": "Hello everyone, looking for a bit of advice here. So, I was recently hired as a research assistant. The problem is that I don't like the job at all. I'm wondering if I should look for a different job even though I've just started. However, I've a few considerations weighing on my mind:\n\nPros:\n- Position is at a renowned university for health and medicine, so it might look good on my resume to have been an RA here.\n- If I decide to get a master's, it'd be helpful to be able to get a letter of rec from my supervisor or PI. Still not sure if I actually want to go back to school, though.\n\nCons:\n- I've never wanted to go into academia, and I can't imagine continuing to be in this lab or similar a career path in the future at all. So I don't know if having this on my resume would even be that big of an advantage.\n- There is literally only one other person who is with me in the lab, and this sounds dumb but it makes me feel very lonely and unhappy. I am infinitely jealous of the other RAs on my floor who actually get lab mates.\n- I'm their only RA currently. I'd feel bad if I quit and they become completely screwed. \n\nOverall, I overwhelmingly want to quit. But finding a new job might be tough, and I'm not exactly sure what I want to do instead. I thought about maybe going into industry, or maybe even healthcare. I don't know if I should just tough it out for a year or so for the sake of my resume, or jump ship. What's holding me back is mostly that I've just started and I'm afraid it'd look bad on me to hop jobs like that, and I'd feel bad for quitting so soon. Any thoughts?",

          "text": "Hm, that's a good question. I think feeling so isolated amd alone is really exacerbating how much I don't enjoy being in the lab. It was always just going to be a gig for a year or two for me and I was under no impression that I'd love research, but I thought it'd be manageable for me if I had coworkers that I could get along with. That's how I survived my previous job anyhow (retail). I guess I'm realizing I value human interaction more than I thought, and lab work might just not be right for me on a base level.\n\nAlso, the lady I work with is very sweet, but sometimes I have a lot of trouble understanding things the way she explains it. She tends to go on tangents and completely lose my question in the middle of it, and it always makes me even more confused than before I asked.",
