So it all depends on what you'll be going for after you graduate. If you don't think you'll be able to publish anything during your PhD I'd say that teaching and getting practical experience in the field is an absolute must if you want to have any chance in the academic job market",

My advisor refused to write papers with PhD students, so my first published paper was solo. I waited a lot for the review. And this happened with all my solo papers. Then I wrote two papers with senior scholars and the reviews came in A LOT faster. Young scholars need pubs, and you'll get them much much faster if you write them with senior scholars. This is my experience. It's not good if you ask me - but the waiting time was much shorter when one of the authors was a senior scholar \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
