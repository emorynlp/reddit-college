  "text": "Hello all! Apologies for typos and weird formatting as I am posting from mobile.\n\nI teach theatre and have a student in my class who I can tell is very well-intentioned but also very insecure. I can tell that she does not read social cues well and is likely relegated to the category \u201cawkward girl over there.\u201d I have no idea if my student is neurodivergent or not, but some of her behavior in class makes me think she might be. \n\nWe had auditions for staged readings (low stakes, we try to cast a ton of people so everyone gets a chance to perform) and she asked me if she should audition. I told her that she should as it would be likely she would get in and we need lots of actors. This turned into a twenty-minute series of verbal jousting as her anxiety took over and all logic went out of the window. I have never, EVER told a student to not audition before and I said this to her as an option because the thought of auditioning gave her an incredible amount of anxiety. \n\nWhile I\u2019m sure she does not intend to be anxious, the emotional labor I have to perform to attempt to alleviate this student\u2019s frequent crises and anxiety is wearing me down. It was so bad that on Friday, I bolted to the bathroom immediately after class so she couldn\u2019t corner me in the 15 minutes I have in between classes to keep stating her insecurities.\n\nI don\u2019t want to push this student away and alienate them as I can tell they may not have many resources, but I\u2019m just worn out and it\u2019s only March. \n\nTotally open to any tips, tricks, and ideas on this one.\n\nTL;DR: My student\u2019s anxiety is causing me to perform an exhausting amount of emotional labor. How do I set better boundaries without feeling bad as she is likely neurodivergent? ",

      "text": "Especially if this person isn't paying attention to boundaries because of neurodiversity (vs, say, being self-centered or confused about school or alone) then letting her know directly that you do not have time to discuss extra-curricular things after class would be helpful. Folks with autism spectrum minds tend to be less good at hints! It would probably also make sense to schedule an office hours meeting with this student so that you can then forward her to the school counselling service.",

      "text": "If it\u2019s something that is stemming from mental health problems, directing her towards your school\u2019s counselling services may be beneficial. If it\u2019s something that you feel might be diagnosed (ie. an anxiety disorder) they could also benefit from connecting with accessibility/disability services. Hopefully these resources can help the student find ways to manage their anxieties, and also connect them with trained professionals who are better equipped to deal with her health in contrast to you as her professor (as you\u2019ve expressed). \n\nSince she has a lot of anxiety, I would also reach out to these services yourself before approaching her as they may give you strategies on how to best bring up the subject. With the stigma of mental health, bringing it up could cause her to shut down, so finding out how to talk to her about it would help.\n\nBest of luck! As a theatre student myself I understand how anxiety inducing theatre can be in all respects, and also how important it is for students to feel supported in their theatrical endeavours from their profs. So good on you for wanting to ensure you give her the best support while also recognizing your own limits.",

It's a professional way to approach the issue and it sets the tone and boundary for future interactions. While she clearly struggles with boundaries due to anxiety or whatnot (oversharing, too much reliance on others, etc), she might get the hint.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to send her an email making this recommendation as well so you have a record of it. I'm not trying to suggest anything negative about this specific pupil, but unstable young people do all kinds of things they regret later. That ranges from self-harm to complaining about you and filing an official grievance or something.\n\nJust my 2 cents though.",

      "text": "Longtime theatre teacher here. I understand balancing the need to engage with your students to open them to the work without turning into an unpaid/ill-trained  therapist. A couple of suggestions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. When one of these conversations starts, set a time boundary immediately. \n\n \n\n\"Excuse me, \\*\\*\\*\\*, can I talk to you for a minute?\" \n\n\"Sure! I have exactly three minutes before I have to head to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\"\n\nHOLD TO THAT DEADLINE. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA student with anxiety is likely to interpret a sudden end of conversation as a rejection, and you can alleviate this by setting the boundary before the conversation starts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Contact school counseling services on your own. You don't have to give a student name or anything; just describe the situation and ask for advice/resources. Best case scenario is that they will have a good protocol in place for you to refer the student to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Frame any counseling suggestion as educational. \"You know, a lot of performers have concerns like this, and it's not all about acting. Sometimes our brains just tell us to worry even when we don't need to. A lot of people find it helpful to talk to experts, and I'm not an expert in this area. Can I recommend some people to you?\"",

Walk away while she's still talking if you have to. You can also tell her bluntly that you are not a therapist and so there are certain topics you are happy to discuss (specify X,Y,Z things that relate to the class), you are not available to talk her through her anxiety (and give a clear example of what that means). \n\nSounds like a stressful situation, I am reminded of a challenging student I had a couple years ago who was very high anxiety and did not read social cues at all. I got to the point that had to speak to him so bluntly that I felt I was being rude- but actually I think he appreciated it because there was no ambiguity in what I was saying. I made the boundaries very clear. He continued to request a lot of my time for the rest of the semester but I got better at saying no. ",

You can not be this student\u2019s psychologist; that is too much pressure to put on yourself. And this is coming from a former student with undiagnosed ADHD who confided a bit too much in some professors before being diagnosed and receiving treatment.  I think a good first step is to contact health services and speak to someone in mental health there that can give you good advice on how to approach this issue with the student in a way that won\u2019t make the student feel worse or shamed. I\u2019m not sure what services your university has but my university had something called health services and a portion of it was free therapists for students. ",

You will have to tell them no - that you don't have time to talk about that right now. You have to make sure that every student has equal access to your time, and if you don't hold office hours immediately, you have other things to work on after class.\n\nIf you don't protect your time (and sanity) no one else will.",

But it's not your job; she needs to find a good psychiatrist, who will probably proscribe a low dose of beta-blockers, or something similar. Your job is to kindly advise her to talk to professionals, and then return to you.\n\nI also really like some of the ideas shared in this thread, about setting strict boundaries on the length of each individual conversation with you. 3-5 min, but not more, as it's counter-productive if it's longer.
