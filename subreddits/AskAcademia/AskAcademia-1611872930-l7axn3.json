  "title:": "I've decided to leave academia",
  "text": "I didn't expect these many comments. Thank you all. I read all of them and thought about the toxicity of academia. One more thing I want to add is data manipulation. Unfortunately, I've seen quite a bit of cases within the groups I belong to and heard some from friends. Some of them are totally wrong, but many of them are sitting near the boundary. For example, if the majority of experiments give 0.1% efficiency but one experiment somehow generated 50%, then those pseudo-cheating students or postdocs report the one nice data that are not reproducible. To be honest, I'm not sure if they manipulate or not. There's no way to check if one manipulates data nicely.  PIs are too busy to care about it. They are just happy with the result. This is one side effect of the '*publish or perish'* issue originated from the crazy competitive market.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Vent.)\n\nThroughout my life,  I've been dreaming of being a professor. I love science and engineering. I finished my phd at a top school and currently a postdoc at another top school for 1.5 years. Published a decent amount of papers in decent journals. Last December, I went into the job market for the first time. I applied for TT faculty positions, but couldn't find more than 10 schools to apply because of the pandemic. So far I haven't heard anything. Read tons of articles about faculty search processes and depressed how narrow the chance is and how the \"luck\" plays crucial roles in the process. I don't think the job market will be any better next year. Maybe if I continue for 2\\~3 more years, I can get the job.\n\nBut I cannot afford to be a poor postdoc for 3 more years. I grew up in a rural area, and my parents are poor. I was always disturbed by the fact that I'm on my 30s but I don't help my parents financially. I feel selfish to continue my path toward a professor.\n\nSo sadly I decide to leave. I will work for a company and send money to my parents. I will live a normal life. No more works at nights and weekends.\n\nAny comments or thoughts are appreciated...",

I have been working in industry while applying for academic jobs after my first year of applications was a bust (for a while I was even set on staying away from the academic rat race). Turns out my industry experience was the differentiating factor I needed, got many more interviews this second year around, and even an offer at a university that I think is a good fit. Good luck!",

Read some of his advice there: https://pg.ucsd.edu/guo-faculty-job-search.pdf\n\n> In mid-2012, I finished my Ph.D. and began working as a software engineer at Google. Less than six\nmonths into that job, an incredibly lucky set of conditions arose that boosted my chances of getting a\nfaculty position, which was something that appealed to me but always seemed outside my reach\n\nHis situation is somewhat similar to what /u/Berkamp12's own situation would be, as he applied after a crisis had passed:\n\n> Most importantly, the U.S. economy began picking up again after the 2008 crash. Thus, far more\ncomputer science departments were hiring this year than they had been in the previous few years.",

And I seriously am not trying to rub salt in the wound, but I've had a ton of success in the job search and I don't even have a post doc. Honestlu just saying this because there are a lot of non-tenure teaching positions even amidst the pandemic that you might consider. Quality educators are always in demand, especially if you happen to be in the physiology or medical field. That field is rapidly changing.\n\nI really wish you luck in whatever you decide is best for you because that's the most important thing. I don't think all of academia is a lost cause, but research is for many.",

          "text": "I don\u2019t really agree that only privileged people get jobs in academia. Plenty of first generation immigrants do. I\u2019m a first generation immigrant. Came in this country with one suitcase. As a graduate student, I was making $1060/month in California , lived with 11 other people in a house . Out of the $1060 I was saving $700/month. My ability to save was extreme. Then I had a baby during my PhD, savings went to hell. As a postdoc , I got fired for having a kid and not being able to work nights and weekends like the others. I was in danger of having my green card rejected because I wasn\u2019t allowed to not have a job. I had to take my toddler back to my parents in my home country , where he stayed for over a year, while I was stuck in here because of visa, at a new postdoc, in another city. I had to send my son away so I won\u2019t be fired again. Then I found a tenure track job . On the drive from the postdoc to the TT town, when I tried to get gas, my ATM card I tried to pay with got rejected because I did not have any money in the bank. I had to live on credit cards for a while. Then I brought my baby back, got a house , started the job ... I never said that my son was sick , never mentioned him , if I had to stay home. I was saying I was sick if I had to miss some meetings. The culture in my department was that they wanted to see you in the office until 5pm, which I never understood. Three years into the TT job , I got divorced. My ex husband was also a foreigner, like me. I brought him to the US, I came alone first. He said he could not stand that I got the TT position and didn\u2019t get him one too and he said that working in industry is like being thrown \u201cbones\u201d. So he left. He still works in industry and seems happy as far as I know. So I raised my son alone since he was 6, and I was still on the TT. Now I\u2019m a full professor and I\u2019m sick and tired of academia but feel trapped. Anyway , most of my colleagues are immigrants and I also have American colleagues who come from poor or very poor backgrounds. Only one out of 33 comes from a family of professors.",

I believe that many of the people above you are making the point that pursuing positions and success in Academia can be a HUGE risk that can turn out badly just because of luck/chance. Even if someone makes all the right decisions and puts in more work than everyone else, it\u2019s still a huge risk and hurts some people more than it helps. This risk is minimized by having the safety nets of privilege and money. That means more of the rich and privileged will pursue academic endeavors. This creates an imbalance that\u2019s hard to correct later. Making it more accessible to everyone will help prevent this. What would have made things more accessible to you as an immigrant? Would any of these have helped prevent some of the losses you experienced or helped you to have more success in the field?",

Also, a little bit of maternity leave would have been nice. Instead, my PhD adviser told me that she won\u2019t pay me at all the semester I had my baby because she told me I won\u2019t be able to return to work. I went to the business office crying because I did not have another way to support myself while pregnant and after, since I didn\u2019t have the right to work in the US. The kind lady from the business office confronted my adviser and she recanted her threat . She even gaslighted me by saying she never said she will not pay me, as if I was crazy or deaf.\n\nI stayed home exactly 2.5 weeks after delivery , my vacation days and she nickeled and dimes me on those too, didn\u2019t let me have one day extra . Then she made an astonished face when I did show up in the lab exactly after 2.5 weeks after delivery . It would have been nice if academia was more humane for everyone.\n\nIt would be really nice if there was some kind of maternity leave and a change of attitude.

I have experienced both sides (I worked in industry for a while and then went back to academia), and neither is better than the other. Academia gives you more freedom, but bureaucracy can be beyond frustrating, and pay is not as good, etc. I also want to add that quitting a pursuit of academia is a courage. I saw many people who do not really fit to academia just stay in the course just because... they just don't want to seem to the other people as failure. Be proud of yourself.

Long story short: so far it feels like the best decision I ever made.  \n\nNever forget that while academia feels everywhere quite similar (basically your boss and his expectations change but the job itself isn't that different in the same field) there is a huge variety of different jobs available, where you might have completely different tasks and responsibilities. When one job isn't got you you can still try out other jobs (which is way harder in academia, where you usually want to stay in one place because if you didn't publish anything is just wasted time).\n\nI personally felt lost until I found a job that I actually could imagine doing, I think one of the biggest flaws in academic education is that the are few opportunities to find out which jobs you are qualified for and few chances to develop relevant skills (even though academics could also benefit from a lot of them).",

It can often be disappointing when we don't end up in places we expected to be, but it is important to remember that life events, including career trajectories, are not linear. We are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating our professional and personal priorities as we progress. The sacrifices you were willing to make for your dream job early on in life may not be the same ones you are willing to make now. That is okay. It is not a failure. In fact, whenever I see someone taking charge of their own path, I think of it as a success. Go get em.' \n\nTo share some solidarity. I decided early on in my PhD I would not continue with academia afterwards, although I did not dream of working in academia to begin with (so this realisation wasn't as conflicting to me as it has been to some others). Throughout my process I learned I was good at everything research-related *apart* from publishing, which I also did not enjoy doing. And yet, publishing was really the primary metric as to what determined the \"success\" my academic career. Knowing that this was going to impact my career in the \"publish or perish\" rat race, I evaluated my career goals early. Staying in academia, even with lots of luck on my side, was going to be a \"publish AND perish\" scenario and destroy my health, my relationships, my finances. I have seen what adjunctification has done. I have seen amazing PostDocs pushing huge numbers of publications, awards, teaching evaluations and grants still struggling to find stability. I have seen many amazing scholars and researchers get left behind.\n\nSo I sat down and assessed my professional strengths/weaknesses and translational skills, but more importantly, I assessed what I wanted in my non-working life; stability, progression, time off, the ability to focus on my health, hobbies and relationships. I then re-assessed what my \"dream\" job was, and realised that I just wanted to be a scientist or in a science-related field (i.e. science communication). Where did not matter (academia, industry, government, NGO), but rather it was the outside things that did matter (location, stability, money, career progression). Unfortunately, academia provided the least chance of achieving that balance. So I spent a lot of time upskilling in areas outside of publishing, much to my supervisors' dismay. I am now pretty far in the process for a position with Government and an NGO and I hope so dearly that I will be leaving academia forever. I don't regret my PhD or my decision to leave, and I am excited for what comes next.",

The truth is you can extend your academic skills while working private, and make the transition when the opportunity presents itself.  You are not defined by your job.

Failing to be accepted in labs where I'm interested is clearly a good sign that I don't do well and I Can't follow the suggestions of my colleagues to join any available position even if the research is not interesting for me. I don't believe I have to get a Ph.D. only to move forward in my current positions, it would take years of struggling mentally and financially for what !! I'm a computer engineer and I have been always offered 5 times what I earn from a public university in my country Egypt. I used to work in part-time jobs outside the university to enhance my financial situation, but what I have learned during my master's is that research needs more and more time. While I'm still ready to give up money for years during my Ph.D., I can't give up my interests. what would be the point of this.

I wish I have known you earlier :'(\n\nI am already in my thirties, sacrificed two years to military service and many more years to PhD. I also dreamed of becoming a professor one day, teaching things i like. I was still holding on to the hope when I did my first postdoc, and now I am doing my second postdoc and I realise I need to crash out quickly of this academic industry. \n\nI also do not come from a rich family, and my parents are getting on in their years, and I really cannot see myself trotting around the globe for a few more years just to get that glimmer of hope. So i have decided to go back home, find a temporary research fellowship on some projects that are related to industry, then move on to something else. \n\nI feel your pain, but things now are not the same as they are used to be. In the past having a PhD and a good publication is enough to set you on the academic path. But this path is getting narrower and more exclusive, and it seems like you need to display attributes of a full professor before you are even qualified for a tenure-track position. Even so, you have to worry about your job for another 6 more years before your tenure is up for evaluation.\n\nI spoke to my PhD supervisor about this and luckily he understands the current state of the academic job industry. Both of us come to the same conclusion that if I can't get a university position it is not my fault. It is the system that is broken and if nothing is fixed, it is best to leave it rotting. \n\nI feel that joining the industry pays well, and morally feels good because I will be contributing something meaningful to the company. And it is a more stable job compared to a TT position because the skills and network that I develop will eventually serve me well now and beyond. In the country where I come from, the academic industry is brutal. There are professors who lose their tenure and end up taking a much less dignified job to pay their bills. Imagine the horror...",
