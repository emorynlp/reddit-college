  "text": "I\u2019m a grad student and just got my first conference proposal accepted. The conference is being held in a somewhat touristy city that\u2019s in driving distance, and my partner would love to come with me, as he\u2019s never seen it. \n\nOf course he would occupy himself during the conference sessions and such, but would like to grab dinner with me, see a museum, etc. I\u2019ve never been to a conference, so I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s frowned upon and what isn\u2019t. Would it be bad to bring him with me and enjoy some sightseeing together in my downtime? Or is that a no-no? ",

Set the expectations of when you think you'll be available... it's okay to skip out on parts of the meeting that seem useless. And maybe stay a day or two after the meeting to see more together.",

We were both attending the same meeting actually, so it made sense...we then of course also brought the toddler to the big featured keynote dinner (because we both wanted to hear the speaker). As it turned out, there were quite a few people from our university there and we all ended up sitting at a big table together-- including our provost. We were both like \"Whoops! We snuck our kid into the banquet and now we're gonna get the stink-eye from the provost!\" but she ended up playing with our kid through most of the keynote.\n\nLots of young academics bring their kids to meetings.

                      "text": "> And I have a hard time understanding how there could be literally no one else to hold the baby during a presentation. It just seems silly to me. But, I could just be missing details that would elaborate on why she chose/had to do so. \n\n\nMany babies I've seen get queasy when someone else is holding them but get perfectly calm again once you hand them to their parents. She probably made sure that it was recently fed and therefore sleepy, then used a towel or something to create a nice sleeping space close to her body, so that the baby would feel super comfortable and will simply sleep.  \nHanding it to another person on the other hand might have made the baby uncomfortable, which leads to screaming. This can be a lot more disruptive. If the baby is in the lecture hall it obviously is ruining the talk, if it's somewhere else people would probably try to get her there as soon as possible to calm her baby down, either disruption the talk ('sorry, but you need to check on your baby, it won't stop crying!') or shorten her discussion time with the same request. If you can hear the screaming from inside the hall, she probably also would be very distracted. Why risk that if you know that your baby will most likely sleep through the talk if it's with you?   \nThis isn't the same for all babies, it depends on age and character, but she surely thought this through and found that this solution will work best for everyone.\n\nI had a lecture with someone who did exactly that almost every day. Only once I remember that the baby was making any noise, usually it was calm and caused zero trouble. It also wasn't distracting.",

If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll run into someone and start networking your way around. More likely though is that you\u2019ll get bored by the third session and wonder if it\u2019s ok to wander off to explore the city (tip: it always is!) so much better to be able to do that with someone you think is cool!",

They generally wouldn't be welcome at panels and networking events (and in my case, my wife would have hated them anyway),  but conferences shouldn't be just that anyway.\n\nNow, after a years in the field, my colleagues know my wife and expect her (and my daughter) to be there.  Our kids play together, sometimes we grab dinner together, and when we have night time networking to do, my wife isn't sitting alone at a bar or in the hotel room.\n\nThis is a very male perspective on it, I recognize, but for the females in my collaborative group, similar behavior occurs with their husbands (or significant others).  All of us may be odd, but I suspect it is the norm at some level.",

My collaborators and I all get so geeked out that it becomes completely unbearable for our spouses -- and even for some of our fellow conference-goers who know how to talk about non-work things. So, the arrangement most of us settle on is to have the significant others stay for a leading or trailing weekend, overlapping no more than a day or two. It still saves some money on travel, and avoids complaints about boredom and neglect. \n\nThat said, you shouldn't hesitate to bring your partner, just be sure both of you are aware of your schedules. It is totally common, acceptable, and a great opportunity to justify a short vacation. ",

We do the same as university employees (faculty & admin) and sometimes take our kids as well. Everyone does it. For grad students you probably need to plan in advance to not see a lot of one another, since you are there to attend sessions and network. But as faculty I will often go to a multi-day conference and split off for a day or two to meet friends, visit an archive, explore, whatever, as I no longer have the drive/need/interest to sit through for days of talks on anything.",

      "text": "The conferences I go to are usually during the week and wrap up on a Friday night. I usually ask to postpone my flight home until Sunday that way my SO can meet up for the closing party and the two of us can have a mini vacation that weekend without the stress of the conference . This allows us to get away without him(SO) getting bored while I\u2019m at sessions and I can network without worrying about him (SO) feeling left out. If you ask your PI for the delay of the flight home, make sure you\u2019re not charging anything extra to your travel account when you\u2019re not at the conference. From my experience, several PIs enjoy knowing you\u2019re getting to unwind on these trips and have no problem with the delay if it doesn\u2019t interfere with costs or work. My SO and I can usually find some super cool affordable hotels, for the non conference days, that end up being much better/ cheaper than the conference hotels. ",

If it's a nice location, I usually extend my conference trips and use it as a holiday with family. ",
