  "title:": "Do you find that many people in academia have \"tunnel vision\" where they are excessively preoccupied with their field of study and that critical thinking doesn't transfer to other domains?",
  "text": "It would appear at first glance that the skills of reading a technical paper and logically critiquing it would generalize to thinking rationally in other areas of life as well. However, I've increasingly seen that many professors are often able to be brilliant in their own field, while having silly opinions in real life, apparently without experiencing much cognitive dissonance (of course, this is a generalization...). The kinds of arguments that they advance for their opinions in real life would get them laughed out of the park if they were applied to their own field of scientific inquiry. I have a strong suspicion that academia self-selects for those people who are highly intelligent but have \"tunnel vision\" in the sense of having singular interests (or very narrow interests) and are rather conformist in their beliefs otherwise.\n\nIs it just me? What has been your experience? Have you felt the same way?\n\n(For my background: I'm a STEM masters student, and this came up quite often in a group consisting of masters and PhD students.)",

I find that the same critical thinking skills my colleagues have tend to transfer to other arenas outside of our tiny speciality areas.  \n\nOf course some academic folks have some views that are \u201cout there\u201d or seem ridiculous.  But that occurs across all populations.  \n\nFor example:  I\u2019m a criminologist.  Everybody has opinions about crime (and most are wrong).  When I speak with other academics about issues related to crime, nearly all the time, they get it.  Or, at the very least, they are able to view the issue from angles outside of their own opinion.  But when I talk about it among non-academics, I find that many people can\u2019t get past their own views to analytically think about the topic.",

But once it comes to something which they believe in, they seem to be about as likely to be blinded by ideology or some other beliefs they have as everyone else (or at least, not much less likely). \n\nIt's like they can get by looking at the trees in such detail that they forget entirely about the forest. They unquestionably have expertise in the tree in front of them, but they miss the fact that the forest is burning. If someone points it out, they can get defensive because they apparently know a lot about the forest, but their actual expertise is in the tree. They often get the implicit assumptions wrong or fail to realize that they have those assumptions in the first place. (This is the point about lacking rationality.) However, once the assumptions are set in place, they are extremely good at deductive reasoning, or otherwise working within the system.",

Later on, I studied at a highly ranked math undergraduate program, followed by a CS grad program at another university. I worked with a few professors for my thesis as well as other projects, attended a conference, and generally had substantial interaction with the grad students.\n\nI don't dispute that researchers are more rational and analytical than the average person. My point is that it's often not nearly as much as one might assume looking at their domain-specific expertise and the critical thinking involved. To give a concrete value, if you had a good psychometric measure of rationality vs domain expertise, I would guess the correlation to be something mildly positive (like 0.2-0.3) and not 0.8 or so, which you would expect if the critical thinking transferred substantially.",

The ones I know are so irritated by this trope in movies, how as long as someone is a scientist in some area, they have some high-level of expertise in all areas. \n\nThere are some disciplines, like some in biology, that do require a fair level of mastery over math, chemistry, and physics as well. And some people who are scientists just love science in general and make an effort to keep up in all areas - journals like *Science* and *Nature* are targetted at exactly these people. So, it's not outrageous to find a scientist in one area to be quite conversant in other ones, but I think the expectation of scientists to be masters of all areas of the discipline mostly comes from the outside. I think every one of us as a story of a friend or relative asking us an opinion on an idea they have or something they read about when it is nowhere near our field of expertise. I don't have any friends who are scientists doing that.",

I would think it would be impossible to publish in a larger journal.

It's even more common for ecology and conservation papers to end with \"policy and management recommendations,\" without any reflection on the fact that their are *entire fields* dedicated to studying environmental policy and management. Then these studies and recommendations are recirculated, re-cited, etc., all within those disciplines, which have little to no awareness that they are overstepping and presenting bad work. Or old, outdated ideas that social scientists have examined, critiqued, and improved on. Sometimes literally decades ago. And this work ends up being very influential, in terms of actual management practice and policymaking. But it's missing half the story half the time.\n\nIt's the equivalent of me, as a soc scientist, just off the cuff using my topical experience to make ecological claims; publish a scientific \"study\" that uses anecdotal data, outdated methods, and showcases my limited knowledge of the literature; or suggest new research directions in a field I have no actual training in.\n\nWhile it's easy to say the opposite probably exists -- social scientists overstepping their bounds -- I'd argue in my experience this is far less common l, at least in the enviro realm. And it has to do with the power dynamics of the environmental field genrerally, which has long been steered by ecologists and other natural scientists, who've allowed themselves to creep into other disciplines like the social sciences. It would be outlandish for me to send some sort of lab or field ecology study to Science, so why is the opposite not only OK, but a regular occurrence?",

These suppositions likely seem far-fetched to medical scientists (I also work in more applied areas of the field and with medical scientists), but they are not meant to be taken literally without more translational work. \n\nAs an evolutionary biologist, I work with many ecologists all of whom do feel very passionately about environmental policy, and it is what motivates their work. If people in environmental policy take the recommendations of abstracted discussion sections of their papers, then I think may be the issue with is policy as a field. If they keep taking these recommendations literally, it will only encourage them more.\n\nEven if this is an issue entirely the fault of some ecologists, I still don't think it should be used to color all of the natural sciences as riddled with self-important and under-informed people who want to overstep into other fields.",

Most of us finish our discussions with management or policy implications as well as the science, because often it reflects the nature of the work (less and less ecology papers are \"blue-sky\" science and more publications tend to be linked to issues like climate change, invasive species, resource management etc.). Journals, funding bodies, examiners will criticise you if you don't state how your science has applications in the \"real-world\" beyond learning a new cool fact. That's not even limited to ecology, either. Unless your research is purely theoretical, my understanding is that more applied fields push for research to discuss wider applications.\n\nYes, a few ecologists/scientists will pander to the management/policy/social aspect too much without being in those fields themselves, or completely overreach what those implications are. I will admit that researchers will try to state how implications are global so they can get into higher impact factor journals while no policy or management changes are made from their study whatsoever. That annoys me, personally. But for the most part, ecologists are willing to step aside and let those in environmental policy, management etc. take the lead on those topics. And it's becoming more common place that we're collaborating with those outside our fields too.\n\nMaking a few policy/management *recommendations* at the end of a paper (which are expected) does not mean the scientist is trying to speak entirely for politicians/managers, which is what the OP almost implied.",

You see dozens of papers on medrixv by data scientists, machine learning folks, engineering modelers, economists, and physicists, who have never touched the field of epidemic modeling*. They're legitimately excellent at modeling their own field, so it is easy to assume this knowlege transfers. But in truth some domain expertise and context is important, and it's easy to go wrong without it. \n\n* There are some who do both, have significant experience in the field, and are excellent at it. In this case I specifically refer to those who never touched the subject before March and now are trying to publish on it without any collaborators in the field.\n\nAnother excellent example is John Sununu, the adviser who convinced President Bush (41) that climate change was a farce. He was a brilliant guy. A PhD from MIT, and a known engineering modeler. He felt his modeling expertise was sufficient to evaluate NASA climatologist James Hansen's models, and he decided they were bullocks. Until this point the entire focus of the debate was \"*how much economic growth will we sacrifice to deal with this problem?*\" But Sununu's criticism gave the deniers new life and credibility. After Sununu publicly denounced Hansen and convinced President Bush to abandon any greenhouse gas regulating treaties the US was entertaining, the entire debate shifted to \"*is it a hoax or not a hoax*\". We've been fighting that once since then. The entire world changed because one brilliant guy decided his admittedly impressive expertise translated to another field he didn't understand well.

That same PI who bought a house on the beach in a very high risk zone. \n* A PI was extremely intrigued by what the tractors do on the beach and had multiple conversations about it to try to solve what he believed was a mystery. (spoiler: They are scraping the sand!). \n* I have been asked by a STEM PI how to use a beaker. \n* I have also been surprised at the beliefs research groups seem to hold. I thought scientists did not *believe*! In my STEM field, there were two \"gangs\" that had different views on a reality that had not been observed yet. Working for a PI in either one meant you adhered to their belief. I was confused by that, aren't scientists supposed to be looking for truth, no matter what it is? \n* Also sitting on any committee, even prestigious ones, as someone with minimal management training is torture. Scientists are completely unaware about all the management tools that exist to help decision taking and project management. They also don't care and don't trust them when they are presented to them. It could save so much time! It's like they believe that they know everything already and that it surely won't be something coming from \"soft\" sciences that will help them.\n\nOf course these are just anecdotes, but it would be pretty interesting to see an actual study on the subject. I suspect it would calm down some of our know-it-alls.",

That's a huge generalization; but if you think about it, some of the classic signs might match up: small, specific interest in a very specific thing, perhaps a lack of understanding in other areas, etc. Again I'll say: obviously this would be a case-by-case thing and I don't know of any statistics to support this, it's just my observation.",

My theory about it goes like this.  Analytic skills are not passive (something you have or don't have) but rather more  like a muscle that can be flexed, but also it can be exhausted if you use it too much.  If I spend all day doing high level analysis then, yes, I want to relax and pretend the rest of life is easy, even trivial, even if it means I look naive and simple-minded to others.  For example, during the quarentine I downloaded a Linux game that involved \"hit rate\" probabilities  and terrain penalties for various characters.  I wanted to distract myself from all the stress work, and yet here it is tacitly nudging me to solve expectation values during my break.  So I promptly uninstalled it.  I can do that kind of math all day but sometimes I just want to do anything but analysis.",

I think that going on for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, analyzing a very specific phenomenon (bonus points if it's theoretical) must require a particular type of person. And it makes perfect sense that someone doing that would unwind by shutting their brain off for the rest of the time. This is what I was referring to in the \"self-selection\" bit. I think that, by and large, people who don't have that \"madness\" won't decide to join academia, given its current state. I know I wouldn't if that was the price I needed to pay. So, you self-select for a narrower kind of intelligence, or a person willing to spend their time thinking about a narrow field of inquiry to the exclusion of everything else. (To be fair, given the highly specialized world today, such a \"narrow\" kind of intelligence seems ideal to be in the workforce in pretty much any industry.)",

On one hand, they don't have the time to dedicate their lives to other fields like they do to their own.  But on the other hand, having conversations about things you don't know about can be intimidating.  So having weird beliefs is a way to get around that.\n\nI used to be confused because of course, academics often have conversations about research where usually you don't know the answers.
