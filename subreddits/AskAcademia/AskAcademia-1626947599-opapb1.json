  "title:": "I feel alienated when non-academic friends and family superficially congratulate me for achievements",
  "text": "Hello everyone. I understand very few people want to hear about your achievements, even fewer people care. But my non-academic friends and family say they care, but never get too invested in anything. I mean anything. I know my audience, im not blabbering details and details about my work. Nome of them can actually say 1 sentance about what i like/do. They cant say 1 defining word. I mention i am very invested in their lives and talk for hours over the phone with them. I know they admire and respect me for my achievements, but whenever they say, \"are you finished?? \" - - im like, finished with what exactly? They don't know. I dont want to be finished with uni, with work, this is my life. \n\nWhen it comes to friends and family I personally feel unnecessary pressure with things like \"im sure youll do great\" even if I know they are just trying to be encouraging. There will be something that i fail at, and ill be very disappointed in myself, given i should have done \"great\".\n\n<rant over>\nHow do you manage their passive investment and impostor syndrome to these expectations?",

      "text": "Honestly, it never even crossed my mind to hold it against my friends and family for not being sufficiently expert in my field or sufficiently well-versed in grad school stuff. Like, for one, because I do something very specialized that people without relevant training can't even understand, let alone be interested in, and for another, because I'm just grateful that my family/friends care about me and want to be supportive, even if they understand diddly squat re what they're being supportive of. Why would you expect non-experts to respond to you as if they are experts? That doesn't make logical sense.\n\nI suspect you have either decided that you have no identity outside of your job, which is why people not being able to discuss your job in detail is so visceral to you, or you feel resentful of your family and friends for some reason and are sublimating that resentment as... whatever this is. Either way, I suggest you meet your family and friends where they are. You can't turn them into different people, and you shouldn't throw them away over something trivial.",

          "text": "I think you misunderstood me. Im not holding anything against them for not understanding what i do because i dont detail any of my work. I do something very specialised in biology as well. I said they are literally incapable of knowing i do \"biology\" like 1 word. They don't know my specialisation, lol. I dont think 1 sentance about what your child does is too much for non-academic people to comprehend. That is my frustration. Read my previous comments.\n\nAlso, this is not trivial to me since its my passion. Something trivial is all the daily details of their lives that i discuss with them:)",

              "text": "Bruh, the only people who know my specialization are people who are in or adjacent to my field. My family and friends usually know my discipline (although some confuse it with other social science disciplines), most grieviously misunderstand what my discipline even constitutes, and certainly none of them discuss my specialization with me or probably know that there is such a thing as specializations - what for? I don't think this is weird or something they are doing to spite me. I think you have elevated expectations of how much laymen understand, and also of how much other people are supposed to care about the minutiae of your life. \n\nI don't know, have you tried doing what you're asking your parents to do? Like, suppose your dad is a plumber: does that mean you can now carry out a sophisticated conversation about plumbing?",

Im not losing my enthusiasm, as i keep working just the same, but im losing the connection with them since its so tiring for me.",

It's a bit like if you had a crazy runner friend who ran all of the time and all they talked about was running, and it made you feel a bit inferior because you get winded walking to the corner store, and then they told you that they were about to run in (or just completed) another event. You are now in a relatively elite club, and you are not going to get much validation from people who are not also in the club.",

Your friends and family care about you, they don't understand what it is you do but they know it's important to you and they want to show you they understand that and that they support you, so suck it up buttercup. \n\nYou're still doing your PhD, most of your peer group is either still in academia or in junior roles and many will be in areas you understand. Wait until you're 40, your friendship group has expanded and changed, your friends will have been through various career changes and moved across their organisations and you won't have a clue what any of them do in their jobs. However, you may have developed some empathy and you'll find yourself congratulating them on all sorts of things that you don't understand the significance of and just sharing in their joy because you're their friend. \n\nYour friends and family have their own lives, they don't live vicariously through you. It's pretty arrogant to expect them to understand what you do and then to be snotty that their sincere congratulations don't come with a full explanation of why they should be congratulating you. Say thank you, appreciate their sentiment and save the detail for the lab and your colleagues.",

They go in, they do what they need to do, they leave and go live their lives. You might hear about the promotions or their boss being a jerk, but it's not something they want to chat about in their free time. Most academics don't see it that way and see their work as a meaningful part of their lives, but that's the mindset you have to convert it to. Sometimes it's easier to mostly talk about non-work stuff with non-work friends/family.",

It's unreasonable for me to expect them to be super interested in what grad school like I am-we all know there are a LOT of boring details lol. After accepting that (both parties), I've found we are getting better at this.
