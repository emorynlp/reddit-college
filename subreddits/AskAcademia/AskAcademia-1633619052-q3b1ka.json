  "text": "Every youtuber talks about how to break chain of addiction. Everyone talks about how to stop porn addiction. Everyone talks about how to get out of bed. Everyone talks about how to stop watching netflix and focus on work to do in Hand. But that is none of my issue. My issue is burnout. After studying for an extended amount of time I get burnt out. How do I deal with this(prevent and recover)? How do I decrease frequency of burnout? Once a month is fine for me as my exam last 4 weeks. \n\nI have to study around 10 hrs everyday during exams(5 hrs per day when there are no exams) to study. Most of my friends study the same. I study in 45 mins +15 mins pomodoro.\n\nMy grades are hurting and this way I will graduate with less than what I actually am. How do I decrease the frequency of burnout?\n\nI am trying-:\n\n1) Yoga\n\n2) Walking\n\n3) Pranayama \n\netc. But there are days where doing any of them doesn't work. That is my issue.",

If it's 10h of staying in front of your computer without active attention, it doesn't sounds like efficient work. And that's OK! Human brains are not meant to be focused 10h in a row.",

          "text": "I know it's hard to take a break because it makes you feel guilty, but it's important to tell yourself that you'll work more efficiently in good conditions. In good conditions, with motivation, I can do 5 hours of work in 1h. Sometimes I don't have motivation and that's OK, the best thing to me is completely disconnect from work for few hours, maybe a day",
