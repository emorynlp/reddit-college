  "title:": "Can we talk about how strictly \u201cSTEM\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean job security or good pay anymore? And the illusion is misleading students.",
  "text": "STEM = Science Technology Engineering Math\n\nI will absolutely agree that: (1) Engineering and Technology, (2) Health Care (sub sector of \u201cScience\u201d) and (3) Statistics/Data Science (subsector of\u201cMath\u201d..?) are in high demand and are usually well paid. Going into any of these specific fields directly is healthy. \n\nHOWEVER basic scientists like biologists and chemists are not paid all that great and are certainly not in demand. It\u2019s not quite as bad as being a Art History major but I see many similarities on these Reddit threads between science grad students and humanities grad students. It\u2019s not unusual for grads with M.S. in life sciences to apply for many jobs with hopes of making just $45-50k. Meanwhile their business and engineering counterparts start out at $80k with a just B.S. \n\nOk. So what? Why is this a problem? Well because many naive students believe their hard work, years of late night studying, 45 page thesis, lab work, etc. in life sciences will translate to a good paying job easily. I mean it is \u201cSTEM\u201d right? But that\u2019s just not the case. It\u2019s a problem because budding science undergrads should be warned with a flashing red light that if they don\u2019t go into health care directly, their degree will require several more years of study for a job that will probably be underpaid.\n\n(Steps off of soap box...)",

              "text": "There are typically 6 reasons we get very skewed perception on the internet about job prospects for STEM folks.  We are assuming these comments are from STEM folks outside of computer science or those with MDs.\n\n1) These commenters are mostly young people in the first three years out of their out of college.  No, you aren't going to make 65k right out of college with only a BS, unless you are have a degree in engineering or *maybe* computer science (but less likely if only a BS).  In 5 years, yeah, that is a reasonable goal, but not to start with.\n\n2)  These are people that went to a subpar school.  There is name recognition here.  Get a degree from a good program in your field.  People that tell you otherwise have no idea what they are talking about.  And grades DO matter for your first job out of college (which sets the trajectory for the rest of your career).\n\n3)  Some of these folks have never had a job in their entire life.  They graduate college with no work experience.  It is idiotic how frequently I see this.  DON'T do this, it will cripple your job prospects for the rest of your life.  Get work experience BEFORE you graduate with a degree.\n\n4)  People are unwilling to move across country to get a job.  If you live in the middle of nowhere Missouri, there are no jobs in biology, biochem, or chemistry.  You have to go to the coastal cities where the tech and biotech hubs are.\n\n5)  Many of the STEM fields are available only to people with MS or PhDs.  It has been this way for a long time and you should expect to get a graduate degree from the start if you want one of those jobs.\n\n6)  Job markets for most degrees are tight.  You know what there is a real shortage of in this country?  Tradesmen.  There is a massive shortage of skilled laborers.  Why?  Because everyone thinks they need to go to college to have a fulfilling life.  Everyone was lied to.  It isn't just STEM. in fact, STEM fields are ***considerably*** better off than most.  It is ALL college degrees that are oversaturated.  There are just more people with college degrees then there are jobs for college degrees (EXCEPT in computer science, and MDs.  Those are included in STEM though so...).",

In my (admittedly limited sample size) circle of friends including several CS majors, relatively few CS majors walk right into a full time software engineer/developer position with a BS (that is none out of the 4 I know well).  I am 6 years out of undergrad and two of the 4 now make that kind of money, so much better off than most, but this wasn't 'right out of college'. My boss' son got a position out of his BS making 85k at IBM after 6 months of job searching post graduation, but he was a math major at MIT (a top program), not a CS major at a typical state school, and was looking for jobs at major coastal tech hubs.\n\nSo, of course there are exceptions, and CS majors are still better off than basically anyone else in STEM besides the *lucky* math major or people in particular fields of engineering, but I don't think walking out of a typical state school into a full time, salaried position making 78k + benefits is necessarily typical even for a CS major unless you went to a top program and are looking for jobs at coastal tech hubs (see my comments above).  Hard work pays off, but not often does a mere four years of hard work pay off.  You just need to temper your expectations a bit.  We had been trained that college equals instant success.

Mathematical skills are *highly* marketable, but many of the jobs that'd really appreciate those skills are looking for PhDs still. Someone with a BSc in mathematics is not likely to end up working with a lot of maths, but few get any other useful skills. \n\nTheir writing skills can be subpar, their programming skills won't be very developed, they don't know how to use important programs, and they don't know how to paint their experience/knowledge in a good light on their resume. Some students might even hype up the \"pure\" aspect of their maths degree or speak with jargon without realising that industries simply don't know how to interpret that. \n\nThere are a lot of young people graduating with these degrees only to realise that there *isn't* a clearly-defined job waiting for them. Someone with an engineering degree doesn't need to ask \"what jobs can I get with this?\". \n\nEdit: It's funny though, we also have posters in the department that literally say a degree in physics can get you \"any job\". So we're not exactly helping to fix that misconception. ",

Even if you hit on something that's fairly secure, automating pressure and the general gig-ification of the rest of the economy means the \"demand\" for those jobs is going perennially unsatisfied. Barring unusual circumstances, we can expect employers to behave as if there's a deep line of replacements available for any particular employee no matter how skilled they are.",

Getting a degree in math or physics can definitely aid someone in standing out.\n\nEDIT: once again anecdotal, but there are plenty of bio majors who perform well in the more math intensive courses and still have a difficult time when applying to med school. Usually they have other issues on their belt.\n\nAnother thing to note, undergrads in my school (an average school)  are required to do research before graduating. Math and physics pre-meds usually find themselves doing research in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics or simulations of dynamical systems. Those sort of research projects are very critical thinking intensive. Biology pre-meds on the other hand, will get research positions where all they do are robotic hands on tasks like cleaning lab-ware or injecting solutions onto a machine. If I was looking for someone with critical thinking skills, what would look more favorable?",

My PhD advisor did 2 post docs before getting their job and basically told me that they really never considered being a professor until after their 1st post doc. Then another student, who happened to be the first student in the lab, told me that our PI never wanted to do post docs or be a professor, they just did it because they couldn't find jobs doing anything else. \n\nThere's lots of people like this and then we talk about how there is an over supply of PhDs and it's basically a crap shoot to get a TT job. It's because we keep training people in these useless, academic niche fields and then make them believe they will have marketable skills outside of academia and a job waiting for them afterwards. ",

Look at Table 1 [in this report](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/04/11/aaups-annual-report-faculty-compensation-takes-salary-compression-and-more) and the \"all combined\" line near the bottom-- the average for assistants is $70K but excluding the big schools/R1s it's in the low 60s.

No one is guaranteed a job or a lot of money and all too often people mad about science jobs are people who didn\u2019t want to be scientists in the first place. \n\nI think you specifically have had a bad experience with your STEM degree and are projecting that onto others. \n\nLike most fields scientists and mathematicians need a few years of work before they start making significant money after their bachelors (and sometimes this few years can be graduate school IMO). Even engineers don\u2019t start out immediately making an egregious amount of money. \n\nAll too often these articles and stuff like that are overdramatized, oversimplified, and overstated by people who are dissatisfied with their career and education choices. \n\nAll fields will vary based on the economy the specific discipline and the region of the country you are in. One year mechanical engineers may be the bees knees; the next they might be a dime a dozen. The same goes for chemists, biologists, physicists, etc... \n\nAlso I think a SIGNIFICANT part of this animosity, including some of yours based on your post history, comes from people who try to use the sciences as stepping stones to other careers. They want to be a doctor or a vet or a dentist etc..... and sometimes for whatever reason that doesn\u2019t happen and the jobs of a scientist vs a healthcare professional are VERY different. \n\nFor example. I have a B.S. in chemistry; I could have come out of undergrad with a job immediately making 45k per year with full benefits. But I love chemistry so I am choosing to go to graduate school so I can learn more and pursue what I enjoy as well as increase my earning potential long term ",

This is more an example of you being a bossy undergrad who mistakes his plan for the future with what is actually happening.
