      "text": "I preferably work with vector graphics in R so resolution isn't a problem since you can easily scale vector graphics up or down and they'd always look crisp. If you're using Rstudio, you can export the image as an SVG or PDF, both of which will save the image as vector graphics, or you can use svg() in the code. I then proceed and make multi-panel figures in inkscape\n\nKeep in mind though that if you have a heavy plot (say, 5000+ data points) then vector graphics can be very demanding of your computational hardware. Many libraries in R now have a rasterise option where they make the data points raster graphics while the rest of the plot is vector. It's a good hybrid approach for heavy plots, but I mostly end up with increasing the font sizes etc so that I can export the hybrid vector graphics at a higher resolution for the raster part (increasing the resolution increases the plot size but keeps the font size the same, hence changing the font size etc)",

But for me it's been taking graphs usually from Prism, but R or Python or MATLAB could be fine, and fine tuning them in Illustrator (or a free equivalent I'm not remembering the name of right now). It has a bit of a learning curve, and I'm not super comfortable still, and luckily had some instruction/help from my PI, but that's usually the process behind the figures I find most impressive and compelling. Most of the time you probably still have to touch up or make combinations in Illustrator even with good code.",
