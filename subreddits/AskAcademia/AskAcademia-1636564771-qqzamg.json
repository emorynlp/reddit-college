  "title:": "New PhD Student - Feel like I'm not doing enough",
  "text": "I'm a first-year School Psychology PhD student at an R1 university. I'm about \\~1 month away from finishing my first semester (yay!). I'm really enjoying it so far and I've definitely had weeks where I've been busier than others, but as a whole, I haven't been as busy as I expected at all. I'm taking 15 credit hours (5 classes) and work at 20hr/week graduate assistantship (non-teaching; I work in a campus office). Comparatively, my peers in my cohort seem like they're ALWAYS busy, always working, always doing something, etc... I regularly hear how stressed they are, how much they're doing, how much work they have to do, and honestly, it makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. I still have a lot of time to relax, go out with friends, binge watch show - all the things I enjoy doing - and I haven't really had to sacrifice much. However, because I can't relate to my peers in stress levels and workload, I can't help but wonder if it's because I'm not doing enough and/or falling behind compared to the rest of my cohort. \n\nI've met with my chair/advisor a few times throughout the semester (we meet once a month). She's encouraged me to start probing around for research opportunities that I want to get involved in, and I've reached out to my co-chair/co-advisor to join her lab. For some added info, my chair/advisor is not a research professor; she's the clinical professor of practice and supervises our behavioral clinic on campus. As a result, I have a co-chair that is a research professor, but when I spoke to her, I was told that she's still getting her weekly lab meetings set up and will let me know when I can join. As a result, I still haven't started doing any research, but my advisor has let me know it's perfectly fine to take it slow. In comparison, a few of the individuals in my cohort are in a diff. research lab where they're doing so many incredible things already - working with R, doing literature reviews, getting on publications, getting on their own projects. Most of my cohort is also older than me (25+ while I'm 22), but there's another individual in my cohort who is my age and started her PhD straight out of undergrad who is already presenting her research at our national conference.   \n\n\nCompared to my cohort and the rest of my peers, I'm scared that I'm already falling behind.  I know there's this facet of being a PhD student in which you're always busy and always stressed out as is the nature of doing a PhD, but I've yet to feel this way. I love what I'm doing and started this program because I'm passionate about it, but honestly, I'm not a particularly ambitious person nor am I interested in doing everything at once. I almost feel as if I'm not meant to be a PhD student, because I'm not highly motivated, as perfectionistic, nor as hardworking as my peers are. How do I handle not feeling like I'm doing enough? Should I be doing more?   \n\n\nThank you! I really appreciate the help / any advice.",

      "text": "What is your end goal with your PhD? If you want to go into industry, perhaps you\u2019re just fine. If you want to be competitive at an R1/R2 or even SLAC, you likely need to get on the ball. Even CCs are in high-competition (several of my colleagues are stuck in the revolving door of adjunct hell with degrees from Ivies but low productivity\u2026 others have decent degrees with high productivity). Several of my friends with degrees from Ivies and high research output are still stuck in the NTT revolving door (usually with post docs and recurring 2-3 year VAPs). Academia is a crapshoot right now\u2014and it really is all about luck, being in the right place at the right time, and who you know\u2014but you will be best served with high research output beginning as soon as you can in your doctoral career, regardless where your degree is from. This is probably why your peers feel stressed and constantly \u201con.\u201d However, jobs do exist outside academia, especially in your field, so that may not be the route you want to go, and that is perfectly fine, too.",

          "text": "I\u2019m honestly not all that interested in going into academia or working as a professor and both of my advisors know this. My end goal is to work in schools and later on as a clinician, but I did want to contribute to the research base especially with issues related for underserved populations where the research is generally scarce. I don\u2019t really envision myself as pumping out publication after publication though, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very good fit for academia in general! Thank you for the info and best of luck to your colleagues as well! I\u2019m not really sure how many in my cohort are interested in academia, but considering the market it\u2019d make sense for them to be putting so much work in now!",

      "text": "I don't know. I am in my third year and have never felt particularly busy or the crazy amount of work/stress/sacrifices that everyone else seems to deal with. I usually feel like I am not doing enough, but I have exceeded all of the expectations/milestones set out for me by this point, and my advisor seems very happy with my progress. I sit on multiple committees, TA, research, network, etc. I also enjoy my life, spend time with my boyfriend and family, and keep active. I think a lot of people like to compete with how busy they are - as if it is some sort of requirement to have no life. If you have the right research support, and you know how to work and study efficiently, it is not impossible to balance things out. Plus, I also realize how absolutely insane the world of academia is - and I refuse to give up my sanity for the 0.0001 additional point it may give me when applying to academic jobs.",

          "text": "I really appreciate hearing this, especially from a third year student. I feel like I always hear that PhD students are incredibly busy/stressed out with a lot on their plates in terms of workload. I very much came in with the goal to set boundaries and do my best to ensure I had a good work-life balance. I\u2019m happy to hear that you were able to exceed your milestones and are so active in your program without having to make those crazy sacrifices or losing yourself to your PhD. It\u2019s definitely want I also want to do, though I do think I could be a little more involved haha. Thanks so much for the insight!",

      "text": "It's hard to not compare yourself to your peers--they're going to be your professional colleagues. I understand that. However, people often come into programs with jobs that they were previously holding, or knew faculty coming in, etc. There are reasons some people can hit the ground running more than others, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.\n\nIf your advisor is saying it's fine to take it slow then take comfort in their input. Faculty in my program, for instance, have indicated that they'd prefer some students to \"be students\" that first semester to ease into the new change rather than working immediately. If you're being proactive about looking for potential research roles and are on track to secure one in the spring then I bet you're okay.\n\nSince you have some time, as well, it might be worth thinking about reaching out to faculty in your program/department to introduce yourself, get to know their research, and probe about potential opportunities that might be coming up on their projects. It's good networking practice but also will put you in their heads should they have new things come up in the future. Not sure if this fits your program at all or not, but just a thought!",

Personally, I feel like I'm busy but I'm not stressed out or having to give up things I enjoy. I treat my PhD studies like a 9-5 job most days and then relax on the evenings and weekends. I don't think this is necessarily a sign that you're not meant to be a PhD student at all. You might just need to be a bit more proactive in getting involved in research.

A lot of my peers also treat it as a 9-5 but end up having to do work on the weekends as well, so it made me wonder if I\u2019m missing something since I don\u2019t really touch work on the weekends. Thank you for the insight and advice on being more proactive about getting involved w research tho - I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve been as active as I could be, so I think I could definitely benefit from maybe being a little more involved.",
