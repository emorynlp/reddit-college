      "text": "It's not mandatory but many places will include failure to appropriately acknowledge contributions in their definition of academic misconduct. It's at best bad practice not to acknowledge someone and at worst it's misconduct. However, it's also subjective and there's no hard and fast rule.\n\nDiscussions about authorship should happen before the work starts, not at the point of submitting the paper, although all too many PIs leave it until then.",

      "text": "ICMJE criteria were, broadly,  adopted by many medical journals (as well as many life science journals).  An author should meet all criteria, and all people meeting all criteria should be an author.\n\nHowever, this is not \"the law\".  It is a set of recommendations, and specifically required by some, but not all journals.\n\nOther systems take a different approach. The CRediT taxonomy for example is more into describing specific contributions for each of the authors.\n\nWhich ever system, gift, ghost and guest authorships are considered unethical.",
