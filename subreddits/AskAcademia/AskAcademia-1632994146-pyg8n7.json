A professor?\n\nTo answer: Probably fine; probably fine but if everyone uses slack that would be better; I would suggest you all use slack; facebook would be a bit weird at this point; honestly if you're faculty you wouldn't be asking this here.",

Slack is both a professional tool but has a social slant to it, so it toes the line slightly better.\n\nThat being said, I'm not currently a PhD student; if you go to r/GradSchool and ask this you might get a better level of response from current grad students who might feel differently to me.",

Or if people have another tool they use that is similar to slack then use that. But I've already given my reasons for why facebook might not be ideal.",
