It was definitely faster than Matlab in all the comparisons I ran, but I was already fluent in Fortran at that point and didn't see the point in switching.\n\nThe biggest drawback to Fortran is the lack of built-in routines, so I have had to code up a lot of things myself (or adapt other people's code) over the years.  Time associated with program development can be substantially minimized with a good text editor -- I use Sublime Text and have written snippets that help with variable declaration and that sort of thing -- and heavy usage of input-output commands.  I do sometimes wish I could copy/paste stuff into a console, though!

Think of a flexible plastic ruler, and imagine holding it firmly against the board at a 45 degree angle (roughly) and then applying a force at like a 40 degree angle. If you keep the force insufficient to overcome friction, the ruler will bend a little and then at some point flick away from the board. It's a similar sort of motion when you speed it up.",

Depending on where you lived (mainly in Europe), your age, gender and social status, I could tell you your possible life expectancy, diseases you were likely to contract, your diet and stature, and occupation (which in turn could tell me what kind of occupational-related injuries or degenerative changes you could develop).",

Meaning the old cemetery is 5 feet under the current street/ground. \nSo yes, most times we just estimate age at death from their bones, and teeth. Bone development can provide you with an age range like (20-25). Teeth are great to estimate age of juveniles. You can also estimate sex as long as they\u2019ve gone through puberty. It\u2019s very difficult to estimate sex on non-adults (adolescents and children) as their bones haven\u2019t developed their sexual dimorphic traits yet.",

E.g the pelvis can both tell you the age and sex of an adult skeleton. The maximum length of the femur or the talus (foot bone that articulates with the tibia) can also tell you the biological sex, but you need to apply a method specific for that population (I.e you can\u2019t apply a method developed from people from Scandinavian countries to a population from the Iberian peninsula)",

The problem is to estimate with certainty that said person had this injuries/skeletal changes due to being a sailor or carpenter for example , as some changes can be the result of bearing heavy loads especially from a young age (that will often result in spinal degeneration) but you can\u2019t say for sure they had this particular occupation. But there are some cases where you can get pretty close. I\u2019ll give you the example of the men of the Mary Rose, a Tudor ship that sank in the 16th century, with most of the crew inside. If you\u2019re interested here\u2019s a video about it that explains quite well how they were able to know if some men were archers, marines or sailors https://youtu.be/v-4qXi8kXTs",
