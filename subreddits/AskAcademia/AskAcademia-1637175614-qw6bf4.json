  "text": "Hi all,\n\nNewbie, first book author here. I work on youth cultures and children's literature. I have seen that the *University Press of Mississippi* (UPM) publishes many books in my area (children's literature and dozens of books on it!). Is this a good press? I have seen legit scholars publish books with them. But sometimes, smart academics also have a few publications with the likes of Cambridge Scholars. No offense, but I'd want something decent for tenure (and unfortunately my department has no scholars in my area). If you have any experience with this press, or if you are broadly in literature/cultural studies/children's literature, I'd really appreciate you weighing in.",
