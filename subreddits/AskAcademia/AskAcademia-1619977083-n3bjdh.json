  "text": "I know this may not be the place for this discussion given the heavily academia-focused nature of this sub, but I know there must be others wondering the same thing\n\nTL;DR - What non-academic research career tracks and professions do you consider (or have first-hand experience in) having a 9-to-5 work schedule, or one that cannot be described as \u201calways-on\u201d and why? Less asking for advice, more trying to measure the perception of dedication and lifestyle balance for tenure-track academia compared to other career routes. \n\n\u2014\u2014longer version with more details below\u2014\u2014\n\nI am a small liberal arts college-educated, Ivy League PhD in biochemistry/biophysics, funded by NSF GRFP in grad school. Currently a postdoctoral fellow in a HHMI-funded lab.\n\nMy wet lab research is exciting and stimulating. My PI is both an excellent academic mentor yet duly recognizes the humanity of our lab members and accommodates our needs (especially during COVID). My lab mates are supportive and collaborative. None of the typical structural issues that affect grad students / young STEM professionals apply, I believe. \n\nTherefore, you might be asking why I am considering leaving academia after all this time and good fortune to be in an excellent lab environment. \n\nAfter a year in my postdoc lab, I\u2019ve realized that perhaps the academic research environment requires too large a proportion of my head space and cognitive effort, and my mental health is deteriorating. \n\nMaybe it has been pandemic-related, or maybe I convinced myself that the postdoc experience would be much different from the graduate research experience... but so far, my postdoctoral research has taken a great toll on my mental health and self-worth as a scientist. \n\n- Constantly trying to come up with new groundbreaking ideas to literally create new knowledge. \n- Thinking of experiments only to have them criticized by peers or already done by labs that have much greater talent/capacity. \n- The sheer loneliness of putting a Herculean amount of effort into an experiment that is only understood and considered worthy/interesting by a few dozen people in the world. \n- Cultural laser focus on the achievements of a singular individual (\u201cstarting my own lab as a PI\u201d vs \u201cfounding a research group\u201d), when we all know that great science nowadays is done in teams\n\nIt\u2019s utterly draining, and I want to consider other career avenues. Ones that do not have me dreaming up experiments while cooking dinner. Ones where the impact on people is immediate, tangible, and gratifying. Ones that do not incentivize emailing with my PI about projects at 3am because he is so taken with his half-formed hypothesis. Ones where grant writing cannot be considered a weekend hobby. And ones where the team, the collaborative, is more valued than the singular genius.\n\nAfter college, I taught private high school (physics and chemistry) for two years. It was one of the most challenging yet satisfying occupations I have encountered. Your hypothesis is almost always the same: \u201cif I explain a concept in X way, maybe student A will understand Z concept.\u201d The results of the experiment are usually immediate: the student expresses comprehension, or not, or something in between. You can try a new \u201cexperiment\u201d right after, instead of taking a week to clone five constructs and testing it a month later. You are always working in collaboration with your students, and success is, by definition, shared. \n\nThis thought process\u2014applying the scientific method to other professions like teaching\u2014inspired in me a great desire to learn more about other careers where the same \u201cmuscles\u201d are employed, but the culture and atmosphere of the always-on academic is nowhere to be found. \n\nSo therefore I\u2019m asking: What professions would you consider to have the quality of \u201cleaving your work at work,\u201d but which are still in the broad field of biology and STEM, suitable for MS or PhD-holding individuals? \n\n**As mentioned at the top, I am much less looking for advice, nor do I want to be persuaded that the preceding qualities are untrue of all academic environments. I know that. But the same narrative has been a key part of the self-perpetuating academic bubble, so I would greatly appreciate perspectives outside of the #NotAllLabs variety. \n\nCareers I\u2019m curious about, just to name a few, are:\n- teaching-focused academic positions (HS to grad)\n- academic administration (Dean-type positions)\n- biotech or pharma\n- publishing\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and consider",

It\u2019s not for everyone, some people like doing \u201cgroundbreaking basic research\u201d that\u2019s not what government labs do (with the exception of the DOE) AFRL, ARL, NRL, for example, all work on \u201cadvanced science\u201d- using basic research methods and applying them to real world problems. \n\nI like it a lot. Coming from academic labs it was a big shift. No panicking about deadlines, no panicking when I tell my project manager something is working, and not even being allowed to work more than 40 hours a week. It\u2019s beautiful. It is not for everyone though, working for the government is very slow, and sometimes people are morally against it.\n\nWorking at AFRL, NRL, ARL you are offered competitive pay (compared to the rest of the government) and good benefits. I do not think of work ever outside of work. You can stay technical with an MS or PhD or you could go into project management if that\u2019s more your style.",

I was kind of forced into it however when the pandemic hit and academic jobs were very difficult to come by. Now I work as a contact employee for a state government.\n\nI enjoy it a lot. I have deadlines but my boss is understanding of setbacks. I get paid well. Although I am not doing my own research, I am contributing to wildlife conservation. But the best perk for me so far has been the respect I feel from my superiors and colleagues. There is no undertone of competition, I feel appreciated, and my time doesn't feel constantly wasted. That has been mind blowing to me, coming from a decently hostile lab in my undergrad and masters program.\n\nI am considering moving away from academia and sticking to government work. Have you found that these programs have a similar air of respect and collaboration, or did I just get lucky with this job?",

I was opposed for the same reasons you mentioned. \n\nI actually feel very lucky since I get to collaborate with all sorts of people (mentoring undergraduates, working with Master\u2019s researchers at nearby universities, contractors in the private sector, PhD students and people who have doctoral degrees)\n\nObviously being with the government things can get a little political about funding for projects and things like that. But for the most part I have extremely supportive colleagues and I feel very satisfied at my work.\n\nAdditionally, there is amazing job security in working for the government. The government puts a lot of work, time, and money into the hiring process. So once you\u2019re in you\u2019re usually in for life as long as you don\u2019t screw up horrendously.

Policy, technical writing, various aspects of federal funding, regulatory affairs, political advisors, business/industry liaisons, consulting, lobbyist groups etc. Finding these jobs and understanding what you're in for before you start is the hard part. Also it helps if you're willing to bounce around between gigs before landing the position you really want. Generally it's a lot easier to get into FDA than the NIH. Even at NIH, some institutes are easier to break into from the outside than others. There's also NSF, USDA, Military, the VA and of course the hundreds of contracting companies that support them all. \n\nFor the most part it's a 9-5 culture, unless you're in a position where you're the person that has to answer questions from congress. I'm a program officer. I spend my days on the phone talking to PIs about their research, reading proposals and reports, and sending way too many emails. I still keep up with the literature and attend scientific conferences. I'm surrounded by similarly-minded PhD scientists, and generally everyone takes pride in what we do but also is willing to leave work at work.",

Sometimes people in these kinds of roles include contractors who aren't government employees, and those jobs are advertised on the usual places like Linkedin and Indeed.\n\nI don't know much about NSF specficially, but if you're interested in government positions that involve communicating with congress that's often science policy positions (Health Science Policy Analyst is a title I've seen), as well as more senior roles at any of the places I listed above. There are also science advocacy organizations and non profits like FASEB you could look into. AAAS fellowships are a fantastic way to get started in this kind of career.",

You might be able to start informally discussing a position in advance, but that's going to be very agency-specific (I've seen ARL and NRL do this). It's definitely worth making a USAjobs account and starting to build your resume, which will look a lot different than resumes you will use in the private sector. The interview and hiring process also takes several (4-6) months in my experience.\n\nApplying for jobs with federal contractors is essentially like applying anywhere else in the private sector.

      "text": "There are many, many of these kinds of jobs, and even whether a particular role is that way or not depends a lot on the company and even the team. For example, I'm a UX researcher, which is relatively close to a nine-to-five job where I work - and many other places - but could be \"always on\" at some kinds of companies, or have periods of time where they are (like \"crunch\").\n\nI left academia for similar reasons that you did plus more (greater control and flexibility over where I lived, a better work-life balance, and more direct impact on people or things). I ended up going into UX research at a large technology company, where I conduct research studies with our users (and potential users) to improve the user experience of our products and services. Most tech companies and lots of consumer product companies in general have roles like mine. I work a 40-50 hour week, make great money, and really love to see the effects of my work on the products we make - especially because millions of people use and benefit from those effects. It's also very collaborative work.\n\nI still dream up experiments while cooking dinner. The difference is I CHOOSE to do that because I love my job so much, and the work is so fascinating, that I find myself working through a problem when I'm doing something that doesn't require my full brain. It feels really different, though, because there are no consequences if I don't work it out right that moment, and I can always choose to say \"hey, I don't wanna think about that right now.\"\n\nI'd encourage you to think outside of \"biology and STEM\", or at least expand what that means to you - as there are lots of jobs that can use the skillset of a PhD but aren't direct biomedical/biotechnological research.",

It will be easier to manage expectations and improve work life balance but you will have to make some changes to your mindset  to make that happen no matter which job you take.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI already see some good suggestions so in this thread on careers so I'll share a different perspective. I know you are not looking for advice so let me share my experience more as a cautionary tale. \"Always-on\" is in particularly endemic in academia, but many *intellectually-stimulating-9-to-5s* have similar issues. \n\nI left academia 3 years ago for a data science role due to reasons very similar to ones you mentioned. Things are a lot better in terms of mental health and work-life balance now but when I first made that switch some of the issues I was trying to fix, did not just go away. \n\n* I still had to deal with imposter syndrome\n* The feedback cycles were months instead of years but still \"success\" took a while\n* Still had to make sure I stood out among peers and felt the stress of breaking new ground constantly\n\nWhat really helped me move the needle on my mental health was lots of therapy where I'm still working through:\n\n* Giving less of a shit about how others see me and external metrics of evaluation like grants, awards, etc\n* Lower the bar for \"success\" and see it in what I do everyday  (e.g. consider making a plot a win too instead of just grants/publication)\n* See critiques and mistakes as learning opportunities (like, really) instead of personal failures\n* Knowing in my heart I am enough and I can always walk away and be ok\n\nLooking back, I probably would have enjoyed my time (and maybe even achieved more) in academia more if I treated it like a 9-to-5. I should have kept regular hours even if I had all the freedom to work whenever which ended up being working odd hours and all hours. Not carrying piles of unread papers and all the \"should also be doing X\". Treat weekends as off days or at least set a boundary on how many weekends in 3 months is acceptable (many 9-to5s also have crunch periods where you might have to work weekends). Don't check email or reply at 3AM. You may not be able to do any of this because let's face it PIs have a lot more power and leverage than the average manager - I can leave my current job and get a similar/better job in weeks but it's not that easy in academia. However, a large part of \"perception of dedication and lifestyle balance\" is in your control. See how far you can 9-to5ify your current job and even if it doesn't work at least it will help you practice this skill for whichever job you end up in in the future where you have more leverage to impose this.",

      "text": "A niche area not a lot of people know about is Clinical Chemistry. Look for a COMACC-accredited program. They are generally 2 years, pay around $50k and then you sit for boards at the end of the program. Once board certified you can be a clinical laboratory director. If you\u2019re willing do 2 more years of \u201cschool\u201d it\u2019s a very lucrative career choice.",

      "text": "I just started working as a biomedical writer, which is (mostly) 9-5! I work for a medical communications company that helps create content for pharmaceutical companies to use to educate health care practitioners and patients on various disease states and drugs. I got my PhD in molecular and cellular biology (my research was in immunology) in Dec 2020, and began working with my current company in Jan 2021. I love that I get to use my analytical skills from graduate school to assess research papers and then translate them for a broad audience. And from what I\u2019ve seen, many companies right now are hiring people to work from home, so you can generally work from anywhere that is convenient for you! I knew I did not want to continue in academia after grad school precisely because I have a ton of anxiety and couldn\u2019t  just leave my work in the lab. Since starting this job, I\u2019ve felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders, and honestly, I couldn\u2019t be happier!",

      "text": "I'm in early R&D in big pharma. It's mostly \"9 to 5\" but can become more when approaching certain deadlines or a whole bunch of samples from a large/important study come in. From what I've seen, the people that work the most do it to themselves. We are also encouraged to use our vacation time, which has actually been kind of a struggle (how do I use vacation when I can't go anywhere and being at home even more is kind of boring?).\n\nSome days I work less than 9 to 5. Some days I work more. I am definitely NOT working 10 hours a day 5 days a week physically in the lab with more hours at home in the evening and half a day to a whole day on the weekends like I was during my PhD.",
