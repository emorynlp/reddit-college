If you look at any given university department I guarantee you'll find people who either did their UG and PhD in the same place (possibly even the same place they're now working) or who basically circulated through a very small network. It's a common trope that you have to move about but the reality is no one on a hiring committee is going to say \"10 first author publications, an NSF grant and a really interesting research proposal but they did their PhD and UG at the same place so out they go\". \n\nGetting a tenure track position is pretty much a lottery. Set yourself up for the best chance of success by going where you think you'll flourish (and that includes having a happy personal life). If staying in the same place as your UG is where you think you can do your best PhD, stay there. No one will say \"well they have a run of the road publication record but look they moved university for their PhD!\".",

This isn't 1950 anymore, I can click on a button and start a videoconference with people on the other side of the planet (if they're not asleep!). Academic inbreeding is only an issue if you let it become one. \n\nThat being said I do encourage people to do their PhD somewhere else but that's only because it's fun to discover a new city/country.\n\n> So the direct question is, what were you told about academia when entering grad school?

My idea of academia before that however was shaped by movies like Good Will Hunting and TV shows like Community. Little did I know how accurate those portrayals could be at times!",

You pick it up as you go.\n\nHonestly; find the Phd/PostDocs in your PI's lab that have Golden Boy/Girl status. They'll set you straight on what you actually need to know about academia.",

Most applications for funding in my field have to be completed almost a year in advance, if not more eg. a major funding source in my country has applications due in November, you receive a decision in July, and you don't start receiving the money until October. She might not know yet if she's able to fund a project for next fall. \n\nI expect she's just being honest that she doesn't have anything for you to do and that it's not personal.

I\u2019m an international student majoring in Biology (3.9/4.0 GPA). I attend a regional college in New Jersey (FDU) and this is my third year in college but I only have 10 credits left to complete my Bio program. On one side, I want to graduate and get a Master\u2019s in pharmaceutical biochemistry but I\u2019ve recently learned more and more about the area of bioinformatics and computational biology and I find it deeply fascinating. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I have the option to get a second BS in computer science and complete it in 1 year and my school also offers the option of doing an accelerated MS program in Biology. Theoretically, I would be able to complete my MS in biology and simultaneously complete my second BS in Computer Science. I\u2019m not particularly worried about the rigor of the programs or the time management because I know 100% I can do it. I have a significant scholarship too so I almost don\u2019t pay anything for college and that won\u2019t end until I finish all my coursework. \n\nThe other option I have is going to a better college and complete my master\u2019s only. I feel like I\u2019m not fully ready to do a PhD or something else because I\u2019m clearly not sure of my path in life yet. I\u2019ve always imagined myself working in the biomedical field and I\u2019d love to discover new drugs. However, I\u2019m still not sure of how I want to do that. The pandemic has definitely affected my college experience since everything was online for almost 2 years and many of the practical classes were lost. \n\nPlease let me know what you think and what you\u2019d do in my case. \n\n\nThank you.",

PhD is sometimes better than masters (more likely to be funded but longer and might be unnecessary depending on the type of job you want). \n\nI'd look for schools/programs that are biomedical engineering or bioengineering with both the biology and computational side of things that you want. I think a masters in bio with a second undergrad in comp sci isn't going to give you the combined bioinformatics tools that you need.  \n\nI'd take some time and reflect on your career options. What interests you, what internships/lab experiences have you had and what did you like or not like with each. Lookup job ads for the jobs you might one day take, do they require masters or just the bachelors? What doors does the masters open for you? Do you think you'd be happy sitting at a desk all day coding or do you think you'd want to be more biology wet lab hands on? If your interested in drug design that's definitely industry, so go see what drug companies websites say about careers, what jobs are entry level and what are the requirements. If you haven't had internship or experience I'd strongly recommend seeing if you can do any of those with the time you have left.

Especially if programs are funded, or have limited spaces, they want to ensure that the people they accept are the best and the brightest and will most positively contribute to their program. \n\nNot every program/institution looks at GPA alone, but many do because it's an assessment of academic ability. Graduate school is not undergrad 2.0. It is more difficult. It requires more self-discipline, often comes with a significantly higher workload and often more rigorous academic demands. A student who is unable to keep up with the demands of undergrad is unlikely to be successful in graduate school. A GPA below 2.0 at my institution places you on academic probation. Being relatively close to that threshold can be a warning sign to a department that you are not adequately prepared. \n\nOf course, some institutions allow you to compensate for a low GPA by having other stellar aspects of your application. Not everyone views GPA as an accurate metric.",
