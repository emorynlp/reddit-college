  "title:": "Inappropriate to ask professor for another research opportunity?",
  "text": "Let me just start by saying I'm an undergraduate physics major. I have a physics professor who I have a really good relationship with. I showed so much interest in his class that a few months ago he actually offered me the opportunity to do research with him on a certain topic that I was particularly taken with. We finished our research the other week and typed it up for publication.\n\nNow that it's over, I'm feeling kind of sad. I appreciate the opportunity so much and absolutely loved working with him (it was a dream come true since I look up to him so much as a physicist). I'm wondering if it would be rude to ask him if he would be willing to do more research with me in the future (in the coming months or next year)? I don't want him to think that I'm trying to use him or that I think he's some type of machine who is just here to do research with me. I just loved working with him so much.\n\nI understand he didn't even have to give me this opportunity and I just want to make it clear that I don't feel entitled. When I say I appreciate his gesture I mean it with all my being. This is why I'm wondering if it wouldn't be right to ask him that. Or is there a way to bring it up to him without sounding like I'm using him or that I am unappreciative of the amazing thing he already did for me?",

Usually it is not a chore for the professor. And it also provides professional benefits for them, and is part of their job. You should definitely tell your professor how you feel and that you'd like to start a new project together. Even better if you can pitch some ideas.",

Take some initiative and ask him about what else can be done in the field (with him or even independently), even start asking about Graduate school and whether that may be a route for you to go.  \n\n\n\\*Note: I'm 100% in that pyramid, with my Master's finishing this week, and starting a PhD in the fall.

While the prof is giving you research work that will help your career, they are getting a highly skilled worker producing highly skilled labour for essentially peanuts and 'exposure' (assuming you get a PhD with them).   \nYou aren't entitled to their time or the research work they may give you, but it isn't an imbalanced relationship.",
