  "text": " \n\nI am a sophomore-to-be from a Tier 1 Engineering and Science College in India. Right now, my ultimate aim in life would be to pursue Research in Physics. As our department change is based on our CGPA, my only realistic options are Integrated MSc in Physics, Aerospace Engineering, Integrated Masters in Chemical Engineering, Metallurgy,& Manufacturing Science or just stay in Chemistry. I have checked the courses and the only ones which is interesting to me apart from Physics MSc is Aerospace Engg. So I am listing my priority list(according to which we are alloted seats) as Physics-> Aerospace 4 yr -> Aerospace 5 yr. After this, what do I include if my primary focus is eventually a PhD in Physics abroad? And what should I choose between 5 yr(dual degree) and 4yr courses?\n\nmy\\_qualifications : First year at tier 1 college.",
