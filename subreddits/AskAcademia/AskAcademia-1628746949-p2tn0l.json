  "text": "I've heard it's illegal in the States for the employer to ask the age of the applicants. But I've also heard that the universities and employers can figure out the age of the applicatns by asking when they've graduated from highschool/entered the university/college. Can the university know the age of the tenure track applicants in the States? Also if the university can figure out the age of the tt track applicants, could the applicant be discriminated by age if he or she is over a certain age? I've heard there's a bit of ageism in computer science tenure track hiring process.",

However, if this is what you want to do then you have to get on and apply for those positions. You cannot guarantee you won't be discriminated against, but you can guarantee you'll never get TT position if you refuse to apply because you might get discriminated against. And it's not just academia that discriminates so if you're thinking of not doing something because you might be discriminated against you're ruling out a lot of jobs. Lastly, discrimination is often less overt than not giving someone a job, it's giving them less salary, less start up package, smaller pay rises, denying/delaying promotion, not offering opportunities etc.",

There were a couple of hundred of us there from 32 colleges and universities in our system. And the system lawyers laid out a variety of legal issues. One of the very first was to NEVER tell a faculty applicant why they didn't make the short list or were not hired. Not anything. The only thing we could say in the \"Thanks for applying but it's not going to be you\" letter is that we decided to offer the position to a different candidate but nothing about why we chose the candidate that we did. Over the years I had a number of people email and ask why they weren't hired and/or for suggestions for what they could do differently in their applications going forward. I never answered any of those questions. Perhaps the most interesting email that I got in this vein was from a 60-something newly minted PhD who had a career as a cop and then earned her criminal justice doctorate in retirement. When she interviewed for a TT position she was upfront about wanting to teach for 7 years and then retire from our college. Her doctoral advisor apparently had a nightmarish tenure application and our candidate just didn't want to mess with that. When I offered her the TT position she emailed and asked why I offered it! I figured that the lawyers certainly couldn't have any problem with answering the question for somebody we hired and so I answered her. She is great as an instructor and in my last year before I retired I convinced her to apply for tenure and keep going. She earned tenure and a promotion and is still percolating along; she has 10 years at our college now and doesn't look like she'll be retiring soon.",

What they can't do is refuse to hire you because of those attributes.\n\nAs a general rule, HR and legal departments are going to say that under no circumstances should you be asking either. Not because asking is illegal, but because most people you interview, you're not going to hire, and your lawyers would rather the interview not look like, \n\n> You: \"Hey, do you happen to be black?\" \n> \n> Them: \"Why, yes I am\". \n> \n> You: \"Interesting.

Instead it says they \u201crecommend you avoid\u201d them, because they could be used to discriminate or taken as evidence of discriminatory intent. Nowhere does it say it is illegal to ask.",

Considering transfer students from community colleges usually take 1 more year to graduate, I'd be 30 when I graduate from 4 year university. I want to apply for ML phd programs and I'm worried that my age and lack of relevant experience might be a serious problem in academic career. I have been a basement dweller for 4 years and only experiences I have are serving in the Korean military and attending medical school for 1 year.(I am from S. Korea and I had to serve in the military because of the conscription)",
