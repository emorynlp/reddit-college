  "text": "I\u2019m in Canada and Ill be applying for PhD public health sciences/epidemiology in the US. I have 2 third author publications, a few years as an unpaid research assistant for a med student, and a summer of paid research working in a professors lab. But if I want to get into a great school, will my application be seriously considered if I don\u2019t have a masters? I know it\u2019s not required but I\u2019m trying to get an understanding of my chances.",

      "text": "While I am not in epidemiology, I would say that it is not a waste of time. The vast majority of people that I know from my program (biomedical science) did not have a masters. However, if you want to get into an ivy league program, then you might need to get one to really stand out (assuming you do really well), but I would still apply without and see what happens.",
