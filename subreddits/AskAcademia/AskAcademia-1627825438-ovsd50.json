  "text": "Do you know whether publishers such Elsevier, ACS or others offer a Ph.D. positions for a guest editor of papers in a sense of finalizing (formal and graphical corrections, final look before publishing, and collecting volume etc.) the papers that can be done remotely?\n\nI went through some opportunities and all seemed to require presence in person in the workplace.",

      "text": "A \"guest editor\" would normally be a recognised academic who has solicited articles around a chosen topic and is managing the review process for the corresponding submissions (usually for \"free\"). What you describe sounds more like a copy editor / managing editor who is processing articles after they are accepted. I'm not aware that a PhD is needed for such a role, but I don't know much about the back end of this process.",

          "text": "Copyeditors are often remote (when journals still have copyeditors, which plenty of legit journals no longer do), often subcontracted freelancers, and often poorly paid. They do not need PhDs. \n\nIn-house principal or managing editors often do have subject-area PhDs, but I'm not sure how many of those positions allow full remote work with zero office time. I think a lot of things are shifting in publishing after the last couple years and that might be worth asking about - but these positions may still require one to be a resident of a particular country for hiring reasons. These positions will be posted as regular jobs.\n\nA fair number of PhDs have set themselves up as full-time professional developmental/copy editors who work directly with authors. With the right set of regular clients, this can be a decent living, and it's more interesting editing work, but it has all the usual upsides and downsides of self-employment.",

      "text": "In academic publishing \"editor\" has several meanings.  I am an Editor, which means I oversee manuscript submissions, arrange the review process, and ultimately decide the fate of the manuscript.  I certainly do not get involve in anything like final checks and language editing.  That would be copy editors.  By and large, they are a thing of the past.  Now we get the proofs and do our own copy editing on line.  Most journals do not do anything to the manuscript, just format set it.  Some journals do give it a quick go over (interestingly, MDPI do a moderate job of copy editing).  Very, very few journals do a proper language and style edit.  Mostly at the high end. Those journals also often have professional editors, usually with a PhD who are employed full time, but they focus more on the policy/acquisitions, and are not involved in language editing.\n\nWhat you describe is a copy editor (not a \"guest editor\").  As noted, this is increasingly rare.  I see no reason why this needs to be done on site, as most of the work is on line.  But my impression is this is mostly sourced out to India.",
