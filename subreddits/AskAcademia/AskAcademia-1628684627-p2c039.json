  "text": "So, im finishing off my PhD. I'm leaving towards going back to industry simply because I hate the toxic side of academia/ felt extremely unappreciated by my new PI.\n\nI've been sending out my CV/ portfolio and was getting some pretty awesome replies. An add came up for a company that looked really interesting to me, so I sent my portfolio on Sunday. \n\nOn Monday I spent the entire day at the lab -finishing off so I didn't check my mail all day. The company I applied to replied saying they really liked my work and asked if I was available for an interview the next morning. I replied in the late afternoon (4pm), first apologizing for taking so long to reply - I had not checked my mail all day, and that if they were still available I'd love an interview.\n\nThey replied the next day, with quite a rude attitude , saying that I was wrong and should have replied faster. Now they're not sure when they will fit me in. Maybe I'm over thinking this but I already got the feeling of being stressed out , just not replying to an email ASAP because I was genuinely busy doing other work / without access to my laptop. Other companies I applied to were way more familiar and friendly - though the work/ location wasn't as nice as this place \n\n\nI'm tempted to just cross this place off my potential places to work - is it wrong if I take the interview simply for an ego-boost/ try get a feel for how useful I am in the industry  , I don't think I would want to work there if it already feels stressful",

      "text": "It's not wrong at all, by all means take advantage of the interview they're offering.  For you it represents practice and field research in this regard.  Their HR people will need to demonstrate that they've interviewed X number of qualified candidates to satisfy corporate policy anyway.\n\nShould they fail to sway you during the proceedings, that's on them.  If they can't work out that their poor communications etiquette made that an uphill climb for them from the start, that's likewise on them.  You aren't their employee, you absolutely did not owe them an immediate reply.  They're presuming an obligation and leverage, and demanding that you tacitly accede to it before any offer has even been made.\n\nWhich brings up an important point about the corporate world - while academia can be toxic, the corporate world...well, it tends to frame surviving routinized passive toxicity as its pinnacle virtue.\n\nOne element of that is the level of entitlement employers like this have.  They're not entering into a business arrangement with another party providing a needed skillset they lack.  They've nothing to prove to the likes of *you*.  They're benevolently granting you the exceptional - and undeserved - gift of some of *their* money.  A gift they will rescind should you displease them.  A 'gift' which in reality is a fraction of the wealth you would generate for them, otherwise they wouldn't bother.  And had you not been the most appealing (ie. likely to produce) candidate on the market, that's who they would have hired in the first place.\n\nI don't mean to say anyone should walk in with a sense of entitlement, or inflate their self worth before they've learned an industry by working in it, or maintain a defiant attitude towards structure.\n\nIt's just that if you can't tell, I was deeply soured by my experience in the corporate world.  I found the principles it operates by utterly dehumanizing, and some of the characters I encountered exceeded any stereotypes I'd absorbed from media.  It made me work like crazy to get into grad school.",

That place sounds like they are super desperate to get literally anyone  who slightly meets their requirements. \n\nMy guess is at the interview you'll be hit with lines like:\n\n\"We're a big family here\"\n\n\"Everyone here gives 100% and more\"\n\n\"Here at our company, we are always for our employees and give everything to them\"",
