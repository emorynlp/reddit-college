  "text": "I am writing an application for an assistant professorship in the social sciences at an R1 and working on my research statement. I have a section about the main theoretical framework I use, but it's hard to describe it without including a diagram. Is it ok to make a diagram of the framework to include in the statement? This is a framework identified by a well-known author, so it would not be original work (I would of course cite everything)",

I would be more concerned about including something so complex in a research statement that it needs a figure to be explained. Research statements usually need to be broad enough so everyone in the department can follow along (more or less).",

I don't think framework itself is not that complex, it's just that it's not intuitive to understand from written description - the framework figure is essentially three boxes of generalized concepts feeding into another box and arrows between the three boxes showing how they connect.",

I have also seen Venn diagrams showing how the researcher is doing work at the intersection of 2 fields, for instance-- e.g., paper A and B belong to field 1, paper C and D belong to field 2, and paper E belongs to both. This can help show a \"coherent\" research agenda for people whose work spans multiple fields.",
