  "title:": "Seeking suggestions for polite refusal",
  "text": "How to politely refuse working on a manuscript with your previous supervisor? He has been asking me to take the lead and already asking possible meeting times to schedule a catchup. \n\nReason to avoid him is their assertive and inconsistent work pattern which somewhat leads to borderline grey area of ethics too.\n\nI completed masters under his supervision a couple years ago.  Finishing off manuscript for publication from my masters research data was a nightmare itself and took a toll on mental health. \n\nI am not in the same country anymore. I do not plan to do PhD in near future, but if I decide to pursue PhD later, could this refusal affect my admission?\n\nPlease advise.",

      "text": "This is an easy one. Simply say that you appreciate his offer to take the lead on the manuscript but that you have very limited available time and that you cannot commit to this task. Better to say no than to not finish a task you committed to.\n\nOf course, a problem that may arise is that if you ask him a recommendation letter when applying to a PhD program. It is possible that, depending on his character, he refuses to do so. So, you will need to secure other recommendation letters, if possible.\n\nEdit. Minor typos.",
