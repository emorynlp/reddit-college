  "title:": "My father passed away during the last year of my PhD abroad, how to keep my motivation up and make it through to the end?",
  "text": "The title says it all, really. I admittedly came here to vent a little bit, but mainly to look for some advice, either from anyone who has gone through something similar or from those with general advice for getting through really rough times during a PhD.\n\nA little bit more about me and my situation:\n\nI am doing a PhD abroad, several thousands of kilometers from home, and my deadline to defend my thesis is in less than six months from now. My father passed away a few months ago and, though he had been ill for some time, it was rather unexpected. I quickly flew home and stayed for a few weeks before coming back to work. Since I've been back at work, I've been a complete mess and my motivation has just been hanging by a thread. I am constantly homesick and still grieving a lot. I can become very emotional at unpredictable times. It's very hard to concentrate. Additionally, I'm feeling more isolated than ever, as many friends have moved away recently and I don't speak my host country's language very well.\n\nWhile I would like to take a break (technically possible for up to one year, I believe), it would be complicated. For one, it would involve a visa extension, which would be tricky and expensive. I'm on a tight budget, especially after flying home on a moment's notice those few months ago, so I can't really spend a lot in general, let alone visa fees or extra airfare right now. Lastly, my mum is strongly encouraging me to stay and finish since I am so close to the end. She wants to see me finish my dream and she's worried that something could get in the way of me finishing if I were to take a break. I agree with her and finishing on time is probably my best option.\n\nOverall I've been very content with how my PhD has gone and I'm not behind schedule, even after taking almost a whole month away from work. Before my father passed away, I was already feeling a bit of the normal stress and pressure of a PhD student in their final year, but I was extremely motivated and I could handle virtually anything that came at me. But now I just feel so different... like I am suffocating. Dreading the next day, the next task, the next meeting, etc. Each day I feel the motivation draining away more and more and the growing feeling that an inevitable burnout is coming.\n\nHow can I survive or maybe even try to thrive during these last months? How can I find my motivation again? What are some ways to handle the grief and intense homesickness at the same time as the PhD? For anyone who has faced similar circumstances to any of the above, what helped you the most?\n\nThanks for any and all advice :)",

      "text": "Try talking to someone before making a decision. You don't have to fight the emotion in order to push through your degree - the degree is tough enough on its own. Your university must have grief counselors and therapists as part of their health services. Talk to them, or someone you are close to. It will likely take multiple sessions but it is worth it. They will help with what is causing the dread. All the best; you can get through this :)",

      "text": "A couple of things. First, it sucks losing your father and will continue to suck for a long time. Someone on Reddit said it better: its like being in the ocean during a storm. At first. You can just keep from drowning, but eventually, the waves get smaller and it becomes easier to keep above the waves. What I know is this, eventually, thinking of him will bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes. \n\nAs for the motivation, the only thing I can suggest is don't quit now. It will be much harder to get back into the swing of things if you take time off (It took me more than a decade to get motivated to finish my degree). I'm also willing to bet that your father would not have wanted to be the cause of you not finishing your degree. Mine was thrilled when he found out I was going back to finish before he died. Push thru that degree and share the diploma with him when you visit his grave.",

      "text": "I am studying abroad as well and my father passed away last year (in my 2nd year of phd). I would say that my father was one of the reasons why I chose to pursue my Phd. I used to discuss these things with my father about how to make the next move (my career and stuff, since he was slightly related to my field). After he passed away I didn't know what I was doing and for whom? Why was I in a foreign land with no friends and family? Is my life even worth it anymore?\n\nWhile I am still in a similar situation as you are, in the end, these thoughts don't matter. What I did was to make list of the things that I can do right now? Griefing all day won't help me move forward in my life. I started making small objectives to do in a day. Maybe write an abstract or just a line of my paper. \n\nAlso, get someone to talk to. Your supervisor or co-worker or other friends not just about your work but your life in general. I don't know if any of these make sense since I am in the same boat as you are in and still trying to figure out who I am.\n\nEdit: a word",

Having a good therapist was extremely important to helping me develop strategies to just get through the slog. I was also not progressing as fast as I wanted in my PhD and my lab turned incredibly toxic in my last two years, I got through this and you can, too. \n\nPeople in my cohort also had a really tough time empathizing with my loss and I empathize with the isolation you\u2019re feeling. Often they don\u2019t know what to say and then say nothing. It sucks. \n\nHappy to chat more, but resource all you can with your university, too and explore your options.",

I think you should definitely take a break from your PhD, even if it's just for a couple of weeks. It would allow you to begin dealing with it enough so that you can continue working well.",

But my grandparents used to be my primary caretakers for most of my childhood, and my grandpa died a few months before the end of my thesis MSc, and this is how I looked at the situation.
