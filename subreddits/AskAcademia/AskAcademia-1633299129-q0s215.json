  "title:": "What to do about a situation where my professor wrote a negative letter of rec for grad school?",
  "text": "I am in the US, and applying to graduate school. I was a research assistant for this particular professor and ran a club that she was the advisor to. I did not struggle in her class or other class revolving the program I am going into. I asked her well beforehand to write me a letter and she claimed \"it would be an honor\". \n\nShe submitted it, I had my interview and it came up that she said in the letter that I would not be a suitable candidate for the program. Her points in the letter claimed \"that the club struggled under my leadership\" and my research \"was not adequate and not helpful\". She never gave any inclination that this was the case, so I am stunned that she is saying these things.\n\nWhat can I do about this? She lied to me, and could impact my future. What course of action do I take? I'm at a loss of words here.",

          "text": "I'm glad this is the first answer because it is one of the few reasonable ones on this thread. OP, burning bridges feels amazing but is not going to serve you well when that person is likely more connected than you are, and can probably justify themselves to their peers using all sort of mental acrobatics. It might for example be a cultural thing - a lot of cultures discourage direct confrontation.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do is:\n\n* [definitely] Find a better person to be a reference and immediately stop using her. \n\n* [definitely] Warn your friends who may be asking references from her\n\n* [maybe] Book a meeting to discuss this with her. At the very least you'll want to hear this kind of criticism directly, e.g. why does she think your research was not adequate. \n\n* [maybe] If you have an academic you trust who also knows her, then ask them for advice because it might be a recurring issue",

I know certain topics, I can easily fall into speaking habits. This might be a topic that\u2019s easy to feel personally attacked and let that shine through.

As others have said, any competent letter writer in the US academic system understands that a letter should be positive, or not written at all. That's why it's called a letter of recommendation. Do not use this person as a reference in the future. Do let other people know that this person wrote you a bad letter rather than declining. This likely will not harm your application as much as you think.  If anything, it will hurt the writer's career when their peers see the kind of letter they write for people they should be supporting. It's of course a shitty thing to happen, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this, but it's not as serious as it probably feels right now.",

Disclaimer: this is not always the case, I\u2018ve known some lovely career researchers. However, cut-throat industry + funding-based career advancement means some academics do not have the best people-management skills. \n\nAs I said in a previous comment the difficult ones absolutely get a reputation in their department. I\u2019ve known of lab heads who were so notorious that people would grimace when they met the new PhD student. And from what I\u2019ve observed references from difficult academics are given less credence.",

It's beneath contempt; but, you also don't want to get into a pissing match with someone who is both better connected and more senior than you for the simple reason that they may retaliate. Writing a 'negative' letter of recommendation is, on the whole, an incredibly odd thing to do. It shows a serious lack of judgement and panels are generally not quick to accept them, but if she were to make accusations against OP or \"speak\" to colleagues about them, it could be far more detrimental than any negative letter. I would be very weary of giving them a piece of your mind. Talk to them, and get their side of the story, but keep it neutral and very professional.",

As a starting point, letters of recommendation are requests not rights, and typically it costs academic staff a lot of time that does not necessarily get put into their contract to write them. The professor did not \"lie through her teeth\". She agreed to write a letter of recommendation and did so. \"It would be an honor\" is a bit of a standard cliche to say. Who knows if there were other hints in the conversation that the OP didn't pick up on. We weren't there. \n\nShould the professor politely declined instead of writing a negative letter? Of course. There are a a variety of ways to do that, and I have used them, and of course she should have. That is different from saying the professor lied. \n\nAlso, let's look carefully at the facts. OP says she didn't struggle in the professor's class. Is that even a glowing endorsement by OP of her own work? Is that what you wanted the professor to write? That you, as a student, \"didn't struggle\". Does that mean that OP did struggle in other classes? Further, this looks quite sloppy to me: \"I did not struggle in her class or other class revolving the program I am going into.\" \"Revolving\"? How about: \"I did not struggle in her class nor other classes pertinent to the program I applied for.\" It sounds nit-picky, but we are talking about someone wanting to go to grad school who was a research assistant and thinks her abilities are better than her professor does...",
