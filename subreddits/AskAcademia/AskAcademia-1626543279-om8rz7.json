  "text": "Hello there,\n\nI am a masters student, currently writing her thesis (yay!). \n\nI got a topic, which is quite uncommon as a thesis  but I still found it interesting and went on. The thesis (administratively) is co-supervised by one Phd and a Professor (who I have seen a total of 2. times).\n\nBut at the start of my thesis, the formal procedure was not clearly discussed. I asked my supervisor whether I should book ALL of the modules related to the thesis, and he said yes. Logically, this led to me book a module (i.e. writing of the thesis), which I should  not have. This is the timepoint after which I have a deadline to submit. The professor was not on theese meetings.\n\nIt became clear later on that this should have been discussed with the Prof (when by accident, one of the other Phd-s sent an info sheet with the instruction not to book in the 1. Semester via email). By that time, no changes could be made to those modules.\n\n When I asked him about this, he was optimistic that it was \"doable\" and agreed to work on it during the summer. But now we are in the middle of the summer, with NO timeline. He wants to organize meetings with the rest of the researchers in this group, but now we are dealing with the problems of absece and my own slower progress and possible fail.\n\nThis creates stress, because as much as I want to progress faster, I am not and  this whole situation seems weird. \n\nEvery time when I ask what is supposed to happen, he is not being very specific. Also, I am not sure whether the leading professor has any idea what is going on. \n\nHow should I go for this? Do not get me wrong, my supervisor is an awesome person! But he is also new at the uni...",

      "text": "You said modules can't be changed, have you discussed the whole situation in detail with the responsible office? We had an office that was responsible to giving you advice about exactly these things (which modules to take when and what to do then something goes wrong). Additionally there was an office responsible for all kinds of questions for examinations.  \n\nOptions I could think of is obvious whether they can sign you out or if you can repeat the module if you fail. We were allowed to fail our master thesis exactly once, which I actually did after having a bad experience with my then-supervisor who failed me tremendously. \n\n\nSecond approach would be to bother your supervisors more, both of them. One needs to take the responsibility and organize everything. If they don't respond to emails, call them. If you can go on campus visit them personally and bring up that you need assistance NOW. If they just try to buy time bother them more and tell them it's urgent. If you fail, again, figure out who else at your University you can escalate this to, there should be different offices that handle conflicts.",

I am at an European university and I have never heard of or seen any office, which handles those things. \n\nBecause of corona, my supervisor working from another city, i.e. is not on campus. I have never even met him personaly. \n\nI still have time (the draft is to be submitted in the middle of october), and we have \"upcoming\" meetings with the rest, but he is not making anything clear.",

I'd also be extremely surprised if an European university has no Student Advisory Service.",
