  "text": "I work in a pretty well regarded lab and my boss is amazing. But there are two people in the lab who make my life miserable. They pretend not to understand what I say. I have to repeat myself 4 times and finally fake an accent to get them to understand me. Often when I am working in the actual lab (shared with all my labmates) they'll complain about how dirty it is and make me clean it. They will call my country dirty, ask me if I eat cockroaches, one of them had used a picture of a weird religious monument in my country as his backdrop in zoom and everyone in the lab laughed about it. I hate having to work with them and a project which i am leading and I depend on them is entirely stalled for two years which is very disappointing because it would barely take weeks to finish. But they refuse to listen to what I say and take part in discussions, and want me to write up the entire project which is not possible because I depend on their expertise to do that! \n\nThey both have permanent positions, and I am immigrant PhD student. The entire department hierarchy is white. And I am pretty certain based on how the two people from my lab interact with the people incharge in the department, that I would not be taken seriously if I complained to them. Like the only case where they would take an action would be if a literal hate crime was committed against me.\n\nThere is a quantifiable decrease in my output due to these people. \n\nI wonder why academia is filled with assholes.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you so much every one for the support. It is easy to think other people are being dicks to you. I can recognize when they racist/sexist to others. But if they are being rascist towards you, it is harder to come to terms with it, because then I become central. They are not just bad people, but they are being bad to me because I am different. I think recognizing people are being rascist towards you comes with a realization that you are indeed different....\n\nI am currently working in Europe, and there are strong civil rights laws. But the establishment is not \"woke\". I will mention the rascist agressions to my boss, so that at least they are aware. \n\nThe group o work in is pretty large ~40 people and I have many projects so the majority of the time the people i work with and my experience is great. Other than those two my colleagues are super supportive. So I am in a very privileged position to not have to worry about this constantly.\n\nThanks again to everyone who replied with actions I can take. I mostly wanted to get it off my chest, but I think it is worthwhile to take action. Despite being a POC immigrant I still have a lot of privileges which cushion me from some of the blowback and its my responsibility to make my work place safer/better.",

      "text": "It sounds like a number of overt and serious cases of racism are happening in your lab. Here is my advice:\n\n1. Start taking comprehensive notes about every incident, who was involved and what happened. Catalogue any evidence you can, including any applicable photos or screen captures of zoom meetings where they use potentially racist backgrounds. Remember, all acts you deem racist are relevant, big or small. Micro aggressions should also be noted. \n\n2. Determine if there are any allies in your lab, who have spoken out or refused to participate in the racist conduct, and if you feel that you can trust them ask if they can be witnesses of the events you describe.\n\n3. When you have gathered enough evidence of a pattern of conduct, make a complaint. If you feel the head of lab or department is either complicit in the conduct or would not take it seriously, go to your university's HR department. If the university does not deal with your complaint, and the fact is, racism is a systemic issue on many campuses, either consider communicating with your student union if they handle issues like this, or if you are in a country with a human rights ombudsman or commission and make a complaint there.",

One my first day in the lab they were joking about shaving a colleague's head because they didn't want her hair falling into the instrument.\n\nThank you for asking for my mental health, I have been speaking with a counselor for a while, but I haven't discussed these issues with her.

Nothing ever changes if people stay silent.\n\nYour response to the situation warms my heart. I've always felt that university HR and administration are more focused on protecting the university than advocating for the students. While there may be legal protection for filing a complaint, it doesn't take long for those are negatively affected (e.g. head of the lab, those who collaborate with the two senior staff members, the department, etc) to come up with a *different* reason to get you fired. The department or PI could, for example, suggest that there is something wrong with the OP for stalling for two years on a project (obviously some issues with basic competency?). They could, for example, complain that the OP's English is not good enough for earning a PhD degree. His/her lab could insinuate that s/he is not a team player and difficult to work with. Who will the university believe, the student who is the outsider, or the more senior staff members who likely have more allies among faculty and throughout the university? \n\nI hope one day that not only will there be more people like you, but those who feel as you do will not be afraid to speak up for those who cannot.",

Find out who is involved in diversity outreach at your college and meet with them to share your experience directly.  Your story can make their job easier without exposing you, if you seek a non-confrontational approach.  Stories like your give them targets to for change.  And share your story.  This stuff goes on so much because people never hear about it.  But when people like you take to twitter (use a fake name if you want to be protected and obscure details), the stories start to add up.  \n\nAlso definitely seek out others like you.  I know many sciences have black science groups but there has to be some for every other race out there.  These are not unique experiences and sharing them with people who understand you and where you have come from may be very valuable.  \n\nSorry to hear about this.  Like many others I hate to see this in academia.  We should be far better than this.  Know what you describe though is wrong and many of us want this filth removed from academia altogether as it goes against everything we should stand for.",

You need to document your responses as well. This info can then be brought to university HR Dept, which is where I went, or to a student liaison. There has to be a liaison/graduate student body that you can go to,and if not, have a look at the unions as they might be able to help. If nothing works there, ask a nearby PI, if you aren't sure yours will take your side. Your managers can't ignore hard evidence.
