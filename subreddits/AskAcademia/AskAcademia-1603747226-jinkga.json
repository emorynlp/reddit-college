  "text": "So I'm on a search committee for a tenure track faculty position at an SLAC, and I sat down to review applications today, and noticed a jarring change in style between the research statement and the diversity statement.  A little googling reveals the diversity statement is 100% plagiarized.\n\nNow I'm paranoid, so I start checking all of them with plagiarism checking software.  I'm on application 3, and so far they're ALL plagiarized--teaching statements to research statements to diversity statements.  WTAF?  Is it really this common?  I started wondering why you would work so hard to get a PhD only to plagiarize your job apps, and then realized they probably just plagiarized their dissertations too.\n\nAm I just experiencing a statistical phenomenon, or is academic fraud really this common?\n\nUPDATE: have now checked 16 applications.  3/16 had at least 1 document with anywhere from 1-3 pages lifted verbatim from internet sources.  Very blatant plagiarism.  I double checked it all by hand.\n\nUPDATE 2: To clarify for people who just cant quite believe this is real: by internet sources, I mean publicly available sample documents and documents posted on completely different professors' websites years ago, not internet sources belonging to the actual applicants.  I checked for all that.  And yes, someone really did copy/paste about a page of someone else's research statement.  It was a very broad and vague preamble to a research statement on a similar topic.",

Or scoring high on the software? \n\nPeople submit the exact same materials to multiple schools, so it is very likely that it could trigger the software because someone else ran it through (and those clever plagiarism companies keep all the things you scan and use them to build their databases). So, this may be no big deal. \n\nI can't really see how a research (maybe teaching) statement could be plagiarized, which makes me think this is the case. \n\nThat said, I can definitely see someone copying the diversity statement because 1) they don't think anyone will read it and 2) they don't have any particular thoughts/experience about it and just want to give the \"right\" answer. Still a bad move to copy it and grounds to throw out the app.",

      "text": "I'm not surprised with the diversity statements. \n\nI was a on a search committee last year, and we were urged to ask for them.  I thought that it was not a great idea--to me, the whole idea seems so pro-forma as to be virtually useless.  (What are you going to write--that you're against diversity???!)  Plus, I had never seen one before, as I've been tenured for awhile, and this is my first search committee in some time.  But I'm old (and white), so time to learn something new.  I talked to our Dean of Diversity, and she showed me a sample of what she thinks a good diversity statement looks like.  (I thought it was good!)  It turns out, she regularly meets with grads going on the job market, to talk about this very issue.  Cool, right? \n\nWell, of the 100 or so applications we received for the position, about 80 of the Diversity statements were almost *exactly* alike... and almost exactly like the model statement I had seen.  (!!)  Now, this is from 80 different universities. \n\nSo, it seems to me that--given how Diversity statements are very new--no one knows how to write one or what to say on one--so not only are grad students all borrowing from each other (and online), but Diversity officers (who are offering pointers to grads) are also clearly borrowing from each other (and online).  \n\nIt's a great big, happy circle.  :-) \n\nSo, let's just say I wasn't entirely impressed with the process. \n\nHOWEVER, to be balanced:   there WERE four great diversity statements I read (that taught me something new about the candidate).  Two were from candidates who were minority scholars; two were not.  \nAnd there were three candidates that we could exclude based on the heinousness of their diversity statements (and in one case, in the teaching statement as well) (brrrr.  there are some real assholes out there...)  \n\nSo, it was not as useless an exercise as I'd feared.   (but not very 'efficient' either...)\n\nAnyway, that's my $.02.  Is it plagiarism if you're just writing what you're told to write?",

Hmmm. I put one paragraph of the teaching statement into Google and found a completely different person's material for their faculty job applications which included the exact teaching statement I had in front of me verbatim. The whole packet was well designed with the same blue headings used throughout.\n\nYou might wonder how I came to this post today (I haven't joined this sub). Hiring committee again.

So long as your statement checks all the boxes and sounds right, I don't think anyone is looking at it beyond that.  However, if you have trouble coughing up this sort of thing, it points to trouble.  Not just with racism, but with being a faculty member -- just in general you're gonna need to be able to cough up a page or two without much difficulty.",
