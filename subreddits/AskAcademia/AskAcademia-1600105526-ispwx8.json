  "text": "I recently went through the end of a delightful 2 year process of applying for TT positions (90+ applications). I was lucky enough to receive and accept an offer to be a professor at an R1.\n\nSeeing as how I have this all useless knowledge in the application and negotiation process, would there be any interest in this subreddit for a guide to be written out on the entire process? Are there any particular burning questions you might have if you're a graduate student/postdoctoral fellow?",

I have not heard of an instance of a direct transition from graduate student to running a lab at an R1, but others may have. \n\n2. I applied during the weekends, but it may have cut into my \"science\" time. I cannot underscore the value in having a boss who is kind and sees value in getting their trainees to be PIs in their own right. In this regard, it may be more helpful to having an established PI mentor.\n3. The interview process sucked, especially as one of the three I had was all over Zoom (thanks, Covid!). More than anything, if you're expecting to go into an interview without having looked up the department culture and the research of the PIs you'll be meeting with, you've already set yourself up for failure.",

If you're looking to be at a high research activity R1, more likely than not you know someone who either attended the university or have given talks there or have collaborations there. Find them! Look for collaborators on papers faculty in their department has published in the past 10 years. Sometimes they won't know anything, but it's worth it for nuggets.",

Once you're on an interview, it's about your work, publication record, and how well you fit in with the department culture. So I think it's more important to do good work. The biggest danger if your school/advisor aren't as fancy is that maybe nobody will actually read your file -- technically that's not supposed to happen, but if you had 500+ applications to read for one position, would you really read them all carefully? -- but there are ways to combat that. In Math, the best way to do this is by writing good papers (not just good math, but well written also), giving lots of good talks, and attending conferences as often a possible. That's more important in the long run that who your advisor was, I think.",

      "text": "Could you talk about the importance of teaching experience?\n\nAt the moment I'm mostly just confused about it all. Based on the common consensus on Reddit, you need to have a lot of teaching experience during your PhD if you want any chance of getting a \"typical\" research position in a university, which would mean I may as well drop out of my PhD now because we don't have teaching roles in the UK so my chance of getting a job will be literally 0. Plus, we don't teach during postdocs (anywhere) because those are research positions and no one is particularly happy if you waste time teaching when you're a 100% research fellow.\n\nBut at the same time, the data from my department suggests we get 75% of graduates into permanent academic positions, many in the US. These people didn't teach during PhD, didn't teach during postdoc, and have jobs as TT faculty. When I bring up teaching opportunities, they tell me not to worry about it and not to waste time on it, which is the exact opposite message to what I get here. \n\nI can't discount the experiences of people here, but I can't discount the experiences of people from my own program either, and they just don't agree.",

If you think it's going to be an issue, your best bet would be to be open about it and contact HR directly (not the committee as that's probably outside their purview) - if they're going to do a check and it's a deal-breaker, may as well get that out of the way so as to not waste time.",
