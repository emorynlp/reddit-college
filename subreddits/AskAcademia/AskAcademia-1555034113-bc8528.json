  "text": "As many of us, I\u2019ve had imposter syndrome since I started grad school. Until my exam, I honestly thought I would fail my QE as I really didn\u2019t belong and didn\u2019t think I knew enough. I thought they would hate my proposal and rip it apart in front of me. However, after today\u2019s exam, I finally feel more confident in myself. Having a discussion about your proposed project with other researchers really does help bring things into perspective, and can be thought provoking. Having your thoughts and ideas supported by other well established researchers is something that I never thought would happen.\n\nTo everyone going through comprehensive/qualifying exams: you can do it!!! We are our own worst enemies, but believe me when I tell you that you know a lot more than you think you do! You\u2019re going to kill it!",

It's a big deal and I wish you much success on the dissertation.\n\nProtip: sometimes, passing qualification exams gets you Master's Degree, sometimes it takes passing and filling out a little extra paperwork. I always recommend that people take the extra step and fill out the paperwork to get a Master's degree along the way to the PhD (if this is automatic for you then ignore this advice).",

Don't leave with nothing.\n\nSome institution do not give a master's in passing at all. Some give it if you do the paperwork. Some give it automatically. I think there are few more important things you can do in your career than to make sure you get this master's if it is available.",
