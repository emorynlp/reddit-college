  "title:": "I hate my PhD supervisors. Is it worth even continuing?",
  "text": "Their feedback is always too broad for any real application, they're, at best, indifferent about me continuing my studies after severe extenuating circumstances (worsening of my physical and mental health, the passing of my mother after a long battle with cancer, my wife being diagnosed and treated for autoimmune disease, and more) and they go out of their way to passive-aggressively make me feel like I don't work (every conversation with them starts with \"as we've already told you\" even when they haven't told me, they don't believe in any form or shape of encouragement and have never said a single positive thing about me or my work, they constantly ask if I'm still interested in continuing my PhD even though I've been meeting my deadlines, etc). More than that, they actually recommended  that I quit my part time job so I can focus more on my PhD, even though all they ever tell me is that I'm falling behind with no actual advice to fix things. They are purposefully opaque and honestly might as well be magic 8 balls at this point, randomly answering my questions and serious concerns haphazardly. Further, they are charging a premium because I'm an international student, and I am being charged literally the highest possible cost for my PhD (the bench fees are absolutely ridiculous for a non-lab based PhD). I have a professional doctorate degree and a masters degree already, and received them both with honors. I've never had any problems with anything coursework related before this horrible, horrible experience. \n\nI'm at the end of my first year, and may or may not pass my first year. But I'm wondering: if I even do pass, should I even continue? Best case scenario is 3 more years of suffering, then a PhD so I can get a teaching job that pays less than my current consulting job but that I'm passionate about. Worst case scenario is I fail the final viva and lose some very serious time and money.\n\nAnyway, rant and questions over. Thanks for reading, appreciate any thoughts.",

That's how it works, when I went through my PhD I thought about quitting a lot. But I always asked myself, would you be comfortable quitting? In my case, It wasn't an option, for several reasons. So many things in my life were linked to the PhD. So I went through it and do not regret it. \n\nKnow you have several options and if you decide to quit, make sure you have in mind what's your next move and have the conviction it is the best thing to do (otherwise it will be an unbearable load for you, and you will ask yourself what if..? ). Some of my friends quit their PhD knowing that it was the best for them and they are doing fine. \n\nConcerning your supervisor, I had a hard time with mine as well. We had \"the talk\". Believe me, if you continue you need to have this one. It is the only way you will be able to get out of this state of mind. \n\nFinally, try to have some therapy sessions, you will be amazed how much it will help you. If it is not possible for you, try to meditate, practice some sport or grab a cup of coffee with a good friend, get some perspective. \n\nMy best for you, and listen to yourself. Only you have the right answer.",

Research has high uncertainty, so I think it's critical that you need to be able to trust the people you work with to steer you right and support you.\n\nI hate my PhD advisor since their favorite activity is shitting on ideas that are not their own and being unsupportive in general. Fortunately, I did eventually find mentors who were supportive, gave me good advice and added to my energy instead of draining it, so I got a glimpse of what a great PhD experience can look like and realized what I was missing out on.",

I did not say that you are blaming them for your lack of progress, I said that you are blaming them for telling you that you are not making enough progress. I think based on everything you said, it is a fact that you aren't making enough progress. \n\nMy sincere advice to you is to stop thinking about it in terms of blame. I'm not attacking you. In fact I have deep compassion for your situation. You have extremely good reasons for not making enough progress--you are suffering some incredible tragedies right now. But PIs have responsibilities to their funders and to themselves. They cannot support people financially or with their time who are not making good progress. It doesn't matter what the reasons are. If someone is falling behind, it is a problem. They might be assholes about it, but they have good reasons for concern, i.e., it's not just that they are assholes. Staying and not progressing is bad for everyone, including you. \n\nAs a former graduate director, I would recommend that you take a leave of absence and deal with your personal/family issues and return when you are ready to more fully commit your time and energy to school. You can always quit later if you find that you do not want to return.",

I am not sure how you even came to that conclusion, especially considering the brevity of the context. Yes, it has been a rough year all around, but after losing a loved one and then another falling sick in a similar timeframe, it's incredibly difficult to remain productive as before. \n\nIt's also clear that OP is accustomed to being intrinsically motivated and being good at academics innately. It seems that a few obstacles have impeded their progress and that OP is trying to navigate through all that. The last thing you want is an inconsiderate supervisor who instead of supporting you, is intentionally being condescending while you're down. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the last bit. To the OP, a step back and evaluation of your priorities and future plans will definitely help. If you're happy with the current consulting role, stick with it for a bit longer until you're ready for academics again.",

The supervisors might be assholes, but they can\u2019t fix OP\u2019s incredibly unfortunate situation, and if OP is part of a group project (as is sometimes the case in science and engineering), the rest of the project may not be able to wait for OP to get things sorted out.",

      "text": "I feel you on this experience. It was mine too. Maybe not to quite to the same extreme where I thought I would truly fail out. But I basically had the same conversations with my advisor. He would constantly tell me that I wasn\u2019t putting in any effort (i was) that I couldn\u2019t work even part time (even though our funding doesn\u2019t even begin to cover our living costs). It really really sucks. If you truly want to finish the PhD, and truly don\u2019t think you can do this with your current one. Is there any opportunity to find a new advisor? I know that can be super tough or impossible depending on the field and school but I\u2019d look into the option before quitting. Honestly. My supervisor made my life in the program a living hell and it drastically impacted my mental health for sure. Your supervisor really does make or break your experience. \n\nSorry I\u2019m not more helpful. But wanted to just say that I understand your situation and that it really really sucks ans I\u2019m sorry. \n\nDo what\u2019s best for you at the end of the day and don\u2019t worry if dropping out is the right answer. But also don\u2019t let some asshole take away your chance to do a PhD if that\u2019s what you really want. Find a different supervisor. Or if that\u2019s not possible ask your supervisor to sit down with you and to talk about your progress to date and what their expectations of you are and build a road map together. Then follow up with an email that specifically lists that road map so that you have evidence of it if he tries to turn it around. \n\nIt may also be helpful to send a summary of \u2018meeting minutes\u2019 after every meeting that summarizes your discussion points and the action items you have agreed to. Also send an agenda for each new meeting that also includes those action points and briefly outlines your progress on each one. That way you can build proof up for if the \u2018as I already told you\u2019 or \u2018you aren\u2019t making progress\u2019 starts to become a major issue. This turns it from a he-said-he-said into something with evidence that both sides have (and implicitly agreed to as fact by not responding refuting anything). Sucks you might have to go this route but is super helpful to have this evidence documented. \n\nHonestly though. If you can switch advisors. Do so. ASAP. Any delay this causes in progress will be well outweighed by better (and easier) progress over the next few years.\n\nEdit: basically every PhD considers quitting at multiple points in the program. It is inherently a terrible experience (why can\u2019t we fix this). So wanting to quit isn\u2019t unusual. Doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t the right decision for you. But also know you aren\u2019t alone in feeling like crap and wanting to quit. The best thing for me was when myself and my fellow PhDs actually admitted this to each other and were able to help support each other more. \n\nAlso. If you aren\u2019t already therapy/counselling can be a huge help. Especially with all the other experiences you\u2019ve had this year. I started in my PhD program and it was literally life changing (also got some diagnoses by doing so that I wished I\u2019d know about years earlier). But basically everyone in my PhD program when I was there is/was in therapy at some point in the program, so do yourself a favour and get into this early in the process.",

First, I am sorry for your loss and that you have to deal with shit like this. Second, you should talk to a department supervisor or director because a lot of this sounds like your supervisors are treating you poorly. In most reasonable academic institutions, you will be able to work under a different set of supervisors given the right context and the right situation. Third, your supervisors are most likely going to be more critical and compliment-heavy because the hard reality of it is that they need to produce the best quality PhD candidates and with such little time, compliments don't get the results they need. Realistically, the harsh criticism may sound harsh now, but when you are more experienced and are standing in their shoes, you might be doing the same thing. If anything, I could highly recommend talking with someone before you do quit. However, it is important to know that if you do keep going like this, you will tire yourself out mentally, and you could burn out academically!

I went ahead and submitted anyways and the reviewers loved the paper and it was accepted.
