  "title:": "Would I have a shot at a US role?",
  "text": "Hi, it's very early days in my PhD but I was wondering could I have a shot at a US role. My grades aren't amazing, I mean they were good enough to get me into a PhD at a world top 10 university and one of the best in the UK. I am in STEM, mainly ecology and evolution but I am entirely computational. \n\nAssuming I get a few publications down, would this background hold me back. I am not particularly focused on getting a job at like an ivy league or something famous, I mean it would be nice but thats not as much of a motivator for me.",

I\u2019d be pretty surprised if anyone cared about your grad school grades either but I\u2019m not in the sciences. \n\nStandard advice though: it\u2019s a real crapshoot to get a tenure track job in the us so stay open to other places or private sector.",

But yeah if it seems nobody will care thats a relief and yeah I am very much option to not staying in academia, assuming I can find something that is as fulfilling.",

      "text": "The US isn't better than anywhere else in the world. They have many great universities but so does the rest of the world. The US also has a great number of mediocre universities and even poor universities, just like the rest of the world. The difference with the US is size. There are a huge number of academic organisations so just by force of numbers they often dominate various league tables. Rankings that normalise across countries usually feature far fewer US universities, and other universities come through. As always it depends how you chose to measure it. \n\nSo basically, if you can get a job in the UK you are just as likely to be able to get a job in the US.",
