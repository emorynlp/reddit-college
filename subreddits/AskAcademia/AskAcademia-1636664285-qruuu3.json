  "text": "Hi, sorry if this is a bit of a silly question, but I really love research and I think that I might (if I still enjoy it then) want to work in a research position after grad school. I know that professorships are pretty rare and hard to get, so I want to see if there's any positions that involve research to a similar degree but that are easier to find.\n\nEdit: I'm majoring in CS",

I liked the culture at the government lab best, and the pay and resources in industry best. Academic labs were stressful for me.",

              "text": "**Tl;dr it\u2019s a lot harder as a post-bac. Lean on your connections. Stalk the profs whose research (and personality) you\u2019re into. Read all their papers and then email them about it. Ask if they have post-bac research positions open. Don\u2019t expect to get paid much if at all. Ted talk below:**\n\nI was an undergrad during most of my research work. I applied for a bunch of REU\u2019s (Research Education for Undergrads) every year and always got accepted to at least one. I did four total REU\u2019s: one after freshman year (2014), then each year after that including the summer after I graduated. The REU I did the summer between sophomore and junior years was at a local university (not the university I attended for my degree, but nearby). I asked the prof if I could keep working in her lab doing research during the school year \u2014 unpaid \u2014 and she said sure. So two or three days a week all junior year I\u2019d bike over to that university and work in her lab. I also attended all her group meetings and got second author on a paper. Then my senior year I did a yearlong thesis project with a ton of lab work at my Alma mater. The REU\u2019s I did the summer after junior year and the summer after senior year were both with the same scientist at NIST. I fucking loved that work and loved living on the east coast, best summers of my life hands down.\n\nAfter you graduate you have to just lean on your connections I think. Hit up profs who you\u2019ve worked with or for, mention their specific papers and say what projects you\u2019re interested in, and ask are they accepting a post-bac researcher. It\u2019s a lot harder once you graduate especially I\u2019d you haven\u2019t spent the last 4 years obsessively networking and getting research experience, since most of those positions are reserved for undergrads or grad students, and if they have funding they\u2019re _probably_ not spending it on a post bac \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not impossible.\n\nDuring my short time as a grad student I knew a guy in his 40\u2019s, total chemistry whiz, who worked a ton as a tutor (not for the university but just under the table $20/hr\u2026dude must have been making bank in this cheap little college town) and then also researched full time in one of the professors\u2019 labs. He said he didn\u2019t want to do the grad program, and no one ever figured out why. I bet he\u2019s still there, making $500 a week tutoring and working in the lab til 2 am every night.  He was sort of a sad, lonely guy to be honest, but an awesome chemist.\n\nThe ironic part is that even though I was OBSESSED with research experience and my resume and getting into grad school, I burned out after two terms in grad school and walked away from the whole fucking type-A 5 year affair with science with just an undergraduate degree\u2026and now I don\u2019t even work as a chemist.\n\nEdit: just had another thought. One way to get into a position would be to look for related positions at your local college. My background is in chemistry so for me those positions would be like EH&S technician, chemical inventory specialist, lab assistant, etc. Those jobs aren\u2019t glamorous and don\u2019t pay a lot and are generally but not always filled by current students. Once you had that job secured, you could start chatting up the professors, reading their papers, talking to their grad students, and probably rustle up a research position.",

It\u2019s really tough out there. I\u2019m like highly cynical about academia so someone who\u2019s actually gone through it might have a better take. I burned out after two terms in my grad program.\n\nI think unless you want to teach (teaching is wonderful and it makes me cry that I\u2019m not a teacher) or for some reason you have a burning passion for academia, then the industry or government lab culture is a lot better. I work with a ton of PhD biologists, chemists and biochemists and they work hard but are generally compensated fairly with good benefits, reasonable-ish work life balance, etc. I believe it\u2019s fairly easy to find a job in industry if you\u2019re a PhD scientist who\u2019s competent.",

There\u2019s less of these institutions and their programmatic focus is narrower than university research. And they also usually target longer-term projects so turnover is lower (this means less openings, all other things equal).\n\nResearch jobs in industry are easier to get, as long as your interest is relevant to the industry. People are aware of this, so a typical PhD student from any institution worthy of existence has already been conditioned to pursue research that\u2019s sexy from industrial perspective, whenever possible. But in many fields, this is just not possible. You are not going to find relevant private research positions if you\u2019re in particle or astrophysics. Your only options is to change focus (I knew a bunch of astro people who switched to computational aerodynamics for DoD contractors) or drop the pretense of doing physics altogether (go for financial/insurance/data science jobs like the rest of those that didn\u2019t make the cut).",

They have the budget to put major capital into long-term research initiatives.\n\nIt's highly competitive, and of course there's no tenure, but opportunities like these can be both fulfilling and highly lucrative for the right person.\n\nI only have an MS in CS, so my perspective is second-hand, but when I was considering a doctorate and looking at opportunities, these were my findings. From what I can tell, they hold true today.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck to you!",
