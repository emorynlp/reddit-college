  "title:": "PhD program - How to decide if this is the right one? Radboud University Water and Wetlans institute - Netherlands",
  "text": "Hello there! I got offered a PhD at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. They surprisingly accepted me the day right after the job interview (all other application proccesses I have been involved in took more than 2 weeks to get any answer). Further, the Job interview did not feel so \"elitist\" as the other one I got two months ago. I am not sure if this is the right place to be for me, especially since I experienced horrible supervising at my master's program. How can I make sure that I am not ending in a bad program?   \nI asked the professor to get in touch with the other phd- students (he put all of them in cc and explained who is working on which kind of project) and I emailed all of them.  I would highly appreciate some advice as well as personal experiences from people working at the Radboud University!",

      "text": "Congrats for being offered a PhD-position. I can't really attest to anything specific to your field within the faculty of Science but could confirm that overall the university does feel less 'elitist' than other universities elsewhere. I have studied for five years at the management faculty (which might of course not be that comparable) and people there feel more 'down-to-earth' in comparison to for instance universities abroad. I think this is generally also the case at the other faculties.",

      "text": "Congratulations! Might I ask which department your PhD will be involved in? I'm doing my Masters at an IWWR institute related department at RU, but there are differences among the departments. If you have the name of the Professior(s) maybe I even know them. You can send me a PM with specific questions if you like.\n\nOverall, the Science Faculty at RU is very relaxed, lots of possibilities to develop yourself as a researcher, close contact with professors and other staff, at my department quite social too before Covid (friday afternoon drinks, some events with a barbecue or sports). You would probably be expected to supervise quite a few undergrad and grad research internships I expect, more so than TA'ing courses I think.\n\nI would love the know the department you'll be attending! Will you be coming from abroad, btw?\n\nEdit: I noticed from your post history you'll be working with Henk Siepel from Animal Ecology, will he be your day to day supervisor as welll? If you PM me I can give you some info on him, I have had him supervise a very short project I did during one of my courses. Not in Animal Ecology myself, though",
