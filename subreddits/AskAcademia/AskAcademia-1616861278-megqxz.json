  "text": "Rutgers just announced it is mandatory. My university has begun to vaccinate current students on campus, but does anyone know if universities nationwide will require it in the fall? \n\nI would suspect the big hurdle is that currently they are an EUA, which I am not sure how that effects requirements for students vs employees. If a vaccine does get officially approved, I would see all colleges instantly requiring it, but I am not sure if we will be there by the fall. \n\nPeople seem pretty mum at my school at the moment regarding a requirement.",

I could also see far-right legislature/governors forbidding their \"liberal elite\" state schools from requiring it, just to make a political statement.\n\nI could also see a fair number of schools not \"requiring\" it, but still asking for vaccination records, heavily promoting the vaccine at campus health, and juts hoping they end up with herd immunity that way.",

Adding COVID to that list would not change much. They have already started tracking who is vaccinated, and having us submit proof to HR.",

I know nothing about medical law so have no idea if this is true-- but that's what faculty were told when our reps specifically asked about fall. The vast majority of our faculty don't want students allowed on campus without being vaccinated.\n\nI assume this is going to play out over the next several months yet since we don't have enough vaccine for all anyway. In fact, in my state faculty aren't even being vaccinated yet because we're not considered \"teachers\" by the state health department.",

Quite a few international students, whether arriving to study in the US for the first time or continuing their studies after being forced back to their home countries for the pandemic, will have been received vaccines approved in their home countries but currently not recognized by the US. How this situation will evolve by the fall is unclear, and will probably influence how university administration approach the issue.\n\nA lot of times, universities aren't announcing things because they are still working furiously behind the scenes to iron things out. This wouldn't be the first time hold-ups were caused by government policies rather than adversarial university administration.",
