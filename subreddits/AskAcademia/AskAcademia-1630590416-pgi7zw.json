  "title:": "Thoughts on Joplin as an Evernote Alternative?",
  "text": "Like a lot of people, I'm bummed about what happened to Evernote. it served as my everything notebook, not just for academic things but also I kept recipes, notes on articles, exercise logs, etc.\n\nI have attention deficit so it was good to have everything handy and even offline in an app. I don't think one note will serve the purpose, and it takes a lot of space. I liked that Evernote also had a web browser version.\n\nIs Joplin a good alternative? I need something more than a note taking app.\n\nEdit: it might not be. I need a good PDF reader. Also, I liked that you can upload scans with Evernote. I'm just not sure if it's worth the cost. Most people say it is not worth it. ",

It is super flexible, and it does allow uploading of PDFs, but I haven't used that function too much so I can't state how well it will perform. It has both browser and an app.",
