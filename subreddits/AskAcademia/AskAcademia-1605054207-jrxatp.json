  "text": " \n\nI\u2019m noticing this pattern where I get sidelined by men who take over something I was working on, or male colleagues opening talking down to me in front of our superiors, or even the male students that I TA blaming their mistakes on me and I am getting extremely frustrated. Even with the men in my cohort that I consider my friends, I have moments where I am talked down to, talked over, or my input is not taken as seriously. These moments like often derail me for the rest of the day, and reinforce all the icky imposter syndrome feelings I have going on. I tried to google but all I got was icky misoginistic \u201clean in\u201d type rhetoric that just tells me to have less feelings and be one of the boys. Do you have any advice? Or any good reading material that you have found on this topic?",

The environment is SO much better in the new lab even though there's still a majority of men. Finding an advisor that cultivates a supportive lab culture for women is so important.",

      "text": "Here are some things you can do:\n\n1. Understand that they are part of a larger culture and it is so normal to them, they often don't even realise they are doing it. So, if you want to do something about it you have decide whether you want to draw their attention to it and when and how. Or you have to suck it up. You may make this choice from incident to incident - you don't have to choose one path always. \n2. Understand you work in an environment where most people are socially and emotionally immature or even have disabilities in that area. They get away with it because they deliver something of value and they have privledge. So, factor in that not only are they unaware, when they become aware they may not care or understand what you are talking about. \n3. Find allies. There are people who likely don't treat you that way. Gravitate toward them as much as possible. \n4. Find mentors. There are leaders who are encouraging and supportive. They might not even be in your discipline. Find them and utilise their support. \n5. Go to HR/Guild/Student Council. Join groups that further women's issues or women in STEM. Go through appropriate channels to recommend that training on conscious and unconscious bias is part of the routine where you are. \n6. When you have a situation where you are sidelined and you want to speak up do it respectfully (note Kamala Harris in one of the VP's debates. Mike Pence didn't even realise he was cutting her off as he is so used to it, but she held her ground) but firmly. \n7. Don't wait for anything to be handed to you.\n8. Don't all them into your personal life or do anything that is not 100 percent professional.\n9. Ensure if someone is taking credit for your work you immediately remedy the situation with evidence of your contribution and then query with the individual why they would say it was their work? (This is theft in academia and should be taken very seriously)\n10. Write down every incident you experience and then put it in a drawer. It creates a record in case you want to go formal with someone for repeated behaviour but you can also show it to someone else to determine if you are being too sensitive. \n11. Understand that women do this to other women as well - personally and professionally. it is a human condition that when you have privilege to want to hang on to it.There is no nirvana where everyone gets what they deserve. Determine what you need to do to succeed (network, self-champion, etc) in your field and do it. It is really up to you to be resilient and positive.",

I won't speak to Mike Pence, but I know that I personally do that a lot, because that's the normal flow of conversation where I'm from -- moving to the Midwest was a bit of a shock, and I had to (attempt to) adjust how I converse because otherwise the other participants in the conversation (not just women, I've been called out by guys for this) would never be able to get a word in edgewise.",

You're right that it's bad behavior either way, but it does have a disproportionate effect on women due to this imbalance.",

They don't necessarily need to be doing what you do, and I'm not suggesting you should switch advisors (based on what you wrote so far), but you need to find a safe space to commiserate, give guidance for actions you can take, etc., etc. \n\nAnd to all the men in STEM reading this, you also need to be active in the fight for equality in STEM!

So in case seeing some description of it in someone else's words isn't redundant and actually helpful here's what I might try for:\n\n I'm not the most versed/practiced in that kind of boundary assertion/quit the BS at this point but as much as it sucks, being able to retort about how toxic their inability to listen,lead in service to team members, and genuinely collaborate is is still the way to go--or just know that it doesn't fly in some workplaces where good communication and social skills tend to be more important than  \nSolely being a brilliant problem solver.\n\nEdit: in case you haven't seen this before (neither have I till tonight), a former US female secret service agent covers topics on presence, confidence, and how to assert even when folks try talking over you, I'm guessing it may be relevant on a direct note.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FmMTb2lF7jM\n\n\nAlso, try cross posting part of your situation to r/askhr to see how other folks in the field navigate from an academic institutional, professional organizational, and self-advocacy point of views. \n\nFrom an organizational/student point of view (inspired by the woman Geology/former civil engineer's mentorship post elsewhere in the comments), also look at organizing advocacy with other women+diversity in STEM/STEAM orgs + any unions that may be at the University, or even professional societies.\n\nLike literally find folks who are willing to coordinate hosting a handful of events with you in a way that holds the University's claims to diversity, equity, inclusion, etc. to the fire. Maybe even collaborate with marketing/PR student orgs to get it promoted to the media as well. Invite the Deans and vice chancellor plus chancellor and other department heads. Convene to get some kind of timeline-bound commitments, and if they don't make the agreed upon changes by the next half year or so, take the coals and put it on blast with the media again in a follow-up event or strike or something.\n\nI don't know what flavor of engineering you do but the Engineering Society of Detroit has a huge list of national and international professional societies and associations etc. In their affiliate council directory. Check their website to see what stands out in addition to obvious women's professional societies too.\n\nGood luck--the world needs way more people like you and fewer ignorant and arrogant engineers who try to float a misplaced sense of superiority based on their perceived technical prowess.",

If they are trying to bulldoze you and take over your project (as you mention happened), I would say that\u2019s the time to make a stand and push back. To this effect, I suggest always keeping evidence of your work, meetings, and communications, such that you have the tools to make it right.",

I can understand that you are finding the environment challenging and hostile, and a lot of your male colleagues find your presence unusual from the status quo, however, this is not something that should stop you. \n\nYou must take control and stand by your work. You have to stand up for yourself. If your little shits of students are blaming their mistakes on you, plainly point out their mistakes to them, don't be shy about it. Try to explain their mistakes to them FIRST and If they behave in a way that it is your fault, let them know you won't be afraid to penalize their sloppy work or escalate the matter accordingly. You are not their MOM. \n\nIn the lab where you work, you need to make sure that you establish boundaries on what your projects belong to you with your advisor and other folks at the lab. As a male student who is doing a Ph.D. in engineering, I  often found my senior colleagues at the lab try to take over my work in the final days in the name of \"collaboration\" etc.  Whenever this happened to me, I made sure to have a joint meeting with the entire team to establish the work and contributions they would be making, and when you do this these people fuck right off. They are freeloaders trying to get authorship.  it is important to establish the authorship and contributions in your projects early on. \n\nAssert yourself, don't be intimidated. You belong in the field don't let the biased field make you feel otherwise. Definitely make friends in and outside your department, be part of IEEE Women or women in Engineering groups, they can advise you much better.",

Do not touch them\n3. Do not use foul or street language\n\n1.If they are misbehaving during class which is causing interruption to your teaching and the rest of the students, politely ask them to leave the classroom. Stop teaching for a moment till the person exits, if they are not leaving you can ask the building security/ department facilities staff to help you, either way, make sure to file an incident report with your department and immediate supervisor.\n\n2. If they are misbehaving when you are having one on one interaction with the student, ask them why they are agitated, if there is something wrong, ask if they would like to speak after class. If they can express the problems to you, maybe you can help maybe you cant you have to proceed accordingly. If they are not engaging with you, let them know that you would want to help them but you will not put up with unprofessional treatment so you will let the supervising professor or department know about the misconduct.\n\nWhatever you do make sure, to always be professional, courteous, and always try to resolve matters before escalating them, so that you can say you tried.",

              "text": "So, I understand your point. But I maybe have some things to share for you to consider...\n\nSo I get where you coming from and ultimately advocate for skill and expertise being a big factor obviously.\n\nI will also add that I am a male who is finishing up his clinical psychology PhD (I\u2019m on my clinical internship). I realize that I don\u2019t know shit about other academic areas, only clinical psychology. \n\nThe reason why, at least in clinical and counseling psychology we need a variety of people is because the variety of people that we serve. I will of course stand by the data that states that having shared cultural/background data with a client for psychotherapy is not at all related to efficacy of treatment- this is a fact. However, having a diverse staff at a community mental health clinic (just as an example) makes people of diverse backgrounds comfortable going into counseling. A lot of places where I work have few ethnic minority therapists and, while research would indicate this won\u2019t influence efficacy of therapy per se, it may contribute to a decreased likelihood of ethnic minority clients coming to the office to be seen.  \n\nObviously I realize that your situation is differently than mine (psychology compared to engineering). But I could certainly think of situations in some areas where it might actually be important to have more diverse representation on a team. For example, in biomedical engineering I can think of situations where, as a male, I\u2019d prefer to be meeting with another male (and I\u2019m sure some females feel similarly) to talk about some sort of fake limb or something (I don\u2019t know shit about engineering so bear with me here). Same goes for any education perspective- I would for sure prefer to speak with an engineer prof who is a POC to get their experience of being one of the only non-white people in graduate school if I was a POC applying for a graduate school in said field.\n\nAgain, I do get your point. I think the complete opposite of your view you\u2019re advocating for is when people state that you should hire someone who is a diverse applicant over non-diverse individuals who are more qualified purely because they are a diverse person (an argument I\u2019ve heard). I disagree with this point as well- I would just advocate for their diversity being just one other factor to consider when hiring and not the end-all be-all\n\nEdit: sorry about spelling/grammar errors. My wife always gets after me for being on Reddit when we are hanging out so I gotta be quick.",

Not sure where I read this but it\u2019s summed up beautifully \u201clisten to someone speak to understand them, don\u2019t listen just waiting for your chance to talk\u201d (Horribly paraphrased but I hope it makes sense).\n\n2.

Aelin, what do You think about this.\u201d Asking our thoughts on a point first if someone interrupts before other people jump in is really powerful as showing you value our ideas and are willing to listen, and giving them back control over the discussion. Also shut down any misogyny/sexism/condescending behaviour as you see it. Not sure what the best approach is for that, but not saying anything in this case is tacit approval and creates that culture. \n\nJust you asking how to change is really wonderful, thank you!

This one time in her group, a guy kept using some tool wrong (i think it was some kind of saw, and there is a particular way you use it, idk for sure, i'm not an engineer). She kept telling him that he's doing it wrong, but he wouldn't listen. Dude broke two of those things before another guy came and told him how to use it correctly.\n\nSo yeah, it's a very common situation. People didn't take her seriously, even though she did very well in exams. What my sis did was to be *very* assertive in these situations. A lot of times guys have this bias so ingrained that they don't even do it consciously. They automatically assume that the girl doesn't really know what she's talking about. Sometimes girls speak very softly and timidly, and this doesn't help either. So when my sis told them firmly (and quite bluntly) that that weren't letting her participate, they actually listened and realized what they were doing. Or pretended to. Who cares? My sis got to do her share, and that's enough.\n\nI'm not a girl, and maybe I don't understand your situation completely. But being assertive, and talking loudly when the need arises works wonders. Also, my sis was once told at a group discussion that while all her points were very good, she needs to speak loudly and not let people talk over her all the time. So I think that's a good starting point. Call them out when they talk over you. Don't be timid in these situations. Of course, you don't have to be an aggressive asshole, but speaking in a firm tone usually prevents others from talking over you.",

      "text": "I'm a bit late to this thread and others have already given good advice, but as a female grad student in engineering, I've definitely dealt with this too, and might have another insight to share. \n\n* Certainly find out other women through groups: Women in Science and Engineering is a common one. \n* If there are certain situations/groups that consistently leave you feeling like this, try to avoid them or change them to your advantage. For example, when I started grad school, I was on a project team with all older men who were all working full time while I was taking a full course load. Project meetings made me feel terrible about myself and presenting my minor progress. Looking back, I wish I had asked my PI to have fewer group meetings and more individual meetings where my work had context with the rest of my responsibilities and I wasn't being compared to people with much more experience and much more time.\n* On imposter syndrome - the straightforward way to deal with it is logic: almost everyone feels it, obviously you aren't an imposter as you are as smart and capable as everyone else, etc. Recognize that much of the dominating behavior exhibited by men is often due to their own insecurities. \n* Sometimes though, that imposter feeling persists despite all logic. When I'm feeling like that, I lean in to it - not in the typical lean in way of \"just work harder and don't have emotions\" - I like to lean in to the \"imposter\" character and try to feel like I'm a feminist spy infiltrating this patriarchal society. So I'm feeling like an imposter today? OK great, what would a badass Jane Bond-style engineer/scientist do in this situation? It's a bit of fake it til you make it, but try to spin it to your advantage and have fun with it.",

What usually works for me is to call out the bad behavior in a tongue-in-cheek way as soon as it happens. For example, if a male colleague were to interrupt me now, I might say \"Mr. Vice-President, I am speaking\" (a la Kamala Harris) and then finish my thought. Using a bit of humor, but still being firm, sends a subtle message that you're playing nice now, but if they persists in their poor behavior, you might just rip them a new one.\n\nAs another example, when a male firefighter would talk down to me, I'd say \"you know we both took the same class, right??\".  He'd usually sheepishly laugh and say sorry. In the majority of cases, in my experience, these guys don't realize what they're doing and are appropriately embarrassed when it's pointed out.",

But once I drop the timbre of my voice, men don't brush me off, talk over me more than they talk over other men, or ignore me.\n\nAlso don't be afraid to throw in an incredulous, \"Excuse me?\" when someone, especially in your cohort, talks down to you. The delivery is key: you can't be riled up or high pitched. Calm and low-toned makes people go \"Oh wait.\" I once had a professor tell me I was a coquette (I wasn't, he was just a disgusting dude), and when I pulled out the \"excuse me?\" in a calm, flat tone, he immediately started back pedaling.",

Eric do you want to finish your point?\" People won't forget that and when the time comes they WILL do the same for you. \n\n3) Ask others for help. Usually, one or two people are the problem and everyone else is just complacent and oblivious. Ask others in your group for advice or help. If you confide in them and place trust in them they will likely respond. \n\n4) Make an announcement at the beginning of the meeting without naming names. \"I've noticed people are often getting interrupted when they speak, even though it may be unconscious. I think it would be beneficial if we paid more attention to this as a group and made an effort to listen to each other.\"",

If you never say anything or even something the majority of the time, sexist men will keep making sexist comments . \nAlternatively if the op wants to change the mens mind she could try having a debate, perhaps it would work\nAlso being from the south im vastly aware of the non explicit sexism.",

I am by no means a timid person, I am just super grated by the constant questioning of my intelligence. There's also a super delicate balance of being assertive and being a bitch when you're a woman. Believe me, I will stop someone interrupting me or point out if someone says exactly what I said 5 minutes before. Hey can I ask, what are you doing in the field to hold men accountable for this behavior, since you have so much advice on what I should be doing I am sure you have thought about how to better instruct men on being less shit.",

I shut any comments or actions down at first sign and never have a problem with it afterwards for fellow coworkers or students.  Yes there a couple guys who try to keep passing stuff as jokes at first, but they either change fast or I elevate the matter. Hence the second point\n\nProfessors are tricky due to the power imbalance.  I have had the luxury of choosing a professor to work with who isn\u2019t misogynistic.  However most of them aren\u2019t at my grad school program in engineering so it wasn\u2019t difficult.  And having mentors and people in your corner on the professor level male or female is vital.

Sometimes when we bring up experiences of sexism with our male colleagues they can be dismissive, argumentative about every single little aspect of our experience, or agressive about telling us how wrong we are.  Even if only a small minority of people respond like this, it's so exhausting and irritating to have to deal with it that it's often just not worth taking the risk of having this kind of interaction.",

              "text": "Yeah but as soon as it's a minority doing it then it wouldn't be systematic anymore. Sure still super frustrating and annoying but at that point it's not a general thing and it shouldn't be generalized.\n\nThey might not have told me but some of them were really straightforward and would **probably** have said something about it at some point when venting. These are/were good friends not simply some colleagues or study mates. It is still very possible they didn't and that this is still an issue (in my field+location) however if people don't mention it or say anything about it WHEN it happens then it becomes that much harder to change and address. I understand it's complicated but people can't help when they don't know there's a problem.\n\nSo I can understand that if someone has already complained about it before that at some point they get sick of saying it or don't care anymore. However if it's really bad and you just let it go then it's unlikely it will change. \n\nI might have also just gotten \"lucky\" to end up in departments and places were it didn't happen (much).\n\nAlso people tend to underestimate how much difference there can be between countries, I've lived in 4 countries (2 continents) and in each 2 years or longer. It takes a long time to really get to know a country and its culture (about 1.5 years from my experience).",
