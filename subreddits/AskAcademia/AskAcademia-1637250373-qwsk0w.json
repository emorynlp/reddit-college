  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have a quick question about standards for author affiliations on a in-preparation manuscript. A lab I previously worked for is about to submit manuscript that has been in the works for quite some time (4+ years). I contributed to this project early on as a trainee but haven't been involved in quite some time. I've since changed institutions and have published a couple times with my current affiliation. I've just been asked to comment on the manuscript and confirm that my affiliations are correct. My question is: Do I put my affiliation to reflect the role I had while I did the work that was put into the manuscript or update them to reflect where I am currently affiliated?\n\nTIA.",
