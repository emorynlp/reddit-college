  "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI have been recently accepted into a Ph.D. program in the US and I am really excited and cannot wait to start. My advisor has been assigned and it is the same person who took my interview for admission. We have not had any conversation after that other than an exchange of email regarding me thanking him for consideration and that I will be accepting the offer. \n\nIs it too soon to send such emails? months and I wished to ask the PI general doubts and queries regarding my prospective projects, good courses to take, and stuff. I also wish to update him that I have started my visa process and received a university email ID.\n\nHow should go on about drafting an email? What should I say?",

However two months might be a while out and most likely nothing important can be done at this point. I would recommend sending an email when your flight is booked and you know when you are arriving to set up an appointment to meet.",
