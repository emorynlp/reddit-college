  "title:": "I am a non-standard applicant, which Politics PhD programs should I realistically apply to in the US?",
  "text": "Hi AskAcademia! I\u2019ve been a silent reader for a long time but posting for the first time.\n\nI am planning on applying to US PhD programs this year. I am looking to study comparative politics (non-quant), and am interested in historical and case study based enquiries on the political economy of development (South Asia). I already have a well-developed research proposal as I applied to UK universities last year which require you to submit a research proposal. \n\nI did a Master's with a distinction from the LSE in London in an interdisciplinary social science field but it was unrelated to political science. I didn't do an undergrad and instead studied for a professional qualification after school (in a developing country).\n\nI have really good LORs and have recently left a job in consulting to work with a research centre in my field of interest which I hope will further strengthen my applications. I'm also taking the GRE soon and hope to get a score above 325 without much effort (should I be aiming for much higher?). \n\nI applied to 2 of the top universities in the UK last year but didn't get in and will be applying to several US universities this time around. Related to that, I had a few questions:\n\n1. Is it worth it spending my time (and asking for additional LORs from my professors) for applying to places like Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Yale and Berkeley? I do know in my heart that I will be good enough to complete a program at these places, but being realistic I also realise that my academic background is quite weak. I thought realistically I should apply to UMich, UCLA, UC San Diego, NYU where I will have more realistic chances. In any case I\u2019m thinking applying to more than 4-5 places might be a waste of time. \n\n2. How much does the GRE score affect an application for someone like me who has one really strong academic degree but not much otherwise? I could possibly get a much higher GRE score (than the 325-330 I am targeting) but would need significantly more investment of time which I may not have with other commitments.\n\n3. Is it necessary to have spoken to some professors before applying? I normally do not read much beyond my own field of interest especially since I already have quite an advanced proposal, but I\u2019ve read some personal statements where students mention 1 or 2 professors they would like to work with. I\u2019ve always found this to be a bit intellectually dishonest but if it does help then that would mean a bit more research and possibly less universitites applied to.\n\n4. Finally, are there any good resources specifically for PolSci grad programs where I can ask more feedback on my application material? I know about gradcafe (spent a lot of time refreshing that after my applications last year!) but as far as I know there isn\u2019t any specific thread there. \n\nThank you for reading the long post. I have just left a really rewarding career and also had to leave a country I loved living in just for the hope of pursuing my dream of an academic career. Any help here would be much appreciated!",

      "text": "Honestly this OP is super weird. Have you researched PhD admissions in the US at all? Like, taken a peek at gradcafe at least?\n\n> \nI did a Master's with a distinction from the LSE in London in an interdisciplinary social science field but it was unrelated to political science. I didn't do an undergrad and instead studied for a professional qualification after school (in a developing country).\n\nThis isn't super clear. By professional qualification, do you mean you did vocational school (like welding)? Or that you did a bachelor's in a professional field like law or medicine? Your LSE masters in an \"interdisciplinary social science field\" - was that an MPP or a similar policy program? Was it taught? Did it have any research component at all?\n\n> have recently left a job in consulting to work with a research centre in my field of interest\n\nok; but do you have any research experience in political science? publications? conference presentations? are your LORs from people who can speak factually to your *research ability in political science*?\n\nI'm a bit confused by your profile as you tell it, but tbh for someone who doesn't have a relevant educational background and appears to not have relevant research experience, the chances are not so hot. The schools you identify as less competitive than your top choice schools aren't actually less competitive. And while the political economy of development in South Asia is not a field I am literate in, I very much doubt that it's widely studied across all the ivy polisci depts. It's not American politics. Have you checked that all of these departments have faculty that are able to support your research interest?\n\n> In any case I\u2019m thinking applying to more than 4-5 places might be a waste of time.\n\nI'm confused by how you made this determination as well as by your choice of schools. If your research interest is niche, it may well only make sense to apply to the 4-5 departments that can support it, but otherwise, I think most apply to about 10. Chances of acceptance, especially at top programs, are low even for stellar applicants.\n\n> How much does the GRE score affect an application for someone like me who has one really strong academic degree but not much otherwise?\n\nTop depts expect both scores to be in the 160s. A quanty department like MIT will scrutinize your Q score. No, they're not the most important thing, but they do matter, especially if your profile is low on other credentials like relevant BA/MA degrees and high grades in relevant classes.\n\n> I\u2019ve always found this to be a bit intellectually dishonest\n\nThis is another red flag that you haven't given the application much thought tbh. It's not \"intellectually dishonest\" to show that you've researched the department and have identified faculty who can support your research interests. In fact, in many fields it is imperative to reach out to potential advisors even before you file an application. Students include this in their SOP to demonstrate their fit with the department, which is one of the most important factors in PhD admissions in the US. You don't have to put this in the SOP, but you do have to do this research before you apply anywhere and know in your head that 1) the department in principle has people who work on your research interests and can therefore advise you; 2) that these people are taking students. \n\n> as far as I know there isn\u2019t any specific thread there.\n\n...there is an entire subforum for polisci on gradcafe that is full of specific threads. dude.\n\naside from that, the polisci subreddit has a career and gradschool sticky but be warned that 90% of the commentariat is undergrads.",

I do understand your frustration and that my questions might have sounded undercooked. Just to recap my profile: I did a degree which is similar to a CPA for my undergrad; it's recognised as equivalent to a Master's (in most countries), but it isn't university taught.\n\nMy Master's was in social psych and I wrote a mixed methods dissertation. Although not specifically in political science, I wrote about a very relevant topic in the field and did my experiment+interviews in South Asia. \n\nI am not so well versed in American PhD programs but I applied to Oxford and LSE last year but didn't get funding.",

      "text": "Hello, I recommend posting this to r/gradadmissions (see sidebar). \n\n1. You should apply where you you want to go the most, but also where you know you can write a stellar essay (i.e. You should be able to write passionately about all the reasons why Xuniversity is a good fit for you, and for them, assuming you will be having TA-type responsibilities). Think hard about your values and what aspects each program should have to make your cut. If you have to limit the number you apply to based on what you can afford in app fees, it's nice to have a range of tiers (i.e. not all reach schools), but remember you should also STILL WANT TO GO THERE if you got in nowhere else. \n\n2. As for the GRE, most universities do not put much stock in GRE any more. Just don't do poorly on it. Beyond that, having a higher score will only help you, but it's not worth stressing out about it so much that your essays and contacting profs process suffers.\n\n3. I can't speak to PolSci-related questions, but I do personally highly recommend reaching out to professors before you apply and go in prepared with some questions to ask them. You could even preliminarily tell them your educational background and ask if they think you'd be a good fit, considering your interests as well. They will be honest with you. Worst-case scenario, they will save you $100+ by recommending you not bother applying. Then, you can focus your efforts elsewhere. Best-case scenario, they will say yes, apply, and maybe they'll even tell you exactly what kinds of things they are looking for (This happened to me. I spoke to 3 profs when applying to UC Berkeley and Cornell with no big name schools under my belt or distinctions, and I got in.). You don't necessarily have to read their works (although it wouldn't hurt), but you should definitely have an idea of what their research area is and how their expertise fits into your interests. Also, meeting these people ahead of time will give you an idea about the faculty/department culture, which is really very important. After speaking to profs in my chosen department at Cornell, one of them described the culture as \"fractious and quarrelsome\" and this played a role in my choice (since I was lucky enough to have one!). This whole process narrowed my list of schools to apply to from 10 to 7 for various reasons and, honestly, MADE my application. \n\nGood luck!",

You will need an advocate who is willing to go to bat for you in the admissions process. It doesn't hurt to say this outright to potential supervisors. Tell them that you know you can succeed at research and you're willing to work exceptionally hard (as demonstrated by your past performance) and ask if they think they can advocate effectively for you in the admissions process or know someone in the institution who could.",

But no university is going to go through the time and expense of getting an adjunct a work visa. So you'll end up back where you are now, with no job and heavily indebted to U.S. banks.",
