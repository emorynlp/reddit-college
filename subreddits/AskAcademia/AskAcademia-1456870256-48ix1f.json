A student who had graduated about a decade before wrote to him asking for a letter of reference but my boss couldn't really remember the student so he had me pull his records. Turns out that the student had been the worst student in his major that year. Since it was a military college, my boss wrote something like, \"Although he was not one of the top performers academically, this college has a number of difficult aspects outside of the classroom that build considerable skills. etc\" \n\nMy boss figured that the guy must have really needed the reference to be stretching so far back and to someone he'd had limited contact with, so he didn't want to reject him. He tried to spin it but it was still one of the worst reference letters I've read.",

We have competition, all students are into research, but there are not enough guides, most of us do stuff on our own and we have a hectic submission schedule. I have qualified to olympiads in highschool, but I can hardly stand out in my class in this college, teachers are very reluctant to give LoRs mainly because, nearly everyone is applying and they don't have time. However, my friends from local colleges have it extremely easy. Who would be average here can easily top with just one final exam and no submissions. Not everyone is applying, teachers there don't even know about application procedures most of them allow the students to write their own LoRs and send them through the teachers emails. \n\nA huge disadvantage.

It's a matter of working on some small time projects with some of your professors, or even just taking one of their classes which sometimes is enough for them to get to know your abilities to provide an LoR.\nNow I'm happily doing my M.Sc in a top notch university abroad.",
