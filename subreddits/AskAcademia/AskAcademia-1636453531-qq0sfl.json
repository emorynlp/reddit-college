  "text": "I have the option of either studying medicine or   computational science. I like both of them and want to choose a subject that has more impact on society and contributes more. So I wanted to know how much do computational scientists actually contributed in research in various fields.",

      "text": "They can contribute a lot. I do computational biology, and am almost exclusively dry lab (programming) and have had critical roles in huge projects of >60 scientists. I am not implying my wet lab collaborators did not contribute however, simply that we all were needed to bring the projects to completion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that being said, if contributing to society interests you, consider that a bit in your field, but more important is whether the actual research you do day to day excites you. If not, then it can become pretty miserable pretty quickly. I don't know what level you're at, but if you are an undergrad consider taking classes in both and seeing what speaks to you in terms of the actual research areas.",

          "text": "I agree with all this. I\u2019ve had a number of students in my lab who either went on to MD/PhD or worked on the PhD in my lab. For all of them, seeing patients was something they really needed and saw as key to their happiness. I would view this less as either/or and more as what aspect of the job will make you feel fulfilled.",
