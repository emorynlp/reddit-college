  "text": "I just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake.  My understanding is that in most cases, the university/college will request the letters from the references you sent if they are interested in you as a candidate.   Is that correct?   (as opposed to having my references preemptively send their letters)\n\nI assume I should notify my references as to which jobs I have applied, but otherwise it's up to the institution to request them.    \n\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I have no idea if this is field-dependent. In my field (STEM), when you apply you arrange for your reference to send the letter to where you apply, since they are taken into account to decide whether or not they are interested in you: usually in the call for application it is written \"arrange the recommendation letters to be sent at ....\", in the cover letter you should mention something like \"X, Y and Z will provide a recommendation letter\".  If you apply via some website, such as ademicjobsonline, your references could upload their letter on the website and they are automatically included in your application.",

I'm in the STEM field also.   Thanks!",

      "text": "In my field, they\u2019re generally sent at the time of application. In some cases, this is apparent to the applicant (AcademicJobsOnline or Interfolio). In other cases it\u2019s not. At my university, when you apply, you\u2019ll give the names and email addresses for your recommenders, and the system will send them an email to request the letter. \n\nI find Interfolio works really well for this because it means the letter writer isn\u2019t bugged every time.",
