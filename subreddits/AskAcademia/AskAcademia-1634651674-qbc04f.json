  "title:": "When applying for an academic job, at what point are reference/recommendation letters sent?",
  "text": "I just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake.  My understanding is that in most cases, the university/college will request the letters from the references you sent if they are interested in you as a candidate.   Is that correct?   (as opposed to having my references preemptively send their letters)\n\nI assume I should notify my references as to which jobs I have applied, but otherwise it's up to the institution to request them.    \n\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I have no idea if this is field-dependent. In my field (STEM), when you apply you arrange for your reference to send the letter to where you apply, since they are taken into account to decide whether or not they are interested in you: usually in the call for application it is written \"arrange the recommendation letters to be sent at ....\", in the cover letter you should mention something like \"X, Y and Z will provide a recommendation letter\".  If you apply via some website, such as ademicjobsonline, your references could upload their letter on the website and they are automatically included in your application.",

I'm in the STEM field also.   Thanks!",

      "text": "There is no general rule about this and how a particular call treats letters is some weird intersection of the HR processes at the college, how the application materials pipeline works (usually some website), common practices in the respective field, the historical practices of the department in question, and random choices made by hiring managers and search chairs.  \n\nMy college's hiring pipeline doesn't have a LoR facilitation system, so there's no built-in way to get \"closed\" letters.  Search chairs have to either settle for open letters or else facilitate gathering the materials themselves.  As a result, lots of searches just don't ever ask for letters of any kind and do a reference checks over the phone for finalists.",

      "text": "It depends.\n\nSome jobs require letters of recommendation with your application, right at the beginning when you first apply.  Usually you enter your references contact information during the application process, and they are sent an automated email with a link to upload the letter.  You never see or have access to it, of course. Hard copy letters are rarely required these days.\n\nSome jobs only require contact information for your references, and if you are chosen for an interview, they ask your references for a letter.  Your references won't need to write a letter unless you make it to the interview stage. This is becoming the norm, at least in STEM fields, because most people on the job market apply for dozens of jobs, and it would be a huge hassle to have to ask for letters for each of them. \n\nUsually, the job ad indicates whether they need letters or just contact info. Sometimes the wording is frustratingly vague, and it's hard to know until you actually start the online application process. It's sometimes hard to know at what stage of the process your references will actually be asked for the letter.",
