  "text": "Hey y'all, just curious, but is there anyone out there who is perhaps doing a continuing education on physics, alongside another undergraduate program like literature? I know both are completely at different ends of the spectrum, but I'm strongly interested in physics, especially astrophysics.",

          "text": "Firstly, thanks for replying. I'm actually doing an undergrad in English literature rn. Unfortunately, my college doesn't offer physics in the continuing education courses. The astrophysics degree you mentioned, did it just require basic high school knowledge on physics, or something additional? Also, did you take it up online, as in long-distance learning?",

              "text": "No an astrophysics degree is a bachelors degree. So you go out of high school to the college, and have course requirements to get that degree. You start in math and basic physics like any other STEM  college degree. No my astrophysics degree was at the university I went to, but I changed it to chemistry after awhile. I do not know if you I could get an astrophysics degree online because of the course material and lab. \n\nIf you have a degree in a directly related field, you can g into grad school for astrophysics, or go all the way to a doctorate. These two degrees require a bachelors degree first",
