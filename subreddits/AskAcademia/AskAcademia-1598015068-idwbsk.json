  "text": "After an altercation with a cop, I was arrested for \"battery on a law enforcement officer.\" It was a trumped-up charge and I eventually pled guilty to \"resisting an officer with violence.\"\n\nI hold two MA degrees, and was planning on applying to PhD programs next year. \n\nIn March, I was hired to be an adjunct at a community college, for both Humanities and English classes in the fall. I was told that they would call within a month to fill out the paperwork. Then COVID hit, and the campus shut down. I did hear from the English department lady on occasion, and was sent the books that I needed for my classes. \n\nIn July, after not hearing from anyone for two months, I contacted both the people in the English and Humanities departments who had hired me. The English lady didn't reply, and the Humanities guy informed me that the English lady was no longer there and though there were some Humanities courses, the department no longer existed. He told me who to contact, if I still wanted to be an adjunct.\n\nThis was particularly disheartening because I turned down another job because it was in conflict with my planned teaching schedule.\n\nA week later, I was contacted about teaching an Intro to Humanities course online. I was subsequently sent training online stuff (which I did), got a school email address, attended a Zoom adjuncts meeting, and made a syllabus, which was approved. \n\nOn August 17, I was contacted by the English department, offering me two classes. I could only take one, because they were in different cities, and I would have to drive 40 miles to the other after finishing the first one. \n\nOn the 18th, I filled out the paperwork, submitted stuff for a background check, went to an in-person faulty meeting.\n\nI was also informed that day that I would be teaching no Humanities courses. I was also offered a position of a classroom proctor, which I accepted.\n\nOn the 19th, I taught my first class.\n\nOn the 20th, I was informed by HR that I was fired due to \"things that came up in\" my background check. That is my ONLY arrest, unless you count the single speeding ticket that I got and payed off. I told them that I had been arrested for resisting in my application, but didn't mention the \"violence\" part. In fact, I wasn't aware that there were two types of \"resisting\" charges until yesterday. \n\nI was surprised because my record wasn't an issue in graduate school, though I'm guessing that it might be because the community college has dual enrollment with local high schools, as well as a collegiate high school.\n\nWill prevent me from ANY academic jobs? I CAN get my record expunged since it was over 5 years ago and haven't been arrested since (that was in the plea agreement), but I'm not sure if that would prevent it from showing up in background checks.",

(I appreciate that you didn't understand the distinction between the resisting charges, but the rationale for your firing could make a difference). The main reason I ask is I wonder whether the 'violence' is the root of the problem, as I'd be surprised if a university was bothered about a criminal record per se (though I know the UK and US have rather different attitudes), and then 'lying' on an application is usually a sacking offense no matter what the lie actually is.",

Either way if you can get it expunged then do, sure it may still show up on a deeper background check but its not going to make things worse to get it expunged.\n\nEDIT: FWIW you've got my sympathy mate, the whole point of our 'criminal justice system' is supposed to be to rehabilitate people to be able to rejoin society so this stupid nonsense that hinders peoples employment potentially for the rest of their lives is just vindictive and shortshighted, I'm a big supporter of the 'ban the box' campaign, where employers only ask for criminal record disclosure *after* they offered someone the job and only if its actually relevant",

Another thing, you don't need to pay a ton to a lawyer to do it. It is extremely easy to file the paperwork yourself. Then just go in front of the judge, explain why you need it expunged (professional reasons, I lost a job due to this, etc.). I called two lawyers and they wanted to charged between $600 and $800 to do it. It took me 3 trips to the court house, and very little time.

              "text": "This was 10 years ago so my memory is realllly shakey, but I had just gotten out of the army and needed to get it expunged to qualify for a security clearance for a defense contracting job overseas. I was unemployed for months and super broke. All it cost was the court fees to file the paperwork since I did everything myself, so it was well under $100 and if my memory is correct it was closer to $50. That may have changed but it still would be far less than the hourly cost of an attorney.\n\n\nI remember there were several forms I had to fill out basically explaining why I needed to have it expunged. Picked them up, went home and filled them out, went back and dropped them off the next day and had a court date a couple weeks later. Then I spoke in front of the judge and he asked me questions and I explained how this would help improve my job prospects and how I had improved my life since the conviction (incidently it was the same judge who sentenced me, he sent me to jail for a month for selling weed). Then he said he will approve and I got a document in the mail a week later saying my conviction was expunged. The court part was over in like 5 minutes, it was between normal circuit court cases though so it was awkward having to talk with all of these families in the room who were awaiting more serious hearings.\n\n\nIt was a quick process and very cheap. I was very broke then and don't remember the cost being an inconvenience.\n\n\nEdit: a word",

I did it without a lawyer but it was still a costly headache with numerous steps that dragged out over 8 months. First I had to have my fingerprints taken (at cost), and send an application and processing fee of like $100 to the state's criminal investigation bureau. Then 6 months later the state office sent me a certificate that said I was qualified for expungement (not an actual expungement order). I had to send that to the county where I was arrested, along with like 6 separate sets of paperwork. They reviewed my case and finally granted my expungement request. But I had to buy copies of the expungement order. Then I had to mail those copies back to the state's office and the district attorney's office. The combined cost along with postage (because I handled everything by mail) was over $300.",

When I hire an office managers, I need them to have a clean background because they\u2019ve got access to finances. \n\nWhen I hire faculty, they don\u2019t need to pass a background check, because the job description does not require it. \n\nBut that\u2019s at my institution, in my state. Your state or institution may vary, especially if there are high school students taking college courses. In general, if the position requires a background check, it should be in the position description or job announcement.
