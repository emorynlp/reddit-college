  "text": "My funding comes from the government, and while the work I'm doing involves a publically available dataset with publically available methods, I need security clearance to give my talk. This is despite having already attained clearance for our publically available paper that the talk is about.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm going to a conference where I probably can't discuss our work. Any ideas? I may cut out all discussion of our paper and instead talk about the papers related to the data set and the method.",

In fact having a situation where 'A' is unclassified, and 'B' is unclassified, but 'A+B' *is* classified is not unheard of. Given that they've been cleared to publish, but not present, I would wager OP is in a situation like this. They're paper has likely been reviewed for any possible data spills, but there may be concerns that depending on what they actually say in their presentation, what questions get asked, and how any questions get answered, a data spill *could* occur (govt. is very risk-averse). \n\nWhile doing a partial presentation is a very good thought, u/ParticularTomatillo3 should double check with whomever is in charge of information security in this case (the person who told them 'no' to the presentation) to find out what what - if anything - can be presented in a partial format.",

The Feds do this entirely because any system where classification might be \"inherited\" from a prior document can get confusing and ambiguous, and leads to spillage; instead, they simply mandate that *all* documents that enter into the public domain be treated in this manner.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, OP got the paper cleared and either they (or someone they were working under) assumed that the clearance would transfer to the presentation. In reality, it doesn't work that way, and it *hasn't* worked that way for decades.",

Idk what your personal situation is, and this sounds a lot like DoE work rather than DoD work which is what I\u2019m used to. So with what I\u2019m about to say, YMMV.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should do anything, give any kind of talk around your current work. I would email the organizers and the panelists and be very clear and honest. \u201cMy clearance for speaking didn\u2019t come through in time, I\u2019m really sorry but I have to back out.\u201d These kinds of agencies take classification extremely seriously. I wouldn\u2019t say word one unless you are 110% sure youre allow to say what you\u2019re saying. Even if *you* think the information is basic or publicly available. \n\nClearances are like gold if you keep them. They open all kinds of doors, and will always be the greatest advantage you have in future funding applications. If the Govt. doesn\u2019t have to vet you twice, or to the same extent, you\u2019ll have an advantage over someone who does. Losing your clearance would be the death knell for any future work like that. A lost clearance is like a black mark that will follow you for life. That\u2019s before we even get to any of the sanctions that could be imposed if you accidentally reveal actually sensitive information. It\u2019s not worth it to give a 10 min talk, you already have the job and the government grant. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t go to the talk, but maybe I\u2019m militant. If you do go, just don\u2019t talk about your paper or your current work. Talk about something else you find might be interesting. If people ask just tell them your speaking clearance didn\u2019t go through and so you can\u2019t. They\u2019ll understand, or they won\u2019t. But importantly you won\u2019t lose your funding or your clearance over that. \n\nBut maybe the DoE is the Wild West of secrets idk. With the DoD is not a joke and the trainings arnt there to check a compliance box. You have to follow the rules or you\u2019ll be, at best, removed from the project.",

The Atomic Energy Commission inherited this system in 1947, and the modern-day DOE inherited it from them.",
