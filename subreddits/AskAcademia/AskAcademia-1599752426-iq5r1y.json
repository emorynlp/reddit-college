  "title:": "Should social ethics be a required curriculum component for scientists/pre-health professionals?",
  "text": "Undergraduate senior here. My thesis project revolves around analyzing case studies of science and medical curriculum that discuss scientific professional ethics, and then recommending a general chemistry curriculum with a greater focus on equity and understanding/recognizing personal and external bias, and analyzing ethical situation.\n\nMost professors believe that the ethics component should only be focused on teaching how to present \u201cGood Science\u201d and less on \u201cpersonal conduct\u201d (the argument being that you can\u2019t change someones morals). My perspective is that by teaching awareness of historical and current social injustice in research and greater science, students begin to recognize more of their own and other biases, and may act accordingly. What\u2019s your opinion?",

I don\u2019t know if I worded it well; but the paper suggests that professors feel that reacting ethical dilemmas and situations comes from morals (which are usually established before students enter undergrad) and would be irrelevant to incorporate into the curriculum.\nThe lash-back that I\u2019ve personally experienced is that some Professors don\u2019t feel as if they have enough time to include ethics when they need to cover so much course material. That\u2019s another issue though-",

I'd also note that in most departments, any faculty who were teaching in 1996 are likely retired or close to retired. \n\n25 years is roughly a \"generational\" changeover in faculty composition. \n\nI'd also say that Kovac's paper is very much a \"perspective\": they mention \"when I talk to my colleagues...\" rather than having, say, broad national statistics in terms of faculty perceptions. I'd be careful about generalizing one persons comments on their colleagues from 25 years ago to \"most professors\" broadly. Moreover, Kovac doesn't (from my quick reading of the paper) mention that \"most\" faculty feel that way, just that the those are the two most common objections they hear.",

While ethics is important, I have a hard time seeing how introducing interpersonal relationships and biases in experimental design fit in well with that course content, as the students aren't at the stage where they are actually developing their own experiments yet. \n\nThere are certainly ethical areas that can be introduced along with case studies (for instance, how we used to test toxicity, or how low funding has led to cutting chemical corners with respect to water quality in poorer areas, or any other number of things), but that's different than your suggested focus on \"personal conduct\" as a researcher.\n\n::edit- some examples:: For example, I talk about the Flint water crisis in my general chemistry class. \n\nI think content also matters. For example, a lot of the ethical issues with, say, testing drugs on traditionally white male candidates has led to severe issues in safety. But that's more suited for an organic chemistry / biochemistry / med chem course.",

I didn't go to a particularly progressive school (10-15 years ago) and research ethics were a topic of discussion in every class that remotely touched on human subjects research or science history (mostly biology courses). We also touched on biases particularly related to funding sources. In my grad courses we talked more about the erosion of trust in science and how that is fueled by high-profile cases of data manipulation, a rise in private interest funding of research to compensate for a decline in federal funding, and waning quality of science journalism that therefore mandates us as scientists to learn to better communicate our ideas and findings on our own terms.",

Putting all STEM together in one room over 3 days to learn research ethics is an **awful** idea. It inevitably ends up focussing on subjects where ethics considerations are backed by law and/or are more complex, like sciences that deal with humans or animals or run experiments. Theorists and pure mathematicians are forced to learn how long a psychologist must keep their records for but get no ethics training related to their own field beyond \"don't commit academic misconduct\". \n\nAt the same time, the work that us theorists do on supercomputers contributes more to global CO2 than our *travel* does. It's more significant than flying to conferences. And that's basically never mentioned. No one is taught responsible programming practices for reducing CO2 emissions. Even for observation for astronomy, no one is formally taught that our telescopes are on indigenous/traditional owner land or any part of the ethics considerations that should go into using data from those observatories.\n\nI think people would be far more engaged if the ethics was related to their own subject.",

The criticism of \"an inch deep and a mile wide\" is reflected in the rapidly expanded textbooks, which when from 90ish pages in the early 1900s to several hundred pages now.\n\nI work in curricular design and reform in chemistry education. Adding socio-scientific issues is a low priority, especially because they are poorly incorporated and assessed. It's not that they're not important but the bulk of these ethics issues need to be taught within a discipline like philosophy, and we can work across disciplines to build on those ideas within a chemistry context. It's hard enough to fix general chemistry to get instructors to focus on the chemistry, and I would argue that most of us do not have the requisite expertise in ethics to give a comprehensive view anyway.\n\nWorst case scenario, build it into lab. Most institutions don't have laboratory courses that use evidence-based curricula anyway.",

We can scale back to fewer projects over multiple weeks and ask students to do the same experimental/technical skills while also giving them a chance to think about how what they just did connects to ethics, socio-scientific issues, or even just revising and collecting more data to refine.\n\nPlus, lab courses are less political to change. Faculty don't want to be told what to do, so changing lecture-based courses is really tough. Starting in the lab is already more student-centered and hopefully shows our future colleagues (the grad TAs) what our learning environments and curricula could be.",

At a minimum, you need to be surveying to the individual course syllabus level for this question, because you will rarely find an entire course dedicated to, for example, bioethics, as a required part of a major. Such courses, when they exist, are often taught out of Philosophy departments rather than Biology/biochem/neuro/etc. However, virtually every Biology-ish course involving human or animal research incorporates ethics during the course of lectures.\n\nI agree with others - general chem/general bio is a terrible place to ~~introduce~~ focus on ethics, not least because students don't have enough of a knowledge base to have those types of discussions.",

For undergraduates this may look like a yearly reflection on their encounters with ethical dilemmas and how they navigated them. Graduate and Professional schools should require prospective applicants to submit portfolios based on ethics. \nAnyone who is remotely bothered by discussions on ethics or integrating ethics into academic programs are actively upholding structures that thrive on disenfranchisement of others. Professors not wanting to teach ethics/integrate it into their courses do not want to take ownership of the part they play in maintaining elitist and discriminatory practices of higher education and professional communities. \n\nI find it interesting that we want to focus on \u201cgood science\u201d and not policing personal conduct until someone\u2019s personal conduct impacts our lived directly... then we want to snatch their credentials and punish the hospital or even medical school where they attended... but things should have never gotten that far in the first place.",
