  "title:": "Struggles with my Advisor (Long Post)",
  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m currently struggling in my relationship with my advisor. I am a 5th Year PhD candidate at my university. I have often had a tenuous relationship with my advisor but the more I sit with it the more I realize that it is possibly abusive.\n\nA few years ago I was reading a biography for my dissertation and I asked her for some tips on how to get the most out of a biography when reading it, since  I knew she had written one. Instead she responded by telling me that she couldn\u2019t believe that I asked her that question and I should know this already. Then she told me I should drop out of my university. \n\nI tried to get other Professors to back me up and instead my advisor scheduled an intervention and made me sit with her and another Professor while she listed the things I\u2019m doing wrong in Grad school. After breaking down in front of her I left the meeting and attempted to take her advice. Shortly thereafter she told me that I had improved and things were better for awhile.\n\nOne time I asked her for a letter of recommendation and she wrote one for me. I went to thank her afterwards and she told me not to thank her \u201cbecause it\u2019s her job and she shouldn\u2019t be thanked for doing it.\u201d Which I thought was a little strange. \n\nI often end my e-mails with a phrase of thanks to all of my professors and none of them seem to mind. But she got angry at me for \u201cthanking her for her time\u201d and told me to never do it again.\n\nAs I studied for my Exam she started giving me weekly drill sessions where she would call me and ask me random trivia about the details of my field. It was during these meetings that I got increasingly stressed and frustrated with her behavior. If I got something wrong she would continually berate me for it, and told me that \u201cI should know this material by now.\u201d\n\nShe also started prying too closely into my personal life asking questions about my exercise level and the amount of sleep I get. I told her that I was increasingly stressed and she started recommending me medication to help me sleep. Which was another red flag. \n\nThe time came and she told me I was ready for my exam. I took it and ended up failing. I spoke to other graduate students in my department and they began to wonder if she had sabotaged me on purpose.\n\nI took several more months of her drill sessions and finally took my exam again and passed. I was willing to continue to work with her but I also began to speak to a professor who served as a graduate student coordinator and she suggested that I get a co-advisor to help mediate some of the effects of my advisor.\n\nAfter passing my candidacy exam I continued to work on my dissertation. I wrote and expanded on a chapter and sent it to her for feedback. She read three pages of it and refused to read any further because of grammatical mistakes. She then started berating me for not catching my mistakes and not proofreading, despite having proofread it multiple times and having other professors look over it.\n\nI ended up working closely with the writing center at my university to fix many of my grammatical errors and I sent it to her again. She read one sentence found an issue with a comma and refused to read anymore and continued to insult me for not proofreading despite literally working with a proofreading service. \n\nI decided to reach out to the graduate student coordinator and the department chair with my issues. And they recommended that I work on getting a co-advisor. There is another professor in the department who I have a close relationship with so I asked her if she would be willing to be a co-advisor and she responded that she would.\n\nAfter conferring with the department chair and the graduate student coordinator, I contacted my advisor and asked if she would be willing to be a co-advisor. And she responded saying that she was not okay with being a co-advisor. Because she didn\u2019t believe that anyone in the department had co-advisors. And she was angry that I talked to the other professor first before discussing it with her.\n\nI contacted the graduate student coordinator again and she e-mailed my advisor and explained that it was possible to have a co-advisor but my advisor again refused because she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it would be good for me.\u201d But that she was willing to let the other professor be my main advisor and that she could still serve on my committee.\n\nWe had a conference over Zoom this weekend and she didn\u2019t attend my panel but attended a panel an hour later for one of the other grad students in the department. At this conference she received an award.\n\nI decided to finally reach out to her again and congratulate her on winning the award and how it was well-deserved. I updated her on my presentation and the good news I received from it. And I sent her my chapter and some of my writings again now that they have all been closely read by the writing center.\n\nShe responded today and completely ignored the entirety of her message and then told me I needed to decide whether I wanted to keep her as my advisor or not. I responded that I did want to keep her as my advisor. She e-mailed me back again and berated me for not telling her that I wanted a co-advisor first and that it reeked of unprofessionalism. She told me to really think about whether or not I want her to be my main advisor and let her know tomorrow. \n\nI was completely willing to work with her despite all of the insults she hurls at me. But the way she responded to my e-mail with even more insults finally made me decide that I want to switch advisors because I don\u2019t think I can ever have a positive relationship with her after all of this.\n\nBut the problem is I\u2019m applying for 6th year funding and I need a letter from my advisor. If I keep her as my advisor I\u2019m worried she won\u2019t write me a positive letter, and if I switch advisors I\u2019m worried that the other advisor won\u2019t have a chance to write a letter for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been in contact with the department chair and the grad student coordinator and they told me that there really isn\u2019t a good option going forward. So I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nThis relationship has caused me a ton of stress and prevents me from sleeping and has actually caused me to have physical illness in my interactions with her. I\u2019ve tried to do everything I can think of to maintain a positive relationship with her but she seems unwilling to do so. She has also, in the past, been prevented from having graduate students for over 20 years. There was apparently an issue with her and a graduate student and they decided in favor of the student. I\u2019m her first graduate student since then. I\u2019m just not sure she understands how to be an advisor. As it stands it\u2019s been over a year since she\u2019s read any of my work on my dissertation.\n\nIt\u2019s really disappointing because I think she\u2019s absolutely brilliant and she\u2019s an amazing writer. But her interactions with me have just made graduate school much harder.\n\nTL;DR: My advisor told me to drop out, recommended me drugs, regularly insults me and refuses to let me have a co-advisor. And I need a letter for 6th year funding next week.",

You gotta get out of there.",

I can also 100% assure you this will not be the first time a funding extension will be requested by a dept chair because the situation with the adviser has deteriorated- you are not the first and not alone, however it might feel that way.\n\nWhat you DO NOT WANT is this person to write you a letter because frankly it does not sound like it will be a good one.  On the other hand, for an extra year of funding people are ok if the letter is from a department head and says \"we have righted the ship and this student just switched and is on track now to finish with this plan\"- read again, *this happens all the time*.  They will *not* be ok on the other hand with whatever the hell this terrible person is going to say in lackluster fashion.\n\nI know it's hard emotionally to move on, but it's what you have to do.

My guess is that they are all scared of her as well and no one wants to rock the boat.  \n\nBut if there is ANY chance to get a more helpful advisor, I would take it.\n\nI had a couple of friends flee advisors like this and leave great universities just to get away from these kinds of people. I cannot believe others allow this to go on, though.\n\nI don't understand why there are so many people like this in academia. Everyone else runs away from them and is paralyzed by them so it is hard to find help but if you can find another advisor and it is possible for you to jump ship in a way that will avoid her from having power over you I would do that.",

So their response is basically find a way to appease her because there\u2019s no way to change her.\n\nBut in that case I have to point out that if people felt that there was no way to bring about change we never would have had the civil rights movement or marriage equality. Just because someone has always been like this or the system used to be like this, that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t change.\n\nLife is all about change and growth. If she\u2019s refusing to grow and change with the times that isn\u2019t in any way my fault. There\u2019s so many holes in the system and I\u2019m currently falling in one. I wish I could change it somehow.\n\nIf nothing else I hope that if I report her it can prevent her from having graduate students again. Because I don\u2019t want her to do this to future students. I don\u2019t want them to have to suffer how I have suffered. But we shall see what happens.",

This is why no one steers grad students away from known sexual harassers. They don't want the backlash from the faculty. And they don't want their program to get a bad reputation so they pretend they don't see. \n\nI worry a lot about the fact that the department chair and grad student coordinator are telling you to suck it up.  Why are people such cowards in academia?  THEY don't know how to handle her either is my guess.  \n\nThey are correct that the structure makes it hard to do anything and it's been like this a long time--but departments should be thinking about how to reform their advising system so they avoid this problem. \n\nPeople unfortunately get away with a lot sometimes because people around them don't know how to address the problem. There's no structure in place. Grad students should be given an escape hatch for situations like this--when their advisor turns on them for whatever reason. However, they don't do it because it's easier not to. \n\nStill, they should help you quietly on the down-low.  You are really far along in the program!  They need to get you through the last hoop. That should be another advisor. Barring that then a co-advisor or some informal mentoring...someone in the faculty should be supporting you.\n\nI am surprised your program doesn't have dissertation committees. That's one way around this--if the main advisor goes sour others on the committee can still do advising.",

      "text": "A slightly contrary view: It sounds like you and your advisor have quite mismatched expectations and probably unclear boundaries.\n\nIt sounds like your advisor expects you to know fine details about your field, to be fully prepared for the candidacy exam, to not make grammatical mistakes in drafts, and to talk with her before seeking out a co-advisor. To be honest, these sound like reasonable expectations.\n\n(Having said that, I don't know what she has written - you have described some of her emails as \"hateful and vindictive,\" but I'm not sure what examples you have in mind.)\n\nHowever, your advisor also seems to have odd behaviours - criticising you for asking about how to read biography, asking not to be thanked, and advising you to get medications to help you sleep. It sounds like she has realised you are stressed but doesn't know how best to help you (asking about exercise, sleep, etc.).\n\nSo my guess is that both you and your advisor have not been conducting your interactions in a constructive way. It is probably a good idea to get another advisor. But whatever you do, you will need to have a clear discussions with your advisor on what expectations they have, what expectations you have, and how they can align well.\n\nIf this is something you want to explore further, Tara Brabazon (who is a dean of graduate research at a university in Australia) has a couple of great videos:\n\n* \"Vlog 134 - Complaints\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Zqh\\_QNsQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Zqh_QNsQk)\n* \"Vlog 235 - Who are the most challenging students to supervise\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7WE2vFfyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7WE2vFfyc)\n* \"Vlog 236 -The characteristics of the best PhD students\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ArionKnvXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ArionKnvXc)\n\nShe talks a lot about the importance of boundaries, clear expectations, and communication.",

      "text": "Ok, this is complicated. \n\nFirst off, if you're in your fifth year and you are in this situation, you are in a serious bind. This is not news to you and you can see the other respondents agree. So clearly does the chair of your department and the graduate student advisor. Your options are very narrow and they're harrowing but that's just the way it is.\n\nIf you are being grilled about whether you know the field in very basic ways at a point where that's supposed to be a settled issue--I presume you have already taken your field exams or local institutional equivalent and are basically ABD--the degree of doubt that your advisor is showing in your expertise is extremely threatening. It's one thing to have an advisor who is aggressively questioning your dissertation as it is developing--that can sometimes be worked out or overcome--and another to have an advisor who is questioning far deeper measures of basic competency and expertise.\n\nThe thing you have to explore with that possible second advisor is whether they're willing to take you on as your sole advisor. I was once in a dangerous and delicate situation as I looked ahead to my dissertation exam because I had one advisor who didn't like what I was doing--but I also had another advisor who I was very close to already. We were able to wrangle the bad advisor off my committee though I had to ritually abase myself to accomplish it because our first pass at wrangling him off was executed poorly. You need to see on your own if you can wholly switch over to the second advisor: there is almost no way for the department to simply assign someone involuntarily to you as a substitute, at least not easily. Even if they did, that person might not be able to competently narrate your work or your qualifications or your accomplishments in something like a letter asking for a sixth year of funding, not if they've never worked with you before and the only other source of information is an advisor who is now openly hostile to you. If the chair and graduate student advisor felt that your advisor was clearly in the wrong or being completely unfair, they might be more forceful in solving the problem--their statement that there \"isn't a good option going forward\" is an indication that they either they're not going to get involved any further (your advisor may be too influential or powerful or difficult) or that they may share your advisor's point-of-view on some level.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\n1) You can meet with your current advisor and ask for a mediating figure or figures that you trust to join the meeting with the intent of clearing the air--like the last time you did this but much more focused on how you've felt and how your advisor's attitude has affected you, with nothing really held back. Perhaps the graduate advisor or chair, but you might also ask that a fellow student that you trust who knows your work and the personalities involved be present--if there's a grad student union, talk to them. I understand that your advisor might be offended by the thought of mediation but if you're really going to try to have it out with them in the hopes that you can restore a better working relationship, you've got to have someone else there to see the conversation and to help it go in that direction. You cannot confront an advisor in a closed room where it's just the two of you: most of the outcomes there could be very bad. Keep in mind that if you have a meeting with mediators present, you are going to have to be ready to hear that your work needs to improve or your attitude needs to change etc.; mediation will likely charge both of you with the need to make concrete specific changes and to hit certain benchmarks. It's a very high stakes approach and the advisor will be able to either refuse or to reject everything you say. \n\n2) You can just submit, meaning, you can just put your head down, do your dissertation with a minimum of interaction with your advisor, hope the advisor will continue to do their basic duty in terms of writing letters for funding, etc. If you're told you're an idiot, meekly nod and smile and say you'll try to be less stupid. If you're told you have to make revisions to a draft, you make them. What you do in the meantime out of sight of your advisor is critically important, however. You start building your professional relationship to other faculty--faculty in your department, faculty in other departments who do work that interests you and hopefully vice-versa, faculty at other institutions, grad students at other institutions. You go to workshops and panels and professional meetings, you participate in online discussions in your field, you make as strong a professional network as you can manage that doesn't include your advisor. You try to avoid anybody that's going to be in conversation with your advisor so the work you're doing to build your network doesn't trigger their scrutiny. You have to some extent already tried \"meekly obeying\" and it hasn't worked so you might not have the breathing room necessary to develop that other professional network.\n\n3) You demand to be transferred to ANY other advisor in your department and to have no further contact with the former advisor. This is a dangerous option. They might deny you; the other advisor who doesn't know you if they accept you is likely to view you the way an orphan is viewed in a tight-knit nuclear family that's living right at the edge of their means already--as an object of pity but also as a cause for resentment. Your former advisor may be glad to be rid of you but they're still likely to badmouth you in consequential ways within and beyond the department. If your current advisor is generally well-liked by everybody else, that could be fatal; if they have a reputation for behaving like this with other students (now's the time to start listening for gossip to that effect), you might be ok and in fact you might find you have sympathizers who will look out for you and that a substitute advisor who will understand your situation. \n\n4) Finally, you have to consider the possibility that in some respect your advisor is right. Not in the way they're saying it--that's shitty teaching and bad professional and interpersonal behavior. But you have to run a self-diagnosis. Your advisor's message seems to be consistently that the advisor expects you to have a better command over what is implicit or untaught, to be more autonomous and yet at the same time compliant to unspoken expectations: to write to a not-fully-articulated or explained standard, to know already what a biography is or how to use one, etc. Basically, the advisor is expecting you to act as if you're already a professional academic who knows the unwritten etiquette, who is self-teaching (and yet dependent upon senior colleagues), to know what people will be judging you on without telling you. It's true, for example, that at some point if you don't know that there are problems with your writing (if there are: you need people in the writing center or grad school friends to tell you honestly whether the advisor is a psycho or whether there's something to it) you're going to repeatedly be in a situation where conference papers and articles and so on are turned down without even going through full peer review and you won't get clear explanations as to why, or your cover letter is going to be ignored and you'll never know it was because it was badly written. It's true that at some point in your career as an academic you have to start being self-teaching to a substantial extent and to some extent acting like you kind of know things that you don't really yet know--you have to be more and more careful about asking a question in a way that makes you seem naive or unknowledgeable. Professionalism is partly about a \"performance of self in everyday life\" and it's hard to teach other people how to do it programmatically or in a step-by-step way. It is entirely possible that your advisor is straight-up unambiguously abusive and there is nothing at all valid in their constant criticism of you. They are certainly unfair and arbitrary and not teaching you in a constructive way even if there is. But if you realize that there is something valid in there--that you're not picking up on implicit cues and you are finding skills like writing to be more of a struggle etc.--you will need to gain ground on those even if you get another advisor, because a second advisor may be less inclined to tell you any of that knowing that felt terrible on hearing it the first time.",
