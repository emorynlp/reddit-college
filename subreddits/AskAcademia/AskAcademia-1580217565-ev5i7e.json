It's a waste of time for everyone to be thoroughly trained on every device and procedure; instead, you just train the lab rat(s), and then *they* oversee the experiments. The student typically doesn't learn everything about their experiment, but is expected to know the generalities of the experimental procedure, and it's accepted that sometimes information gets lost in transition or simply is never communicated.\n\nFor example, one student in my PI's lab had an experiment that they knew backwards and forwards, but they got asked a question about integrating a separate device into their experiments as a form of future work. They had no idea how this device would actually be used except in a general sense, but the question was on specifics involving how the actual experiment would go (not as a gotcha question, but more out of curiosity by that committee member). At that point, my advisor stepped in, explained that the student hadn't really been tasked with going in that particular direction, and then asked me to step in and answer as I ran the lab and had an inkling as to what to do.",

The students didn't need to know the specifics of how those instruments worked or were calibrated, because it wasn't worth the time to teach them as there's a *lot* of information to digest. That sometimes meant they got asked questions they couldn't answer concerning whether a given measurement was valid or not; I, and my PI, would both know that the question was a non-issue as we know our field, we know our instruments, and we know the best-practices suite for our experiments, but the student in question, and the committee member who asks that question, wouldn't. Thus, we have to step in to ensure the defense doesn't get thrown off-course over what is legitimately a non-issue. Alternatively, the accepted answer to questions along the line of \"so why did you do XX\" became \"because r3dl3g said so,\" at which point I explain why, unless my PI thinks it's a core competency question at which point he would tell the student to answer what they thought before I answered.\n\nBear in mind I'd only do this with M.S. students, not Ph.D's as they need to know this kind of stuff.\n\n>I don't like the grant application reasoning because it means that the student will be completely blindsided if the grant funding doesn't come in.\n\nTypically, my old PI would use the M.S. degree as a trial run, and if he knew he had the funding *and* the student was competent enough, he'd offer them a spot in the lab for a Ph.D. after their defense. But he's not going to tell them he's writing the grant on that side-topic to fund their Ph.D. entirely because if it doesn't come in and there's no funding, then there's no Ph.D. for them. No sense in getting their hopes up ahead of time, particularly given how cutthroat academia can sometimes be when it comes to funding.",

Makes it very clear departments know their discipline best and they should set the standards.  We spend a semester working on them, voting, etc.  The Dean says he will not support what we proposed and the Provost called a last minute special meeting to basically say the same thing.  The Dean says he will not support lowering standards.  The problem is, the entire tenure process is changing.  Before, we rated candidates, and the informal guidance was around excellence (get X number of publications to get a top rating).  Now, we are changing to an up/down system, so we are now defining the floor (you must get at least X number of pubs).  But the Dean is still stuck on the old guidelines saying anything less is lower standards. \n\nSo we showed them guidelines from peer institutions to show our recommendations are in line.  They didn't care.  We argued the institution does not support faculty research.  Their response, if there is something we need for research, then we should ask, after all, if we have higher standards for research, the administration should give us more resources (little cart before the horse).  We pointed out that we just came off of a 4 year budget crisis and the first thing that was cut was the university internal grant program, the second was faculty conference travel, and the third was any and all course releases.  Plus 4 years without raises means people have been teaching more summer classes to make up for lost income so that has hurt research productivity.  If we vote in these higher standards, then they are in our bylaws and they don't change next time the administration wants to raid the grant program. \n\nNeither the Dean or Provost will say exactly what they want, just that they cannot support our recommendation.  What they are clearly doing is trying to frustrate us to have us just guess at what they want with a higher number, therefore it would be on the faculty, not the administrators (don't complain, it was your idea). \n\nWhispers of a no-confidence vote for our dean have started.",

They invited me to apply for a 3 year contract and I did, knowing it was nearly certain they would hire a PhD or an ABD.  Long story short, the candidate they hired got a TT offer and left them in very nearly the same position, only I was in another job.

I think the PI went to the admins first after they got the threat, and then the admins decided on the approach of non-disclosure and even the PI is sticking with it to make sure they got the security they wanted.  Perhaps they're worried people in the lab would harass the \"accused\" if we found out who it was, but that was never explicitly stated.\n\nI should add one day the front desk security guard potentially slipped up and referred the person as \"he\" but that's as much as we've got!",

A few weeks later he stopped showing up to work, except to grab his paycheck. The next week people come in on Monday and all the computer monitors were stolen from the lab. He was on video stealing them.\n\nAnother time someone posed as a janitor by putting on a high viz vest and grabbing a random cart from the hall. He went into the lab and stole a laptop. One of the other grad students saw him, but didn't realize what was going on. \n\nAnyway, stuff does sometimes happen. \n\nI'd guess maybe there's a legal reason why it's not good to give out the person's name?",

So now I am in the position of handing back forms that tell my staff that someone who comes in really early, puts in huge amounts of extra time and creates 150+ small videos to help students understand concepts (and gets great student satisfaction) gets an \"acceptable - just doing your job\" and so does someone else who turns up and delivers the same old material for the last 10 years and does nothing to keep current.\nI anticipate resignations, very unhappy people and a drop in overall performance.

They want volunteers to sit in on every proposed class in the new degree, and let them know if it'll be suitable.  My 'mentor' wisely advises me not to volunteer, and this German prof who's been there a few years volunteers with some others.  Time goes on and every class is approved by the group except for this Thai history class, which just happens to be taught by one of the best educated and well respected Thai profs. I guess this Thai prof had a whole lesson on how people who weren't Thai were basically inferior subspecies of human, and the German prof didn't think that would sit well with the students they want to attract.  When the Thai prof found out the reason her class was excluded, she started telling anyone who would listen that the German prof was actually responsible for the whole thing and was an undercover Nazi. A hacker Nazi who hacked her computer the night before class, changed her lesson slides, and she didn't notice while teaching the lesson because she was so tired from all the research she does. I kid you not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple weeks later, after I thought it had all blown over, the German prof up and disappears.  The Dean later tells me that they got an 'anonymous' tip that the German profs credentials were fake, so they decided to check them out. Turns out they were fake and when confronted by the Dean he just walked out and never came back. My Thai colleagues told me the scorned Thai prof hired a PI to dig up dirt on the German guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still talk to a colleague who is there, and it doesn't sound like much of the shenanigans have changed over the last few years.",

That program didn't really have labs bc it was social science and students often developed & found funding for projects independent of their PI. Both professors and grad students were encouraged to find consulting gigs because it was seen as preparing for real world job opportunities  & proof students benefited from going there. Students who got gigs worked with the university to navigate overhead since they were often using university resources like Qualtrics, SPSS, focus group rooms, etc. But their dissertation advisor wasn't necessarily involved (chair only required sign off during application stage). So the data, money, and any recognition could bypass a grad student's PI.\n\nI worked on a consulting job with the director and some other grad students and my advisor was never involved, didn't get $, nor was his name on anything. The data we collected belonged to the company we consulted for especially since it involved data collected about their employees. The hard data was only supposed to be internally facing.  If my advisor had gotten his hands on it not only would he have had to break into our shit he would have been stealing data that belonged to the company.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve recently just been offered and accepted my position but getting here was a windy route. I originally applied last year and got the interview on campus and everyone all day was saying it was down to two candidates and they liked me for the job more. I\u2019m thinking awesome! The whole committee wants me. Slam dunk. I meet with the dean who showed up for maybe 10 minutes of my talk and his demeanor is odd. He doesn\u2019t seem like he wants me to get a fair shot and doesn\u2019t really seem present. He didn\u2019t even ask me questions. Just talked about the position and said it wasn\u2019t a typical appointment so if I wanted to teach this wasn\u2019t for me. It put me off because I\u2019d be reporting directly to him. I leave and they say they recommended me to the dean and he\u2019s supposed to be the one making the hire so we\u2019re just waiting on him. This drags on for over a month and they say he didn\u2019t see how I had much in the way of a certain skill and they want me to put together a portfolio. It\u2019s all too much and rather insulting for me with my experience to be asked to do this so he obviously doesn\u2019t want me. Fine. I take another job. Come to find out my search wasn\u2019t the only one he screwed up because he dragged his feet and they told him you will step down or be fired.  New interim dean and they called to offer me the job about 6 months after all this happened. Interim dean got everything done as fast as possible. Took the job. I feel a little powerful, not gonna lie.",
