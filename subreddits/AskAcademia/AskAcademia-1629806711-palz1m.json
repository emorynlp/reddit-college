  "text": "Hello,  \n\nIn one of the labs that I worked in as a masters student in the US, we a had a post-doc who worked remotely from Europe doing mostly bioinformatics analysis. He was somehow jointly working in both his European university and my US lab. At that time I never paid much attention but now that I am myself looking for a post-doc position, I am wondering how this sort of arrangement can work. \n\nI am applying for post-doc positions in the US but because of some personal issues my family cannot relocate to the US with me. My choice is to either leave them and go to a top university in the US or do a post-doc in my home country at a not very good university. Due to this I am wondering if I can come up with a similar arrangement where I jointly work with two different labs, one in the US and one in my home country so I can spend half the year with my family and the other half in the US. I mostly work on bioinformatics so the nature of my work doesn\u2019t require me to be physically present in lab. However, I am not sure how the logistics of such an arrangement work. Which university would I be affiliated with (or would it be both?) and who will actually pay me? I was wondering if anyone has done something similar and has any advice on how I should go about finding such a position. \n\nA professor who I previously worked with in my home country is sort of receptive to this idea and I am sure he wouldn\u2019t mind me working remotely. He would most likely also partially fund me. However, I am not sure how I can find a post-doc position in the US who is also receptive to such an arrangement. Should I just email potential labs and say that I am interested in such an arrangement? I have also seen visiting scholar positions which allow you to go to another university for some time but I assume those don\u2019t provide any funding. Would appreciate any tips.\n\nThanks",
