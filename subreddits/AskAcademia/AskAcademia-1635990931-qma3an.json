  "title:": "Can professors refuse to give you a reference?",
  "text": "Can they? I'm currently less than month away from the deadlines on my earliest PhD application, have contacted some professors from my undergrad uni (I'm now doing a masters) and have heard nothing. My email was long, admittedly, but very respectful - it asked for their advice on my proposed research project and then whether they could write me references/letters of recommendation for my applications. That was a week ago, and I still haven't heard from them. Is it common for professors to be hard to contact like this. Is it a sign that they won't write me a reference? Does that sort of thing happen often, and what should I do if they don't? I'm getting quite concerned.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your comments everyone. It seems as though what I thought a reference is and what it actually is are two different things. I also didn't realise quite how busy academics are. That said, I must admit I have been a little upset by some of the feedback I've been receiving. I'm not entitled. I don't think I'm owed a reference (although I do think it would be kind of a prof to give me one). And thinking that just under a month was a decent notice period isn't me giving my professors a 'fuck you' but an honest misconception. So please be a little kinder to me. I was hoping to get some useful advice from this thread. As it stands I've found many of the replies unduly harsh and even quite upsetting.",

Usually that has nothing to do with my willingness to do the task or interest in the person emailing!\n\nI get a lot of email, and sometimes things slip through the cracks.

Asking for that *as well as* advice about all this other stuff is going to be overwhelming. Keep it simple with a recommendation request. Don't try to *make conversation* by asking them to also do a bunch of other stuff for you. Also make sure you're asking professors that you've made some personal relation with, who has some individualized knowledge of your abilities.\n\nIf I got a long email from someone who I can't remember as a former student, asking for advice about this and that, I'd probably just immediately trash it or possibly go off and do something, intending to read it when less overwhelmed, but forgetting to come back.",

I assume they are essentially a way to get a (rosy) preview of the applicant's references as an additional piece of information in the initial sort. They will still call the references for the top candidates.\n\nAnecdotally, I have found that my European references are much, much more likely than my American references to ask the applicant to write the first draft and less likely to be concerned about whether the letter is sealed from the student. I know zero students who actually *want* to draft their own recommendation letters. \n\nIf the student does not have references who know them well enough to write a detailed, personalized later...they are probably out of luck because they don't have good references. In one of my previous jobs I helped my boss go through internship applications and there are definitely ways to tell which recommendations are sincere and backed up with concrete examples and which are formulaic fluff or subtly backhanded.

Then once they've responded you can send them more stuff. \n\nWriting reference letters is a part of our job (despite what some other people are saying) -- we're certainly not required to write any letter that we get requested for, but don't be afraid to ask. Asking is fine, regardless of your relationship to the professor (although I would recommend not asking someone you know doesn't like/respect you)",

Funded PhD studentships (at least in my field in the geographic region I'm applying) are posted as jobs when the funding comes through and are generally up for less than a month, and since the proposal has to be tailored to the funding, the applicant is writing a proposal and cover letter from scratch in that time. It's just not possible to give letter writers more lead time than the applicant themself has! The application I'm currently working on is for a position with a 3-week application window.

Since funding and cohort size fluctuates, a lab with a new grant might take 2 students from the same year, but then not have any more open spots until someone graduates. At my institution, the tuition and stipend are paid by the grad program for the first year, then by the PI grant for subsequent years (unless the student received some kind of fellowship or is awarded an individual grant like an F31).",

It's not something you simply want to \"check off\" on your application.

Learn from this mistake and apply next cycle and be sure to give your professors ample time (no less than a month is minimum - but letting then know as soon as you narrowed down your schools is best) so they can write you a solid reference.",

Reach out to them again, apologize for the short time available, and ask very politely if they can please do it; and \n2. Offer to provide a draft letter that they can work from (and which you should start on immediately). That significantly reduces the amount of time and effort they have to expend, because you can fill in your background and accomplishments and other relevant information, and they can then slice and dice it however they like and add their own personal thoughts about your accomplishments and their thoughts about your potential for success at the PhD level.",

A negative reference letter obviously is a no-go but even a neutral one can harm the student's application. So you keep out unless you can actually help the student.  \n\nBut not getting a response isn't saying no, it just means they didn't respond. I'd forget about the research proposal advice and just send a short email with only the request for reference, apologizing for the short time you give them to actually write the letter. If you have the option to go to office hours you could also discuss it in person. I wouldn't expect enthusiastic \"yes\" answers but it's all you can try.  \n\nIt's sadly not uncommon for professors to not only being hard to contact but also to forget about handing in letters in time. It really sucks that such a basic requirement that basically everyone involved hates is still existing. But there's nothing you can do than respectfully contacting them again, saying sorry for the short time period and hoping for the best.",

      "text": "I would suggest politely following up with SHORT emails (many people set long emails aside to follow up \"later\" and never do, and professors might see a long infodumpy email as a lack of focus). Asking for feedback on your research ideas is a much bigger ask in many ways and most profs won't have time or interest, especially if you don't have an ongoing relationship. In the second email, just ask about the letter and include your application materials and a brief summary of what you're applying for.\n\nYes, it's good to give as much lead time as possible. I don't get where all the people saying 1-2 months is absolutely mandatory are coming from - most PhD and job postings are not even up that long! Can't ask for a letter before you know a position exists.\n\nIt is true that the further back you go, the less likely it is that they can write you a strong letter unless you have stayed in close touch, but most will say if they are not comfortable writing you a letter or serving as a reference.\n\nIt is also entirely possible some thought they replied but didn't - this recently happened to me with a prof who was willing to write a letter but only answered my first email in his imagination. (Also - have you checked your spam filter, just in case?) Again, it's reasonable to follow up politely.\n\nWhile no professor is ever obligated to write a specific rec for a specific student and many will say no for different reasons, I don't think I agree with those who say writing letters in general is entirely optional. As long as letters are required for applications, someone has to write them, and when letters have been written for us, I think we are obligated to pay it forward by recommending others when we are in the reference position. This is why it's important to cultivate good relationships with a handful of people who can write strong references. (Much like the peer review system, it sucks that the labor is not officially compensated, but if we take advantage of what others put into the system, I think we *are* in fact ethically obligated to put similar work in ourselves.)\n\nGood luck - the whole process is complex, often opaque, and not very consistent, especially if you are applying to programs in different countries.",

      "text": "To answer your specific question, of course they can refuse to write a letter. You cannot really think they are required to do so. Professors get requests for letters that would be negative if the professor was honest. In most such cases, the professors refuse to write such a letter rather than write a negative one. You would not want a system where they are required to write a letter. Occasionally, we do receive negative letters or lukewarm letters, which function as negative letters.\n\nI think you are trying to be respectful, but in reality could come off as demanding. You did not just ask for a letter but for them to review your proposed research. This is a lot of work and while some profs will be glad to do this, it is not their job and is a big ask. You also did not give a huge lead time.\n\nBelow are my suggestions for how to engage with your professor on this, which align with many suggestions made by other posts:\n\n1) Write a *short* email. Longer emails are sometimes written in an effort to engage the prof. In reality, they often are taking up their time unnecessarily. \n\n2) Remind the professor who you are, even if you think they will remember you. \"I enjoyed taking your classes X and Y, for which I made an A grade.\"\n\n3) Attach your resume or CV.\n\n4) Provide the name of the program(s) to which you are applying to. If you are going to apply to multiple programs, try to include all of this in one email, not a separate email for each recommendation request.\n\n5) Give a brief text - one sentence - about why you are excited about this program(s).\n\n6) Give clear instructions on deadlines, how the recommendation will be submitted, etc.\n\n7) Thank them.\n\n8) After you have written your email, read it again and see if you can shorten it. This will be greatly appreciated.\n\nStart thinking of alternate letter writers just in case.\n\nGood luck in your applications.",

Honestly a month isn't unheard-of and I'm fairly certain most of your profs will have done more with less. That being said, you now know to give them as much lead-in time as possible. \n\nWhat strikes me as the bigger concern is that you sent a really long email asking for multiple pieces of input. As somebody else recommended, I'd follow up with them, with a very clear single ask. You can reply to your original email, and say \"dear x, I just wanted to follow up on the below, and specifically, writing a reference in support of my application for y program. The deadline is z and I was hoping to list you as a reference. I sincerely apologize about the late notice, and I would understand if it is not possible in that time period. If it is possible, I can send you any further information you require to help craft the letter. Please let me know one way or another.\" Or words to that effect. \n\nGive them: (a) the ask, (b) the deadline, and (c) a single action (saying yes or no). Don't overwhelm them with documents and info that they don't need until they've confirmed they're willing to write the letter. \n\nDon't assume malice or that the profs don't want to support you. It's much, much more likely that the profs just missed the email or put it aside for later instead of actively wanting to refuse to write you a letter. After a week (which really isn't that long to not reply to an email), it's entirely reasonable to follow-up. \n\nI would, however, think about having a couple of people in your back pocket who you may be able to call on for a reference. Are there profs you're working with during your MA who might be able to help? Anybody that you can reach out to if you don't hear back? \n\nAnd this isn't a hopeless case. People are jumping on you for not giving enough time - and while it's fair, it's also not particularly helpful for you unless you've got a time machine - so let's figure out how to get those letters of recommendation for your application!",
