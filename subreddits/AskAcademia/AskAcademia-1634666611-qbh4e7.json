  "text": "English (Pre-Modern)/2nd Year Doctoral/TA treated as part-time instructor/USA\n\nMy research interests are in the literary history of a minority language, and so, I only had a few options for institutions here in the US. If I earned my PhD here, I would have a BA, MA, and PhD all from the same institution (R1 flagship school). I recognize that going abroad (probably the UK, maybe Ireland) would serve my research better, but I was a little lost when I was applying for this program, bouncing between odd jobs and just scraping by. Looking at programs abroad just wasn't in my bandwidth. I was just in a significantly different headspace. Besides, I personally like my advisor.\n\nI thought, \"well, if I can get some time in the country to learn the language and dig through the archives, the program will work well enough for me.\" And I was mostly supported when I initially floated that idea. When I brought it up again, specifically about getting a grant of some kind to do so, my advisor said to just focus on my dissertation, not to think too much about travel. Enter my doubt.\n\nEvery time I try to find a seminar project that deals directly with my research interests/dissertation project, unless the professor is my one advisor, I am told that while it seems really interesting, they can't help and I should pick something else. I have not really been able to do what I came here for. Enter my doubt.\n\nThe courses I've taken this semester were necessarily out of my focus, but I could find some tangential value in the descriptions. They have since revealed themselves to be a lot of what I don't like in literary research (one significantly more so than the other). Enter my doubt.\n\nIt's finally happened too, taking all my degrees from one institution is blowing up in my face. There are no courses next semester that are either tangentially related or that I haven't already taken. Enter my doubt.\n\nThis isn't to mention all the things that cause me to fret that I am sure many other graduate students are struggling with (COVID, job market, disconnected administration, disorganized Rhet/Comp department).\n\nJust about the only thing keeping me here is wanting to do right by my own students this semester. The curriculum this semester, most of my peers agree, is a mess, but I'm sure we'll all be blamed for not implementing it correctly if earlier conversations I've had with the director of the PRC are any indication.\n\nIt's all complicated by the very nice fellowship I have, and I would feel guilty to let it lapse when someone else could have been awarded it. I'm not going into debt for this program, and to go elsewhere, I would probably have to incur some amount of debt, which just seems foolish. On the other hand, I'd like to work in the UK, so I'm not even sure to what degree I'm doing myself any favors by being here. And I would like to speak the language I'm studying, but between me and my advisor, there is I think one more speaker in the area. I'm not a heritage speaker, so it's something I have to actively seek out.\n\nMaybe it's time I just suck it up and get a 'real' job. That could feasibly get me and my spouse to the UK faster anyhow.\n\nI could just use some outside perspectives. Everyone I usually turn to for help has proven less than insightful because they're also all personally implicated to some degree. I'm going to be talking with my advisor soon to address this more directly; I've raised some of these problems with him before, acted on his advise, but it wouldn't appear that that has dispelled the doubt. Just trying to organize my thoughts. Thanks, I do appreciate your time.",
