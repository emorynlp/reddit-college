  "title:": "Professor responds to notice of father's death with \"Hmm, okay..\"",
  "text": "I'm pretty furious right now and do not want to act out of anger so I would appreciate some level-headed input as to how I should approach this situation. My father passed away, so I have left campus to be with family and will not be back in time for finals. I sent an email to all of my professors regarding the situation and attached the obituary and one of my professors (whose class I'm doing very well in) responded with \"Hmm, okay..\"\n\nWhat even? How should I respond to this. My father DID actually pass away and while I do recognize that professors might get a lot of these excuse emails near finals this does not seem like an appropriate response. I will have the same professor next semester for the second leg of this course so I do not want to create an issue but also don't know how to respond in any way that wouldn't be aggressive. Should I just not respond?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses. I wrote this post in a fury of anger -- I've since had time to cool down and do not intend on responding. Also, to clarify, the university page outlining final exam policies suggests directly consulting the professor with documentation in the case of an unforeseen emergency. There's no mention of contacting a DoS, so I am going to leave things be since I believe I have followed protocol and do not want to go over my professor's head unless instructed to do so. Thanks again",

Not because I am heartless and inconsiderate, but just because i simply missed this section of the email. We receice so many emails before the exams, and in the interest of responding to students in a timely manner, we often speed read emails and just repond with a few rushed words. I felt extremely bad when i by chance came across the email and my response again a month later or so.",

That said, in the email did you just inform the profs about the death or did you communicate any plans about when you will return or makeup the finals? I could see the prof\u2019s thought process go something like \u201cSo they are gone...what do they want from me? Do they want to make up the test later? Do they want an incomplete for the course? Do they expect to just not take the final ever?\u201d Sometimes I get emails from students which don\u2019t contain a question and after reading the email I\u2019m not sure what kind of a response they want from me. If that were the case, I\u2019d expect the professor to tactfully say \u201cwhat are you asking me to do in response to this?\u201d",

      "text": "First, I am so, so sorry to hear about the loss of your father. Parent deaths are so difficult but especially during a challenging time in life (college!) My thoughts are with your family during this time. Please take care of yourself.  \n\nI am a faculty advisor. Please contact your Academic Advisor, your college's Dean of Students office aka Student Life office, your VP for Student Affairs (these offices have different names depending on the college) or the Counseling office on campus if you are unsure where to go. If you tell us the name of your college I can help you locate some resources. \n\nMost colleges have emergency procedures (including immediate family death) or a crisis team to help you reach out to your professors, or they may do so on your behalf. Other colleges will require you to reach out to professors individually but at the very least, they are there to provide students with advocacy and support during emergency situations.  Also, ask your professor about taking a grade of Incomplete (assuming you were otherwise in good standing in the course) so you can take the final exam with them next semester. Research your college policy on grades of Incomplete and when they need to be completed (sometimes within 1 semester, sometimes within 1 year).\n\nIf your college does not have an emergency process, or if your professor does not allow you to reschedule your final, and will not allow you to earn a grade of Incomplete, if you absolutely cannot take the final exam or know you are not in a state of mind to be successful - skip the exam and take the final grade you earn. \nThis is not ideal, obviously, but this would be your last resort. \nYou will should be able to repeat the course in the future for GPA repair (though some colleges will average the grade for repeated courses), so research your college repeat policy and retroactive Withdrawal policy. Your college should have a Grade Appeal procedure that you can submit to the Dean over the academic department that houses the course so you can appeal the grade. A quick turnaround may be required, so reach out to your academic advisor or a counselor or professor you are close with to help you reach out to the Dean of Students right away to determine your options. Your college might also have a retroactive Withdrawal process where you can later Withdraw (earn a grade of W), or have it expunged from your transcript.  \n\nI hope this helps! Best of luck to you -- my condolences to your family during this difficult time.",

I wish I could write all this out right now, but my kid's soccer game just finished and I promised her dinner and Frozen 2, so I won't be able to reply for three hours, so, all I can say right now is Hm, okay, and hope that makes do.\"\n\nIt's *probably* callous.

      "text": "Chiming in after your edit here.\n\nI want to offer my sincere condolences. I do not know you, but I empathize with your plight - and I've had very distraught students in similar situations who need help, not dismissiveness and a lack of any sympathy or even indication as to what you ought to do. No matter how he meant it, the response was insufficient, unprofessional and out of line. Whether it calls for future action will come to be known after he finds a way to resolve your grade (likely an incomplete and letting you take the final at a convenient time early next semester).\n\nI am glad you didn't respond, took stock and cooled down. \n\nI don't necessarily agree with some commenters that you shouldn't respond at all; **you may want to respond asking whether you will receive an incomplete or if he wants to handle the issue in a different manner.** This forces him to make a decision and communicate, creates a record of you having clearly asked for an incomplete (which is likely what will need to happen for all you classes which remain... well, incomplete.\n\nYou should definitely do this if he's offered no follow-up.\n\nAs to how you proceed, if follow-up responses are kinder and show some shred of sympathy **and if** the situation gets resolved amicably and to your satisfaction, I agree - don't pursue it further. Best not jeopardize a relationship with a professor you have to face again (especially if he *is* the department head, or has a lot of clout, or you are at a small school). He shouldn't have done it, but if he does not further harm than just not worthwhile.\n\nHowever, if you are mistreated further - in terms of the tone of his responses; in terms of how he handles you final grade; in terms of how easily he makes taking the final when you return; etc. then it is something you need to notify someone of - department head, or their boss, or the college dean, or whatever the relevant authority is. I assume the rest of your professors are either handling this by giving you an incomplete, or giving you a final grade you can both be happy with - if that's the case, that'll be clear on you transcript and their emails with you will be evidence on your behalf of mistreatment. \n\nUnderstandably, you don't want to mess with this - which is why I'd follow up, ask directly for confirmation of an incomplete or another means of finishing the class without you present, and without your intellectual mooring given your loss. If he provides further insult or is disagreeable or disrespectful, I'd send it to their boss and not worry about it until you come back. If you have to prove it, bring him a copy of the papers handed out to everyone at his funeral - and said you were said he couldn't make it... (don't do that very last part...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(Afterthoughts, half formed)** Admittedly, we're human and occasionally we fuck up too, which is why it isn't something that ought to consume your time and energy. Especially at this time. If you get a grade you are happy with and just don't want to deal with it anymore, then do that (still, consider forwarding the email exchange at the end of the year to his boss). He may have just been having a bad day, not known how to react, fired off an email without it fully registering...\n\nMoreover, death is... awkward. People all react very differently to it - both when facing the loss of a loved one and, in a very different way, when reacting to someone who just lost a loved one. The calmest people can become hyperactive, angry and violent. The kindest people, mean. The most quiet, outgoing and casual as if nothing happened. The professor clearly reacts awkwardly to death - but they should have thought about it before hitting send. Or sent a follow-up.\n\nAnd you likely don't want to deal with these attitudes at all now - wrap it up and forget about it until you come back. It would be **really good** to have an email record of him either confirming or denying an incomplete. If he demands proof.... he's apparently in his rights, but is a jackass. In that case I'd not respond again until you get back next semester.",

They respect the students and treat them like adults, the students respect the lecturer and treat them as more knowledgeable/qualified. I would not argue my grade unless I could point to xyz spots where it was *obviously* graded incorrectly and it was worth a significant amount.\n\nMay also be because of the grading scale.

I think this is a mistake.  At my university, it is the student's responsibility to arrange for accommodations in case of emergencies.  If your original message was along the lines of \"There was a death in the family and I must leave...\"   that does not clearly articulate that you would like to make accommodations to take the final.  I would followup with offers of when you can take the final to ensure you complete all aspects of the class.  In my role, I would not just assume you were willing to as there are many outcomes on this front \n\n1. Take the final at the normal time if you didn't explicitly state you would be gone for the final\n2. Take the final  late but still before grades are due and not dramatically impacting things\n3. Take an Incomplete grade and take the final after grades are due and get a grade change\n4. Seek a medical withdrawal.  \n\nSince there are many options, the professor may be waiting for you to arrange them.  Simply leaving it out there for the professor to make a decision may not work",

Because this sounds like the sort of advice a student would give.\n\nOP, this is a good response to your grief--like others here, I'm sorry for your loss--but a bad suggestion.\n\nPeople get a lot of emails. Sometimes they send back a bad one. That's unfortunate, and this particular wording seems thoughtless. However, your role as a student is *not* to \"explain to your professor how inappropriate he was with that reply.\"\n\nJust chalk it up to a shitty day on his part, and follow--as other posters have said--your institution's protocols for bereavement policy. If you do that, you're highly unlikely to have any problems with this or any other professor.",
