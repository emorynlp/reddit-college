I went back to academia for the freedom and the teaching, and even though not every minute is bliss, I haven't regretted the decision even for a day. Academia feels like home.  \n  \nEdit: Just saw that you're asking which field: It's Finance",

I postdoc-ed for 10 months at a top engineering school. (real talk, I don't think I could hack it) I put out applications and made a switch to a biotech company. I would be lying if I said I don't second guess my choice and I do miss parts of academia. I do not regret my choice though. I'm still getting paid to read, learn, and invent. I don't feel the handcuffs of industry... during my postdoc I learned more about funding/academic bureaucracy and how to craft your research aims into fundable proposals... i.e. you need to study what the government and your peers think is worthy to get NSF/NIH/etc funding and sometimes apply your research to diseases or fields you might not be excited about to score the money. Overall, I am much happier in my new position. I feel like I'm making valuable contributions to society while also making enough money to live a life I'm happy with. Also if teaching is your jam, you can still apply for an adjunct as a side hustle.",

Occasionally a pat on the back from a manager can also make you feel like you accomplished something: there is way more external validation. Plenty of my family and friends are enjoying fulfilling lives in a corporate environment.  \n  \nOf course shitty employers also exist and it's horrible for their employees.

In the end I really wanted to get back into academia so I decided to leave, but I had plenty of colleagues that are still there, and there were plenty among them (smarter, more hard-working) that could have made the same step I did, but chose to stay. Having people around that care about the same things you do really matters.  \n  \nOf course not all is bliss. Shorter deadlines lead to fulfilment of finishing a task, but also don't go that well with some forms of research. You may be able to publish from time to time, but definitely not in A journals, with time horizons of years and years. I would say that unless you're working in specifically a research position (think tank, central bank), your possibilities for research will be very limited. If you're in a position where you have access to data, your best bet may be to team up with an academic and let them lead the project while you co-author.  \n  \nAlso, you're a little less free with what you can publish in say a newspaper op-ed. Then again, most academics I know (especially early carreer) hardly write op-eds, so I'm not too sure if this is a problem. And for me personally: I love teaching, so I would miss that.",

I have often wondered if I had just an unusually good sample, because the place I worked was an amazing, fast-paced, creative, supportive environment where everyone -- including myself, a complete outsider -- felt like they were actually contributing to a high-functioning innovative team on most days. We had amazing leadership and did demonstrably good things for our customers. And whereas I have always struggled to fit in personally in the places where I've worked (I'm 23 years post-PhD and have worked in three different colleges), my co-workers really accepted me and made me feel valued. I miss it every day.\n\nBut would I be happy leaving academia and going to industry? I don't know. Academia is my home, it's what made me who I am, and I feel more of a call to take what I learned about workplace culture and innovation while working in industry and adapt it to make higher education a better version of itself, than I feel called to just dump higher ed. \n\nI think, as awful as Covid has been for us, in many ways it's been just what the doctor ordered for higher education --- we've been stagnant for 100-200 years in this \"industry\" and we have been needing something to shake the foundations and get us moving toward something better. So while I'm definitely not a fan of pandemic-era college, I think we're on the cusp of some pretty intense -- and good -- changes, and I'd hate to bail on higher ed and miss out right now.",

There are neoliberal pressures, of course, but nothing at all like there are working for a publicly traded company.\n\nThe influence department politics have on me is less than in industry, as once you have tenure you're more or less free to disengage if you wish, and let other people battle it out.
