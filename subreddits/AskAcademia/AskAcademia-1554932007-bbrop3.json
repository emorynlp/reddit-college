  "text": "Hi\n\nIn a couple of days I'll start the second year of my PhD and looking back I see that I have a lot of space for improvement. Recently I found my self involved in several different problems and I'm finding quite difficult or even impossible to retain all the information from meetings, talks, proposals or ever papers that I need to read. I never really used a notetaking app but I guess that now I can really profit from starting to use one. \n\nI took a look at Onenote but I guess this is not what I'm looking for my head does not work in that way. Evernote looks really nice but is quite expensive and Notion looks overly complicated. But maybe I'm wrong and you guys can help me choosing and setting up the best methods for getting things done and stay organized.",

      "text": "I have used pretty much every app possible now and the most useful has been not an app. I use an A5 Leuchtturm squared notebook and semi bullet journal with it. I take notes from meetings and papers and whatever else, write massive to do lists (and ones for \u201ctomorrow\u201d) and have an index at the front I keep updated so I can quickly find stuff. Along with my calendar for appointments and a Getting Things Done-ish approach to building my to do lists (if I am in a position where I can deal with it in 2 mins, do it now, otherwise add to to do list and archive the email) I find I can keep most things under control. \n\nMight not be what you\u2019re after, but you may find apps distract you from just doing the thing. And it often feels rude to pull your phone out in a meeting to take notes.",

I'm happier taking notes on paper, but have trouble staying organised - my initial categories and lists tend to devolve into chaos the moment I start running out of space. \n\n(Tried index cards for the ability to order and reshuffle, but they're a bit fiddly when you're writing down things on the fly.)",

(Sometimes I have a \u201cthis week\u201d list; I\u2019m not particularly consistent and that\u2019s fine.)",

I generally date most pages though. You'll also see on the to-do list that I have added things later (different coloured pens, etc.). Sometimes it just gets too far back or too messy and I just rewrite it without all the X'd out ones. I'm up to about VII to-do lists now in that book! I also do occasional \"tomorrow\" or \"this week\" mini-to dos to prioritise the items on the big ones. Anything with a due date I tend to stick in my calendar. (though frequently I am lazy and just put the due date next to the item - this list doesn't appear to have any though)\n\nHope it helps!\n\n(PS this is seriously bujo for lazy busy people; it's about the only way I, as a busy lazy person, can keep things under control.)",

I can now easily find the notes I made on things, which I couldn't before as they'd be stuck in a bunch of files somewhere on my computer and welp good luck finding them! \n\nYou'll note the \"Days\" in the index - that's my sort of daily to-do (I usually do \"tomorrow\" ones, which help me to start my day off without having to think too hard) and any random notes I take during the day, like phone numbers or student names or something that I might need for that day or soon after.\n\nFind what works for you - but this system has kept me vaguely sane for well over 2 years now (I have about 4 books total).",

You have to understand that everyone is unique, and you need to identify exactly what your weaknesses are and create solutions for those, and only those.\n\nMy issue is that I am scatterbrained.  I cannot remember an appointment to save my life.  I am pulled in too many directions to care.  Every appointment I have goes in one place: google calendar.\n\nI am also privy to forgetting important points during meetings.  However, my handwriting sucks and transferring and collating items on paper is tedious.  For the last 4 years of grad school if I am ever in ANY meeting, whatsoever, I simply open up Notepad on my laptop, put the meeting name and date at the top, write anything I want to remember, and save. Why Notepad?  Because it's so simple, it takes all decision making out of the process.  It opens, you type, it is offloaded from the brain.\n\nFor reading journal papers, I directly highlight and comment within the PDF.\n\nFor writing journal papers, I use Overleaf.",

          "text": "Wholeheartedly agree with this. I also just have a series of notebooks that I call \"scrap notebooks\", numbered chronologically. I am in the 5th year of my PhD and am on scrap notebook number 8. This is just where I can write down and random musings or notes from a talk, treatment calculations, some random person's name, literally whatever. Sometimes larger scale experiment planning (weeks or months) that is still tentative is in the scrap notebooks. No pressure at all for it to be neat or organized, I just try to remember to write the date at the top to have some semblance of an idea of what time frame I was thinking about the topic when I wrote the notes.\n\nAs far as tracking to-do's, I have a paper weekly planner to keep track of appts and daily to-do's as well as a super simple checklist widget app on my phone. The widget is just called Stuff I think. Sometimes I'm writing to-do's in my widget and also in my planner, but they both have their own purposes. For example, the widget allows me to categorize a to-do as \"Upcoming\" or \"Someday\" with no specific date unlike the planner. The planner allows me to keep a record of what I did each day unlike the app where the done items disappear at midnight.",

I currently have classes in their own notebooks. I also have a sort of To Do notebook that lists my weekly schedule (I have different tasks assigned to different days), my running training, and long-term items like to revamp my website. I also have a journal notebook (to track my thoughts overtime), a research project notebook, and a dissertation notebook. In each notebook I have multiple sections and pages based on whatever is appropriate. It's super organized.\n-You can access your notebooks online and on mobile.\n-They can be backed up.\n-You can drag PDFs in (Insert as a printout) and then actually write on and highlight the PDFs. This has been amazing for classes.\n-All your writing will be searchable. This includes PDFs (text within the PDFs). I use this functionality constantly. If you're looking for any random term you can search your whole one note (or just within a particular notebook if you want). You definitely cannot do this with written hard copies.\n-The OneNote app on mobile also syncs with your sticky notes if you have a Windows computer, which is so helpful.\n\nFor organizing the papers I read, I:\n-Use Mendeley to keep the citations and my notes. Mendeley is searchable and also plugs into word applications so that you literally can enter a citation and the app will then update your reference list. Seriously this app is totally amazing. There are other similar ones but I like it best.\n-Make myself bibliographies on certain topics in Word. These list my very extensive notes on all papers I read. I actually learned this from my advisor. Usually I list the citation, abstract, and then highlights from each section of the paper. I take those notes and put them in Mendeley as well.",

Identify articles through searching for a topic, seeing articles come through on journal alerts (I have alerts set up for specific journals to send new articles to me), hearing about them on twitter, etc. \n2. Use my Mendeley web importer when I have articles open on my browser. The importer will import the citation information and PDF, if possible/if you want it to (I usually don't just for space reasons). I have Mendeley on my desktop as well. It's pretty great, especially for writing papers because it basically autocreates your bibliography. It's amazing. https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/ I have various foldes in Mendeley that I organize things into. When I import citations, I import into a folder (you choose which folder to import to) that's basically called \"TO REVIEW\". It's essentially my to-do list. Once I review, I move files from that folder.\n3. Based on what I'm working on, I will go through my TO REVIEW folder and look for articles. So right now I am working on a piece about school leader speech rights (TLDR, pretty much nil), so I might look through to see what I've collected on school leader speech. I usually pick a few articles at a time and write them on a list or something so I have a to-do list for the day (I get a lot of joy from crossing things off). I usually will try to review 3-4 articles (depending on length--I'm in the humanities and some articles can be super long and not filled with tables/stats) in a day if I'm actively spending the day on bibliography building. Then I find the article PDFs and download to my computer and put in a folder for that bibliography. Usually I save by author and date (so like \"Theoharis, 2007\" as the title of the PDF). \n4. I start entering info from the article into my bibliography. I currently have four: Socially-Just School Leaders, Neoliberalism and Education, Youth Activism in Education, and Theory and Educational History. Sometimes it makes sense to put notes from an article in more than one. They aren't meant to be mutually-exclusive. Instead, it's my intention that, as I'm writing papers later on, I can go into the bibliography and get pretty much everything I would need for a lit review. So if a section of my paper talks about what socially-just school leaders are, I currently have over 100 pieces reviewed on that topic. For the bibliography, I usually have two main files. My advisor had me doing 3-4 but it was too much. The files are: full annotations (more on that in a bit) and thematic (more in a bit). I start notes as full annotations. This part is pretty basic. I paste in the citation. Then I paste in the abstract. Then I make a heading for each section of the paper (Intro, Background, Conceptual Framework, Method, Findings, Discussion, Implications) and literally just cut and paste things from the article that is of interest to me and relevant to my research. You can also summarize but I prefer copying in direct quotes at this point (and then I enter the page #), so I can use quotes if I want or can just paraphrase when writing. I make full annotations like this for every piece I review. If I think the piece should be in another bibliogaphy, I'll paste it in there too.\n5. When done, I paste the annotation notes into Mendeley because Mendeley is searchable.\n6. I've been building thematic bibliographies for my full annotations. This isn't necessary but it's helpful if you're preparing to write a paper. The thematic bibs just take themes/patterns from the literature and compile them. So for my Socially-Just Leader bibliography, there are lots of papers that talk about barriers and risks, for example. So I have a section on the thematic bib that pulls anything on risks/barriers into a section. I have another section on the skills these leaders need. Another section on the community orgs they partner with. Etc. So when I'm writing, I can easily just look at my thematic bib and use it as an outline. It's extremely helpful.\n7. The bibliographies are super helpful because I can search terms or just re-read at any time to refresh my memory about the literature. It's a great note-taking tool and helpful to have everything in one place. \n8. It's helpful to go through the reference list for articles you review to identify additional articles, as in the first steps. \n9. When writing, I typically use my thematic bibliography. Mendeley in Word allows you to basically enter the reference from Mendeley, and then it auto-adds that citation to your reference list. So no need to go through the paper at the end and ensure all your in-text references are listed in the reference list. Zotero also does this but I had random issues with it. I'm sure it's very similar though. \n\nI think that's it!",

The main reason I like this is the safety of having all of my literature with notes uploaded to the cloud. It's all reasonably well organized too.\n\nI probably wouldn't use google drive/docs as a general note taking app. I haven't done it yet, but I'm sure it could be good if one is organized enough though.",

All of that is automatic so I can just set and forget it; while doing periodic checks to make sure the backups are working properly.\n\nI hope that helps.

This is the system I am currently using (text adapted from my instagram post on the same topic):\n\nFor me, it's critical that my notes be (1) backed up online and (2) available from my desktop and laptop. I also need to (3) maximize the amount I can store while (4) avoiding proprietary formats (it would suck to invest in a program that stops being updated/supported halfway through my PhD.) Finally, I want to have my notes (5) organized chronologically, and maybe look nice too.\n\nSo for my  purposes, I've settled on keeping my notes in Markdown. These are plain text files, aka. tiny and can be opened/read anywhere! But when opened in a Markdown reader or other advanced text editor, they appear nicely formatted with headers and bullets etc. And they all go in a  local folder synced via Dropbox \ud83d\udcc4 The text editor I'm currently using is Atom, so I can see my notes and scripts side-by-side.\n\nCurrently, the notes function mainly as a lab log really.

I am looking to expand my notes now to include all the literature searching I am doing, and am also open to suggestions!",

      "text": "As a PhD candidate in computer science I primarily use Emacs for nearly everything. \n\nFor note taking I take org-mode where you can take notes in markdown form. Org-mode also provides scheduling your tasks and deadlines, displays your tasks in a agenda. Additionally you can export your org files to pdf via pdflatex and HTML, if you like. But org-mode provides much more features like habit tracking. \n\nFor bibliography I use bibtex. However, again, I manage those entries in Emacs via helm and org-ref. This allows me to search for bibliography with a few key strokes, open the corresponding pdf or take notes (again, in org-mode). Further, I am able to easily access APIs of crossref or dblp to insert new bibtex entries into my bibtex file by simply searching for the title. With that, I do not need to leave my Emacs environment :) \n\nOn top of that, when I am writing paper, I also write them in org-mode and export them accordingly. Together with org-reg I can easily search for references and insert them.\n\nI am aware that Emacs is not for everyone as for a beginner it might be confusing to configure. However, maybe you can look into Spacemacs, which offers a preconfigured playground to get startet.",

Taking notes on research papers is totally different from making a grocery list for me.\n\nMac user here.  For notes on research literature, I used to use Sente, but it's now dead (RIP).  I now use Bookends, although Mendeley and Zotero work nearly as well.\n\nFor tasks/todo lists, I've tried just about everything out there.  OneNote, Evernote, etc are all too heavy for me.  I need a relatively simple structure or I spend more time making a todo list than actually doing tos.\n\nThe only things that stick for me are:\n\n1. Things.  iOS and macOS app that just works well for me, both for ongoing project todo list and today's task list.\n2. Field Notes pocket-sized notebooks and a pen.  As their slogan says, \"I'm not writing it down to remember it later, I'm writing it down to remember it now.\"  If I think I'll need it today or it's cumbersome to get out an electronic solution, this is where it goes. \n\nFor meeting notes, I use plain text files in a Dropbox folder.  Platform independent, editable just about anywhere with just about any software, and will be readable 50 years from today.  Mix with Markdown if you want fancy formatting, or, you know, not.  This is how I take notes in meetings... just plain text and indented lists.\n\nA notable macOS and iOS solution with low friction:  Notes.  The built-in Notes app on both macOS and iOS has built up a pretty impressive set of features for a bundled app, including checkbox todo-type lists.",

If you pay for it you can insert files right in the table so one click and you can pull up the paper/article. If you don't, you can still insert links. Again, if you pay for it you can also make separate boards for collaboration and write notes to ppl within it which they can see and respond to. It's pretty neat for collaboration work or organizing things. It's still new-ish and not perfect and there is also a little learning curve so I can see why some people might not like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's an app I haven't used for mac called Findings.

      "text": "I use noteability with an Apple Pencil to annotate articles, draw up figures etc. it\u2019s always with me so it makes it quite easy, plus you can import the pdfs from your cloud storage, create notes, and do basically whatever in the one place. I then use google sheets for organising the lit, where I have one spread sheet that acts like a bibliography system (article details; plus my own version of the key words, and the themes included in the paper), another one that is sorted by themes that arise for my literature review (column one is theme, column two is author names, column three states whether it\u2019s a theoretical/empirical finding). Then I have a google docs page where I write the main arguments I plan to use so that by the end I\u2019ll have a list of things I need to discuss (I like to work in a way where I can annotate a whole bunch of things for a few days then go back and write the important notes a week or so later) (I use all the appropriate heading levels for this because it\u2019s easy to navigate to where I need to go in docs).... I guess everyone has their own method but this really works for me :)",

      "text": "This definitely is more applicable for an experimentation heavy PhD but I absolutely LOVE Benchling: https://benchling.com\n\nIt has a lot of inbuilt features/display options and has really helped with my notetaking when I get lazy about handwriting notes.\n\nOtherwise, I definitely rely heavily on google drive for autobacking up basically everything in my \"lab\" folder. \n\nI would say chronological order within individual projects has worked the best for me - if you get in the habit of international date formatting all your experiments/analyses/notes it really speeds up searching for information even years later. \n\nIf you're primarily coding - github or gitlab can be lifesavers. Intimidating to start, but it becomes pretty intuitive eventually. \n\nAnd I'll echo support for Zotero - the Word plugin is dope.",
