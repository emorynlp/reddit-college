  "title:": "Do you REALLY want to hear from former students? Especially an emotional letter?",
  "text": "Last semester, I had a professor who helped me a lot, both academically and with tough situations in my personal life. (I never told him specifically about anything going on in my life, but he provided general encouragement and support during tough times.) I also learned a LOT in his class and really developed a good work ethic and interest in the subject, thanks to him. \n\nI wanted to write him a letter this semester and let him know how much his support meant to me. I've written a draft of the letter, but it's an emotional one. I was in some dark times last semester and he had said some things that really helped me get out, and I wanted to include that in the letter. But would you cringe if a former student wrote you a heartfelt letter? \n\nShould I just make it a more general \"Thanks for helping me and encouraging me during the semester; it helped me a lot\" type of letter, or is it okay to provide more background info and explain just how bad my situation was and how much he truly helped me? \n\nA little more context: we've also talked over the summer when we've seen each other in public (we live in the same city) and talk this semester too if we pass each other at school. I know this doesn't automatically make me a better student or anything like that, but I feel like we know each other more than the average student and professor. (BUT I don't mean that in a gross creepy way whatsoever! We just talk about college, family, etc.)\n\nWhat are your thoughts? When you say \"keep in touch,\" do you actually mean it and would you want to hear from a student? Would you want to hear specifically how much they benefited from you and your class, or is that too cringy?",

I find that when I\u2019ve sent things off like this, I sometimes regret it (even if the reception was good) because I feel like I\u2019ve shared too much. (We may not react the same though.)\n\nYou can still be personal and heartfelt without being cringey. I think it\u2019s best to try and draft it in your speaking voice and to not rewrite it many times. A message of thanks to show that someone made an impact to you is always worth it. Often they appreciate it more than you know. However if you have to dial it back a bit and do a more general thanks, that is already a lot and works just as well.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine though :-)",

Unless it's something you feel like you need to air out or get off your chest, your professor would likely benefit more so knowing what they did right with you so they can better attend to other students' needs in the future. I would often end semesters feeling like I built a good rapport with certain students, but I wasn't always able to figure out why or how to replicate that.\n\nI'd also recommend keeping it short and sweet. Make it something small enough that they can pin on a fridge or a corkboard. That's what I do with all of my thank you notes.\n\nHonestly, the best note I ever received didn't have any words on it. It was a hand-drawn illustration the size of a business card. I keep it at my desk at work to remind myself of why all of this matters.",

If you want to mention that his support and encouragement helped you make it through some challenging personal times, that would certainly be fine, but I personally don't think you should go into anything more than superficial detail as to what the issues actually were.\n\nIn the end, though, nobody can make this decision except for you.  You know the professor and you know the type of relationship you have with him.  If you want to relate a large degree of personal information to him and think he would be ok with it because of the type of relationship you have, then by all means do so.\n\nGood luck.",
