  "text": "I'm familiar with the tenure system in the US and in some other European (too soon?) countries (see e.g., the recent [\\#IchBinHanna](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IchBinHanna) protests in Germany [https://t.co/3nm7qDzH1N](https://t.co/3nm7qDzH1N)).\n\nI understand that there isn't the same structure of academic ranks:\n\nPhD student --> postdoc --> assistant professor --> (tenure) associate professor --> full professor\n\nHow does permanency/tenure work in the UK system i.e., at what stage do academics progress from fixed term contracts to more permanent employment?",

On a regular research and teaching track, lecturer is probationary and then senior lecturer is permanent.\n\nHowever, \"tenure\" does not exist in the same sense as in the US.",

          "text": "Lecturers are not (necessarily) probationary. It is quite possible to be a permanent lecturer and stay there for the whole of your career, never getting promoted but being permanent (\"tenured\") and hard to get rid of.\n\nRE: the original question, if you are hired on a permanent contract (typically as a new lecturer), most places will consider you on \"probation\" for the first few years. There will be some targets/hoops to jump through and you can then apply for permanency. However it is nowhere near as hard as the tenure process in the US, and it is very rare for people to not get permanency (worst case, it is delayed by a year or two). Where I work, a mid-table research and teaching uni, as long as you show you can do the main aspects of the job you will pass.",

                          "text": "For OP and other interested readers there are big differences between pay grades and criteria for the different academic levels across institutions. \n\nAt some research intensives you\u2019ll find the pay grades are a little higher than others. At my institution a Lecturer starts at the same grade as a Senior Lecturer at other places.\n\nBut there are also differences in what is required for SL (in terms of research, teaching, impact etc). A couple of my friends at post-92s were promoted to Senior Lecturer after one or two years probation. One of those friends then moved to a pre-92 and they refused to make them an SL because the criteria aren\u2019t the same. This is fairly common from my experience and down to the fact the demands for each grade are higher at some institutions. At my institution promotion is bloody difficult and you need a book and about 8 articles to even stand a chance at SL (in a college of social sciences) whereas one of my old colleagues is SL at a post-92 with 2 articles. Of course this is just one box to tick out of many but just to illustrate the often wild differences. \n\nMost pre-92s have 3 year probation and once you\u2019re released you stay as Lecturer. Promotion is a whole different process, committee and some places do external review of promotion applications to SL\u2026 not just Reader and Professor.",
