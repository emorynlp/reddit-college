  "text": "My PostDoc advisor wants me to work on my PhD project and extend it. It's a good project and I already published a few papers from it. However, I'm simply just sick of that project and also I think maybe I should broaden my research a little bit instead of keep working on that very narrow area. Is it a good idea to continue your PhD work if you want to find a tenure track position after your PhD? Any tips in term of choosing research interests and projects during PostDoc is very much appreciated in general (the goal is to be able to get a K grant and a tenure track faculty position).",

      "text": "Whatever gives you the best shot at securing some postdoctoral funding! I worked very briefly in my PhD area after graduating, but when funding ran out I took a lateral step and ended up shifting research areas (from drug use to HIV health). It's important to be able to \"tell a story\" with your research track record (i.e., ensure it's not completely haphazard), but you also want to avoid pigeon-holing yourself in a very niche area, or ending up in a position where you can't find any money.",

This is a big part of the F32, and the F32 is a big part of the K. If you want to start a lab, think about the work you want to do, find your weakness and go get trained.",

A good PI would tell you to get out and maybe stay in touch. Even collaborate in the future, but for the postdoc to get out.",

Maybe you can compromise and continue your PhD project, but include a side project that is tangentially related but that you're not sick of. As someone else mentioned, you want to be able to tell a cohesive story - one that is able to be funded, no less.",
