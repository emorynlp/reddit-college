  "title:": "How to take advantage of online academic conferences? (I need tips for getting feedback from other speakers)",
  "text": "We all know that covid made a big impact on how academic events were held, It brough a lot of advantages, but also a lot of limiting factors. In november I am participating as a speaker in an international congress, but instead of conecting in a zoom meeting or something like that, I was asked to send a video. I found the task exciting, but then I relized that I'm loosing a lot, I wont be able to iteract too much with the other speakers (at least not in my presentation), therefore I wont get live feedback. \n\nWhat would you sugest to help me to encourage feedback on other channels?",

      "text": "I was on online conferences that had this format. They had also a live slot for questions to the presenters. Are you sure that this conference does not have a similar thing? If the time tables are not fully set yet, you could also ask if they were willing to implement something like that.",
