  "title:": "To grad students/established professors: how do you get rid of researchphobia or just general anxiety of doing research?",
  "text": "So I am planning to enter grad school. I know I just have to because my dream job requires me to have at least a masters degree( I want to teach college). I only have like one or two research works (one special problem and one undergraduate thesis) and both are deemed unpublishable in journals. Now this may have put a dent on my confidence doing research but I can summarize my reasons on why I generally loathe/fear doing research:\n\n1. What if my research is not journal worthy?\n2. I feel like I lack the training to even pull off a good research topic. I haven't done a lot of laboratory techniques  on my field (cell biology). Most of my trainings are pure lecture classes with a little bit of paper reportings.(Case in point: molecular genetics. I know the gal and ara operon machinery and viral genetics but I have never done a recombinant DNA technology experiment.)  And most research technician jobs require experience so I cannot apply to those either prior to applying to grad school.\n3. I feel like everything has been discovered already. \n4. They said that in academe you should be writing for grants. I don't even have the creativity to think of a good topic. My thesis was just a sub topic under a project of one of my professors, so I know the idea didn't come from me.\n5. I feel like my writing skills are not up to par with like science standards. I still make grammar mistakes from time to time. \n6. I sometimes lack the comprehension skills to understand a single paper. Takes me like 2-3 days just to fully absorb everything in it. I blame my lack of hands on training lol \n7. Overall I think I just have some rejection sensitivity dysphoria lol \n\nHow did you overcome this (if ever you went on this stage)? Any suggestions? I think I gotta clear my mind of this if I am to enter and apply to programs next year.\n\n\nYour advice is greatly appreciated.",

IME this is around the 100-200th paper mark, if you\u2019re reading casually (which you usually will be).\n\nNothing shatters those rose-tinted glasses quite like reading the kind of flawed work that gets published in reputable journals. No one has discovered anything, and what they have discovered, they have incorrectly characterised. And the same will be true of your work too. Everyone\u2019s work is a work in progress, and then we die and hand the baton on to the next generation.",

You don't do any of it alone. \nHating rejection is the normal state of being for probably 99% of humans. But your supervisor should be very well published which means they'll guide you to produce research that's publishable.\nThat's much of their job in academia. \n\nGive it a go. If you hate it, leave and do something different. You're not stuck.",

First of all, different journals have different requirements\u2014some of them are more likely to accept lower quality work than others. Second, as everyone as suggested, read papers. You\u2019ll learn the dos and donts that way\n\n2. Get hands on experience ASAP. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s required. But a lot of masters students don\u2019t have it. Try to volunteer somewhere. I know it\u2019s not always possible but I worked 4 days a week while volunteering one day a week and got the best experience ever. Also once you enter a research institution you have the resources. Take classes if you can. See if you can volunteer in a lab if you\u2019re having trouble figuring out how to make it happen\n\n3. Lol not even close\n\n4. Most of science is building off of research done already. Did you figure out what sub topic you wanted to do for your thesis? In that case that\u2019s some creativity! Find an area you\u2019re interested in, read a ton about it, identify the gaps in the literature, and go from there\n\n5. Writing is really important but honestly a lot of scientists don\u2019t have the best writing skills. It\u2019s something to work on. But everyone makes grammar mistakes. Get grammerly if you\u2019re really worried. Also take advantage of any writing workshops your university offers\n\n6. Lol welcome to my life. It may very well partially stem from your lack of hands on training but also\u2026science is hard. Sometimes it takes me a few days to really understand a proper cuz it\u2019s so dense. Also keep in mind that each paper you\u2019re reading is written by a different person and not everyone explains everything correctly\n\n7. Every single researcher gets rejections. Like TONS.

Make sure that through your program you contribute to other peoples publications so that you can learn the standards and processes in your field. \n\n2. If you need these skills for your field, make sure you learn them during grad school. If they aren\u2019t part of your core coursework, find electives that teach them, or get work in labs where you can learn them. \n\n3. Nope. You\u2019ll learn where the holes are by reading papers. \n\n4. Same as 3 above. \n\n5. Read more papers. Do a bit of practice writing (100-200 words) every day. Take every opportunity you can get to get feedback on your writing from lots of different people. Practice using that feedback, especially the feedback you don\u2019t immediately agree with. \n\n6. Read more papers - it\u2019s a skill and you will get faster as you practice it more. \n\n7. This seems like something you should be talking to a trusted professional about. \n\nBasically, you\u2019re at the start of a process that should help you develop the skills you\u2019re looking for. Trust the process, do the work, and you will get there.",
