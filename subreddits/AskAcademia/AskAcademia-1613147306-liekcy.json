  "text": "Any fellow academics here like to smoke marijuana now and then? Just curious - how long have you been smoking? How often do you do it? Do you feel it has impeded or facilitated academic progress, directly or indirectly? \n\nPersonally, as someone quite high strung, I find it helpful for relaxation some weekends when I'm feeling burntout. Curious about other people's experiences.\n\nEdit: thanks for the post awards! Glad this resonated. I'm also surprised to see that academic-ents on here are also averse to drinking (so am I!)",

No, it doesn't impede my scholarly work. I don't give lectures  or do research stoned, but I do find it helps my writing (not my editing). \n\nWhere I live, it's legal.

I think when used in moderation, weed is great. But I'm just not someone who can use only on the weekends. And when you do it all the time, it can become more agitating than it is relaxing.
