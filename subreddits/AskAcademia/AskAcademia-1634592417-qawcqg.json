  "title:": "Is a PhD advisor with no funding for the past few years automatically a bad advisor?",
  "text": "I have a PhD advisor in mind who did not have grant for past few years. This is what I hear from his past/current students. But he is a nice person, and is responsive and gives feedback fairly and promptly. He also spends a lot of time, and advises many masters students, but not many PhD students. Is this kind of professor with no funding automatically a bad advisor? Or is it just a reflection that his science (he is still rigorous and thinks critically) is not in fashion?",

How are they currently funding their research? Have you discussed how you would be funded as their student? You may have to TA more in that lab than you otherwise would, and you may be limited on the type of experiments you can run. If they lack funding for too long the lab could be shut down, and that would be a big challenge in the middle of a PhD.",

I can work in a field where you can have an army of PhD students with no grant funding because there simply isn't any cost to doing research beyond (maybe) affording a compute cluster. You want grant funding to afford your summer salary, pay an RA, and possibly bring in some post-docs, but beyond that it isn't really relevant. And the lack of funding wouldn't hinder a PhD student; they probably aren't seeing the money anyway.",

Next, it's hard to say without knowing more about the institution, field of research, where the prof is in their career, but I wouldn't say lack of funding means they're a bad advisor. It might just be that securing research in their particular area of research is particularly challenging compared to others. As long as it won't impact you, I don't think it's a problem. But that's not necessarily something you can gauge at this point. The best you can do is have a conversation about how your position and research will be funded.",

That's a lot of work.\n\nBut all of his students have gone on to do cool things and a higher percentage have stayed in academia than the average in our department.  \n\n\nEdit: My point is that there's no one dimension that decides whether one is a good fit with a PhD advisor.
