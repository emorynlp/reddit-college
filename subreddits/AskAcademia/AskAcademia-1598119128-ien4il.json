  "text": "I tried for a PhD in Sociology starting in 2013 and over four years had a ton of incompleted and inevitably just left. The department was terribly snobbish and my advisor was zero help. I am a first time graduate student in my family and no one understood my choice. I ended up moving to a state knowing nobody and had a miscarriage in my first semester. That compounded with a toxic relationship, my mother becoming homeless and other various personal failures in my late twenties. \n\nIt haunts me every day of my life. \n\nI miss Academia. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel if I had known certain things before I would have been better prepared, picked a better department, demanded better mentorship. \n\nDo you think it would ever be possible to get into another program with such a big failure already? I want to either have hope of redemption or just get over the fact I\u2019ll never be able to get a phD again because no one will accept that many incompletes.",

      "text": "Yes, it's possible.\n\nYour challenges are completely understandable. You experienced personal tragedy, supported a family member with an emergency, and, as a first generation grad student, did not have the privilege that other folks have when it comes to the kinds of intangible things that help people to get support and navigate challenging situations within a university. It is not your fault that your mentor was not supportive.\n\nIs there a professor from your past (it could be undergrad, or someone other than your advisor in your grad program) who you feel like you can turn to? Someone who can guide you through the process of re-applying and managing how you describe this?\n\nThe good news is that if you were qualified to enter a Ph.D. program once (and I fully believe you were), you're still qualified now. The challenge may be conveying that, in the context of being outside of the academe for seven years, as part of your application materials. Depending upon what you are doing now, you may find it helpful to consider what new experiences you can build now that will strengthen your application for graduate schools this next time. You may also find that, with such a long gap, you are more likely to be admitted to a masters program, and can apply for Ph.D. programs afterward.\n\nIdeally, a letter writer who is familiar with your situation can provide some context to your application materials--not necessarily sharing every single detail, but sharing enough that programs know that you were experiencing difficult personal circumstances that (I hope) are better now. (You may be able to speak to it in your own materials as well, but I would do so very carefully--you might very briefly speak to lessons learned and certainly to your continued interest in the field, but I would avoid speaking ill of your previous graduate program.)\n\nI also want to emphasize that you have not failed. I am sure that you tried the best you could at the time (which may not be the same as your best during better times). You experienced personal tragedies and did not have the support that you needed to succeed and thrive in your program; it would have taken far more for you to succeed in your program at that time than it would for the average student to. Not everybody experiences a linear path, and while your path has been paved with hardship and tragedy, I also imagine that you have a wisdom and perspective from your lived experiences that can help you to make a meaningful and genuine contribution to your field. I wish you all of the best as you work toward reapplying for graduate programs.",

You\u2019ve offer some great insights I hadn\u2019t thought about, which is exactly why I came here. And of course validation that my experiences were understandable feels humanizing. \n\nI do have one professor that I think would support my reapplication. And in conjunction, I think it could work well for applying to just a masters program in hopes to continue. This professor was quantitative heavy and I did very well. In fact I\u2019d been thinking of either pursuing a department that was more quantitative (mine was heavily qualitative) or a field similar but with more quant, like economics. I already have a masters in global policy which focused a lot on international trade and finance, so economics isn\u2019t a stretch for me. \n\nThank you again though. I think maybe a masters (again) strategy might be an angle I could tackle first to re-enter academia and regain confidence as well as the appropriate faculty support and develop newer research and writing sample for application to a PhD.",

      "text": "/u/jogam's comment is wonderful.\n\nI'm just chiming in to emphasize two things: you absolutely could get into another program. You'd just have to talk *briefly* and strategically about **1)** your prior experience, **2)** what's changed that now makes it possible for you to pursue the PhD with renewed focus, and **3)** as always, present a compelling and nuanced research project in conversation with canonical and new scholarly work. \n\nWhen you discuss (concisely!) your prior experience, you can point to certain variables that hindered your progress, but **don't badmouth the institution or faculty.** Make it more about it being a \"poor fit\" and external problems not within your control, like your mother's homelessness. Jogam is right that your letter writers can and should address these issues, too, but I think a brief acknowledgment from you would also be helpful to committees.\n\nMy second point is: please think carefully about returning to academia. Many sociology PhD programs are suspending graduate admissions and/or reducing cohort size for the next several years. COVID 19 is just intensifying problems that already existed. The academic job market across almost all disciplines is terrible. Things have only continued to worsen. \n\nAlmost 80% of faculty jobs are non-tenure track. If contingent faculty were treated well and paid fairly, this might be okay. But adjuncts are treated horrendously; they might teach five classes a semester (spread across multiple colleges), get paid anywhere from $1000-3000 per class, and are often denied health benefits due to the length of their contracts.\n\nYou might ask yourself: do you still want to return to academia if you won't end up with a  tenure track position at the end? I'm ***not*** saying don't work hard or hope for the best. I'm saying learn as much as possible about the realities of being contingent faculty and consider what other kinds of careers you might pursue with such a degree. Best of luck with everything!",

No one is retiring, no new positions open up, all money goes to barely living wages for adjuncts, to admins, to amenities. Unless you\u2019ve been preparing for it and have the right accolades and awards, know the right people, do the right publications with the right labs, there\u2019s not even a chance. And then you\u2019re competing against people from elite universities so you\u2019d better go to one for your field.\n\nUniversities are grossly misleading about grad school and profs lead the charge because guess who needs cheap grad labor to publish? It\u2019s a pyramid scheme. People get the impression that with a plucky attitude they will somehow rise above. It\u2019s not the case.",

              "text": "I agree with you, but I hesitate to label it a pyramid scheme because it seems like many the issues stem from a lack of thoughtfulness and care rather than malice. I\u2019m open to changing my opinion though.\n\nAs a young professor who\u2019s working hard to inform undergrads, I\u2019ve heard bad advice doled out by older faculty who haven\u2019t had to deal with the market in decades. (There are exceptions, of course.) It's so frustrating that they give out this advice even though they must see their own graduate students struggling.\n\nIn many fields, particularly in the humanities, graduate students don\u2019t contribute at all to faculty publications. But across the humanities, social sciences, and STEM, cheap grad labor for **teaching** is a key factor. Since I\u2019m junior faculty, I don\u2019t know enough to know if university administrators support the overproduction of PhDs to fulfill this specific purpose. It sounds plausible though.\n\nI also don\u2019t have a sense that universities as a whole mislead students about academia. My impression has always been that academia is very exclusionary and lacks transparency\u2014not that it\u2019s advertising itself for everyone to join in flashing lights. \n\nBut, to be fair, I'm definitely not the target demographic for academia (grew up very poor, first person in my family to go to college, woman of color). So, it\u2019s very possible I just wasn\u2019t exposed to the conversations (in the public and private sphere) that encourage people to attend grad school. The appeal of academia depends on a level of insider knowledge. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ll mention that the job markets are so bad that the vast majority of my friends\u2014who I made while doing a PhD at one Ivy and a fellowship at another Ivy\u2014have been on the market for like four to six years now and have been unable to get TT jobs, despite their achievements in research and teaching. So, while going to the top schools for your specific discipline is definitely important, it doesn\u2019t matter when there simply are no jobs.",

Students barely know the difference anyway, so they won\u2019t complain. \n\nI think that was one of a hundred pitfalls for me. I suddenly found myself teaching over 90 students in a discussion sections and I put so much energy into it because I\u2019m passionate about undergraduate education, but that is the wrong move if you want to succeed in academia. And it\u2019s heartbreaking. Teaching gets no credit and the whole publish or perish environment is toxic to everyone. Sigh.",

I also have friends from top public R1s like UC Berkeley and U Chicago who haven\u2019t been able to get tenure-track positions. \n\nObviously, these people have gotten TT campus visits, prestigious postdocs, multi-year visiting assistant professorships, and the like, but the whole goal is the stability and freedom of a TT job. And adjuncts are horrifically exploited, so that's not a sustainable route, even though some people follow it.\n\nThey all have great non-academic jobs now, so they're not doomed. But it\u2019s still hard to work toward a goal for so long and to get rejected for structural reasons beyond one\u2019s control. Two statistics may put things in perspective: \n\n**1)** Nearly 80% of all faculty positions are non-tenure track. \n\n**2)** Roughly 93% of all graduates in the social sciences and humanities will never get a tenure-track position.\n\nThese numbers will only grow post-COVID, in part because university administrators benefit from how \"disposable\" contingent faculty are.

I know it\u2019s asking a lot for your time to answer such personal questions for an anonymous stranger. \n\nI think if I were to apply anywhere I\u2019d definitely keep the discussion of my prior experience about me and the circumstances out of my control. I\u2019d never bad mouth another department or other faculty... I know people know people. Plus it just looks bad on me. I think enough went wrong for me that I really can attribute it to fit and because I am first generation grad student, not only did I not know about fit, but I wouldn\u2019t have understood it has someone told me. \n\nThat\u2019s the thing I hate about my experiences looking back. There was so much about graduate school I was just completely unprepared for. I am not one to regret, but I think if only I had someone to guide me through I\u2019d have done better, but I was always shocked at how much even professors and my cohort just didn\u2019t know was privileged knowledge. Oy, enough lamenting. \n\nTo your second point, I am definitely not naive to this. I of course made a lot of friends some of which have finished their PhDs and others are still in the program. They are all struggling. I\u2019m not blind to the fact that academia as we knew it is mostly gone and I will never be competitive enough to grab one of the few tenure positions left. I think that\u2019s why if I went back, like I said above, I\u2019d like to focus on my quantitative methodology, because then if I couldn\u2019t go down the tenure path (highly likely) I could pursue many other careers in research, government etc.  So I do think that is an excellent point, which is sad. I certainly do not want to be one of those adjuncts. I\u2019ve looked into it already actually because I have enough credits to teach at a community college and you\u2019re right, they get paid so little it\u2019s borderline criminal. \n\nThank you again!",

      "text": "Do not listen to the other posters. They are setting you up for more failures. You already failed once, in a field that is useless in the real world no less. Stop wasting more of your time trying to get a stupid PhD. Even if you complete it your chance of finding a good job in academia is close to nil. Go find a job more useful to society that pays a living wage, and start your life over. Get a therapist too.",
