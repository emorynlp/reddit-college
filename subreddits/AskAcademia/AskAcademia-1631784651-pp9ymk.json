  "text": "I'm in my first year of a PhD and just coming off 12 months of home working.\n\nTo me, the most crucial thing I've come to terms with is that I can't be expected to perform the way I did when I was on campus, especially because of the distractions or general setup I have at home.\n\nMoreover, I suppose it's also important to not judge productivity based upon raw output. Sometimes I only mabage to work 4 hours in a day or only make it through one article when I had 3 queued up. \n\nWhat are some good pointers or tools you've come to use?",

Part of being an advisor is being a manager in the classic business sense. Some of these people have not worked a day in their life, and will not know how to coach you to be the best researcher you can be. In that sense you are on your own with some advisors. After my PhD program in one of the STEM disciplines I worked at the school for a young business professor to do research, I also did my MBA in that business school, before going into industry. My boss had industry, management experience, and was a great researcher, way smoother sailing compared to my PhD experience.",

      "text": "This might be controversial, but the PhD doesn\u2019t matter. 99% of the population don\u2019t have one and are living. It\u2019s just a degree. Tying your self worth to a title and piece of paper is a recipe for misery, and I felt liberated to do better work and enjoy the work once I realised how unimportant it is.",
