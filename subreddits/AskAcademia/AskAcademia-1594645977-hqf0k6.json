  "text": "My wife and I are strongly considering leaving the US once she\u2019s finished with her PhD. We\u2019re tired of all the issues and it seems like it should be moving in the right direction but it will probably be small changes. We\u2019ve been discussing other places to move and are mostly interested in Canada and Europe. Anyone have experience or knowledge as US academic expats here? Can you recommend a place to go? Obviously if it\u2019s easier to assimilate into the culture and find work that would be preferable. Thanks!",

      "text": "Australia has relatively low teaching and pays well for post-docs. I know some people who emigrated there and love it. Personally, there are some aspects of the culture I don't like, but ymmv. Like most non-US countries, bureaucracy is higher but things work well.\n\nCanada is hard for non-residents to gain access to, but probably the most comfortable if you're coming from the US. It has the advantage that it's close to the US without being the US, so sometimes you can get US grants and anyway you are part of the North American network, which helps.\n\nThe UK pays horribly, but almost any place that is not the US pays worse than the US. Still, the UK is the worst on that front. They pay in prestige. Bureaucracy is said to be pretty bad.\n\nEurope: varies by country, and maybe by field. The academic system is generally very different, though a few places are trying to do things the American way. Hiring seems to be more network-based, so as an outsider you may have difficulty getting in unless you know someone or can make a plausible case as to why you're particularly interested. Schools don't want to waste time on people unlikely to take up their offer. Pay in Europe in my field seems to be between the UK and Canada. Benefits are good, though. It's simply a different system that emphasizes different things.\n\nNew Zealand: New Zealand is to Australia what Canada is to the US. (Exaggerating.) Smaller, no universities that compete at the very, very top end but people don't go to very top ones anyway and they do have solid ones. A bit more liberal. Prettiest country by a mile.\n\nHong Kong, Singapore: you said Canada and Europe, but you can speak English here, too, and they are very international ciities. Again, I don't know about your field, but these cities can pay very well in general - better than the US. It could be hard to live under the more restrictive governments, though. There's an active expat community in both places.\n\nThe easiest cultures to adjust to, I would guess, would be Canada, followed by the UK, Australia and New Zealand in some order. In normal times, New Zealand, Australia or the UK would be easier to get into. Under the pandemic, everything is hard everywhere.\n\nA thing I would highlight is that it's probably best to start your career in North America even if you don't want to stay. Getting to meet people at seminars and conferences is crucial for early stage researchers, and you would be a bit isolated in the UK/Europe (and certainly in any of the other places I mentioned), though certainly they have their own academic network. Depending on your interests, you may find that people focus on different topics or methods in North America vs. Europe. It's subtly different.",

In general assuming you will have so many offers that you\u2019ll have a choice where to move is pretty ambitious. Where does her advisor have collaborators? If she is competitive for an nsf postdoc than your problem is basically solved for a few years, live wherever you like. \n\nThe timing of this really sounds like \u201cI\u2019m moving to Canada after the election\u201d and then you\u2019re always so shocked that immigrating is an arduous process. Be warned also that the academic spouses I know typically did not qualify for work permits during their partners\u2019 postdocs unless they found an employer on their own who would sort out their visa and work permit issues. Given the current circumstances I think that will be very difficult. Also, the job market for junior postdocs might not be flattened by the pandemic, but the tenure-track market and the market for senior postdocs is going to be just apocalyptic. People with much fuller CVs are going to be on the market that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be.",

If this is role is in academia, good. Otherwise, bite the bullet and just take whatever it is to get in at least, that way you'll be seen as a PR when you do apply for said academic jobs.\n* Research potential locations in Canada and what you want. Canadian politics are more diverse than you think. Because you're in America, you'll be coming in used to seeing politics as blue vs. red, but here you'll find a more diverse spectrum of beliefs you didn't consider. So go to the subreddits of different provinces and ask them what the culture is like there.  \n\n\nI didn't come in the exact way you did. I got lucky because my wife is Canadian.

As a rule of thumb, at least enough for both of you to live off of from six months to a year (year, again, just being ideal) just in case something crazy like a pandemic happens, as if that'll ever happen... $20,000 is a ballpark estimate. What it takes to live month to month has just as much to do with how you manage expenses as much as where you're living (Toronto, for example, is quite expensive in Canadian terms).\n\nEven Ph.D. graduates here are biting this bullet now, due to what the virus has done. So hopefully that helps you feel less alone. It's hard to say what the market will be several years from now, and Canada wasn't hit as hard as the US during the previous recession, for example.

I wouldn't want to see that my \"best decision I ever made\" statement gives an excuse for irrational thoughts of \"See, the grass is greener over there!\" When I left, I had already known my long term goal was to leave the US for years since the 2009 recession. If both of you are only angry with this Trump guy, I would think a little deeper about why you want to leave. My reason's were pretty broad and holistic regarding my dislike of living in the US. For me personally, the positive and negatives of both countries made Canada a clear winner, but for deeper reasons. If you're more curious, feel free to DM me.\n\nAnd ya, BC is definitely beautiful! My wife and I are considering moving to this area after I finish my Ph.D. Ontario is fine too, but places like Toronto are just too expensive if you plan to raise a family with less stress.

You should be easily able to get PR in Canada, but landing the job you want might be a lot tougher.

I picked a country (sweden) did duolingo until i could say I have basic knowledge and added that to my resume\n*  I think learning the differences of your culture and countries work culture and the companies work culture is important.  i.e if a japanese company has a large branch in sweden, how do you craft your resume , how do answer interview questions. vs what you do for a swedish company in sweden etc.",

The places that had job openings offered at universities that I predominantly saw in Switzerland for my field were at eth or epfl. The person in my above post was at epfl.  The big universities with lots of research tend to have the more means for international hiring; however, this comes with the competitiveness of completing against highly skilled candidates because of the university\u2019s prestige.  Ergo you should be aiming to be of MIT caliber to be competitive for those positions.  Something I don\u2019t think many Americans know.  \n\nHowever there are definitely other colleges who might be a great fit for the OP and gf.  So far when looking at companies colleges the smaller the place is the less likely they want to put towards funds for international hiring.  Not saying it can\u2019t be done,  yet definitely something to think about.",

      "text": "Australia's definitely not a great place right now. Before the 'rona, the uni system was highly dependent on International Students money to the point that they would bring whole village full of non-English speakers and bend over backwards to pass them. \n\n [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-07/emails-show-academics-concerns-over-students/11073166?nw=0](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-07/emails-show-academics-concerns-over-students/11073166?nw=0) \n\n [https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/cash-cows/11084858](https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/cash-cows/11084858) \n\nTheir two largest markets were Chinese and Indian students, which were already declining before 'rona. After, the PM picked a fight with Emperor Xi, so the Chinese are probably not coming back.\n\n [https://www.sbs.com.au/news/students-in-china-heed-their-government-s-warnings-against-studying-in-australia-less-than-half-plan-to-come-back](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/students-in-china-heed-their-government-s-warnings-against-studying-in-australia-less-than-half-plan-to-come-back) \n\nIf you want to go abroad to teach and you're caucasian, I guess the \"Leftie Heaven\" of ~~Ardernia~~  New Zealand seems to be the safest bet. It's pretty far and secluded (see eg: /r/mapswithoutNZ) But even before the 'rona, they're already a popular destination for International students who disliked/rejected by USA after Trump. \n\n [https://www.educationnext.org/has-president-trump-scared-away-foreign-students-facts-behind-fears-higher-education-revenue-recession/](https://www.educationnext.org/has-president-trump-scared-away-foreign-students-facts-behind-fears-higher-education-revenue-recession/) \n\nNow, with Australia's Higher Education collapse, NZ will probably be like [Ellen after Oprah went off-air](https://youtu.be/98HV3H56Jyo?t=65). \n\nThe other country to consider is perhaps the UK. After Brexit, they ran out of cheap labor to exploit because the Eastern Europeans needed to GTFO, so their strategy to fill in the void of cheap workers is to promise Indians residency via higher education. This seems to be working, and their HE system will fare better than Australia in the coming years.\n\n [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/immigration-system-in-post-brexit-uk-follows-the-canadian-australian-model-of-granting-permanent-residence/articleshow/74260558.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/immigration-system-in-post-brexit-uk-follows-the-canadian-australian-model-of-granting-permanent-residence/articleshow/74260558.cms?from=mdr)",
