  "text": " Hi everybody!\n\nI  am international student and graduated master research course in Aus.  My profesor already contacted with me last week to suggest me  scholarship in PHD. Although i did not have any publications but my WAM  is quiet high (over 85). So the probability of having scholarship is  high? And how long i get outcome of my scholarship after submitting EOI?",

      "text": "Your probability to get scholarship depends on your competitors. Good WAM will definitely help but the most important one is proof that you can do research. Considering you do master by research, it means you have a research experience already albeit no publication yet. If your PhD project is the same as your master research, your probability to get the scholarship will significantly increase.\n\nFor the outcome, that really depends on the committees. Probably about a month or so.\n\nFYI, PhD Unimelb here.",

      "text": "Uni Melb Masters grad here. My WAM was also around 85. When I was scoping the possibility of PhD I was told that because of how competitive stipends are, for internationals the minimum WAM would be 90, and around 85 for residential applicants. This was in the Environment streams. It may differ depending on what your area is, and how competitive it is. From memory, I think the stipend was around 47k p.a. don't quote me on that, though.",
