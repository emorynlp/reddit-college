  "title:": "My father mailed my now ex advisor",
  "text": "Just to get it off my chest I was in a PhD program, worked with a faculty for sometime and didn't get along with him. So I have quit my program. My father knows I have been under a lot of stress and upset because of that.  I don't talk much with him as he is also a part of my anxiety issues. He is too interfering and likes to have his way all the time. He has forced decisions on me since I was a kid just because he thought it was right and would never ever listen to my opinion or what I want because he is the man of the house who makes decisions and everyone else is just supposed to obey and never question. His irresponsible decisions regarding my studies and then forcefully imposing them on me has affected my career a lot and has given me unnecessary anxiety while growing up I was a very confident, carefree, active cbild. So He found the mail address of my chairman online and mailed him and the man I worked with for sometime without telling me or consulting me. He can't fix my life problems like that. If he just becomes less of a sources of anxiety for me it will benefit me greatly rather than going around contacting outsiders to do one thing or another.\n\nI am soooo angry and embarrassed. He has terrible social skills and wherever he goes he picks a fight. Idk why he doesn't understand how terribly vengeful and egoistic faculties can be. And btw who does that. I am not a school student anymore. It's my professional life and it can hurt me badly in future even if he was polite in his mail. It will come across as if I am a kid who can't handle adult responsibilities :/\n\nI have been under a lot of pressure already, I fell sick and have been going in and out of depression and he is making my life worse like he always has. I just hope the faculties will be understanding as I apologized and said I wasn't aware of this. \n\nPlease remove if this doesn't belong here.",

No one in his entire family has studied beyond school/12th grade. The entire family is toxic. Always fighting and arguing and pulling each other down all the time. \nI only told my mother about my problems at PhD and she passed this information to him. She can never digest anything even when I tell her a million times to keep it to her. I am not even going to share anything with my mother as well now. \n\nWhen I started crying and yelling at the phone he sent a sorry mail to him even though he wasn't particularly offensive. But the damage is done.",

Toxic = emotional abuse. domineering = emotional abuse. \"not too smart\" = finding ways to exert abusive control.   \n\n\nI understand that it's difficult to see for what it is, and I urge you to find a professional to talk to about it.",

              "text": "Just to add a third point - abuse doesn't have to be malicious to be abuse. What makes it abusive is the behavior and the harmful effects of the behavior, not the intention behind the behavior.\n\nI have a toxic family, most of which I am no longer in contact with. Their behavior, enabling of bad behavior, and refusal to change or even acknowledge what is wrong causes serious harm - it is abusive. And yet it is absolutely not malicious - my parents believe wholeheartedly that they are doing the best they can, that they are being controlling of their children, shaming them, emotionally manipulating them, lying to them, etc out of love.\n\nIt's a hard thing to square - parents that mean well and also hurt you. It happens, a lot. Therapy helped me come to terms with it and find boundaries that work for me. Please don't let your parents' good intentions be an excuse for continued harm. ",

But see, it is not the end of the world. Your ex-advisor knows that it was not *you* who sent the e-mail and that you are mortified about it.\n\nMy suggestion is to ignore it happened and move on with your professional life, and keep your father in the dark just to be safe in the future.\n\nI wish you all the success, this too shall pass friend.

I can't imagine how I would react because that would really be the peak of inappropriateness. It is good that you contacted your advisor and said you were not aware of this. Unfortunately you can't control other people and hopefully your advisor will understand this. It shouldn't affect your future professional life unless your advisor shares this with anyone, but that would be extremely unprofessional on their part. If I were you, I would revoke your parents' privilege of being in-the-know about your professional life. Again, sorry to hear about this, I can't imagine how embarrassing that must be.",

If your old mans a problem you can't deal with, stop dealing with it.\n\nAlso like others have said, it may be embarrassing but its certainly not the first time any faculty has heard from parents and their response will always be the same, \"I can't discuss a student with you have a great day.\" It's not going to give them a negative opinion of you.",
