  "text": "Has there been any instance in your life where you felt like: \"Okay, my life has come to a halt! People around me are doing crazy amazing jobs and what am I doing? Grinding myself into the whirl of higher knowledge and studies, that someone might not even consider while trying for a job?\" I can tell you from my personal experience that there have been instances from my life where I have seen people excel so much in their lives. Like one of the people I know (with whom I have studied basically) is being recognized by many people outside of my country. He's doing some pretty amazing business collaborations (UX and stuff, tbh) and I am grinding myself to learn how drug delivery systems work! I don't even know whether people would recognize this in the future or not.\n\nIt might sound like I am jealous of him. Well, in a way, you would be right! I might be jealous that wonderful things are happening to everyone else other than me. I have been really pushing myself to do some cool stuff and I must say that I have succeeded in some as well (that I am proud of, tbh!) but in real life, it seems I am out of the race and they are far beyond my reach. Is this my guilt of not driving in the right way as him? Or, is it my imposter syndrome that is hindering me to make progress? Have you felt like this is now the stopping point in my life and feel like you are engulfed by total darkness and nothing seems to be okay now! What are your personal experiences? Could you share? How did you find a way to tackle it, if you have any!\n\nWould love any advice or hear your story out!",

Again I felt like I didn't belong.\n\nEven now it's odd.. I work like 30 hours most weeks and because of the way I designed my programs I'm now publishing 5-10 publications as PI/CoPI, applying for grants, and service.\n\nBasically I'm doing the bare minimum amount of work and I keep getting better and better at what I do to the point I'm now a fellow at my university and still have no idea why....\n\nI've been in academia only 4 years and wildy successfully with doing the bare minimum.... the amount of imposter syndrome I have is overwhelming but I keep doing what I'm doing and for some reason it works...",

So we torture ourselves by comparing ourselves with the smartest and most successful 0.01% of the population.   \nI guarantee most people would consider you very successful, smart, and priviledged.

I didn't fight. I didn't get shot. I was the mail clerk for a battalion of 600ish soldiers. I worked nights, mostly, and did a half assed job at that.\n\nOutside of that one incident though I've never experienced imposter syndrome.

I have to go out and strategize/seize them for myself. It's a pep talk of sorts. \n\nThe other thing is that I ended up in my safety school for the PhD, so I have been experiencing the opposite of the imposter syndrome I dealt with in my master's program. It's cringe hearing people in my program talk about imposter syndrome when the academic quality here is nowhere near Ivy/Oxbridge. I'm truly puzzled at who they think they are impostering lol. But the vibe here is super nice and all about helping each other, so my mental health has been at ease.",
