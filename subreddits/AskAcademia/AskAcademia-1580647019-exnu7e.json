  "title:": "PhD supervisors want me to collect more data, I feel like I've done enough already. How should I handle the situation?",
  "text": "For the past 3 years I've been conducting a PhD within industry, which has been very difficult because the host company has provided barely any of the access/support they initially promised. Despite this I've managed to be fairly productive, and have achieved 5 first-author publications so far with 4 more currently in the pipeline (including 2 literature reviews, 6 research studies, and 1 book chapter). The research isn't everything I hoped it would be (I've had some pretty low sample sizes, for example), but essentially I feel like I've done all that I can from a bad situation. My funding has run out, so I want to get the PhD wrapped up and hopefully start to apply for postdocs. My \"PhD by article\" can only include 3-5 publications anyway, so I feel like I've done enough.\n\nMy PhD supervisors disagree. They say that the overall project is lacking a study which wraps up the series of work and validates the approach I've taken. I'm not sure I agree with them (research is never complete, there's always \"one more study\", etc), and if I'm being cynical it feels like they're just trying to milk me for as many publications as possible (during the PhD, they've been pretty obvious in prioritising quantity of outputs over quality). Even if they were correct, I'm not sure it's even possibe to conduct the type of study they want - my collaboration with the host company has ended, and I'll now need to fit in all research in my spare time whilst I'm working full time somewhere else. In my opinion it would inevitably lead to extra delays, and I'd then be responsible for paying PhD fees out of my own pocket as the extra months drag by. \n\nHow should I handle this situation? I've sent them an email laying out my concerns, but what if they continue to disagree? Given that they essentially have the final say over when I'm allowed to submit the PhD, what can I do?",

The measure of average graduation times is an accounting mechanism to contain costs to the university. OP said the PhD is externally funded, meaning the university has no incentive (or disincentive) to graduate them in a timely manner. Best case scenario is faculty or administrators that are part of a review mechanism might just personally dislike OP's supervisors. But I would say, the one nearly unassailable argument in a review is \"supervisor believes body of work is insufficient to award degree.\"",

OP said the PhD is externally funded, meaning the university has no incentive (or disincentive) to graduate them in a timely manner.\n\nI'm sure it varies by field, but in many of the sciences, the measure of average graduation times is for training grants and marketing for student recruitment. I was at a school that almost lost its training grant because average graduation time was too long in our department. At many universities (in the US) the uni is only covering costs for the first year of the PhD student and then after that the PI is supporting thr student from their own grants. So the university often doesn't have a financial drain on a 7th year student like they do on a first year. Definitely had issues where a Prof wanted to hang on to a student because they had great funding but the uni was pushing for graduation.",

Likewise, the university will be granting the PhD (the host company are essentially done with me now). It was a joint project, whereby the university would supervise a research project which could (supposedly) be integrated into the operation of the business.

Where is the department head?\n\nThe format of my PhD is slightly irregular - I've been based full-time with the industry partner, and visit the university only a handful of times per year (because it's in a different city). As a result, I'm not really embedded within the department or friendly with the other researchers. I've met them from time to time when I've given a faculty presentation or something similar, but that's about it. I'm not aware of having any sort of PhD committee apart from the two supervisors and one co-supervisor.",
