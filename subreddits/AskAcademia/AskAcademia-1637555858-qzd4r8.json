  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently made a video that shows you how to add text to your thesis that is still in an ongoing manuscript project so that you can sync the text in your thesis if you made changes in your manuscript. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/nvHkJE1XjEw\n\nI hope this helps anyone in their last year in grad school writing up their masters or PhD thesis!\n\n[Tutorial video](https://youtu.be/nvHkJE1XjEw)",
