  "text": "Hey guys, so I just started my Ph.D. and there is SO much reading. I knew this would be the case but not this much and some of the readings are somewhat dense (AKA: they take longer to get through).\n\nMany of my readings are not just papers but excerpts from text books, articles, special sections of a journal etc. It's been very time consuming to say the least.\n\nAre there any strategies you guys use to get through readings faster? For example I have a bunch of reading due by Wendsday which we will discuss in class. I've been reading and highlighitng etc to try to understand the texts (30-40 pages?). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you",

Reading is either done correctly, or it\u2019s done quickly, and you won\u2019t be doing yourself any favors by choosing the latter. Reading is the main thing you\u2019ll be doing for at least the first year, and it will always form a major part of your career in graduate school and beyond. Settle in. You\u2019ll get used to the workload eventually, and it will seem to go by faster.\n\nThis should be the main thing you do with your days in the first year. Not just reading, but active reading. Take useful notes. Highlight useful passages. Find ways that text A connects with text Z. Your instructor picked those readings for a reason, for a thread woven throughout them all that is somehow essential to your growth. Find that thread, get to know it, and be ready to share your impressions of it in seminar.",

      "text": "Who are these miscreants who highlight in books?\n\nI am in a humanities field and I have to read at high volume, forever. Throw out that highlighter, pencil, anything else you would use to mark a book.\n\nYou need a durable note-taking system that you can return to and understand for the rest of your career. With a highlight you are just decorating and ruining a book or photocopy and not recording any of your own thoughts as you read. \n\nUse a system on computer for taking notes. This can be as simple as opening an MS Word file for every item you're reading and organizing it in a folder with the class name. I use Scrivener to do this because it makes a \"notebook view\" of all my documents related to each project and lets me see their document names as tabs on the left of my screen. Fantastic, but a paid option.\n\nIn each note document, write down the info you need for a bibliography entry in case you use it in a paper (you will). Then, as you are reading, summarize the main ideas in your own words, and record the page number, so you can insert this paraphrase into a paper as needed.\n\nIf your own brilliant ideas occur to you while you are reading (they will), code them and then write them down in the note document.\n\nI use me: as my notation for an idea that is mine. These are the kinds of things you'll bring up in seminar.\n\nThe idea is to go through the text slowly, checking your own comprehension. When you don't understand something, put in a ? and ask a question about it in seminar.\n\nIf there's an idea I know I am going to quote in a paper, I code it with a \\*.\n\nThat way I can search back through a note file looking for me: , ? or \\* and know easily what's important.\n\nIf you're going to work in the same field for life, you might not want to read the same paper thoroughly more than once. I read my old note files. If I do a second reading of the source, I add notes in at the appropriate page numbers. I've just reread a dissertation from the 80s (that was fantastic) that I first read while doing my PhD in the 00s. The fact that my note system is the same as it was then let me integrate notes from both passes.\n\nGrad school is about managing a lot of reading. You may not get through everything in a week. I suggest that you will get more mileage out of reading what you can very well, and having your own thoughts and questions picked out before seminar, than you will from skimming everything.\n\nThat said, you don't always need to read all of a book or a paper. Assess it by its introduction, thesis, and conclusion. The evidence may/may not be of interest. It is especially important to triage secondary sources when you are writing your own papers. Even for seminars, you may have to prioritize if the readings run into the thousands of pages per week when you put all your classes together (mine did).\n\nOn those seminars--if it's \"theory\" and therefore dense, google it. Someone has probably put the main idea of it (if it's famous) on wikipedia. There is likely a key takeaway point that you need for your field, and your professor may/may not explain it, depending on how good at this whole thing they themselves are.\n\nAnd don't feel bad if a \"theory\" reading is hard. I did not understand the point Foucault was trying to make in Discipline and Punish until I read it a second time, ten years later, for a very specific use in a paper, on the suggestion of a peer reviewer. Sometimes the situation has to create the need to use the theory. It doesn't always make sense in the grad school classroom, where you just have what's assigned to you and not the context where you would personally apply it in your work.",

Throw out that highlighter, pencil, anything else you would use to mark a book.\n\nI'm with you on the highlighter; they are useless and serve only as a distraction. But writing marginal notes in pencil is a very useful tool, and much more convenient than breaking your connection with the text to type on a computer. The key is to write useful notes, not just underline stuff.  Active reading strategies in general are what OP needs clearly, and good note taking is a critical part of any of those.",

      "text": "I did my PhD in the UK so the system is a little different as there are no taught classes with discussion of reading. Therefore, my advice to you is in two parts:\n\n1. For stuff you're discussing in class. Go slow, read it carefully. Highlight in two colours - one for 'oh that's essential/key/interesting' and 'what?'. That way, you can easily find the bits you want to discuss and chew over in class. Don't forget that you don't have to do a reading in isolation. You can read (for example) Freud alongside a Freud intro reader, a good set of footnotes, or a commentary on the work by another scholar. Reading in community with other works may sound even more time consuming but I found it's the best way to break down a really chewy text and, after all, academia is a conversation! \n\n2. For stuff you're reading for your thesis. You don't have to read everything and you don't have to read it all. Find a stack of articles that might be relevant, read the first page and ditch them if they aren't. Don't plough through stuff that isn't going to be useful. I use screen reading software to read articles to me sometimes. This means I can sit and think, while it's read to me. The same with audio-books... they can be a lifesaver. Again, keep reading in community with other scholars.\n\nOh, and the best advice of all - keep a list! Use a bibliography manager or just a word doc of references but do it! Nothing worse than having to do it all in one go with a stack of papers, some of which you may not need, and having to sort through them!",

If you've only got 30-40 pages per seminar, that's completely doable and you will find a schedule and a rhythm for how to accomplish that.\n\nHowever, I will say this. Some of my cohort took seminars with a professor who assigned 1000 pages or more per week. With two or three other seminars, there is absolutely no possible way to read every single page across all seminars and retain all that information. It can't be done. In that case, you will have to work on your skimming skills, which includes paying attention to certain parts of articles or books that communicate the main ideas. \n\nI'm also surprised no one mentioned working with your seminar classmates to spread out the readings. By that, I mean that while you should all at least try to get the gist of each reading, you can all make an arrangement that one student spends much more time on reading A, another on reading B, another on C, and so on. This way, while you're all at least looking at ALL the readings, when it comes to seminar, each reading is understood in depth by at least one student. That student can lead discussion, and the rest can take a lot of information from that while contributing where they can. You'll also avoid the awkward moment in seminars where the professor asks you a question about a reading that, by coincidence, no one was able to get to.",

      "text": "Having just finished my comps, lemme say that if you read faster, you will actually retain less.  And yet at the same time, we are all driven by the same necessity to read more.\n\nThe solution to this is reading for your situation.  Very very very few profs even have time to read full books cover to cover.  Every one of them will tell you they frequently have to read THROUGH the books.  What this means, is learn how to break apart the argument.  Learn what they use as evidence, how they piece that evidence together, what frameworks they use, what ultimate conclusions they draw that are new.\n\nThe reason for this is because monographs on topics tend to repeat themselves, especially the preparatory information most academics already know, so they break the information apart to identify the new that they NEED to know.\n\nHowever, I'll caveat this advice with one thing: if you just started your PhD, you may not know enough for an argument breakdown to be of any use.  \n\nFor that, you need to actually read less but more deeply until you have a basic understanding of your field.  Once you achieve a comfortable baseline, then you read more.\n\nI hate saying this but now that I'm on 7 months out from my comps, i have forgotten almost everything I read in detail.  I remember broad strokes, but not some of the more intimate argumentation I prepped for the exam.  \n\nTHIS IS NORMAL.  This is why you take notes.  DO NOT expect to remember everything you read, instead, try to optimize for finding information that will be useful later, that you vaguely remember.  And for that reason alone, reading fast won't help you.  \n\ntl;dr - read less but deeper for content.  read more but shallower for argumentation.  Your brain space is limited, you will forget, so take notes optimized for future retrieval.",

The \"new\" is in quotes because the technique is actually quite old. Its called \"ZettleKasten\" - or the slip-box method. This was developed by a german sociologist in the 60s for his own note-taking and it enabled him to write over 400 papers and a few dozen books. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would look into that. There's a few software out there that really help in this - namely \"Roam Research\" (paid) and \"[Obsidian.md](https://Obsidian.md)\" (Free). I personally use emacs to take notes and create my own zettlekasten. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I had discovered this earlier in my career, as this method has really clicked with me.

I just finished my qualifying exams this summer and these helped me get through the mountain of literature.\n\n1) Know you're exercising a muscle. You are going to have trouble for the first few years reading everything in depth. Practice it. Find ways that work for you. I am a big marker of books (in pen because I am a monster), but I also have a marking system so I can go back quickly. Talk with your peers about their strategies.\n\n2) Reading groups, work groups, and study groups are very helpful. I find it useful because 1) it makes me finish my readings more regularly and 2) I can work through really complicated stuff with the ability to bounce ideas or problems off another person.\n\n3) Work at a desk. Give yourself space that is work related and separate from home related. (If you are able). It'll help keep your mind on track.\n\n4) Take a bath. I get all of my \"ugh I hate this.\" reading done in the bath, because it is relaxing, and it forces me to sit in the same place until I finish the thing. If it isn't a bath, maybe it is a place outside where you can get away and focus? \n\nFinally, you'll kill yourself if you try to read everything in coursework. Find the things that speak to you and really read them. Other things (I'm looking at you Habermas and Bourdieu) you can learn about by trying to read what you can, by listening in class, and by talking with your peers. No one has to read everything, and if you miss something important, you will have peers and mentors who will tell you if there is a gap in your reading.",
