  "title:": "Advice for Transitioning within Academia to Political Science",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am interested in transferring fields within academia. I currently work as an English instructor at a university abroad, and I have an MA in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. I want to transfer fields into International Relations and complete a PhD. My BA is in Comparative Politics and Spanish Literature, but I graduated in 2012 so I'm concerned that experience is not relevant. Also, I have a clear and well-defined research focus, but I am having difficulty finding faculty who specialize in EU Studies & Foreign Policy Analysis.\n\nWhile I do have relevant work experience in both politics and academia, I feel stymied by my academic background and am not sure if it would be possible to change fields. I\u2019ve taught university English abroad for several years now have had lots of amazing international experiences, so now I\u2019d like to return to political studies and move away from pedagogy/composition studies.\n\nMy questions are: 1) is it possible that I may be admitted into an MA/PhD program in Political Science? 2) Would I be competitive for a teaching/research assistantship? 3) If the answers to the previous questions are no, is there some strategy I could take to change the answer to yes (for the previous)? Currently, I speak three languages and have a lot of experience with writing and publishing.\n\nI\u2019m really eager to pursue this career path, and I\u2019ve been planning this transition for a few years now. Unfortunately, it has been hard to put the plan into action because I can't find any definitive information, and I really have no idea how competitive my application would be. I appreciate the time you\u2019ve spent reading my post, and I hope you may be able to help.",

      "text": "You are unlikely to be fundable at the moment for a PhD studentship in the UK, unfortunately, as it's usually an expectation that you'll have an MA in at least a cognate subject for a studentship: you are going to be competing with people who have Firsts at undergrad, and Distinctions in Master's, both in IR, in real terms. So if you wanted to study in the UK, you would improve your chances by doing a taught Master's first, and getting a distinction in your dissertation.  It would be worth a punt applying once you've started your studies, but you will have a stronger chance, and also likely stronger academic references, once you have your MA in hand, so don't lose hope if you aren't successful immediately.\n\nFor EU FPA, I'd look at King's, Birmingham and maybe Warwick or Sussex (on the grounds that I know there's Europe specialists, and FPA specialists, in all those places - you don't necessarily need someone who specialises in EU FPA specifically, mind you) - and check out where the authors of recent articles you have particularly admired are working for more ideas.\n\nIn Europe - EUI in Florence is probably your best option, and they have plenty of funding, too, which helps.\n\nGood luck!",
