  "title:": "Switching fields from Econ to Marketing?",
  "text": "I'm a pretty average economics professor at a pretty average (R2) school in the US. \n\nA lot of what I do seems to have some overlap with marketing and I have been considering trying to shift fields. The motivation for this is threefold: \n\n1) the marketing papers I read are generally more interesting to me than econ\n\n2) the pay is better in marketing \n\n3) I don't love my current job and am tired of feeling stuck (the econ job market is just ridiculously flooded)   \n\nI've even considered going back for a second PhD.    \n\nAre there any marketing profs, or PhD students, willing to talk with me?\n\nA few (of many) general questions I have include: \n\nIf I publish in marketing journals, is this field switch possible w/o graduate credit hours in marketing? \n\nIf I pursued a marketing PhD, is it likely that any of my econ courses (econometrics courses, Industrial Organization, Microecon Theory) would reduce the course work needed for the degree?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "If you already publish in marketing journals, why not just apply to those jobs and see what happens? Most schools will consider you if you already have A journal pubs. No need for additional coursework or a marketing phd. The only thing that will suck is figuring out teaching marketing courses on your own. You\u2019ll quickly find that the students and expectations are nothing like what you are used to and a lot of your colleagues get good evals by teaching the silliest stuff. I made a similar switch. The pay is good, the rest isn\u2019t that great\u2026I still don\u2019t know if I made the right choice. Pretty clear pros and cons.",

          "text": "Thanks for the comments. Very interesting to hear from someone who made a similar switch.  \n\nI haven't tried to get anything into a marketing journal yet, though I hope to give it a try this year. \n\nHonestly, even more than the pay, I envy the higher level of hope for mobility you all have. Any advertised open econ position will get at least 200, usually closer to 300 applications. Doesn't seem like things are nearly that bad in any of the traditional business disciplines.",

              "text": "My management department gets around 100+ each hiring round but usually they are for multiple posts. So the competition is less intense for sure. Mobility-wise, I\u2019m not sure if it is indeed that much better. Perhaps it is for business PhDs, but likely not for a social science PhD that crossed over. One thing I do see is quite different is that most people who fail tenure seem to get a second chance in other departments, which was certainly not how things worked in my social science field due to the stigma and perception that failed tenure = damaged commodity. In management, I\u2019ve even seen someone who got tenure after their 4th try finally. I personally don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have the energy to go through that many TT rounds. Things are certainly more exhausting in b-schools and conversations, much less intellectually stimulating.",

          "text": "Thanks for the comment. \n\nYeah, I have thought about that, but wondered if the $26k was worth it. I certainly don't have any aspirations(delusions?) to teach at some top school , but I'd like to at least stay in the middle of the distribution. For places like that, I wondered if there was much difference between someone with a few good pubs + a bridge certificate vs some with just the pubs. \n\nMaybe the bridge cert makes a difference, I honestly don't know. \n\nAnyone out there have any insights?",
