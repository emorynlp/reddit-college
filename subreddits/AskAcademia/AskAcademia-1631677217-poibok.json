  "title:": "How difficult is it to find a Post-Doc position for international students who got their PhDs in the US?",
  "text": "I typically hear about international students trying to find a job after Masters in their STEM degree and having to go through the difficult process of attaining an H-1B visa.\n\nWhat about PhD students who finish their program and need to do their Post-Doc? Do you face the same hurdles? Are the rules more or less the same?\n\nSay I graduated from Berkeley and want to do my post-doc in the same university, do I still need to apply for an H-1B visa?",

      "text": "A post-doc is a temporary appointment and folks usually use F1-OPT to cover that. Going on a J1 visa after F1-OPT expires is also an option, if you're doing a post-doc that is longer than what your OPT (with STEM extension in your case) would provide.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that if you end up taking a permanent, full-time employment at an academic institute after your post-doc, you'd have to go on an H1-B visa (till your institute applies for a green card \\*). However, there is no cap on H1-B visas for non-profit institutes such as universities, so it's practically guaranteed (modulo admin screw ups and background check failures). This is true for national labs too.  \n\n\n\\*: Not all universities apply for a green card, so you should check that when you accept an offer.",

      "text": "You get a year or two of OPT after your graduation, which is granted (almost) automatically. The caveat is if you do an internship during your PhD, then it lowers the OPT time, so plan accordingly.",
