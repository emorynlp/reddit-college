Otherwise, when it comes to the empirical side, it is entirely possible that articles written 10 years ago use sound methodology (as is the case in my field, where we still don't use articles from 10 years ago unless they are stellar because they are limited by data constraints).\n\n> having access to peer reviewed articles doesn't mean that students know how to properly interpret that research\n\nCertainly. It is useful to have a course that teaches students to read journal articles (which is a separate thing from a methods course, btw). But generally, if you read enough research in a given field, you start figuring out how to interpret it on your own.",

An experienced researcher in a particular field will have met the following tasks along their career path:\n\n* publication to peer-reviewed journals\n\n* systematic review of the literature before undertaking a new research project\n\n* attending and contributing to conferences\n\n* grant chasing\n\n* research centre building or development\n\n* international and/or national collaboration on a research topic\n\n* teaching\n\n* supervision\n\nAny more? Probably. It's possible to get a PhD in some subjects without meeting any of those tasks at all - do a 3 year project on your own with funding granted by the school of choice and submit a traditional thesis not by publication. Such a student would earn themselves a PhD without understanding the many facets of *research* as many of us know it.",
