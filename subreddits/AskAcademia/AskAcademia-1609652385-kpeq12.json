  "text": "Today more than ever people are doing desk jobs. I think academic jobs require a lot of desk work. Even as an undergraduate student of physics I have to sit for long hours. And I know there are several health concerns with that.   \n\n\nHowever, I want to know in this thread if you have any personal experience of health issue due to sitting for too long? And what have you done to remedy those problems?",

      "text": "I have a graduate degree in exercise and health promotion and teach Kinesiology at a university. Sitting too long and too often is bad for anyone, regardless of your occupation. This can lead to all kinds of physiological/physical issues. Weight gain, poor blood/lymph circulation (very important for your immune function), tight/weak hips, weak glutes (arguably one of the most important muscle groups in the body) back pain, etc...Fidgeting, routinely adjusting your posture, and frequent breaks to get up and move for 5-10 min are very important. Even just walking around does great things for our nervous system, cardiovascular system, muscular system; basically everything. If you can do it outside in the sun in an open environment, even better. When you do so, try to look around as much as possible, become aware of your environment. Your vision/balance systems play a huge role in how you feel/move. And for the love of all things holy, and  in my opinion, try and limit your static stretching. Tight muscles are often weak. Use your body often and you might not feel the need to stretch so much. \n\nHope this helps \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

              "text": "Not OP but in very short terms, muscles on opposite sides of joints try to create balancing forces (i.e., the hip flexors (abs) and the hip extensors (glutes) balance their pull on the pelvis to keep the pelvic bowl steady and facilitate smooth movements. \n\n\nWhen we sit for a long  time, for example, the glutes are actually in an *extended* or lengthened position (the pelvis rotates forward when we sit, shortening some muscles in the abdomen and lengthening some in the butt) and so they can become both weak from underuse (neuromotor pathways are maintained and refined by use, lost by disuse) and tight from being held in an extended position. Since sitting keeps these muscles in a static, extended position, over time they lose both strength and elasticity and we call them weak and tight muscles, in contrast to what is often perceived. \n\n\nIn that case, strengthening the glutes can help offset the weakness from sitting, which can then make those muscles better able to do their job of rotating the pelvis/moving the legs. \n\nLook up \"anterior pelvic tilt\" or \"lower cross syndrome\" to learn more about this relationship.",

There are a number of places (like the inner forearm and pectoral) where a bundle of nerves passes through an area that can get very inflamed, putting pressure on the nerves, and a lot of these areas are near the neck for self-evident reasons. \n\nHope that helps a little! The neck and shoulder joint are fascinatingly complex structures",

                                  "text": "No offense taken. I understand. There are various concerns I have with yoga but the biggest one is that it\u2019s fairly static and orients your body around only the force of gravity (strictly a vertical axis). Which is highly unrealistic in terms of all the forces the human body must deal with day to day (momentum, GRF, dynamic muscle contractions like plyos, etc). I\u2019d say yoga is great for mindfulness but, when done consistently, quite terrible for structural integrity/human health. Many of us exercise to prepare our bodies for our daily activities/sports. Yoga is really far helping us do that. Again, an opinion. But in my mind, one that is unlikely to change anytime soon. Great to sprinkle in every once in a while, great for the mind and to be more present, etc. BAD for human biomechanics.",

Of course there are many yoga styles and approaches of vastly different natures. Regardless Hopefully no one is expecting yoga to prepare their joints for managing high velocity impulse and GRF, or to be able to perform feats of grocery bag carrying, or levitate a few millimeters above the ground with a blanket draped over you so nobody can tell you didnt do it, but that's my biggest concern of course, people just go on what they're told by dubious practitioners. All kinds of extreme claims beyond the benefits of any consistent  dynamic bodyweight exercise that involves moving through range of motion. Mindfulness of course, but yoga is only one of so many ways for that, with many others being more accessible and direct. \n\n\nSimilarities to jogging, yes? Good for cardio, but seen as panacea and taken as gospel for decades, to the great detriment of many ankles and knees. \n\n\nAnd of course, a similar  controversial activity: crossfit.",

Helps if you\u2019re like me and generally dislike physical fitness, because you\u2019re kind of forced into moving. \n\nIf you feel like forty is bad, I\u2019m only twenty-six! Work from home was brutal, and prior to that I only had access to a hotdesk on campus to work from. Definitely one of the reasons I\u2019m \u201con my way out\u201d. Life\u2019s too short to feel this old this young.",

      "text": "A sit-stand-walk desk was the best investment in my health I ever made.  I started with sit-stand which was cheaper than adding walk but still much better than sit alone.  Back pain was the main driver then, gone now.\n\nYou\u2019ll see a lot of advice about how to make the fact you\u2019re sitting so much not kill you so quickly, but the more direct solution is not to sit so much. \n\nYou can do that without a fancy desk, but it takes away from all that time you \u201cshould be writing,\u201d which makes it hard to convince yourself in the moment that a break is a good idea. Better solution is to find a way to keep moving while writing. Seems to help with concentration too!  I generally walk 2-3 hours a day now (while writing, emailing, etc).",

      "text": "The amount of time you need to read and write grants and papers, edit, answer email and do computer administrative tasks is tremendous, plus lab bench work falls away as you mentor students. Add in microscopy and commuting and it's an early death sentence. I did fine at first when I swam, walked, or did exercise classes on campus in the middle of the day.  As my duties increased, colleagues made comments about my absence for the lunch hour,  and I started to believe I couldn't/shouldn't take time for myself in the middle of the day (no matter how late I worked), and my health collapsed. Exercise truly supports mental balance, energy levels, etc. Add in parenting stress and/or caregiving for your own parents, with no exercise, and you will age horribly in this job. Menopause also requires more effort, not less, to stay the same weight. Three joint replacements later and 70 pounds heavier, I retired early this year. I've never been happier, love the free time to exercise and create, but I wonder if I could have been happy and endured if I had kept up exercise during lunch at work. The culture of competitively giving your all to work is toxic. No one is going to give you permission to take care of yourself and balance work time. You have to carve that time out. Kudos to early risers and exercisers, but you also need a break to move about in the middle of the day too. Ironically, the sick time, surgery recovery time, and early retirement cost more time from a promising career than exercising consistently ever could have.",
