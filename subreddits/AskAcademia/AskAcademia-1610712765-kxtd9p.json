  "title:": "Who decides when a PhD student is ready to graduate? The PI, the thesis committee, university policy?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a PhD student in genomics/molecular biology and am close to the end of my fourth year. I feel I have achieved majority of the goals that were set for me at the beginning of my PhD. A first author paper based on my work has been accepted at a good journal and so I will soon have demonstrable proof of the progress I have made. However, a 4 year PhD in the US is very unusual and most people in my program graduate in 5 or more years. My PI feels it is unlikely that my thesis committee would agree to a 4 year graduation and I think he has a point. He is proposing I start work on a \u2018small project\u2019 that was not originally a part of my thesis but will help me get one more publication and graduate at the end of my 5th year.\n\nI don\u2019t mind spending another year but I also think my PI has very unrealistic expectations about how long it takes to publish even a \u2018small project\u2019. If I formally include this project in my thesis, I fear it might take another couple of years to publish it which is unfair given that I have already achieved most of the goals that were set out for me.\n\nI will have my thesis committee meeting in a couple of months and want some advice about how to bring this up. Firstly, given that I have achieved most of my goals, should I insist on a 4 year graduation even if it is unusual in my field/university (I don\u2019t think either my advisor or my committee would be happy about this)? Otherwise, if I agree to including the new \u2018small project\u2019 in my thesis can I say that it is something I am happy to work on but it should not be the criteria for my graduation if it takes longer then expected?\n\nI am also not vey clear about who exactly decides when a PhD student graduates. Is it the PI or the thesis committee or the department policy? Who do I really have to convince when it comes to graduation time?\n\nWould appreciate your opinions.\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thanks to everyone for all the great replies. As some posters recommended, I think my best bet is to convince my PI/committee that I am ready to graduate but if they feel some extra work on a new project would be helpful for me, I would be happy to stay for some more time. But I would try to have my graduation timeline linked to progress or paper submission rather than publication and ask about the possibility of continuing as a post-doc in the same lab. A few people mentioned f32 grants and NIH fellowships for early career researchers but as an international student I don\u2019t think I am eligible for most of them anyway. Also a little bit of a clarification that when I mentioned 4 year graduation, I really meant 4.5 years as even if my committee and PI agree to graduation at my committee meeting, it would still take a few more months to complete the formalities of thesis submission and defense so I would be graduating towards the end of this year.

Is it the PI or the thesis committee or the department policy? \n\nThis depends on your department and university.  It's usually a combination of all three, but the details will depend on where you are studying.\n\n>  given that I have already achieved most of the goals that were set out for me. \n\nThat's great, but you should also be aiming to achieve the goals that *you* are setting out for yourself.  What do you want to do after you graduate, what are the requirements to be able to get that position, and are you qualified?  Is one paper enough for the job you want?  Have you demonstrated high levels of skill in independent research, project management, scientific communication, technical/scientific skills, or whatever is required for what you want next?  Certainly in some fields you'd really struggle to get a good postdoc job with only one paper after a 4-year PhD.\n\nI think you should spend some time finding the CVs/credentials of people in the positions you want and make sure you are not graduating too early to be competitive for those positions.  If you don't think you're there yet, then having an extra year to smash out a project/paper and get your CV up to the appropriate level might be a good idea.",

          "text": "Thanks. I don't mind staying an extra year if it helps my cv (and I also have a few co-author papers from my phd and masters). My problem is that 'publishing one more paper' is a very tricky goal. It may take less than a year, more than a year, get stuck in a long review or never get published. There are too many factors outside my control. If the goal was to demonstrate progress on a project, I would be happy to do that. But having a publication as a goal makes me very apprehensive. I am on the older side for a PhD student and the idea of 2 more years on a phd stipend doesn't appeal to me any more.",

Lots of PhDs in every field these days and really limited jobs unless you have an associated industry (and even then, it is very competitive).",

It's can be easier to make a case that you just want to leave already if you've got a good offer on the table (this goes for academic jobs too)",

Are you an expert?\n4) PI- most important. Among other things, signs off on the dissertation.\n\nI doubt that your university or department has a minimum number of years for the PhD. It clearly takes some longer than others to finish. One important piece that people tend to forget is the project itself has a lot to do with that, especially in STEM. Some projects take a whole lot of time. Some don\u2019t. If yours took four years, you believe that you\u2019re an expert in that topic, and your committee and PI can see that, then you took four years. (I\u2019m a bit jealous btw) If they insist on you taking another year because that\u2019s what is normal, that\u2019s not a good reason to stay. If your PI wants you to get another paper out, that\u2019s a different story. Your dissertation itself should allow you to do that without starting another project, though.

When you apply for positions, they will expect a lot more papers on your CV the further out from your PhD you are. All I'm saying is that it might very well be worth it to stay an extra year if you can get some publications out of it - it adds a large buffer to your CV.\n\n| Otherwise, if I agree to including the new \u2018small project\u2019 in my thesis can I say that it is something I am happy to work on but it should not be the criteria for my graduation if it takes longer then expected? \n\nThis is a very fair thing to ask, and I would push this with your advisor. Also, I don't think you need to have the paper published necessarily when you leave. It's perfectly fine to just have it submitted or even in prep with experiments completed, unless you expect that you may need to do more experiments on a very specific piece of equipment that only your lab has or something like that.",

I know of students that have added small projects onto their dissertation after their proposal defense, but the student themselves was making the argument and asking for more time and resources. However, if your PI is more convincing to the committee, then you will have to complete the additional small project. \n\nFood for thought. Good luck!",
