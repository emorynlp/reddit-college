  "title:": "Is it possible to find a mentor within academia if someone is no longer a PhD student?",
  "text": "My partner recently finished his PhD on a topic that he was forced towards. He could not leave the programme for various reasons and is understandably upset because he was not allowed to pursue his interest which lies in a related but different area as initially promised by his former supervisor. As a result he has since left academia and is taking some time to re-evaluate his options, goals and aims. \n\nIt is heartbreaking for me to see him go through this whole thing and it was even more difficult at the final few months before his viva. I would really like to help but I am not familiar with his area of interest as my background is in psychology and he is interested in an area of computer engineering. From what I understand, a mentor in the right area of expertise would really help him with this process, whether he decides to work in industry or return to academia, so I was wondering if there are any suggestions you have as to how he can approach this issue.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit to say: Thank you everyone who has taken the time to reply. It is really valuable advice!",

It is one of the reasons why he decided to leave altogether after his contract ended and is not interested in taking up another post-doc right now as a result.",

      "text": "There may be social/career building clubs linked to the university he just graduated from. In my field there are clubs that host industry + academia talks + dinners where you can socialize with people in your field. There are also explicit mentorship programs but generally the mentors are in industry. Academic professors tend to already be fully booked in terms of mentoring, in my experience.\n\nIt also seems like a post-doc would be ideally suited for him. Many people I know used a post-doc to pivot to a field they were more interested in or that would make them a better candidate. \n\nMy final recommendation is the career center at his university (either the PhD one or the undergraduate one, if applicable in the country you're in). In the US, career centers have always told me that they're happy to talk to alumni. Might be an option\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd also, that sucks. My husband's PhD and mine are on topics we like with advisors we generally like, and it's been tough. I can't imagine how much more difficult it is when it's not on track to help you get closer to an interesting career.",

          "text": "Thank you for this advice, I think he has done that already but he is in a humanities-focussed university that doesn\u2019t have much support for those interested in computer science. So it is difficult to find the right people unless he approaches someone from a different university in the specific area he is looking into. Maybe, I am not sure. It\u2019s kinda tricky because the research he completed was already contested by a few people who thought that it didn\u2019t align with the general approach of the faculty even though it was already changed and adapted a lot to be more humanities-friendly. \n\nWith regards to this being a tough experience, I will only say that our relationship almost broke during that time because of it. I have seen him lose his passion and get more and more frustrated over the years but those months were absolute hell. And I could do nothing to help him with it other than be patient and proofread when needed. I am also planning to do a PhD eventually and as my area is in social science I am really worried that that in itself will trigger some of the trauma he has at this point.",

Nonetheless, would you suggest that he reaches out to the people who are currently doing the work he is interested in? He has a pretty good grasp of who and where they are but doesn\u2019t think his background is appropriate to even talk to them at this point. I think that is partially true as he is a very capable person overall, but his self-esteem is influenced pretty negatively by this whole experience.",

              "text": "You've had some good advice here. I would reiterate the comments about focussing on what he wants to achieve - mentoring without focus is largely a useless enterprise. In addition, he might want to think about coaching rather than mentoring. Coaching is usually about a specific issue rather than mentoring which is about behaviours, career development etc (although can address specific issues).\n\nIf this is really about transitioning careers then he doesn't necessarily need a mentor/coach in the field and instead more generic advice would take him a long way down that road. He could consider a work coach - they can be incredibly useful for helping you tackle a work problem but they are expensive. Alternatively, there are free resources out there which might be a useful place to start. The two that spring to mind are Ask A Manager and the Your Digital Mentor podcast. Ask A Manager has a load of great resources for managing all things related to work.",

In Europe, for example, there are fields where second and third postdocs are far from unusual or even people who move from one field to another by joining interdisciplinary projects as postdocs. In the US, this would have been career suicide for whatever reason.  \n\nThe best advice I can give is to look into positions related to *human factors* and *hci/hri* but in CS and engineering departments. It may not be 100% what he wants, but it will be a good number of steps in the right direction. Furthermore, by experiencing a different mentor than his PhD supervisor, he may get if academia is for him or not.",

The supervisor of a postdoc is a the team leader or whatever but doesn\u2019t neccessarily care about or have the bigger picture interests of the scientist in mind. You need a trustworthy scientist from outside your current role who you can talk things over with. I relied on my masters supervisor at multiple stages during hard calls. I ended up at the same university she also worked at so she has kind of a vested interest so I couldn\u2019t lean on her quite as much during my postdoc.\n\nBut yes for career stuff where the advice might not be in favour of the group you\u2019re in at any given time, definitely look to someone who you know, respect, and want to emulate.
