  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a postdoc and recently acquired funding through a T32 training grant at my university. I am very confused as to how this should be listed on my cv, biosketch, other support documents. When I list this as my funding source, do I list myself as the PI for my project which was selected for funding through my department and list the amount of funding I was awarded or do I list the PI who was awarded the original training grant and the total amount that was awarded?\n\nThank you in advance.",

      "text": "You are not the PI of the main grant. Do NOT list that grant. I don\u2019t know how postdocs usually list T32s, but I would be careful. It is more analogous to getting funded as a grad student than getting a grant. You aren\u2019t formally a PI, even if you are the lead investigator on your research project.\n\nSome faculty do list internal university research \u201cgrants\u201d on their CVs. I suppose you could list yours that way.",

              "text": "You should list it as a postdoctoral fellowship in your education section. I would also probably list it as an internal grant or research award, but be clear that it is internal. You were presumably selected via some sort of competitive process and you got funded, so it\u2019s worth mentioning. Calling yourself Lead Investigator is appropriate.\n\nMy concern is that PI has a formal meaning. This isn\u2019t it, and you don\u2019t want to appear to be claiming to be something you are not.",
