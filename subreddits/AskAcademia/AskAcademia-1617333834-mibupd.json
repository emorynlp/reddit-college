  "title:": "My favorite professor is having a health crisis",
  "text": "Hi ya'll.\n\nLooking for some advice; my favorite professor is having a health crisis; a tumor was found and nobody knows yet how serious or benign it might be.\n\nI'm just an undergrad, so I don't know her super personally, though she has been a support person for me in reporting a different professor. She's an absolute gem, not just for her department but for the entire university. I know for sure that I'm not the only one who feels this way at all.\n\nI want to do something nice for her; anything to bring her some comfort or at least a pick-me-up amidst this clusterfuck. My first thought was to collaborate with the rest of her class and get flowers and cards sent to her room when she's in the hospital, but I'm wondering if there are more/better ideas.\n\nAny ideas or advice would be much appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\###UPDATE EDIT:\n\nJust thought to edit this with an update even though I know it's a pretty old post now; my professors surgery went well, it turned out to be benign, and she seems to be feeling much better and has been recovering really well. It's been a relief for the entire department and all of the students who know her! We all ended up sending in a hodgepodge of gifts and some money for food during her recovery. Thank you all for your advice and encouragement. ",

It might seem simple or easy or traditional but the medical staff are taking care of immediate needs and for many people something simple is probably the best (lowest stress) option.  You could talk to the main admin for the dept and see if there is something being coordinated at that end (so the cards can be co-delivered).",

When you\u2019re sick and feeling alone, knowing that people are thinking of you and appreciate you is everything. \n\nI once compiled a list of a favorite professor\u2019s funniest or most memorable things said in class. She was a HOOT. I gave it to her, and she loved it. Playing on that theme, you could email students and ask them to write 2-3 sentences about their favorite moment in class, a favorite memory of her, something they learned from her, etc. Professors often don\u2019t know the impact they have, and this is a way to bring it home.",

      "text": "Having just gone through a similar health crisis myself, I have two comments. \n1. It's unclear how you found out about this health crisis, and I would not take any course of action (i.e. organizing something from the whole class) that involves a telling a bunch of people what is going on,  unless you are sure they already know (Professor sent mass email or something). Before I had surgery, I told only the people I work closely with, and I figured I would tell the whole department if I had cancer, but it didn't seem worth getting a bunch of people involved while things are up in the air. Fortunately I have a tumor type that is treated with surgery with a 99% 10 year survival rate but it was still a lot of emotional work to tell everyone I had told about the surgery the good news. Please remember this is someone else's personal health information which is not yours to disclose, even if you are trying to do something nice for this person. \n2. Flowers are nice and I love them but I have now received 6 bouquets and have run out of places in my house to put them.  Consider sending a potted plant, which will last longer. I have received several bouquets with really strongly fragrant flowers (daffodils and Easter lilies), please try to avoid those. \nBut honestly the best gift we got was a Harry and David box with pears and snacks.  So consider sending food as an alternative to flowers.  I love all manner of sweet treats but the pears were nice because they are healthy (and delicious).",

So many people left awesome comments!\n\nShe told me and 3 of my friends who regularly go to office hours, and today the rest of the class and the department were informed by the department head as per my professors request. We wound up gathering gifts and cards as well as an online card; one of my friends delivered the gifts this morning. I made some cookies, and gave a card that I originally wanted to give her as a thank-you card; hopefully I'll be able to thank her for the things she's done for me properly with a new card in the future.\n\nAlso thank you for the advice about flowers! It turned out the hospital section she's in doesn't allow live flowers anyway but I was able to order some artificial ones to be delivered. I never would have thought about how overpowering scented flowers could get if you're stuck with too many, so I'm glad you brought it up!",

If it is indeed something she has already started treatment for, she is likely immunocompromised and is susceptible to having strong reactions and allergies. I'd recommend a signed card and a gift card \u2014 that way, she can get anything that she needs and likes. Treatments (even prospective ones) can be stressful, expensive affairs, and support might really help.",
