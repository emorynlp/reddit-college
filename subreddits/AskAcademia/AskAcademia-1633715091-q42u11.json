  "title:": "How do you respond compassionately to students who seem like they're not trying?",
  "text": "**So, I just want to preface this by saying I don't mean \"what do I do when students miss lectures in-person?\" or anything like that. I know that there are numerous reasons (pandemic or not) that could make it hard for a student to come into class. I'm talking about students who have the resources but just don't use them, then ask for unspecific \"help\" with the course.**\n\nSpecifically, here in Canada, we have an upcoming long-weekend because it's Thanksgiving. I am a teaching assistant for a course that has a test next Wednesday afternoon. Today (Friday afternoon), a student emailed me to ask if I could meet with them (via Zoom) urgently because they need \"help before our first test\". Office hours aren't part of my TA contract (I just grade assignments, tests, and run in-person tutorials. Another TA runs the tutorials online because of COVID), so I told the student that unfortunately I would be unable to meet. I sent them a list of resources that the department offers and suggested they reach out to the professor if they have specific questions.\n\nIn their response, the student said that the professor didn't have scheduled office hours before the test and said they would try to \"figure it out on \\[their\\] own\". I felt badly, so I went to check Brightspace to see how they are doing in the course. But it turns out, this student has not watched the past 6 lectures (out of 9 total) or watched the past 2 online tutorials  (out of 3 total). The student has definitely not been coming in person because they are an international student who is out of the country. \n\nI understand that Brightspace course progress data is not necessarily 100% accurate, but the set-up of the course is also in such a way that it's not possible that the student downloaded all the material at the beginning of the semester (the lectures get uploaded each week). They've only spent 4 hours of time on the webpage, when there are about 10 hours of lectures alone posted on the page - even if they watched them at 2x speed, it wouldn't be enough to get through the lectures, let alone the rest of the material. I can also see that the student has not downloaded the notes accompanying the tutorials or videos, so I really don't think they have even attempted to work through most of the course material. \n\nIn my email response, I suggested that they make sure they've watched all the lecture videos and tutorials as preparation for the test and explore the avenues I mentioned in my initial reply. In my head, I was thinking \"why would you ask me for unspecific help if you haven't even tried to stay on-top of the course?\" Obviously, that's not a helpful or compassionate way to deal with students, but I find this type of thing (which seems to happen fairly often) super frustrating.\n\n**So, TL;DR - How do you support students who ask for help when they don't make use of available resources first? How do you respond compassionately? What is helpful for you and your students in this kind of situation?**",

      "text": "So I\u2019ll address two things separately\u2026your response and then your question more generally.\n\n1) DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT TELLING THIS STUDENT YOU CANNOT HELP THEM. You are busy and have a life and cannot help everyone.  There is no way it\u2019s even remotely fair to expect underpaid, stressed out TAs to ensure student success.  If what they asked for exceeds your job description, the school should not ask or expect you to work for free.  \u201cBut it\u2019s just an hour\u2026\u201d so should TAs be required to give an hour to every student? Student success is the responsibility of the instructor of record for the course.  TAs are there to ASSIST.  Refer it to the instructor and kindly-but firmly-note that it\u2019s beyond your contract and that you do not have time.\n\n2) more generally, when I see that someone isn\u2019t engaging with any of the resources, I ask, as non-concfrontationally as possible, how the course has been going and what they\u2019ve done so far (of course, I already know their level of utilization for some resources).  From there, we figure out a plan.  80% of the time, I get a (believable) story about a stressful event or life tragedy that is covered by our school\u2019s policy and the student needs either an alternative schedule or just some time to catch up.  Students often aren\u2019t aware of the policy and how much it can help them out.  Maybe drop an assignment or two for them.  As for \u201cfairness\u201d to other students, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair at all\u2014if their dad died or their mom was in the hospital with COVID I\u2019d let them drop a homework too. Most universities have an Incomplete Policy\u2014often totally appropriate here.  I often see incomplete grades turn into As.\n\nA small fraction of the time, the student is completely out of their depth, and maybe just needs to be told it\u2019s okay to drop the class (like, no offense but if you can\u2019t do college math you won\u2019t succeed in my course yet\u2026so it\u2019s okay to take that course and come back later).  It\u2019s okay!  They\u2019re not a bad person!  They just need more foundation.\n\nSometimes the student is either checked out or too overwhelmed to engage with me (and I won\u2019t have enough information to tell the difference usually).  If the student never responds to my emails and never comes to class, I don\u2019t have enough info to know what\u2019s going on.  I have to leave that with a follow up email \u201cwe\u2019ll I\u2019m here if you need me\u201d and then follow uni policy re: grading.",

Think of the stereotypical rich teenager that cries because her birthday ferrari was the wrong shade of pink. The people that become like this are those that are given everything and are never told no.\n\nOnce you have fulfilled your responsibility (pointing the student to the course materials) if the student fails the course it is on them. There is a plethora of reasons why it might be on them,\n\nMaybe they are depressed and that's why they are not doing well in uni and are not putting in the appropriate effort, but this means they need to address this underlying problem before continuing with their studies (e.g. take a sabbatical), maybe they have really high anxiety, maybe they were never taught proper time management... Whatever it is, if the student is unable to do the expected work for a class, all you might achieve by helping them beyond what you are required is for them to fail later on, and the thing is, the later you fail the more catastrophic it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving poor grades on your first year matters less than having bad grades in your last year. Having bad grades in your last year matters less than not getting a job. Not getting a job matters less than being put in a position of power where your lack of ability might hurt other people...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn essence, whatever the circumstances it is the student's responsibility to search for the appropriate resources to correct whatever prevents them from putting in the effort, even if the circumstances are not the student's fault. And of society and the university should do their best to provide resources for those that are motivated but struggling to improve themselves and fix the toxic aspects of their life. But that is not YOUR job and ironically it is to the benefit of the student to not get used for other people to overstep their responsibilities to help them.",

      "text": "Oof, I can relate to your post because its a struggle that I'm familiar with. I'm not in Canada, but I hope my two cents can give you some perspective. \n\nCompassion towards students who fulfil the minimum requirements of the course is very different from compassion towards students who don't. Yes, there are circumstances that make it exceptionally difficult for students (especially in the pandemic), but I honestly believe its a slippery slope for educators when they apply the same level of compassion to every student regardless of the effort they've put in. \n\nFor instance, I (currently) manage 2 classes that have 30 students each, but if all 60 students demand time from me without even bothering to attend lectures & tutorials, I would have wasted my time preparing, recording, & uploading those lectures or conducting the tutorials. I believe that compassion is a two-way street, with students & educators needing some form of compassion (especially one such as yourself, who genuinely wishes to help the student). \n\nWhen a student joins a university, it is with the agreement that they would do their part & the educator would do theirs. The analogy that I use to make this case would be physical therapists & their patients. If a patient comes in with a bad knee that can be strengthened using exercises the physical therapist prescribes, then the patient is responsible in carrying out those exercises to strengthen said knee. If they refuse to do so, then how much compassion should they receive for that bad knee?\n\nThat being said, I know that some students reaaaally cannot attend classes, and that some educators reaaaally suck at being compassionate. So please don't think I'm placing the responsibility squarely on the student. I'm saying that there are times when the onus is on the student, & there are times when its on the educators. Sorry for that long explanation, but I thought it was necessary to explain myself to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\nBut below are some tactics I use on students to avoid similar situations such as yours:\n\n1. It would take a bit more work & I'm not sure if your TA position allows it, but I'd just glance through attendance of both lectures & tutorials on a weekly basis to see if there's any chronically absent students. If I do notice, I'd just send them a check-up email to see if everything is alright & remind them that if they are facing issues, the university has resources for them. This may sound very cold, but this builds a paper trail that you as the educator have taken the necessary steps to help the student. On the warmer side of things, this is may be helpful for students who truly do not know that they are able to get help or inform the uni of the circumstances they are facing that is impeding their academic journey\n2. If #1 is not possible due to class size, I normally tell the students that they need to send me the questions they wanna ask prior to the meeting so I can prepare myself as well. I had a student who attempted to get a crash course of the semester because they didn't attend classes but I turned them away & told them that they needed to come in better prepared with specific questions. When I say specific, I'm referring to questions that would indicate to me that they've tried to understand the materials (or in your case, attended the lecture & tutorials). Not generic questions. \n3. If #1 & #2 don't work, I would just address the issue directly & ask them (politely, of course), if they've been facing issues over the course of the semester that has affected their attendance. I think taking a more direct approach is necessary at times, as long as it's framed with compassion & concern. Then I follow it up with 'I'm sorry but I'm unable to help you catch up with the X amount of lectures/ tutorials that you've missed, but I can help you if you've been facing other issues that has been affecting your attendance/ performance'. \n\nMy apologies again for the long text, but this is what I've done when facing a similar situation. It has worked for me so far, but it may/ may not be applicable to you depending on the circumstances. I hope it helps! & I think you handled the situation well anyways.",

      "text": "I talk to them.\n\nI imagine the student asked you for \"nonspecific help\" because they didn't have the chance to tell you in person what help they needed. It's impossible to know why this specific student didn't watch six lectures, though, without asking them - so I'd ask.\n\nOne of the things I try to do is imagine reasons why a student might do such a thing. For an international student who is out of the country, if English is a second language to them, maybe they are having a hard time understanding the lectures, or perhaps they have spotty bandwidth and have had difficulty accessing the videos. Yes, they should've asked for support and help earlier in the semester - but a lot of students don't until right before a test, sometimes because they realize how far they've fallen behind when they start studying.\n\nIn other cases, it might be depression, anxiety, or both. I have clinical depression and an anxiety disorder, and I had a terrible semester in undergrad in which I just stopped attending a class and was too depressed to ask for any help. Asking for any kind of help may feel like a completely unsurmountable task, and explaining what exactly you need may feel impossible. That would explain both not doing all of the work *and* not being able to clearly articulate what you need.\n\nI'm not saying that I assume these are the case (a lot of college students are just lazy), but I hold them as plausible scenarios in my head, because that makes me soften my approach and come at it a lot more curiously.",

      "text": "Good on you for trying to find a compassionate way to reply to students. Often there is a very good reason why students can't do all the readings/watch all the lectures. In addition to university, many need to work close to full time to support themselves (and/or their families), some are navigating abusive relationships, are caretakers of sick parents, going through deep depression, experiencing recent traumatic events like rape, etc. I'm a little appalled by professors who don't seem to understand this about the student body, who make assumptions that each student has as much ease and privilege in their young life that they did. A bit more compassion would allow the brilliant students struggling with difficult life circumstances a chance to succeed.",

I agree with you that compassion is needed in much greater quantities than professors (generally) give, but there also needs to be an understanding that so many university staff are swamped with their own troubles and giving so much extra time to students that are unable or unwilling (for whatever reason) to even watch the material is not feasible for many staff members.",

I have seen faculty embarrass students for being late to class who I know were experiencing trauma at that time in their lives. We are talking about 18, 19 year old students who are going into tremendous debt trying to build their lives, and the ones who don't make it through are too often the ones coming from working class families, abusive homes, poverty, etc. Academia loses a lot by not giving more support to individuals who may not have the support systems to help them succeed.\n\nI'm not saying the onus should be on faculty to devote more time to students, I am simply saying that there needs to be more compassion in responses to requests for help. If you can't help because you are swamped, say it with empathy for what they might be going through, and try to point them to some resource on campus that would help. Ask them if everything is ok.",

Or the other students in the class for that matter? \n\nHere's the deal. The job of a professor is to attempt to be objective. Most professors can recognize the difference between a student in a legitimate difficult situation and a student who just doesn't want to work, and nothing stops you from trying to help the ones who really need it. But I see a lot of people recently who apparently try to argue that a student who never comes to class might need to get a break because maybe they were suffering from depression or in an abusive relationship or whatever.\n\nI completely disagree. I feel really bad for that student, and if they come to me for help, I'm happy to do what I can, but that help can't be of a form that removes the expectation that they've completed the requirements of the class. Maybe this week is really rough on you and we can work out a way for you to take an exam a week later. That's reasonable. What I can't do is just say, \"well, you're not turning in any assignments and you're failing all the tests, but I'll give you a B because you're depressed.\"",

Professors who say \"my job is to push you as far as I can to see if you break\" certainly cannot empathize with students dealing with mental health issues. I did not say all professors, but these exist, and not in low numbers.\n\nI did not differentiate between students who ask for help and students who stay silent -- speak with compassion to students, all of them, full stop, because you don't know what they are going through.\n\nI did not advocate giving students a free pass at all -- in fact, you offered more leniency in your comment (an extra week for an exam!) than I suggested (reply with compassion).\n\nI disagree completely that professors have an ability to clearly recognize a student in a difficult situation. That's a very dangerous game to play. I also fully disagree that professors are able to act with objectivity when dealing with students. Bias is absolutely rife in academia.\n\nMany, many undergraduate students find themselves in extremely difficult circumstances for various reasons. I was one, but it was at a time where it was taboo to mention to anyone. Yes, recently, people have begun to recognize it (though it seems you don't believe it?), and, really, it is about time.",

It's less likely as an international student maybe, but I often run into students that seem like they have 0 interaction with a course and it's just because they're working with a friend in the same class. The point is, part of compassion is good faith, and part of good faith is not making assumptions about someone else's situation, motivation, or ability.\n\nObviously, that kind of technical stuff isn't your issue as a TA, especially if answering student queries isn't part of your contract (I wasn't sure from your post if you meant that you weren't required to talk to students at all or just weren't required to have a formal office hour -- but I've been a TA in canada, you're already expected to do loads of unpaid labour, you don't need to do more lol).\n\nIf answering questions/emails IS part of your contract, though, I think you could have made a little more effort to understand the student's issue before deflecting them. For example, you may not be available to zoom in real time, but asking if they could write (or send you a video) of their specific questions. Another option someone else mentioned asking them to tell you what they've done already, which I agree with as well.\n\nResponding in this way is also good for you in a worst-case scenario, like if the student puts in a complaint. In the current situation, the student can say they asked for help and it wasn't provided, whether their request was specific or not. You can avoid this by putting the onus back on the student to articulate what they need. I was taught this as \"Provide the Why/Y\": Tell the student *why* you can't X, and, if possible, offer them *Y*.\n\nIf it's totally outside your contract, though, it's worth being up front with the student about that: Rather than saying you aren't available to meet, it makes more sense to tell them honestly that your contract doesn't include being a student liaison -- that way, providing those other resources/avenues for them to contact is seen as you going out of your way to be helpful, rather than as a way to avoid answering questions. Students rarely know how stuff like TA contracts work.\n\nI'm not saying it's always the case that the student is trying their best and it just looks bad etc etc. But as it is, I can definitely see why the student felt blown off and responded defensively, and also how your second response could be interpreted as accusing them of being lazy / not even trying before asking for help.",

      "text": "I am probably going to get downvoted for this answer but I have some solutions based on my experience. Also, English is not my first language and I am pretty bad at it.So sorry for that.\n\nI started college at the beginning of lockdown so I am in my 2nd year, an economics major.Now classes to date have been 100% online and I have never seen the face of some of my professors, just the voice. So, it can get a bit boring sometimes and does not feel personal at all.And I am more of a problem student you could say. I have to have some medication which makes me fidgety and have ADHD-like symptoms. So listening to lectures can get really hard for me.I take it as my issue and not that of the teachers. I am present in class to keep my attendance up and cover the materials and references myself so I can go as slow/fast as I like. There are no recorded lectures so that is a problem for me.\n\nI am probably behind my classmates a lot but I am forced to study before exams so it works out okay-ish. We cant request special help sessions with professors one on one and there are no mental health accommodations at all.\n\nSo, regarding a solution rather than taking bigger exams if you could set weekly or even daily tests-small ones which require studying, that would create a sense of urgency for people who are behind and force them to catch up. you can also tell them that you know that they are not listening to lectures. Personally, that would most definitely make me attend them. And lastly, if someone is really late you could have a chat with them and ask them the issue and say that you are expected to do well in the next test. I believe you can do much better. A little encouragement and love go a long way-my teacher had done this in school and I remember them with a smile even now.",

      "text": "The best compassionate approach is to try to catch these students early - many students will start improving if you catch them in the act of neglecting their studies - and show them that you care. Take this as a learning experience to carry forward. \n\nFor each student is neglecting studies, suspend all judgments. It's easy to think a student is \"just lazy.\" And many times the reasons they give seem silly. I've also had students who had dying family members, failing kidneys, troubled childhoods, etc. Being compassionate means opening up to the real suffering they may be experiencing.\n\nOverall, just be kind - if they are having serious challenges, they may open up and you can be compassionate. I tend to give more leeway in these cases. If they are just going through a transition phase, they will benefit more from a stern kindness.",
