  "title:": "Entering a PhD with a diagnosed mental illness? / reoccurring gaps in CV due to mental illness",
  "text": "Hey guys, just some stats (**Current MSc Biotech, Ireland, undergrad BSc Biotech**)\n\nI have a diagnosed mental illness which made me need to take time off my undergrad degree, this meant that instead of taking 4 years it took me 8 years to finally graduate.  I wasn't really able to do much else other than try recover during the time off so I have no work experience and my CV does not look great. At the moment I am stable and in a MSc programme but want to go further into academia and get involved in research. \n\n* Is there anyone here that needed to take as much time off in between? how did you deal with explaining gaps?\n* Has anyone managed to get into a PhD programme with a diagnosed mental illness? do you feel that a potential supervisor may view you as unable for potential PhD due to gaps in your academic history? \n* If you have been accepted to a PhD programme, were they aware of your mental illness or did you disclose it?\n\nEven just knowing there are others who struggled through their undergraduate would help me a bit better. My friends and family are both half/half on the idea of me committing to a PhD, and my supervisor in my current college suggests to me to not apply for a PhD. I'm not sure if it's due to my sensitive personality and anxious nature, I have obviously had difficulty in my past programmes but I haven't ever totally given up on any of my studies. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated and your own stories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Current PI and Director of Graduate Studies here. I'd suggest a couple things: first, sit down with your current supervisor and (if you feel comfortable doing this) ask some more specific questions about why they are suggesting you do not apply for a PhD. Is there something about your output or dedication to the work that is motivating them to say this? For example, in my group I feel the main difference between terminal MS vs PhD students is a type of intrinsic curiosity - is the student going above and beyond? Reading papers and formulating questions related to but outside the scope of their current project? This is the hallmark (in my mind) of a student who will be successful in a PhD program and academia in general. If your supervisor is dissuading you only because of your history with mental illness, then perhaps you can take their advice with a grain of salt. If there is something lacking in how you do your work, though, you should know that now - it could be a reason you decide not to go on in academia, or it could be something you dedicate yourself to addressing before you apply to PhD programs. Your supervisor has both a good perspective on your work and also knowledge of the field and how academia works in general, so try to get as much advice from them as possible. This will also potentially give you a preview of how they will write about you in a Letter of Rec, which is important for you to know now.\n\nIf you decide to apply for PhD programs, you can describe your longer than average undergraduate timeline as due to \"medical issues\", which is true, without needing to get more specific. I would hold off on describing your mental health issues in detail until you feel comfortable with and know the people you are disclosing this to. \n\nFinally, not to dissuade you but just to prepare you - PhD programs can be much more stressful than MSc programs. Be sure you have good support - therapist, psychiatrist, GP - in place before you start any program.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your detailed answer, I will definitely prepare some more detailed questions for my current supervisor, I just wanted to have a some time to sit with it and think before asking him again. I don't mind you mentioning about the difficulty with the PhD, I'm trying to compile as much information as I can so that I can prepare myself as best as possible! I will evaluate again and discuss with my supervisor after my 6 month work placement in industry, thank you again!\n\nDo you mind me asking what specific parts of the PhD do students generally struggle with? I have read about problems with supervisors, difficult dealing with failed experiments or data and writing block being some of the common complaints. Obviously I have no real idea other than the few people I encountered in my own lab so apologies if that sounds vague!",

              "text": "All of the things you listed are very common issues - doing a PhD is *hard*, you are spending 4-5 years of your life working on one very specific set of questions, if you're doing bench work lots of times experiments don't work, and it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel until you're almost done. It can also be very isolating - you're in a lab with other people, but you're each working on your own thing, and you will end up feeling at some point like everyone's experiments are working except for yours. There is also a lot of rejection in academia that you just have to get used to - papers rejected, grant proposals rejected, conference abstracts rejected. It can be a very heavy mental load at times. Personally, I didn't have previous mental health issues when I started my PhD, but I ended up dealing with depression and anxiety in my 2nd/3rd years until experiments started working and I could see my way to the finish. \n\nAll of that said... I made it through, just got tenure at a university I love, and don't regret any part of my PhD experience. It was very hard to be in it, but I made it through and doing a PhD was definitely the right decision for me. I think the more you can prepare yourself mentally for the experience, the better off you will be.\n\nGood luck. None of these decisions are easy. I think it's also helpful to remember that these decisions aren't permanent: if you do start a PhD and decide 2-3 years in that it's not for you, you can always master out and get an industry job. This is often portrayed as \"failure\" in academic circles but it is emphatically NOT: PhD isn't for everyone and there is NO shame in that.",

                  "text": "One of the hardest things about doing a PhD is that you often feel like no one is there to help you, only to work against you. While this is not true, it can feel that way because one's professors and mentors think it's important to challenge you. \n\nAs a PhD student, your life is one of non-stop corrections, constructive criticism, and learning by trial and error. Professors and mentors will work hard to help students become less dependent on them for anything, which can really feel uncomfortable but is important for building an independent scholar.\n\nLastly, at least in science, you just aren't a paying customer anymore. You are part of a lab and the research of the PI, what you do must conform to the lab and the PI and reflect well. It's isn't just about your \"learning experiences.\" And you need to earn the respect of your mentor as a colleague by showing you can do good work. While you always deserve respect as a person, it's not about your \"potential\" anymore. This is where the rubber meets the road. It can be a difficult transition, particularly if you don't have experience outside of school.\n\nThe open-ended nature of the process and need to give students a lot critiques along the way can be very destabilizing.",

                      "text": "I will add onto this comment: the experience is also very overwhelming, almost all of the time. There always seems like there is more that you can be doing. Even when I feel like I may busting my ass, I may still feel like I'm not doing enough. Whereas with a set of classes, the goal is a lot more clear and success is more tangible: to get good grades and to learn so that you can potentially apply the knowledge. But as a PhD student, those milestones are less concrete and sometimes feel like they are always out of reach. I have found that even if my experiments are working, and I'm spending a lot of time in the lab, there is a plethora of literature that I'd like to go through, which is only ever a growing list. And reading literature gives rise to ideas that I'd like to try in the lab. Then there are seminars that I may not have time for, or opportunities to network that I may not have the energy to attend.\n\nThe constant criticism is also difficult to handle, especially when mental health is at a low. I have found few things more soul-crushing than pulling long hours to prepare something in spite of being at the edge of a mental breakdown, only to have the project ripped to pieces and scrapped because there isn't the right kind of information available for us to use it. While the logical side of the brain recognizes that it isn't really your fault, it's still really rough to see 100+ hours amount to a scrapped project.",

              "text": "So, first note: my experience comes from thesis-based MS programs in STEM in the US. Things can be different internationally and are definitely different in non-thesis programs or outside of STEM.\n\nI think the best way I can explain it is by using this distinction: a MSc will teach you to *answer* scientific questions, while a PhD will teach you to *ask* them. Usually in MS programs, you're given a pretty distinct scientific question to answer that's already been posed by your advisor. It still might be very difficult to find a way to answer the question, but usually your advisor will be the one to pose it for you (and also usually have a good idea about how to at least try to answer it). In MSc students that I see who I think are well-suited to go on to PhD, they 1. enjoy both finding and reading literature that is related to the question they're answering but not necessarily immediately useful in answering that question, and 2. are starting to pose research questions related to that literature in our 1-on-1 meetings. Granted, especially for a 1st year student, lots of times those questions are already answered in the literature or (more often) not really answerable in the way that they're posed. But, the student is showing an aptitude to *think* about science, and not just apply laboratory (or field) skills in answering a scientific question.\n\nSpecifically for you - I'd highly encourage you to think about changing fields between MS, PhD, or postdoc (if you stay in academia) since you're interested in multiple related fields. I made a similar jump between MS and PhD and I really think it has really helped me have a more holistic perspective on my research. Think of ways you can use your geochemistry skills to answer geophysics questions, or ways that learning geophysics skills could relate to your current interests in geochemistry. IMO having interdisciplinary skills is going to be increasingly important in obtaining academic and federal/state jobs.",

      "text": "Hi there, first of all I just want to say well done on continuing your educational journey through bachelors and into postgrad! There are likely more people within academia with diagnosed mental health conditions than you may realise. I am doing my PhD in clinical psychology, so I recognise that perhaps the departments I\u2019ve studied/worked in may be more accepting of disclosing one\u2019s mental health status (although I would hope that the same would be true everywhere). I have friends and colleagues doing PhDs who have diagnoses, and so please don\u2019t let that alone be a barrier to you accomplishing your dream. Regarding your first bullet point, it would be fine to explain the gaps as time you needed to take off for your mental health. I suspect that it would be considered discrimination to reject an applicant solely based on disclosure of a diagnosed condition. \n\nWhile this shouldn\u2019t stop you, I\u2019d advise you to really think about whether academia would be a good career path for you and for your mental health, particularly if those who know you well (and love and care about you) are advising you to reconsider. Postgraduate students are three times more likely to struggle with mental health issues; one in two PhD students will experience moderate to severe psychological distress during their degree and one in three will be at risk of having or developing a diagnosable mental health condition. \n\nI would suggest having a discussion about your future plans with your current academic supervisor (if you feel comfortable to do so). You say that they suggest you seek another career path; it is worth listening to why they think academia may not be the choice for you, and what advice they may have for you. The choice will still be yours, and it may be a difficult conversation to have, but I hope that it will help you with this decision. As you said, it may not be related to your mental health status at all, but having a more sensitive and anxious nature will inevitably make academia feel even more stressful than it already is. There is a lot of toxicity, rejection and competitiveness within academic culture, which may not be the type of environment that you would thrive in. I also want to highlight that it is entirely possible to continue within research without a PhD, particularly in industry/third sector organisations. If anything, having a PhD can be a disadvantage, as organisations can view you as overqualified, whereas a degree such as an MSc can be extremely beneficial. You might want to look into non-academic routes that still have a strong research focus, which may suit you better. \n\nI hope you don\u2019t feel too discouraged by my reply. You have already demonstrated great resilience by finishing your BSc and working towards your MSc, so this is not to say that a PhD is not for you. It is, however, to encourage you to consider that you may be able to achieve a successful and (more) enjoyable career in research without a PhD and without continuing in academia. Either way, I wish you all the best!",

I have a really good relationship with my current supervisor so he knows of my struggles. I will be going into industry for 6 months in the next few weeks and he believes I'm fully capable of doing a good job, but if the environment prevents me from becoming more confident, he suggests not staying on after the 6 months, so perhaps the the PhD environment may be one of the reasons he had reservations. \n\nThank you for congratulations also, I didn't really think it was that amazing until I looked back at where I started from! I'm glad to hear that you know people who haven't let their mental health stop them for progressing in academia, it's definitely something that has been used to put me down throughout the years so hearing this certainly helps!

Instead I stayed on and my grades dropped - just the consequences of a decision I made. Luckily I did not fail anything, but 100% will explain that semester as mental health issues. I am in the US for reference.\n\nI am in the natural sciences and am thinking really hard about PhD/academia. I do think I would be successful bc of how much of a nerd I am and my work ethic, but the stress associated with a PhD is seriously turning me off. While I\u2019m years away from actually deciding on a PhD (masters first), I am making all my educational decisions by putting my mental health first. Because if I\u2019m a mess in school I won\u2019t be at my best and will not be able to handle it! Mental health is nothing to mess around with when it comes to school and career.\n\nI think making peace with not being a \u2018traditional\u2019 student is important - being able to accept that things can be harder for me to handle but I WILL get through them no matter what. Finding an understanding advisor is a requirement. Also, at least in natural sciences, I don\u2019t necessarily have to work in academia to satisfy the curiosity that I have. In the US there are government agencies I can work for where I can do research that matters, for example.\n\nHope this helps - just my anecdotal experience.",

      "text": "I'll speak from personal experience here. I graduated with my first degree in physics (UK MPhys) last year after four years. For the entirety of those four years my mental and physical health were terrible - I was severely anorexic and threatened with suspension /  being kicked out early.  I've always known I've wanted to do a PhD and had some pretty good friends who reminded me constantly that I was about to die/ really wasn't fit to live alone/move abroad/ survive a PhD the  way I was. \n\nMy transcript for 2nd year was abysmal - we're talking 40% for computational physics with my highest mark being 70% in the easiest exam (still one of the lowest in the class). No information was retained; in fact I have hardly any memories whatsoever. \n\nWhen it was time to apply for PhD positions my friends sat me down and made it clear that I had to get better and so I made many attempts with university counselling (which eventually worked), saw a GP etc. but I definitely wasn't fit to do a PhD. The PhD I wanted was 1300km away meaning if I got better, body would ever have to know; it also gave me a timeframe of only 6 months to be physically fit - so no, I didn't disclose to my PhD supervisor that I was (at the time) ill; I still haven't because it's not a huge part of my life anymore however (and this is VERY IMPORTANT) if I were to relapse I would be comfortable in speaking to my supervisor about it. \n\nOver the 6 months from March - September I worked damn hard on myself. I caught up on physics I'd never learned, gained weight, learned to cook good food and then I was ready to move abroad. I'm not cured by any means - there are still difficult days/weeks/months but my passion for doing physics beats that and there's no way you can fully commit to your passion when you're struggling constantly. Now, nobody would believe just over a year ago I was skeletal and almost dead if it weren't; for my ever more infrequent instagram rants about food.\n\nThose 6 months were crucial and if I were you, I'd make sure you have a sufficient amount of time off before starting another degree. You want to equip yourself for a graduate degree - it's intense, fast past, and often leaves very little time for oneself. You should build yourself a support group of people ho can keep you accountable, look out for you and to whom you can go when struggling. Finally, strongly consider what you'd hope to achieve by keeping your mental health a secret from a potential supervisor - if they judge you based on it, you probably don't want to work with them; ditto if you don't feel like you trust them with the info. Supervisors are mentors and will want to know you personally, if you try to mask your mental health you run the risk of not establishing as good a relationship as is possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck! If you're passionate - go for it. You've done incredibly well to get this far already.",

      "text": "I\u2019m going into my 3rd year as a PhD student, and when i interviewed i was actually on medical leave from my research job from a bad depression relapse and undiagnosed chronic pain and fatigue issues (turned out to be lupus- it\u2019s been a wild ride). Doing a PhD with both mental and physical illnesses, especially uncontrolled ones (it took the last two years for me to reset and gain a semblance of normalcy- i only just feel about 80-85% now), is extremely hard. I have to advocate for myself on a regular basis, work less hours a week, and be meticulously dedicated and conscientious about my health, my doctors appointments and medications. I\u2019m slower to meet milestones and it sometimes feels like my peers are a mile ahead of me.  And there are always the 1 or 2 professors or students who will judge the sh*t out of you. \n\nAll that said though: I\u2019m in good standing, my GPA looks great, i enjoy my research and my department, and i just secured myself some funding for my dissertation project. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without a wonderfully kind and flexible PI, an amazing support system, and a loud mouth that isn\u2019t afraid to speak out when i feel myself starting to veer off. I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes trying to handle my health, and so have my advisors, and so has my body (lol). But if i could give a TL;DR it would be to always always always put your health before your work. Academia will encourage you to do the opposite, which is where i think people with chronic conditions will struggle a lot, because our threshold for \u201ctoo much\u201d is kind of low, and \u201ctoo much\u201d is the standard in academia. But the more I\u2019m working within my limits, the more I\u2019m seeing that academia doesn\u2019t have to be this way. You do not have to work unhealthy amounts to do well. You do have to work hard. But your professional worth will not be measured in late nights at the lab. \n\nI have no idea if this is a good idea for you. I can tell you that you\u2019re not alone, and i can tell you that I\u2019m so far still afloat, but for every person like me who is able to get themselves through there\u2019s another person who decides to leave. And it really depends on the person and their circumstances at the time. I\u2019m here if you have questions :)",

      "text": "PhD programs are usually 4-6 years (where I am, it\u2019s usually 5). Even if you come in with a master\u2019s already, it will take that much longer. Many institutions, maybe all of them, have a cap for how long you\u2019re allowed to take in the program, including if you need to take a year break here and there. For many around here, at 9 years if you haven\u2019t defended your dissertation, you need to retake all of your coursework and make a new thesis (one defense behind this being that science has changed vastly in 9 years, and everything you learned 9 years ago is now \u201coutdated.\u201d) \n\nI can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s a good idea for you or not. Only you, and maybe your close friends and family, know what you are capable of achieving (which seems like a lot! Go you for your resilience!) But do keep in mind these hard deadlines some universities have.",

      "text": "I have been through a mental illness in my childhood, about 15 years from now.\nIt has not stopped my academia and currently, I am about to end my Phd.\nDuring, my phd there were many life changing personal things, which effected my mental well being, although I was quick to recover.\nI was lucky to get a good supervisor, who at least understood.\nBut, from my experience, I can definitely say that Phd takes lot of efforts not only in your subject but keeping your mental health well too.\nIt is a challenge that most of the Phd face during their degree and numerous studies are coming up, regarding the concern of the mental health of Phds.\nNow, as you are already vulnerable, it will be more challenging for you to cop up with the pressure of a Phd. But, I believe if you want, like you have done in past, you can do it now too.\nBe honest with yourself and tell your supervisor clearly, go in small steps, it might take more time for you, but, it's your life, hence, you will be the leader.\nPlease go ahead what you feel is right for you, it will be a different challenge for you, but, worth it.\nI hope this might help.\nPlease let me know.",
