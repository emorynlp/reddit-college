  "title:": "Is it true that \"there is no job where you are as free as a (tenured) professor\"?",
  "text": "Basically the title.\n\nThe end of my PhD is in sight and the ever-so-often-asked question arises, which is either industry, or go on the hunt for tenure (or everything that is inbetween, e.g., be stuck in the Postdoc-Loop or end up in a mental asylum).\n\nI know that on both ends there are people who truly enjoy what they do, and there are people who don't. The latter usually seem to complain here (like me, right here, right now). But I just sincerely want to know from the industry people here: do you really just grind what is thrown at you, or do you feel some kind of \"self-fulfillment\" that one usually searches in academia?\n\nRight now, for me the hunt for tenure also doesn't look like a lot of freedom, you do everything that gets you papers, skewing your data for those last two impact points, and then there will be a lot of teaching (at least in my country) and hunt for funding. Sure, you are free about your research area...\n\nArea is STEM/pharmaceuticals.\n\nAh and yeah, I am aware of the fact that my mileage will vary, no matter what will be written in this post as a response. I also know that I am thinking about this way too hard and all those people winning Nobel prizes out there (congrats to David Julius) probably never had doubts about their path...\n\n\nEdit: thank you all for engaging to this. It's been a rough past weeks with no end in sight (same shit different day), so talking about my thoughts is my way to vent I guess.",

      "text": ">Sure, you are free about your research area...\n\nThat's basically right. I lucked into a research area that isn't too crowded, so I've been able to get a decent amount of funding, take on students, buy things. I've been able to buy out a bunch of teaching, so I think I have a good amount of flexibility to manage my time. But a lot of my colleagues in more crowded fields feel much less \"free\" about what they do because they love research, but can't do it without money and personnel. Obviously, people are going to define freedom differently, but for me the ability to manage my research program in the way I see fit is crucial in my definition. Which, paradoxically, limits my freedom because research ain't free.",

To a person they express envy of my schedule and flexibility. I would not trade the autonomy and long breaks I get for much, at this point it would require at least 2-3x the salary and I still might not do it. At this point in my life I've established a comfortable middle-class lifestyle and I now value my time a lot more than I do money. I'm hard pressed to think of anyone I know on a personal level who has even a fraction of the free time I do...the one possible exception being a pair of lawyers who are partners in a big firm, but the sacrifices they made to get there (including two failed marriages between them and years of working 7 days/week to keep clients happy and billable hours racking up) were things I would not accept. For example, this fall I've made it to 100% of my kids high school soccer games, most of which start at 330 or 400pm, and I've never missed a band or orchestra concert in 10+ years of having kids in music. My doctor and lawyer friends can't say that.\n\nOnce I made full professor most of the BS pressures went away. I enjoy teaching and am selective about my service. Research, at this point, is something I do either 1) to engage students I hire in the summers, who are a delight to work with, or 2) publish something I'm really interested in sharing with an audience. What that means in practice is that for some years now I've simply walked away from work in mid-May and ignored it entirely until mid-August...haven't worked a day in that off-contract period that was once eaten up by \"free\" labor to keep the publications coming. That 12 weeks in summer, plus 3-4 weeks in winter, plus spring break, plus various fall breaks, means I have about 18 weeks a year with zero work obligations. Can't have that in any other profession I'd care to engage in.",

A handful of my colleagues from my PhD program are just now reaching tenure status, and we have stayed in close touch. By all measures, I have FAR more flexibility and security than my academic counterparts--and I have been able to do that without sacrificing 5 years of my life to the brutal tenure-track treadmill.\n\nCompared to professors in my field (humanities), I make a slightly higher salary with TONS of room for movement, promotion and change. I have just as much or more flexibility in how I spend my time. I work on exciting projects that fulfill my sense of mission and--I think--make the world a measurably better place.\n\nI'm salaried with a large and flexible organization, so as long as I get projects done and attend meetings, I am in control of how I spend my days. I have 25 vacation days and 10 sick days and 12+ holidays. I had a baby 1.5 years into my new position, which had absolutely 0 impact on my career trajectory or timeline to promotion. I go to my older kid's soccer games. I am able to meet the big kid's bus every day and take them to appointments or practices whenever necessary.\n\nAnd if my position should change (the same way that the local university just shredded a couple of departments, including tenured profs), I could easily find a comparable position without having to uproot my family.",

Studies show you end up taking less time off, but that's neither here nor there. The point is if I need to make it to a family event I feel is important I don't feel bad doing it. I have a young child so childcare always takes precedent. \n\nPlus remote work looks like it might take hold post covid. My current company is embracing it so schedule flexibility has only increased. He's got me on the summers off though, I can not compete with that.",

It wasn't until I was promoted to full that I really started just checking out for the entire summer on a regular basis.",

I also feel like this idea of \"freedom in academia\" is a trap created to bait people in to a dying and ever-increasingly irrelevant sector of society. \n\n> Recently resigned professor here: You get the freedom to do your work...and yes on your own time....but there's so much work to do, and you have to demonstrate progress on that work, that you don't have very much \"time\"....there's so much work, in fact, that your work will follow you home into your own personal hours....\n\n> As a research professor in one department, but whose work was interdisciplinary, I was being paid the lesser of what I was worth, and forced to navigate the conditions of the department I was appointed to, whose structure did not accommodate what I needed: research lab, research leave, start up funds. I was basically forced to try to build my lab from the ground up: apply for external funding to run a lab, apply for NIH LRP (because my salary $75k didn't allow me to afford to be able to pay my student loans), apply for multiple research grants at the same time, write manuscripts and submit for publication, advance research on-campus (while I was trying to get my lab up), and teach three courses, with the prospect of teaching four the following semester. Needless to say, this was a fucking nightmare. Sure, I had the \"freedom\" to choose which dragon I wanted to slay at which times, but I did not have the time to juggle all of those things, on top of my personal life. My university would not grant me relocation assistance, and cut my salary by roughly 40% (taxes included) for the first 6 months of my hire, leading into the pandemic where my wife lost her job and I was left breadwinner while we anticipated our first baby.\n\n> No one was my boss, I had complete independent freedom. I ended up having to file bankruptcy because the academic pipeline had no mechanism for me to be able to start from the bottom up on my own....essentially I needed to have some kind of generational wealth. I quit my job -- literally quit academia because I couldn't stand it any more. I had devoted roughly 12 years of my life to develop a career in a field that is basically functionally inept. Although I left academia without another job in-hand, I'm currently interviewing for positions at two different companies, where I can still utilize my research skills, but I'll be making roughly $170k, with $30k cash bonus, and $75k in stocks.\n\n> I'll have a boss, but the culture of the company is incredibly healthy, and absolutely nothing like what any college or university has ever created...",

How is all that _not_ quite a lot of freedom in both relative and absolute terms? \n\nYeah, I've still got to work for a living. But if your definition of \"freedom\" is just \"be fantastically wealthy so you never need to work\" then very few people are truly free. And that's kind of a crap definition of \"freedom\" anyway. (I'm not big on definitions of freedom that are just \"nobody can tell me what to do and I am not constrained by anything in the world.\")\n\nMy goal in going into academia was to have the freedom to study basically whatever I wanted to, and at this point, I have that freedom. Yeah, it comes with some strings (teaching, service) and there are things that would make it easier if I jumped through some hoops (getting grants). I can write about whatever I want and they aren't going to be able to fire me, even if is something the university doesn't want to hear. How's that not academic freedom? Or to put it another way, what would you expect academic freedom to be, if not that?\n\n(This is a separate conversation, of course, about whether this level of academic freedom is as prevalent as it _should_ be. Obviously NTT and pre-tenure faculty do not have these freedoms.)",

I'm not expected to do research, but I teach a 4/4 load, and I still have a lot of flexibility. My latest class ends about 2:30, and it meets one day a week, so most days, I'm done by noon. I have afternoon office hours on some days, but never on Friday, so I have a two-and-a-half day weekend every week. And as someone else commented, I'm off a few weeks at Christmas; a week for Thanksgiving and spring break; and the summer if I choose to take it. If I teach in the summer, I get paid extra. I didn't teach last summer for the first time in several years, and really enjoyed the break. \n\nI could definitely be making more in industry. Some graduates of our department are walking into jobs making as much or more than I am, and I'm fine with that and very proud of them.
