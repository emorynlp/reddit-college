  "text": "I am a TA for Organic Chemistry 2 lab. This is the first in-person lab session since COVID brought everything online. I also was the TA for Orgo 1 lab before COVID. A new issue came up when I was checking the students' results for their first lab. \n\nI started spot-checking melt temps of their samples vs notebooks and noticed that NONE of them matched. I went through and pulled all of their samples and 28/40 of them were completely made up. Like the melt temps were 20*C off of what they wrote in the notebook. It seems like they just looked up the melt temp of their synthesis on Wikipedia and wrote that down instead of reporting their result.  I have never had this problem before. Actually, every time I have checked their results previously, there was no discrepancy. \n\nShould I remind the class to accurately report their results, or go to the section lead?",

      "text": "I TAed a micro lab for a few years, but was the lead the last 2 years. My first year, I noticed data falsification in the lab report. The student had a very strange result for a biochemical test, and I have a very good memory when it comes to things like that. Instead of discussing the strange result, the student just reported what they should have gotten. I took them aside, explained that it was an issue and why, and then let them know that future violations could be considered academic misconduct. This past year, I made a big deal about data falsification at the beginning of the semester, including that I wasn\u2019t going to take off points for \u201cincorrect\u201d data as long as the students were following instructions. Labs are supposed to be learning opportunities. You won\u2019t be perfect at everything. This seemed to help the students be more comfortable with coming to me with questions or issues they were having too. \n\nI\u2019d definitely reach out to the lead before doing anything, but the above seemed to work really well for me.",

The TA is just opening themselves to claims of bias and unfairness, if they choose to penalize someone else for the same or worse offence. Just report it and let those who are equipped to deal with these things deal with them.",

I was probably too na\u00efve my first year as lead, so I didn\u2019t even realize it would be an issue. As soon as I did realize it was a problem, I let the student know individually and then discussed it with all of the students so everyone was on the same page. I learned my lesson though, and added it to my syllabus as well as discussed it on the first day of class my second year. OP should absolutely discuss it with the lead, as I said, before deciding to do anything.",

As a grad student now, my first instinct was to take it straight to the section head (but I also generally have a good/casual relationship with my supervisors).",
