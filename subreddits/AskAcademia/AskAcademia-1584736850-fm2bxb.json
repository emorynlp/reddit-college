Don't you know, going in, if you'll pass or not? Do people actually not pass?? Under what circumstances would sometime fail? \n\nThat was more than one question. Also, congrats to OP!",

There's all sorts of reasons why members of the committee might not pass someone, and it depends a lot of the field, the culture of the institution, and the specific makeup of the committee. I was something like 80/20 or 90/10 they would pass me, but I'm a pessimist and I have an incredibly shitty department advisor. Ideally, once you get to the defense stage you're more or less certain your research is good, your theories are solid, and your writing is on par. Reality often shoots holes in one or more of those areas. You will have problems with research methods, your theories will be contested, and at least one of your committee will be baffled by your writing. The mark of a good scholar is getting to be good enough to have acceptable research, not striving for perfection on all counts. \n\nAnd thank you!",

That way it tests your ethics, philosophy, logic, and modus operandi all at once. Or am I missing the mark? Congrats btw! I'm super envious!",

As for questions not answered by your project, sometimes that can seem a bit of an ambush, depending how it's phrased, because it might seem that you didn't answer something important or obvious in your research. But usually the answer is either it's not within the scope of the dissertation, or it's reserved for future research.",
