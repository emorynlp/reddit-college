  "title:": "As a research assistant, I was asked if I want to get involved in more projects. Idk what to say",
  "text": "I have been doing solely data entry for the past four months, for two projects. I know of another project going on in the lab, but the person who initially told me they would ask for my help on it hasn't reached out in 2.5 months, saying that they need to finalize something before I can get involved, and that they would let me know when that is. I don't know what else is going on in the lab. I work remotely, so I don't hear about projects in passing. Also there isn't a lab task board or slack or anything like that (maybe I'm just not added to it). \n\nI don't know what else I could do besides data entry. I know Python & Java & a bit of MATLAB, but I don't know how much/if any coding is needed for any projects. Even if it is needed, there are PhD students and post-docs much more qualified to do that. What should I say? Nothing, and just take advantage of my light workload? I actually only have about 1.5 months left of this job. Would I be wasting this opportunity that I have to learn more about research? (it's my first job in a lab) Should I say \"I'm willing to do data entry or coding for any project that is in need of it at the moment?\" Should I email the person who ghosted me asking for an update?\n\nField of research: behavioral sciences   Title: undergraduate research assistant   Country: USA",

Also, youre young - you can learn new stuff - so dont be worried about not being qualified. Just ask for help and guidance if you find that you need it. Take the opportunity if you want to continue in that line of work",

If you would be interested depending on the work, say \"I would love to hear about the project(s) and the role you have in mind.\"\n\nNo need to warn them about what skills you have or don't have. PIs don't ask undergraduates expecting them to already know how to do research.",
