  "text": "For what are probably obvious reasons, my university is surveying grad students to see if we prefer a pass/fail grade. This is my second masters, and I hope to go into a PhD afterward. I felt like taking a pass/fail was the obvious choice, but people have given me doubts. \n\nWhat do you think? How would you evaluate a pass/fail grad school metric for next year's PhD candidates?",

      "text": "Ours went this way: students have one week after getting their final (A-F) grades to decide whether to turn them into P/F grades. If they decide to do P/F, the course still counts as a requirement for majors, but does not contribute to their GPA. This is all mandated from above so professors don't have to choose anything.\n\nI think this splits the difference somewhat nicely. It's basically saying, \"courses are still real courses,\" but \"if you don't do as well as you'd hoped, you can make the course not count towards your GPA, but still get graduation credit for it.\" I also am glad it doesn't make me pick; I'm not the good guy or the bad guy here.\n\nThe students, if the Reddit forum for our university is to be trusted, seem to like this option as well.\n\n(I've talked to my own students about this, most seem very happy with it. My honors freshmen worried a little that this will require explanation for grad or med school admissions but I've assured them that the admissions people are going to understand that this was a weird semester and they'll hardly be the only ones in this situation.)",

Admissions people aren't robots, and they're not sadists \u2014 they're going to understand that this semester (and maybe next...) are bizarre and not meaningful grade-wise, because it's going to be bizarre for all applicants that have this time period. The result will be them looking to other indicators to assess you. There are a lot of different ways this could work (e.g., just ignore this semester and focus on the other ones as being more indicative). But either way, it'll all come out in the wash. I wouldn't stress about it. If you are a good student it'll be clear in a million other ways; academic performance indicators (your other grades, your thesis/capstone project if you have one, your letters of recommendation, your standardized testing, etc.) are mostly correlated, so one semester's worth of weirdness for an international emergency isn't going to change much either way.",

They believed this was more fair than giving students it as an option in a time of crisis, since having the choice pressures people to opt for normal grading to remain competitive (in GPA) with others who also opt for normal grading and manage to get A's. Essentially, they felt there would be a stigma to choosing P/F, since it would essentially be admitting you don't think you could get an A in these circumstances.\n\nAnother argument they made was that, due to the sudden adoption of remote learning in most courses and the extreme pressures put on faculty during this outbreak, it was unreasonable to expect instructors to be able to adequately judge the difference between A vs B vs C level work this semester.",

That only works if all of your C to A students take P/F. If the students who get an A choose to take an A and the students who get a C choose to take P/F then you've just replaced C's with P's; it still acts like this giant beacon, singling out everyone who struggled this term. \n\nOptional P/F, especially if they have the option *after* their final grades are released, still penalises them.\n\nMandatory P/F across the board does suck for students who do well and want to improve their GPA, but I don't think there's a solution that benefits everyone and keeps things fair. Maybe at the very least universities could suspend the rules about probation so students who specifically need to raise their GPA to stay enrolled or keep scholarships won't be penalised for going P/F.",

I understand it varies a lot between fields, but in mine (humanities) graduate school grads are meaningless. In my Ph.D. program everyone got As all the time, and if you got two Bs in one semester you were put on probation.
