  "title:": "Update on my struggling master's student",
  "text": "I wanted to thank everyone for their thoughtful advice and encouragement, and to provide an update for you, as I know [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/6g06k8/how_to_gently_reject_a_student/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit) generated quite the response.\n\nWhen I had initially made my post, I was not aware of Sara\u2019s final marks in her coursework as she had received extensions on assignments, and I believed her to be in a better position than she was. While her exam marks had averaged out around 51%, I was unaware of how she had done in the courses that were not my own. Marks were fully calculated and posted at the end of last week, and Sarah\u2019s GPA was not in the 2.0-2.3 range that I had expected, but instead at a 1.0. It goes without saying that this will preclude her from any PhD programs. \n\nWhile her GPA could be minorly salvaged by her thesis, at the moment, it does not look like she will complete it. Disability services contacted me on Friday afternoon to inform me that Sarah has only met her first check-point with them, and she should have completed her third last week. It is worth noting that she set out these goals for herself, so there can\u2019t be any claims of unfair expectations.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Sarah was in my office first thing this morning. She wanted to go over the breakdown of her marks and discuss how her current average is so low. We went over her exam papers for my courses, we looked at her final marks in each class and discussed how grades were calculated.\n\nSarah admitted to me that she was disappointed, as she had hoped that her performance on the exams would raise her marks enough to qualify her for funding. Armed with encouragement from this sub, I took the opportunity, bit the bullet, and explained to her that with these marks she is not a competitive applicant for our PhD program and that she should not be depending on, nor expecting admission for September. I told her that I could help her explore other options if she was interested, but I did not feel that this was the best path for her. \n\nSarah took a moment to consider this information and then asked if her exam marks could be changed. Specifically, she asked if the questions she did not answer could be excluded from her final mark. Those of you who read my previous post will remember that Sarah did not complete 3 of her 4 exams. On one of those exams, she did not answer half of the questions. Obviously, if we were to exclude the unanswered questions from the calculations of her final mark, the end result would be quite different. \n\nA few of you believed that I have been too hard on Sarah already, and I fully expect that you will not be pleased with my response but I stand by it. I **will not** be changing Sarah\u2019s exam marks as it would not be fair to the other students. \n\nSarah received extra tutoring from myself and my colleague, as per the request of disability services, she had an extra hour, one-on-one with each of us once a week for a month leading up to the exams. As laid out in the plan created by herself and disability services, she received four hours instead of the scheduled two for her exams. She was in a well-lit room with ample natural light away from any possible street noise. Myself or my colleague were present for the entire duration of each of her exams as we were told she could only have one other person in the room with her (no official proctor) and that it had to be one of us so that she could ask questions as she saw fit \u2013 something she did not take advantage of. It was made abundantly clear to her that if, at any time, during the exam process she felt that she was not being sufficiently accommodated that we would recalibrate and rework until we found a solution. She did not at any point mention this, or ask about changing the ways things were being done.\n\nHer cohort did not receive anything nearing this level of help or accommodation and I do not feel that it would be in any way fair to additionally alter Sarah\u2019s exams, with the exclusive purpose of boosting her marks. Perhaps if she had asked *before* learning her results I would have considered discussing it with disability services, but no. Not at this point. I feel that our department has fully accommodated her, and as we have done everything that has been asked of us, and that she needs to take some responsibility: if the accommodations were not sufficient, she should have told us beforehand, or she needs to accept that her quality of work does not merit higher grades. \n\nI told Sarah that this was something that I could not and would not do. I explained that it would not be fair to her cohort and that, unfortunately, these are the grades she earned. She then asked if she would be allowed to re-sit the exams \u2013 the same exams, under the same conditions. I again expressed that I would not do this as, again, this would be unfair to her cohort, all of whom I\u2019m sure would love the opportunity to re-take one or more of their exams in order to boost their marks. I am not prepared, nor willing, to allow my entire master\u2019s class to retake their exams because they might not be happy with their grades. I think that is simply ridiculous. Again, if she could provide a legitimate reason, beyond being unhappy with her final marks, I would be happy to open up a discussion. \n\nSarah then told me that if I will not change her final marks or allow her to re-take all of her exams, she will file a complaint with disability services and the Dean of Graduate Studies as she does not feel that her needs are being adequately met. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she feels that way, but that I will be holding firm and will not be allotting her marks that she did not earn simply because she wants them, and that I think it would be best for her to focus on her thesis.\n\nAt which point she told me she was headed to disability services to file her complaint and that I should receive it shortly. So that is a disappointing end to a stressful year. \n\nThank you again for all of the support and insight that was provided. ",

If you think the mascot on your cereal box is plotting the downfall of the Ottoman Empire, you need more help than a school can provide.  Less amusingly, if you're suffering from chronic depression, you need to take some time off and deal with that rather than expecting the school to come up with some magical anti-depression machine that will 'accommodate' your issues.\n\nLastly, there are a disappointingly large number of people for whom 'stupid and unmotivated' counts as a disability.  I will freely acknowledge that these are major impediments to success in life.  But they're not something disability services can fix for you.",

Probably not outright threatening professors, given the scale, but you could in theory scrounge up enough participation grades/extra credit to get you through, weighted by the fact that UG classes are easier and the graduation requirements aren't as strict. There's also the fact that \"elite\" and \"very good marks\" are ambiguous concepts. Some people think NYU is elite, and a B is a good mark.\n\nE: I'm not sure I'd leap to \"customer mentality\" as the foregone conclusion. I'm sure there are schools that graduate subpar students because they are trying to protect yields or keep that tuition money coming (which happens in Britain, and on the continent, too), but my own experience with the US system has been that, at the undergraduate level and below, it is particularly well-suited to a student such as OP's first impression of Sara - hardworking, but not necessarily intelligent. Besides the wealth of extra credit (which isn't legal in any system outside the US to my knowledge), a final course grade in US undergrad can consist of nonsense like participation, attendance, homeworks, presentations, drafts, etc etc. It's more forgiving that way, and teaches things like perseverance, consistency, responsibility, as well as the curriculum (which helps more in the working world than a native knowledge of Latin), but I suspect it's why Phd admissions here are holistic and people are adamant that grades don't tell the whole story - in the sense that you can have a 4.0 and still be a functional idiot.",

I get that grade inflation is a problem, it drives me nuts. But here's another big problem: people come to our (American) colleges with an *amazingly* wide educational background background. People who come from underfunded school districts (of which we have many) come in at a severe disadvantage. Traditional course designs are more likely to \"weed out\" these people (from the course, the major, even the college or university) than help them succeed. But why should that be? Why should someone be drummed out of college because s/he had the misfortune to be born poor? Or nonwhite? With these \"nonsense\" techniques, we can help people catch up to their educationally advantaged peers (c.f. Haak *et al.* 2011), and set them up to be successful.",

Haak et al. 2011), and set them up to be successful.\n\nNot that I read the paper, but from what I understand, what sets up disadvantaged peers to be successful is mentorship and support from faculty and administration. This nonsense, to use a convenient summary term, is just proxies for that. You can monitor that a student is coming to class without making it part of her grade. You can grade only the final draft and still work together with her on her earlier ones.\n\nFinally, whilst America does suffer (and benefit) from being so vast and diverse, it is not the only country that faces such circumstances. Most other countries deal with the same problem of underfunded school districts, variety of abilities, and discrimination, and do so, less successfully or more successfully, without resorting to participation grades. That is not to say that participation grades are anathema. That is to say that, a, the existence of disadvantaged students probably isn't the sole reason for the existence of participation grades, b, there may exist other techniques for achieving the outcome you identify here.",

She also seems fairly new to disability services (otherwise she would have set more reasonable goals). Maybe she's suddenly empowered by understanding her condition and has been encouraged to advocate for herself. It's tough to understand how someone can have potential and not use it well. I have one student who for the past three years simply has to write 10 pages to get a masters. That's it. 10 double spaced pages. And he never will. I've had to accept that his condition prevents it. \n\nFinally, you can't blame a person who has dreams for not being able to handle the fact that she is incapable of reaching those dreams. \n\nI personally think this is the best outcome. If she files a complaint it will hopefully be reviewed by the administration. You have done what you feel is right, so you have your integrity.

I've worked so independently not only because I am difficult and rebellious, but also because basically after the first month or less of undergrad research if I asked exactly how to plan my experiments, I was always told I had to figure out that myself (although my advisor usually was and is generally very approachable). Yes, I started my PhD at 24, after MSc. So did some students who were at that point much more independent about research planning, and some who were much less. But yes, before I decided to stay with him for PhD, my advisor advised me to explore other options but to not do PhD in the UK or anywhere where I'd have only 3 years because it's just too little for learning independence (in general and especially for me as I only started doing research the summer between undergrad and MSc).",

      "text": "Reading this I am kind of the in the same place as Sara.  I am a master student who had a marriage blow up by second semester, had trouble with my memory afterwards that was found to be a sleep apnea and then while that was getting fixed it was found I have a crazy high heart rate.  Did not so well on two classes and needed twice to take time off, and was removed from a research project over it.\n\nMy adviser, who I love, straight out told me no to continuing to a PhD when I did not graduate in two years.  Has not budged since.  As for my thesis, I made progress but it is known that if I do not meet the deadlines I will be dropped from the program.  Clock gets stopped when I need to take time off.\n\nI think this is a fair setup.  What I need to do is made clear, and if I cannot do it due to illness, then odds are I should not be in school and take leave.  This seems like what will have to happen here.  You and disability services will have to meet and make a plan and then you can support her, but ultimately, make it known that she has to follow the plan.\n\nAs for rejecting her for a PhD, hold firm that she is not PhD material.  It is rough to hear, but a PhD is harder than a masters and if she is struggling now, then she will struggle more with comps/quals, more advanced coursework and the dissertation.  The PhD dissertation it sounds like will be the issue, as if she is having troubles with the master's thesis, and even course papers, I cannot see her doing a dissertation.  It will be REALLY hard for her to hear this, as it was with me, but the sad truth is, my health makes it very unlikely I will get to do a PhD unless my treatment starts to finally kick in a bit more and my health improves.  Or well, I could do a PhD, but then I will put a future advisor into your place, which is really not fair.  Then again I do really care about my small field, and I know if I cannot finish the PhD, I will take the spot of someone who can move the field forward.\n\nThis forum is filled with stories of awful advisors and clearly that is not you.  You were extremely accommodating, and even as someone in a place like Sara is, I find changing grades that were from incomplete work messed up.  My two bad marks I could have argued and had reasonable cases to do so, but they accurate representations of the work I did.  I also do not agree at all with grade changes or test retaking for select students, as that gives those who beg for grades an unfair advantage.  Reasonable accommodations, are supposed to be that, reasonable.  They also exist to balance the field in regards to her conditions.  What they should not do is replace standards or coursework, which is what it sounds like she wants.  \n\nSo from someone who is near where she is, I think you have done more than you should have already.  You are right, at some point she needs to take responsibility.  She also needs to be held accountable to following the plans she makes.  My advisor uses this to avoid these hard decisions.  He also does not make it personal.  When I had to be removed from a project due to legal issues with the divorce, he explained why it was being done and I did not like but he was right.  He also explained clearly as an advisor he has many functions, and while he will support me any way he could, as someone in charge of making sure a grant based project got finished on time, he needed to take that role seriously as well.  He did get me into a different project that was a far better fit for me though.  But this I think needs to be done with Sara.  You need to explain you will help her as her advisor, but as an educator you have to evaluate her as well according to school policy.  If she fails to meet goals you have to evaluate her and you have to maintain the standards of education set by the school.  \n\nWish you well on the fallout from this.  Sounds like she will make a lot of noise, but in the end, accommodations can only do so much and the student needs to work as well.  She really does not sound like she can endure a PhD so allowing her to continue will do her a disservice.  Some will say not to crush her dreams, but she needs to hear the truth as well.  Protecting her from criticism will just make it that much harder when she is told she is not PhD material in the future by people who really do not care to accommodate or shelter her.",

She requires a lot of supports, from many different people, and in a higher-stress situation like a PhD, I can only imagine her as requiring more assistance.

              "text": "It is not insensitive though to value your time.  I know that is why my advisor will not take me on.  We could make things work, but the comes becomes is that really fair.  He turned down all students for two years as he is stretched thin himself, so to take me on for a PhD while rejecting everyone else kind enters into an area where it has to be asked is it fair to others if I advance.  To his credit, my advisor did lay out exactly what I needed to do to continue to a PhD, and that if I did not meet those goals I would not be able to advance and he would not likely take me on.  What he also did, that you may consider, is he advised me to talk to my other professors.  His view was just because he does not wish to take me on, I should not rule out working with people in my department if my heart was set on staying.  He also offered to write me a letter of recommendation for other programs, including his former advisor.\n\nSomething that has not been mentioned, is if the issues with Sarah are mental, it may be in her best interest to cut her off for her own good.  We do not talk about it, but academia has a rate of mental health issues that can lead to negative health effects or suicide.  If she is struggle now with what looks like comps and the thesis, the dissertation prep work is far more stressful and intensive and pushes some well adjusted students to their limits.  Then if she wanted to teach, there is the job hunt that seems even more stressful than getting the PhD.  \n\nComparing my situation and this one, I think the biggest takeaway is my advisor tries to set parameters from the start, which may be something that may be helpful for you to do.  Lay out early what is expected if students want to continue on, what is expected of students in their coursework, and other projects and make sure it is known what happens if they fail to meet that goal.  It sounds like disability services has done this to some degree, but in general it seems like this is a good practice to do in general to avoid situations like this where you wonder if you are doing enough.\n\nFinally I have no idea what area you work in, but I do education and had to do the class on testing.  A large part of this class was what is an accommodation and what is a modification.  What Sarah seems to want at this point is modifications, or changes to the nature of the program.  Whereas accommodations should put a student on a level playing field by negating many of the aspects of their disability, modifications change the playing field.  Usually modifications change the standards, material to be covered or projects that are required.  The main different on a practical level, is accommodations expect grading and learning outcomes to remain unchanged, and whereas modifications directly change the learning outcomes and standards of learning. Looking at what Sarah is requesting she is requesting that her learning outcomes and mastery standards be adjusted, which leaves the area of accommodations and enters into modifications.  Modifications usually are reserved for extreme cases, like where a student with dyscalculia does not do the same homework as his classmates when they start multiplication.  Their work will remain in addition and subtraction.  Or a student with dyslexia may be excused from doing a book report.  College students however are expected to meet the standards the college sets for all students.  Sometimes the term academic adjustment is used in college settings, but these are modifications that do not changes the standards.  Knowing where the line is between the two, should help ease the worry that you did not do enough to provide reasonable accommodations and possibly explain to Sarah why you cannot alter her grades.  She has the right to request reasonable things to allow her to do her best, but nowhere in the disability rights is there the right to a degree, or admissions to an advanced program if she cannot meet the standards.  The responsibility is on her to figure out what she needs and how to meet the standards.  \n\nGood luck with this.  As for my struggles, they set me back, but in a way, they also helped me a lot.  A got to take time to really spend time working with my area of focus and learn secondary skills to better prepare me for research to attack a complex problem in my field that would lead to a great dissertation down the line.  Also the time I spent recovering allowed a few people to get professorships and grants doing similar research to what I want to work on.  So while I would love to be teaching now with a PhD, the longer road may prove to be the better one as the work I moving into is far more interesting and of greater value to my field.",

You make a good suggestion and perhaps at next year's meeting, I'll discuss the expectations for PhD as well. \n\nUnfortunately, all students must be accepted by both our department and Graduate Studies as a whole. Even if one of my colleagues was willing to supervise Sarah, there's no way Graduate Studies would admit her with such a low GPA. \n\nI agree that Sarah would be better off outside of academia. As I have said in other comments, while this may be her passion, she really is struggling. One of my worries before my initial post was her ability to do work independently. This course has caused her so much stress and anxiety (as evidenced by the many tearful meetings in my office) and we are a small, close-knit department that has offered her every support available. I'm frankly not sure how she would handle deadlines and stressful situations when out on her own. \n\nThank you. She is looking for modifications, exactly. Her argument is that she should not be assessed on work she did not complete and while I understand that, it doesn't quite jive with my understanding of accomodation, or even your explanation of modification. She isn't asking that certain questions be excluded because they in particular cause her difficulty, instead she's asking that we remove the final few questions of her exam from her final mark because she did not attempt them/ran out of time. \n\nI'm glad things worked out for you and that you're in a better situation for yourself.

You have invested a lot of time in Sarah, and seemed to have been very understanding and accommodating to her needs. \n\nAs someone who has used the mental health resources at my university and gone through a rough personal patch in my graduate studies, I am sympathetic to her issues. I remember you saying she is new to Canada (she is from the States?), which can exasperate mental health issues and work productivity. It seemed like she was making use of her resources, and advocating for herself which is important, especially with the stigma attached to even getting academic help. At the same time, I have been an instructor who has dealt with students who have basically threatened me with complaining when I didn't give them the mark they thought they deserved.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear that it seems Sarah is basically throwing a temper tantrum when she didn't get her way. You seemed to have gone above and beyond your role as a Masters advisor (and in an unofficial role, I might add). Yes, we do not know what Sarah is going through. So let's not assume, but I do not agree with some posters here who've said that we shouldn't \"blame\" her for her reactions because her dreams have been dashed. 1) At this point, people have to take responsibility for their actions. She's not a child. I would think she's at least 22. In order to be a successful adult, researcher, and a grad student, Sarah needs to learn to take setbacks and failures with grace and maturity. It is a skill set that needs to be learned, and she doesn't have it (yet). Of course she can cry and yell at home, and even express extreme disappointment in front of you, but then to put the blame outwards and ostensibly threaten you - someone who has seemingly done nothing but try to listen and assist her - is very unprofessional and burns bridges. 2) Her failure should not be surprising, and it was more a fact of willful ignorance since she was struggling in many classes that she believed she could get accepted into a PhD program. That is not on you. ",

      "text": "I work in higher ed disability services, and you did absolutely the right thing. She can file a complaint with the office, but if the administrators have any sense it will go nowhere. Our office always educates students about the law and purposes of accommodations at the college level- accommodations only guarantee access, not success. Students are not entitled to accommodations that alter the fundamental nature of a course or its standards. \n\nThis is not high school, we can not and will not ask professors to cut back the number of assignments for a student, or allow them additional opportunities to improve their grades just because they are registered with our office. Students make choices, and Sarah chose to not follow through with the *generous* terms your department set out for her. \n\nI also want to thank you for upholding your standards. This makes my job easier, and truly upholds the integrity of your institution. I know university politics are complicated these days with administrations putting retention of students above almost anything else, but retention doesn't matter if we are lowering our academic expectations and graduating students who believe that they are buying degrees, not earning them and should be passed no matter what.

Her lack of accountability with both myself and disability services will not go in her favour. \n\n>but retention doesn't matter if we are lowering our academic expectations and graduating students who believe that they are buying degrees, not earning them and should be passed no matter what.  \n\nI wholeheartedly agree. I've yet to encounter this attitude in my real life, but I have seen it a few times while lurking the academic subreddits here. I remember one post in particular where the student claimed that his graduate program had worse 'customer service' than Wal-Mart, insisting that as he had 'paid' for his degree, his professors should be more lenient and less strict.\n\nThis is not the purpose of education. We are not here to provide a service, we are here to provide tools and edification. Tuition is not a payment for a degree, but rather a payment for opportunity. ",

A lot of the feedback the program got was that they paid for the program, and expected to have a throughline into the PhD program. To quote a student, \"I want to get the degree that I paid for,\" and then another prof immediately responded, \"No you get the degree you earned.\" \n\n[Boom, roasted.](http://www.trendspotters.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anigif_optimized-31687-1425330052-7.gif)",
