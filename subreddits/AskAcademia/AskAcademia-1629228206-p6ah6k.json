  "title:": "I use Mendeley, 2nd author uses Endnote - how can be combine our bibliographies?",
  "text": "We're writing a review together and it's huge so manual replacement of references is my last option.\n\nI wrote the first draft and used Mendeley, then the 2nd author wrote their part in a separate word file and used Endnote as a citation manager. They sent me the xml file of their Endnote library which I imported into Mendeley, but I'm wondering if there is any automated solution for replacing Endnote references with Mendeley ones, so that the final bibliography is clean.\n\nI could go through the text and delete each of their (endnote) references and replace them with a Mendeley reference, but just their part has around 300 references so if there's an automatic way of doing this, I'd love to know!",

I just read the title and  first few lines.  \n\nAnd i don't understand the down votes... Sorry about that.\n\nNow back to the question (you could have framed your title differently). What you're talking about is not just combining bibliographies, but merging the two documents using two different citation tools. That's a two step process. First you convert the document you want to merge into configuration of your citation tool (in your case convert endnote document into mendeley document). Then merge the two files. Then update the new document. \n\nI don't know how it's done in mendeley, but I'm sure there is a way to do so in there. \n\nI don't know if it helps you or not but here are the steps of converting a mendeley document to an endnote file. \n\nIn order to convert a document created using Mendeley's \"Cite-O-Matic\" tools, it needs to be formatted in a custom style. [Here ](https://clarivateanalytics.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/41000001O1D5/a/4N000000a9IY/HjvO7jWoi6qzbnnlTKvieYsec4wfmtRwP8v7Uo3IrBQ) is the \"Mendeley-to-Endnote-Title.csl\" file.\u00a0Now add the custom style to the Mendeley program.\n\nOpen Mendeley and click View > Citation Style > More Styles.\n\nUnder the Installed tab, please drag and drop the custom style.\n\nNow in the word program follow the steps below:\u00a0\n\nOpen Word, click the References tab, click on Style dropdown > More Styles.\n\nSelect Mendeley-to-Endnote-Title and click OK. Now references will display only the title in the open and close curly braces: {Title}.\u00a0\n\nOpen the\u00a0EndNote\u00a0library and the document formatted using the \"custom\" style.\n\nSave the modified document with a new name.\n\nWindows:\u00a0Press [Ctrl]+A on the keyboard to highlight everything.\n\nMac:\u00a0Press [Command]+A on the keyboard to highlight everything.\n\nWindows:\u00a0Press [Ctrl]+6 (above the \"T\" and \"Y\" key) to remove any field codes.\n\nMac:\u00a0Press [Command]+6 (above the \"T\" and \"Y\" key) to remove any field codes.\n\nRemove any Bibliography present in the document.\n\nUpdate the document with the appropriate style using the\u00a0EndNote\u00a0tools.\u00a0",
