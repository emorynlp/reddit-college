If so, he is probably good at cooperation and starting stuff. \n\nHowever, in my experience, there are different kinds of people. Some get new ideas every day and just throws suggestions out there willy-nilly without much commitment. If it sticks on the wall it sticks. Other people have fewer ideas but follow through on them. These two types can become just as successful and publish as much. The first one throws 100 hooks out and finishes 10. The other throws 10 out and finish 10.\n\nKeep your eyes and ears open to what kind of commitment to the cooperation he is looking for here.",

You are clearly bringing something of value to the table. Don't be moon-eyed by the attention. Academic theft comes in many varieties. Professors have been sued for lifting their students' work. Although you're not a student, I don't see why something similar couldn't occur. It's highly advised that discussions about authorship take place early on in a project--like who's going to be first author, etc. All that stuff matters.\n\nI'm really hoping that this materializes into the dream situation it should be, but just be careful.",
