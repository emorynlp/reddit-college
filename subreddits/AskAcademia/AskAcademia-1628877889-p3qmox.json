  "title:": "Trying to Decide When To Graduate",
  "text": "Hello! \n\nI'm a Ph.D candidate in English literature currently. I started writing my dissertation this time last year (Fall 2020). I am on track to graduate in May 2022, and I'm planning to apply for some jobs this year. Having said that, I recently had a faculty advisor tell me that I would be a more compelling candidate if I had more articles published before I go on the market. He suggested that I slow down on the dissertation and graduate in December 2022 or May 2023 to give myself more time to publish additional articles. Currently, I have one article published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal in my field and a forthcoming article in another journal with a similar reputation. So my question is: how many publications should I try to have before I go on the market? My university is one with a heavy teaching requirement so I have a lot of teaching experience. Will that potentially bolster my job application even though I've only had two articles accepted for publication? \n\nThank you in advance for any responses!",

      "text": "So I just served on a search committee for a TT job in an English department at my regional uni. I think 2 respectable, relevant articles would be enough to get you on the short list. I know the people we interviewed had that. Perhaps one or two of them only had a single article out, but two I think is the minimum. Others may disagree - my uni isn't very competitive (but I like it). A wide range of teaching would also definitely help you if you were applying here. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I think it depends on what level of academe you want to go to.\n\nIf you want to go to a teaching institution, graduate on your schedule with your teaching experience. If you want to go to an R1 or R2, I think your advisor has a point and an additional article or 2 would be useful.\n\nWay back when, I started teaching at a CC as I was finishing my degree from a top R1. I had my final meeting and approval before fall classes started but I didn't hand in my dissertation to the Registrar's office until January so that I'd officially be a year later. I did that in case I hated teaching at a CC and so decided to apply to R1's and R2's. In that case my CC would be on my CV as teaching experience as I was finishing up my degree. Turns out I loved the teaching more than research and spent a career at the same place.",
