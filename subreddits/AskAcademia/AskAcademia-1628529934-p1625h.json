  "title:": "Example Tenure Letter of Rec from a Student Perspective?",
  "text": "I was asked by a former professor to write a letter of rec for his promotion to tenure track/associate professor. I want my letter to be great because, well, the professor is great and I owe him a lot! I've searched Reddit for all the advice concerning how to write a good tenure letter of rec from a student perspective, which has been very helpful, but something's still not clicking. Generally, I'm one of those people who need an example of something before I understand how to do it, and while I've found example letters of rec from professors to students on the web, I haven't found the reverse. \n\nWithout an example letter to work off of, I'm concerned that I'm talking about \\*myself\\* too much in the letter (focusing on my experience in the classroom with the professor, how he helped me get into grad school, how much his class taught/impacted me, etc) as opposed to talking about the professor himself. But the point of such a letter is to emphasize the positive impact he has on students, right? I'm having a hard time understanding how much to center my own experience of the professor versus talk more generally about his virtues.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to strike this balance or is willing to share an example of such a letter (all personal information redacted, of course), I'd be truly appreciative.",

      "text": "As a chair I find these student letters most useful when they are 1) personal, and 2) specific. Students are generally not viewed as experts on pedagogy or content, so a student letter that says Dr.X is an excellent teacher and knows a lot aren't very helpful. Conversely, those that explain the role a professor had in the educational journey of the writer-- inspired them, focused them, helped improve their writing, gave great advice, etc. --are helpful. Better still if they include specific examples, \"I found Dr. X's use of different materials and teaching styles to be a perfect match for the course content, their feedback really helped my writing, and I will take away their lessons on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ as a guide throughout my life.\" Or whatever.\n\nPersonal. Specific. Brief.  A page should be enough.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your feedback! I really appreciate hearing what a chair finds useful. If I may ask a two clarifying questions:\n\n1) You say students are not viewed as experts on pedagogy or content (I certainly wasn't at the time I took this professor's class!) but I did graduate from this professor's college (good reputation, but small and relatively unknown) and go on to grad school at a highly-ranked, well-known university. Would discussing the professor's impact on helping my academic career this way be helpful (as in, proof the professor is helping students succeed)?\n\n2) I've read elsewhere that shorter letters are worse (ie, don't have many good things to say) and seen 1.5-2 pages recommended as a minimum. Does the length actually make it or break it, or does this perhaps come down to spacing (such as recommending a single-spaced one-page letter versus a double-spaced two-page letter)? \n\nThanks again!",

Long ones rarely say anything more than short ones, especially when they are from students. 1-2 pages total (double spaced) would be plenty.\n\nThanks for doing this-- on behalf of all faculty, as I know it's hard to get students to write LORs.\n\n-SA",

      "text": "I wrote a recommendation letter like this once - not for tenure, but for an external mentorship award. I too struggled with how much of 'me' to put into the letter, but ultimately decided that since this particular professor had done so much to shape the direction and success of my career, it was important to include information on my background. My final letter read kind of like a narrative of our relationship, highlighting specific actions they took that guided me on my academic journey - things like encouraging me to join a particular club, writing reference letters, helping me secure an internship, etc. I also made sure to include things they consistently did for all students, and not just me.\n\nBest of luck with your letter! Though I found the writing process really difficult, I was also appreciative of the opportunity to support my mentor in this way.",

Generic statements from a student about a professor's virtues will likely have very little impact, so I would avoid them unless they are illustrated with your personal experiences with the professor.",

For example:\n\n\u201cIt was Professor X\u2019s enthusiasm about [the subject] that piqued my interest in this area of study. Without Professor X, I would not have gone to graduate student to pursue [this topic].  It is this general attitude and excitement that Professor X brings to the classroom every day and it\u2019s easy to see why they inspire so many students.  Sometimes, it\u2019s as simple as when Professor X makes a joke to relax the class, other times, they use new memes and videos to really get the class involved.  Their passion for the topic is infectious!",

I wrote at length about how this prof was the reason I chose my major (anthropology), and mentioned some students seemed to find his content dull, but I was enthralled, (which tbh is to be expected in his specialty: paleolithic stone tool industries.
