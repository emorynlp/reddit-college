  "text": "Is it beneficial to reach out and make preliminary connections/introduce yourself to some faculty members in universities you're applying to work for in this cycle? My advisor mentioned this as something they would encourage, but in our department's job search seminar, it was mentioned this practice is generally frowned upon.\n\nThose on hiring committees or that have been on the job market, what say you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone! My advisor definitely seems to be the odd-man-out on this and I'm very glad to not follow his advice. ",
