  "text": "Thinking back to when I was in undergrad (early '90s). You would be in a big lecture course, and after an exam the prof would post everyone's grades on the wall outside the classroom so you could walk up and see what you got. (Not everyone had e-mail yet, and course management systems were years off.)\n\nThe grades were not organized by name, because that would be too easy to know someone else's grade.\n\nNo, by Social Security number.",

I still saw that done with some regularity into the late 1990s, but not since. \n\nThere were further amendments to FERPA (and then No Child Left Behind) in 2001 or so that made even directory information subject to privacy rules. That's when my school stopped publishing the student directory with photos (usually senior pics of the incoming freshman). At my college in the 1980s we called it the \"Who's New to Screw\" book.",

      "text": "Wow. Even in the mid-'80s here we had discreet student numbers, and that's what was used.\n\nI went back to school in the late '90s to finish my undergrad work, and we had profs posting grades on the wall as late as about 2000 or 2001.  My university mailed us grades as well, which is how you found out your grade if the professor didn't post grades or you weren't on campus enough to see.\n\nEventually (I forget when) they became available online as soon as released by the Dean's office, which is what we still use today.  And you can only see your own grade, and, if you order an informal transcript (doable online in about five minutes), you can see the class mean and standard deviation, too.",
