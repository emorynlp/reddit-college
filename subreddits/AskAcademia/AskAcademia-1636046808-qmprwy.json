  "title:": "During my PhD study I had supervised a Masters Student. I have doubts regarding the validity of his data - on one of his graphs I am confident it is not possible to get the result he described. I asked for raw data but he stated his USB was stolen. Was I wrong not to pursue it any further?",
  "text": "In 2019 my PhD study I co-supervised a masters student (lets call him Martyn).   \n\n\nI will not show the masters thesis to avoid any identification. Although the student in question is Chinese, so am I, and his supervisor too. I am not implying in any way that Chinese students are cheats.   \n\n\nSecondly, I am using VPN, and I will be vague about the nature of the work.   \n\n\nDuring that time I had noticed some unusual things about his results:  \n\n\n1. In his Masters thesis he claimed that he had deproteinised the samples prior to measurement, but I remember him asking me what the deproteinising process was AFTER he collected the results. This step is critical to accurate measurement of the sample, and the results would be very different without deproteinisation. \n2. His graph shows no change in metabolites (flat line) after 21 DAYS at 37'C, when cells were cultured in 2D. But in 3D the culture media metabolite concentration rapidly decreases. We conducted the exact same experiment again (everything cells media conditions identical), but the 2nd time round I measured the samples myself.   \n\\- I first measured the samples using the assay I used in my 2nd year  \n\\- I then measured the samples using the exact same technique he used   \n\\- I then took the samples to a different lab and then asked them to measure using their bioanalyser. ALL THREE OF THE ABOVE are in agreement and SHOW NO CLEAR DIFFERENCE OR TREND IN EITHER GROUP.   \nI asked him why this is and he stated that this time he frozen the samples too long. I know this is untrue because I measured samples 1 month after experiment (they are usually stable for 2 years when frozen in LN2). Even if they were frozen too long the pattern should be similar vs fresh samples. \n3. I then asked for the raw data. He stated that his USB was stolen while on holiday to China to visit his family. I have doubts about this, because data collected are saved on a network drive and wondered why he could not retrieve the results on his network drive and only had it on USB. During the course of my PhD we were reminded several times to back up our data.   \n\n4. despite lack of raw data he was still allowed to graduate. He is now working in R&D at a pharmaceutical company in China (diabetes medicine). His supervisor is almost retired and never checked anything that he did.   \n\n5. The problem is he is publishing a paper. It will have him (1st author), me (2nd author), his supervisor (3rd author), Principal scientist of collaborating company (4th) and Vice President of company (5th) - company is a Vietnamese start up. Best case scenario the paper is flat out rejected. Worst case scenario data manipulation has actually occurred - if so I assume only he will get in trouble?",

If this work is published and you did nothing, it will still reflect negatively on you as the supervisor. The coauthors are relying on you as his supervisor. If he publishes this without your name and you tried to address this, and documented your efforts, at least you can explain the situation.

      "text": "> I asked for raw data but he stated his USB was stolen. Was I wrong not to pursue it any further?\n\nYes.\n\nIn addition to the comments made by others, it is important to recognize that in many if not most cases it is a condition of grant funding awards, subject to audit, that all raw data be stored securely and accessibly with secure back-ups. These requirements exist for exactly this reason - because without the raw data it is impossible to verify that a result is valid. Even if the data was in fact perfectly valid, by not managing this data correctly this validity is thrown into question.\n\nThis raises serious concerns, and if I were in your supervisor's position I would not publish this data as if it is brought into question he risks an audit that would show mismanagement of raw data - funding agencies will *not* be happy about this, and while the bulk of the blame would fall on your supervisor for not managing the data properly it is not something you would want to be associated with in your future career. If you cannot persuade your supervisor the best thing you can do is take your name off of the paper, and consider if reporting to the university research offices will be a good course of action (maybe yes, maybe more danger to you than it is worth).",

Data should be retained for a reasonable period of time to allow other researchers to check results or to use the data for other purposes. There is, however, no common definition of a reasonable period of time. NIH generally requires that data be retained for 3 years following the submission of the final financial report. Some government programs require retention for up to 7 years. A few universities have adopted data-retention policies that set specific time periods in the same range, that is, between 3 and 7 years. Aside from these specific guidelines, however, there is no comprehensive rule for data retention or, when called for, data destruction.\n\nHowever, most journals would expect you to retain the data for a period of 7 years.\n\nFirst and most important is to inform the supervisor.  They may also want to run a  mile from a situation in which the underlying data is missing (I know I would freak), and they are in a much better position to kill the paper/redo the work.\n\nIt is highly irresponsible to proceed with an attempt at publication in this case.",
