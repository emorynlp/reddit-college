  "title:": "Meeting person whose work I recently peer-reviewed critically",
  "text": "Hi All, I recently reviewed a paper for someone I know. It was double blind, though I could tell who it was from the references. I had let the editor know and discussed any conflicts of interest. They decided it would be OK for me to review. I submitted a lengthy multi-page review which was very critical. The intention was to be constructive and I added many suggestions for improvements, and explain the criticisms in some detail. The editor was happy with the review.\n\nI'll be at a conference in a few weeks where this person will also be present. I can already foresee the situation that we'll meet at lunch or so, and this person will complain about the lengthy review she had gotten on their newest paper.\n\nIf this situation arises, would you identify yourself as the reviewer, or just ignore it (and play dumb)? What is your duty as an anonymous reviewer?",
