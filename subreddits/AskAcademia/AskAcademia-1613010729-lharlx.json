  "text": "I had my first paper published a couple of months ago. It's insignificant really. It was some of the work I did during my undergrad, but it took so long to publish. I'm the 4th author on a conference paper. Although it's not much, I'm excited none the less. But I wonder if an account containing just one insignificant paper would actually make me look bad.\n\nSo should I sign up or should I wait until I have published something I am proud of?\n\nEdit: I didn't expect so many positive responses. Thank you guys! I just set it up. :)",
