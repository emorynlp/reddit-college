                  "text": "Hey,  I am a bit late and not the one you asked, but I think I can answer that question. \n\n I bought the Surface Go base model with 4 Gb of Ram and 64Gb of storage for note taking and reading because I figured it would be enough.\n \n**Tldr** at the bottom.\n\nMy experience with it was great at the beginning but the more I used it, the slower it became and after 6 month of writing everything on a tablet, I reverted back to analog whenever possible, because it would take really long to boot and became unbearably slow as the storage filled up. It as just much faster to use a pen and a notebook for notes. I really only use it for reading or when note taking on script, but even then, the experience is not that great because the input lag makes the writing feel sluggish at best.  \n\nThe lack of storage is really the main problem in my opinion because it will make the computer extremely slow as the memory gets saturated. I have maybe 1 or 2 Gb left of free disk space, even though I only really use it for light note taking. I even bought an 128Gb SD card to compensate for the lack of storage space, but something makes the card inaccessible for the file explorer after some amount of time, so no improvement here. \n\nIf I had to make the decision of buying the base model Surface Go for light note taking I probably wouldn't. It is not suited for my use case, but that said, maybe I had not the right expectations. If, unlike me, you would use it strictly for note taking, and will therefore probably have to have an other laptop with you all the time, then it can be a useful tool. In an other use case it becomes burdensome at best, in my experience anyway. \n\nIn hindsight I would probably even go as far as to  say I would have been better off with buying a Surface Pro or something like a Dell XPS 13\" with touchscreen. Mainly because I came to the conclusion that I want a laptop with which I can do both note taking and light work on the go (engineering field).\n\nIf you really are just taking notes, than it might be worth it to buy the base model. If you want to use it for doing some research online and/or making some power point presentations on top of that,  the device reaches it's limits pretty fast in my experience. These problems might not be solved with a higher tier model because of the tiny screen, it is not suited for any other application. \n\n\n **Tldr**: The main take away is that you really need to have a pretty well defined use case for it, as in only light note taking, and that is not going to change for the foreseeable future. If you need any amount of flexibility, this is probably not the right device for you. It has otherwise also some pretty great features, that are not detailed here, because if it does not suit your use case, they are pretty much worthless. \n\n*This is only a single subjective opinion from a single experience for one use case, so take it with as much precaution as you feel is needed. \n*",

The iPad is definitely better at lasting a longer time, and it's lighter weight both in terms of OS and actual physical weight.\n\nThat said, my iPad dies more frequently because it doesn't manage battery life well while in sleep mode, whereas the Surface Go is better than that.

If you're not used to using the keyboard like that, it's a time investment. Also, you have to edit config files by hand to get the behavior you want. In short, if you're used to working mostly with graphical user interfaces (and that's 90% of people out there) then software like zathura is a huge shock and looks almost archaic and painful to use. But I find using vim keys to navigate a document, save location, etc. actually helps a lot with reading; it's the closest I get to the almost natural way I navigate a document I'm holding.

      "text": "I too struggle with on-screen texts this way. I use a laptop, often attached to a larger screen. Sometimes the large screen, although useful for many things, is just too big and overwhelming to focus on for reading deeply. I'll also note that [Foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/) is a pleasant reader application (on Linux). It has several colour settings to try that suit different preferences for eye-ease as well as font and spacing adjustments.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not sure that those things are sufficient to facilitate a deep read. I have wondered if the issue has more to do with something like expectations of the computer vs. book and how I attend to those. I'm so used to alternating activities or using multiple applications together for various purposes on the computer, that it's an effort to treat it as a tool purely for focused reading. I'm aware that I have an impulse to want to use it differently and so just the ongoing act of dealing with/suppressing that impulse interferes with my attention/comprehension required for the deep read.\n\nAt least sometimes, this isn't always the case. For example, if I try to read something early in the morning (maybe with my coffee :-) ), and before any sort of decision-fatigue type stuff sets in, I'm more likely to focus on the screen in a deeper, more critical way.\n\nAll that's to say that there are technical considerations but also maybe things about one's disposition that play into this.",

I have to give myself a lot of extra time and take a lot of extra notes. Often times I watch a lot of YouTube videos on the subject matter. I find that I can\u2019t make sense of it otherwise. Due to my financial situation and lack of great insurance, I have not been able to get accommodations at school. So unfortunately that means a lot of exams on the computer, which means I don\u2019t do fantastically. Thankfully, I\u2019ve pulled through and I only have two harder classes left involving math in my undergrad.",

All that time spent on forums having giant heated arguments about stuff I knew little to nothing about, must have helped my brains adapt to screen reading.\n\nStill, I wouldn't mind having a good A4-sized e-reader. I know they exist, but I haven't been able to get my hands on on yet.",

The graphics and renderings are very different. I hate paying so much for Macs but it is the only way I feel comfortable reading text and don't lose my attentional control.",

I actually don't use it much these days either because it puts me to sleep, though some people swear by it.\n\nWhat kind of computer do you have?\n\nAnother suggestion that's hit-or-miss depending on the person is audiobooks. A friend of mine developed software called Speechify that uses AI to quite reliably read any text (even if it's in PDF) out loud to you. Sometimes that can be easier than reading with your eyes.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso if you are using a laptop (or even if you aren't), more space can help -- you can get a big external monitor for pretty cheap and plug it into your first screen so you can spread out the pages, zoom in a lot and just have a lot more real estate for your eyes. Some people also like to use a second monitor vertically so it looks like a giant book page.",
