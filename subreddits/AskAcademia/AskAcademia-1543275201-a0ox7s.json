  "title:": "Life as a 'trailing spouse'",
  "text": "I am a non-academic in a long-term relationship with an academic. We met in a big city and lived there for the beginning years of our relationship. Last year, he got a tenure track position at a university in a smaller city several states away, and we moved there. The move has proved challenging to our relationship. No jobs in my field exist in the area, but fortunately I was able to find a remote job. However, I did not have a social network, could not drive, and felt a lot of resentment about the move. Over the course of the year, I slowly made friends and finally got my license, but the damage had been done and our relationship is now in crisis -- we are currently re-evaluating whether we should be together at all.\n\nAs part of this process, I'm trying to figure out if being a 'trailing spouse' is something I can happily do. Because of our different career situations, his career will always dictate where we live, and my professional and social needs will come second. I love this man and really want things to work, but neither of us are sure that these terms are tenable for me, and therefore for the relationship.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? How did you or your partner adjust to being the trailing spouse? How can a professor's non-academic partner make a strong social or professional network in a new place, possibly several times over? What advice do you have for me or for us?\n\nx-posted to /r/academia",

You're too close to the data to do this yourself. Also, counselors provide a voice that isn't easy to ignore.

But the counselor isn't in the game of *expressing*; the counselors there to find the problem, diagnose it, and start to find solutions for it.",

      "text": "This is going to sound harsh, but hear me out: Evaluate him as a partner as he is *right now*. Can you live with this man as he currently is?\n\nIf he can't make changes for you now, he's not going to make them. Academia is a game of delayed gratification. We're indoctrinated into feeling like \"the next step\" will be better than the last, so we don't have to take care of things *in this step*. \"I'll be less miserable when I graduate.\" \"Things will be better after I get tenure.\" \"After this grant application cycle, it should be smooth sailing ...\" \"This promotion would really help our stability ...\" But that game is unwinnable. *This moment* is exactly what life is.\n\nIf he's willing to meet your needs now, and if he can change things to where you enjoy your life as you're living now, then I'd say give him the benefit of the doubt. But be very cautious if he's saying he can't do things because he has to get tenure (or the promotion to full professor, or the next grant, or next-something-else). Tell him you need him now. And tell him that it matters to you how your relationship is now. This is crucial. And it needs to be direct so that you can see how he responds. Don't be afraid of him giving you an answer you don't want. He's going to answer implicitly through his actions, and if it's negative, you're just going to dwindle away in bitterness. Have courage. Be direct. Confront this now. You stand to gain way more than you will lose if you don't.\n\nIf you look around academia, very few professors have good marriages. ~~Most~~ Many have been divorced (some multiple times). The odds are stacked against you. (This is also the case in many other competitive fields like law and medicine.) So realize it's going to be a fight. And you need to learn to fight this now because it won't go away.\n\nNow, I'm *not saying* to be short-sighted and never cut him slack. If he's really trying and giving you what he can, and if it seems like he has a *tangible, date-specific* plan for when he can help you, then realize academia is tough and he's trying. But, given that you mentioned he's not into counseling, that doesn't bode well. If you need more, demand more. In your own counseling sessions, start reflecting on what you need from a partnership. And then start the process of thinking whether he and his situation can meet those needs.\n\nOn a personal note, my wife left me in grad school. And I even *made* time for her, and I initiated counseling. But it wasn't enough to save our marriage through the stress of academia (and who it makes me) and her feeling like she was letting her life slip by. This is real shit, and academia can eat even strong couples alive. After she left me, I went to counseling and tried to take care of my (until then undiagnosed) depression and anxiety. I've realized how, even though I was a good partner, I had stuff I had to work through. I'm in a new relationship now, and it's made me a more caring and open partner. But my girlfriend now knows exactly what she's getting into, and we talk often about what we want and whether the relationship is working for us. I've also cut back my research a lot, and I'm striving for simplicity.\n\nThe point: start to work on this *now* because, frankly, the journey is just as important as the destination. And if this relationship is meaningful to you, fight like hell to save it. But don't fight harder than he will. You gotta take care of yourself too. The world needs who you are too. And you don't have to be a martyr. (I know too many women and people of color who feel like they must be.)\n\nMuch love and empathy for what you're going through. My inbox is open if you have more personal concerns you don't want to say openly.\n\n--------------\n\n**Edit**: Thanks for the gold! I hope this helps OP. And I hope this gives any of you going through something similar by giving you the courage, self-compassion, and endurance to get through what you're facing. <3\n\n**Edit again**: /u/lalochezia1 Provided actual data on divorce [here](https://qz.com/1069806/the-highest-and-lowest-divorce-rates-in-america-by-occupation-and-industry/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1-JVVCiuXBZEpU6_5HsZLYyblVClpEW0ucYBafkNbaYI/pubhtml), with the upshot that academics are in the middle of divorce rates. They're not actuaries (with the lowest divorce rate), but they're not bartenders either (with a high divorce rate). I corrected my above statement to say \"Many professors have multiple divorces\" (instead of my original statement that said \"most professors\").\n\nAlso, my remarks are based on anecdotal evidence. My undergrad, which is a teaching university, had one faculty member (of about five) who'd been through divorce, one who never married, and three in marriages/partnerships of varying degrees of normalcy. But when I went to R1 schools, I met many people who had multiple divorces and rocky marriages. Also, the topic of relationships in academia is written about a lot. See: [\"Why Does Graduate School Kill So Many Marriages?\"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Does-Graduate-School-Kill/244796) and [\"The Dual-Career Divorce\"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Dual-Career-Divorce/44911) and [\"The Postdoc's Dilemma: When to Give Up on Romance and File for Divorce\"](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/postdocs-dilemma-when-give-romance-and-file-divorce). Lots of anecdotal evidence doesn't equal data, but maybe it does point out patterns, if not in action then in how academics lament their relationships. Apologies if I skewed the truth with hyperbole.",

But then it's about tenure, or getting that book published, or that big grant - and you never get there because the carrot is always out of reach.  And in the meantime, you let friendships falter, don't look after your relationship, don't look after yourself... \n\nAnd I say all of this in the glow of just having landed a big grant that I've been worrying about for months.  And I know, that the glow from that grant success will last a day or so, and then it's on to the next horizon (promotion application).  No time for the journey, it's *always* about the destination.

In retrospect, he put up with a lot of BS he didn't have to when I was getting my degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice to all young academics, as someone who's now on the outside and ultimately decided against a PhD, is to get some perspective and realize that academia is not *nearly* as serious or important as you think it is right now. It has the potential to be a beautiful, wonderful thing, but you only have to look around this sub and see a bunch of professors who are *literally working their dream jobs* and still hate their lives to realize that there is something seriously fucked up about the academic's relationship with academia. I've worked some SHIT jobs in my life. To be so unhappy and so stressed when you are in an academic position means there's something very wrong with how you perceive yourself and your work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who are attracted to academia often have an over-inflated idea of their own self-importance in the grand scheme of the world while simultaneously having an extreme case of imposter syndrome. I know I do. I do stand up comedy and there's a very similar problem in that scene-- people who \"see\" things others don't have a hard time being happy because they're always over-analyzing things. The happiest professors and the happiest comics I know are the kind of people that realize family and relationships are ultimately more important than their work. They're still very successful people. It took cancer to snap me out of my own romanticization of \"the grind.\" It's not a good thing to be too stressed out to function.\n\n&#x200B;",

That is part of why we are grappling with this issue now -- can I be happy and fully myself in *this* small city where my life is so different than what it was? Or can he be happy with who I am and who I no longer am in this new context? \n* I'm not sure how much flexibility there is. I can't imagine a dream job that would inspire me to move across the country, but I can imagine having preferences about his future career moves, including a next job offer or taking steps to mitigate our current situation in the long-term such that it meets more of my needs. Our negotiations over the past year have made me doubt his willingness to prioritize my needs when push comes to shove, but I'm not sure if it's because he's not willing to be flexible in principle or if it's more contextual given the relationship damage we've been dealing with. I can explore it I suppose. \n\nThank you again.",

Or are TT jobs really just that scarce even coming from top programs? Basing this question on attitudes I've observed in a few cases, but not sure if this is a wider pattern.

It's an unorthodox situation, but she wasn't willing to compromise her (very successful) career, and he wasn't willing to forego a tenure track position. They've been doing this now for about 20 years, and though it's not my cup of tea, it works for them.\n\nI'm not sure that a long-distance relationship would work for you guys, given that it sounds like your relationship is on the rocks, but it's an example of one kind of relationships I see in academia. Both of the members of my committee (other than my supervisor) are divorced and single, one woman, one man. My husband and I are doing fine while I'm in grad school school, but he is quite happy to be the 'trailing spouse' because he is not really at all career driven. I go where my career takes me (we've moved twice in the last five years), and he follows and finds work wherever we end up. But that works for us because of his personality and desires in life; I don't know if I could do the same were our positions reversed. \n\nAs for making new social circles... I don't think that has anything to do with being involved with an academic, it's just one of those complicated life things. People move for their spouse's job opportunities all of the time, and it's frequently challenging. It will get better in time - I always find it takes about 2-3 years to really settle into a new city. If it hasn't been that long for you, chances are it will get better. You just have to figure out whether you're willing to stick it out or not, and if you're happy being tied to this place long-term. As others have mentioned, it's unlikely you'll be moving frequently if at all. \n\nAs a final note - if you ultimately decide that you're not happy being tied to his career, that's not a failing on your part. From the snapshot we see from this post and your comments, it sounds like he's not the most accommodating to your needs or desires to work on your relationship. You don't owe him effort if he's not willing to give you effort in return. Academia never really gets less stressful or time consuming unless you actively choose to make it so (and even then, it's a long-term struggle)... so his work is always going to demand significant tracts of his time and focus. If he isn't prioritising your relationship now, that may never change.",

      "text": "No advice, but I have seen a lot of divorces/breakups under similar conditions. Once a person gets tenure, unless they are a star or pulling down massive grants, there is approximately zero opportunity for any sort of lateral transfer in most fields.  When people get tenure it often signals to the \"trailing spouse\" (I dislike that term, but we'll go with it) that the game is over...there is no hope of \\*ever\\* moving to someplace better/different/warmer/colder/more urban/less urban or whatever they don't like about location A.  I was delighted to earn tenure, and eventually promotion to full professor, but both came as nails in a coffin to my partner who was never keen on the location we ended up in from the outset. We've done fine, ultimately, but have been spending a lot of time recently looking at retirement locations and planning to build a home 1500 miles away as soon as we can afford it...and we're 15+ years from retirement.\n\nIn some locations-- like ours --it is very hard to build a professional or even personal network if you aren't connected via the workplace. Our college is not in a metro area and the local economy runs on services and retail; there just aren't a lot of jobs for well-educated or professional people outside of healthcare and our university. Luckily my partner was hired by our school a few years after me, so we're both in it long-term now-- though working together has it disadvantages as well. The only advice I can give for networking is to do what you can to build one with academic/professional colleagues from campus...most all of them are likely from someplace else as well, so at least the younger/newer hires will be looking to make friends. Beyond that, join local organizations and club...lots of spouses in our circlres are active politically, or with a hobby group, or in some sort of cultural organization. \n\nBut any way you look at it, academia is tough on couples. Especially so if one is hired outside a city where jobs and opportunities for non-academics are more widely available.",

Once you are tenured at such a place it is near-impossible to make a lateral transfer because those types of schools amost never hire at rank anymore. Leaving not only means giving up tenure and seniority, but usually a good chunk of salary as well.  While it does happen, it's rarely easy to do and then only for academic superstars.

Sometimes that's obviously not the case, as when it's clear that it is in fact a step up. But the candidate would have to make that clear in the cover letter I think. There's also another reality to the market: Ph.D.s have a sell-by date attached, though it's unspoken. I've served with quite a few committee members who basically argue that there's no reason to take someone who has been out more than ~3 years because their knowledge is already no longer current; if they've been in a TT or even a full-time term position for several years the complaint is that they may not be as easy to \"train in\" to local culture, why not start with someone fresh?\n\nShowing that someone else \"took a chance\" might have mattered at some distant point in the past when there weren't 250+ people applying for every TT position. I've personally never served on a search committee where I wasn't highly confident that any of the top 25 candidates could do the job well though, and the top ten are often outstanding. We only bring three to campus. When we can recruit from top 20 schools with confidence, why \"settle\" for someone who was already hired at a lower-tier school?\n\nAs with many things in academe, moving downward isn't as hard; you can go from an R1 to an R2, or a selective SLAC to a public comprehensive, or even from a lower-tier 4-year school to a community college (though they have specific needs too). But moving laterally or up is much, much harder to do in my experience.  Again, of course, barring those who are raking in grants, are in high-demand fields (nursing Ph.D.s!), or who have published promising works that make them stand out. But realistically that's a tiny fraction of all academics...I've been at this 25+ years now and know very few people in the humanities or social sciences who have managed to change jobs post-tenure while moving in any direction but down.",

Lower-tier programs in most fields simply should not exist; they serve no great purpose other than to allow their faculty to supervise graduate students and teach small seminars. And perhaps as a source of teaching assistants.  But a Ph.D. from the #115 program in the country will never get you a tenure-track job in most fields. Indeed, there are single programs in some fields (political science, most notably) that are responsible for a quarter or more of all new tenure-track hires in any given year. \n\nAs a frequent search committee chair I see it as a simple reality: why would we even consider someone from the 3rd or 4th (or 5th!) tier of American universities when even a liberal arts college like mine routinely receives applications from top-ten graduates? Students from top programs have access to more resources, better networks, and a broader range of classes than those at lower-tier schools...they may not be \"better\" scholars or teachers by nature, but they are so well resourced that they certainly tend to be so upon completion (setting selectivity aside...once that's figured in the choice is even more stark).\n\nMy college has no graduate programs at all. But if you want down the hallway in any department on campus you'll generally see Ph.D.s from elite private schools and flagship state universities, with a scattering of international schools thrown in. Pretty much all of them are top 10 or top 20 programs, depending on the field. That's the reality of the market. In my own smallish department fully half the faculty from the #1 programs in their respective subfields, and the rest all come from arguably top five departments or had superstar advisors. Pedigree isn't everything-- it's hardly even the first thing we look at when hiring --but the fact is that top programs tend to produce the most competitive graduates: they have the most publications, the best research programs, the most unique experiences, the strongest networks, and while they can't be guaranteed to be the best teachers (which is critical to us) they do tend to be very strong in that area as well.",

Political science has actually been studied; in 2012 they [found that 11 programs produced fully half of *all* tenured and tenure-track faculty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/PhDs-From-Top/136113) in the field in the US.  As you can [see from this table](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/02/04/study-identifies-challenges-political-science-faculty-job-market), only about 1/3 of new political science Ph.D.s are landing tenure-track jobs annually...and at least half of those go to the top ten schools, so the other half are spread (unequally) among the other 100+ programs. Not all fields are that bad, but it's pretty typical.\n\n> Do you think it'll always be that way? It seems like the only way that would change is if the number of people in doctorate programs drops significantly.\n\nIt's actually going to get worse, because the number of tenure-track faculty is going to go down. Nearly 3/4 of all US college courses are now delivered by non-TT faculty. Contingent labor is cheaper and easier to control. Some schools are already majority non-TT. So even if Ph.D. output goes down (it should) the odds are the market will never recover until/unless the entire neoliberal university model is upended.\n\n>  I know if I ever wanted to continue on for a PhD I'd better get into a good program or not go at all...\n\nThat's what we tell our students. A Ph.D. from a low-tier program isn't going to get you a job in academia, or at least not a TT position at a decent school. If you aren't paying out of pocket and are doing it for other reasons, perhaps it makes sense in some cases. And there *are* fields in which there are shortages of Ph.D.s willing to teach (nursing) so there are exceptions. But generally speaking, I tell my students to shoot for top-ten programs and to *still* have a serious backup plan if the faculty career doesn't pan out-- and never to pursue a Ph.D. at all if it isn't fully funded. You don't want to go into debt for something that is unlikely to turn out as you hoped going in.\n\n",

Maybe those decisions could have happened before, when the relationship was healthier and at least as central and meaningful as the career, but now that's reversed and things are hanging on by a thread.\n\nWas this a conversation you've ever had? As in, when he was on the job market, did you mutually agree on places he applied to based on your willingness to move there as well as his, or was that his unilateral decision? When he got his offer(s), did he consult you on which one of them would better fit your needs, or did he appraise you of the fact and let you decide if you were staying put or coming with? Did you have veto power on where his career was taking you both?\n\n> Because of our different career situations, his career will always dictate where we live, and my professional and social needs will come second.\n\nWell, no, that's not because of your \"different career situations\" - it's because of his priorities and the fact that you're willing to blindly go along with them. There is no shadowy force compelling him to stay in academia and move to locations that make his wife extremely unhappy. This is something he's choosing to do because he prioritizes his career over his relationship. Ultimately this is a very common situation that happens to people in any career, and the very simple choice you have to make is whether you're okay being second fiddle to his ambition. It's fine if you are. Many people are. But I think that a lot of people, especially in academia, overdramatize the lifestyle and lose sight of the sum total of it, which is that you have to make certain sacrifices to achieve certain goals (for you, that's sacrificing your career or social life or whatever to stay with this dude), and that the parameters of the problem are quite simple: are the sacrifices worth the goals?",

Also, we didn't realize how profoundly fulfilling he would find the new job and just how difficult the adjustment would be for me -- so a drastic change in each of our emotional circumstances, in opposite directions. But yes, we made the decision mutually.\n\nIt's true that our \"different career situations\" have to do with his priorities and my willingness to go along with them. Also how we've been socialized -- I have at several points been counseled to make career decisions to avoid being in professional situations that would preclude a relationship or make one unlikely, and I doubt he has to the same degree. \\[Deleted this part of comment for additional privacy\\].",

No one who works in an office was born working in an office. Most office workers would rather be great artists, celebrity chefs, millionaire heiresses or whatever - but they work in an office because responsible adults earn their keep.

This is not a bad thing in the long run -- I'd do well to expand my horizons to make friends with all different kinds of people. But it does make things tricky on the friend front in the shorter term. There are also the people in the university, of course, but there is a layer of disconnect with some of them because I'm not really in the club. \n\nI dunno if that makes sense.

      "text": "My wife and I have been dealing with this for years now. I'm in experimental physics which takes me to remote places, has been since my Masters. That was two years in different countries across Europe, which made it nearly impossible for her to establish any long term friend groups. Now I'm doing a PhD in Saskatoon, Canada, which is just as remote as it sounds, but luckily now we're locked into a place for four years. She got into working remotely as well, but it wasn't easy by any means. Now she's doing an online masters program, along with an online job. I'll try to break down what worked, what didn't, where problems arose, and any advice I can offer.\n\nFor a while the adventure of traveling was enough to keep her entertained, and in the alone times, she learned to appreciate it and take advantage of the time to self-reflect and self-improve- learning languages and such. She demanded, fairly, that I set aside a certain amount of time each week and each day (when possible) that we would spend together- this would be anything from taking a walk to going grocery shopping to a date night.\n\nHowever, eventually it got to be too much. She was wildly unhappy, and coupled with some difficulties getting her a visa for Germany, decided to spend the last few months of my program back in the states where she could get a job and reconnect with friends and family. It was great for her, but god awful for me, but that's how it goes, marriage means compromise.\n\nMoving back afterwards was interesting because it turned out she'd gotten used to the alone time- in moderation of course- and found it difficult to get into the demands of friends and family all the time (we moved back to the city where both our families and long time friends still live). that was another adjustment, so you might be surprised how used to the solitude you might get.\n\nwe moved again after the 2016 election to Thailand because neither of us could take it and settled into Bangkok until we figured out what to do next. Since it was obvious she needed to get used to this lifestyle, she started to lean into it and establish a life online. she learned to make connections and meet people in Bangkok and now in Saskatoon through different means (facebook and expat sites), and at one point even started a writing club in France where she met some local expats to connect with.\n\nBut, it's still very difficult for her- she's a very people-oriented person and the lack of a solid social network has definitely been challenging. I also don't like going to therapists for my own reasons (i saw that suggested a number of times), but one thing I did- we both did- was take a non-violent communication and conflict resolution course which has paid off in spades for our marriage. I would HIGHLY suggest it, being able to express yourself in a non-confrontational way is massively important, and helps all parties feel heard and appreciated.\n\nAside from that, if he's not willing to go to counseling, he's got to compromise on SOMETHING. its not going to work otherwise. I've got a deal with my wife that she can take as many trips home or wherever that our budget allows. She has a lot of sway in the creature comforts we buy, and she finally wore me down and we got a cat, which has helped her immensely. so a pet might be nice.\n\nand don't forget, YOU moved for HIM. without you, he'd just be another sad, lonely academic, eating hot dogs thawing in a sink (this is surprisingly often not an exaggeration). So make some demands, you've earned it. sorry for the long post, I hope this helps!\n\nTL;DR try to enjoy as much of the vagabond lifestyle as you can, and assert your boundaries/demands that will help you through it. Ultimately tho, if you can't keep up with jet setting (perfectly understandable) or if he is unwilling to compromise, you'll have to move on.",

My spouse is also a scientist and got her degree in the exact same field as I did, which has obviously limited her employment opportunities. One of us had to make sacrifices because - let's be honest - a tenured university job is \"a life sentence\". Do not get me wrong - I love my job and would never trade it for any other but, like so many people have already pointed out, one needs to be a top gun in a \"sexy\" field (like Nanotechnology or Climate Change) to be recruitable by other, better schools at the Full Prof level. My spouse has consciously made that sacrifice: her science career is basically limited to teaching occasional online courses, which the University doles out to sessional instructors who are not as expensive as us, tenured faculty. Because I am not a dick (at least I hope I am not), I appreciate what she has done and make it up to her in every way I can. She enjoys traveling and art, and she can do both as much as she wants (well, almost). I am not going to throw a tantrum at the $1,500 price tag on a new painting, or if she wants to fly to Toronto to see a Bolshoi performance. Every summer we go to Australia to visit her family, and have been to a bunch of other exotic places, like Vanuatu, Indonesia, etc. To be able to afford these things, we bought a really small house (no garage or home office, like most of my colleagues have), do not eat out much, and my Kawasaki Ninja had to go, but in the long run, it was all worth it - we have been together for over 30 years, plus she has the freedom and independence that she would not have had if she were employed full-time. Hope you iron your relationship wrinkles out!\n\nOh, one more thing - do not waste your money on counselling. Two smart people do not need a third one to figure out what's good and healthy for the two of them.",
