  "title:": "How as a postdoc do I realistically assess my career prospects in academia?",
  "text": "Being able to assess one's own career prospect seems important in academia and elsewhere. Otherwise one could spend a decade stuck in short-therm positions without realising that it leads nowhere, or on the opposite side, misjudge one's abilities and give up too quickly.\n\nHowever this is difficult to do because of things such as the impostor syndrome or the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect. So I would like to have some advice on how to realistically evaluate my career prospect to eventually get a permanent job in academia (say as a postdoc). I am in STEM but I believe such advice to be somewhat general.",

I was a late bloomer in my PhD and was probably one of the last ones to publish in my cohort (I had one publication just I was finishing my PhD). \n\nTwo years later, and I am one of only two people in my cohort of 10 to have landed a tenure-track position despite being very mediocre on paper (2 pubs with a third in press). I suck on paper but have strong networking/people skills, so there are a host of other factors at play like luck and personality. I know a few really accomplished researchers who will probably never land a tenure track position simply due to their personalities being odd or difficult, which is what matters most once you make it to the interview phase.\n\nI probably would have given up had I just compared my CV line-by-line with my peers, yet I received 3 tenure-track offers this year. Personality matters a lot.",

The idea isn't \"if you don't have exactly what your peers have you shouldn't bother,\" it's more that you know where you stand in certain areas so you can be aware of your strengths and weaknesses in your application.

If it always lands on a six you may be lucky enough to advance.  \n\nOn a serious note I'm only half joking, sadly luck and being in the right place at the right time is a huge part on whether or not you'll be able to advance your career. Everything else is helpful. Having the right connections will help, grants and publications will of course help, too.  \nComparing yourself to *recently hired* people can help (requirements constantly change, so established people are usually a bad measurement) but since you don't really know how many connections in the institute that person has and who they competed with, it's also not perfect. Not to forget that more positions then one would assume open specifically to hire a specific person and don't actually have a fair and open ended hiring process.\n\nPostdoc positions usually aren't the hard part anyways, the real challenge starts when you want to advance higher, which is sadly where the aforementioned luck and networking is becoming more important than any actually quantitative measurements. I know lots of genius and hard working people that are completely stuck at postdoc level and no one can really say why. They basically do nothing wrong and still get no where.",

It shows you cannot grow and you're basically relegating yourself to a very defined role. And when that employers needs to let you go, or if you need to move, then what? You're screwed. \n\nWhen you want to succeed in STEM, you need to grow - otherwise you're an overpaid technician, and no one will hire you. \n\nMy best bet would be to find a good way in getting grants, go tenure track, become an assistant prof..",

Not quite an R01 or something like that, but certainly some smaller grants - I was writing an R03 at the time I exited my postdoc and academia (I discovered that I despised writing grants, which didn't bode well for someone in my field. I'm in the U.S. and I mostly wrote grants to the NIH.)\n\nThen again, in my field, it's not expected that you postdoc for more than five years - most people postdoc between 2 and 5 years, although the average time was getting a little longer as I exited. So if you wait until your third to fifth year you might not get to write a grant (or, more accurately, you'll be behind the postdocs at other top labs who are writing them in their earlier years).",
