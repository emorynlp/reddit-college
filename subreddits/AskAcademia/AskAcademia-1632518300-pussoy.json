  "title:": "How to write a paper with more than 100 references?",
  "text": "I am currently about to finish my masters and will be starting my PhD soon after. I spent about a month researching my thesis before I began my own work. However, by the time I started writing the thesis, I couldn't remember the contents of the papers I had read. True, I read a lot of papers and I shouldn't expect myself to remember every paper, but I've seen some papers with almost 200 references, with a reference in every other sentence. I don't understand how such a thing could be done. How does one write every paragraph with 5 references from 5 different papers for instance? Basically, what I'm asking is how does one go about writing a paper with more than 100 references? Do you read all 100 papers before you begin writing? I'm looking for ideas to improve my writing efficiency.",

Some papers I read in detail, taking an hour to read them make some notes. Others I spend 2 minutes on to get the key message for an introduction.",

Never have I ever been able to cite everything the way you are thinking people do. Usually the entire paper is written and \"(Citation)\" is left in place to remind myself to back up my bold claims later. \n\nThe entire paper is usually written based on my knowledge of the topic from reading literature. This usually happens once while writing the grant/preparing the project (can take many months), and then when I am trying to interpret the wacky results that go against my hypotheses (usually when constructing the discussion section).\n\nWhen reading the literature I always make sure to download the citation and store it in a reference manager (Endnote, Zotero, Papers etc) so that way I can search key words and find the relevant paper later... Sometimes years later. If I don't have the citation, then I have to spend a lot of time on Google to track it down. No joke, this can take longer than writing the entire paper, it's a good \"at home\" activity in front of the tv. \n\nIt can take even longer if the statement you are trying to make isn't true... I have searched many times to find support for untrue statements that I made when writing years earlier, which there sometimes can be scant findings, but when that happens it's important not to cherry pick the data and either rework the argument or discuss controversy accordingly.\n\nFor review papers, if you think you have a clever direct to go that you are unfamiliar with, chances are you will be searching for relevant literature while writing to make sure your ideas hold validity. Otherwise the majority of papers, reviews or primary literature, can be written from memory/understanding of content and not necessarily from remembering the exact reference. That's impossible. At least for me. \n\nMaking friends with a reference manager and knowing your science are the most important parts. Finding references to back up your knowledge is just a tedious necessity.",

You need to comb through research in computer science for new ways that could probably help in the hardware world. You also need to comb through both the analog and digital world to see how such and such is done in the electronics domain.

That is the way to fail. You need to be writing and reading all at the same time. Your research raises a particular question, so you seek to answer it. You seek out papers that might explain this. You find five that seem to satisfy the question. That is one paragraph. On to the next. Etc.\n\nIf you only read until you think you know everything and are ready to write, you will never write.",

      "text": "You learn the literature in which you're working. Our undergraduates are writing theses with more than 100 citations routinely, sometimes twice that. While they aren't all to discrete sources (they might be different chapters in a book, or different parts of the same article, etc.) they learn to manage a large number of sources in the process.\n\nIt sounds like you need an efficient and effective way to take and manage notes. Do you have a strategy? We teach our students (undergrads) to manage their notes within Endnote or another citation manager that allows them to append notes, include keywords, and link to the PDF. Then they sort citations into folders by keyword, project, subsection, etc. When they know they need a source on topic X they simply drop the keyword into their manager, get a few dozen results, then either skim their notes or further refine by concept. By the time they are seniors most students have several hundreds references in their accounts (many well over 1K) because we start them learning the process as freshmen. Ideally their thesis topics will build on coursework and other projects they've done in the past, so they can continue to build on that for their research.\n\nDoing a master's thesis is a similar process. A Ph.D. dissertation-- depending on the field --is degree of magnitude more complex. But if you use a good note-taking strategy and maximize the utility of the software you can make it work *far* more easily than the handwritten-notecards-in-a-file-box system we all used when I was in grad school.",

While doing so, you're bound to find papers which all use  common keyword(s). I add these papers (I tend to try and find 5-10 per 'argument') to a reference management software (I use Mendeley). Now, while I'm doing the literature survey, I also am building my paper/dissertation outline. So, I have points noted down somewhere, that I can revisit. When I write, I simply write what I want to say, and leave markers for citations in the text. Then, I liberally use the search feature on Mendeley to find papers with those specific keywords. Once the search results show me a list of papers with those keywords, I can read through the abstract, briefly, and generally can figure out which papers I would wanna cite. Then I just insert those citations. Over time you'll start to identify keywords, author names etc a little more easily, but I still fall back on the search and insert method often. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "There's no way to remember everything you read, so, at least for me, if I read a paper without taking notes it's essentially a waste of time.\n\nWhenever I read an article, the first thing I do is copy and paste it into a Word doc. As I read, I write short summaries in bold right in the article. If the article is super dense, I might write a one sentence summary of each paragraph; if the article is less dense, I might write a few sentence to summarize an entire section. I leave comments for myself regarding anything I strongly agree/ disagree with, or that connects to the research I'm doing. When I finish reading the article I write a short summary of what I got out of it, and leave it at the top of the Word doc (this is usually pretty different from the abstract, since I'm connecting it specifically to my research).  \n\nI've got an Excel workbook organized with tabs for each topic area. The worksheets include the article citation, the abstract, and my summary. When I can't remember where I read something I browse through the spreadsheet and can usually find it pretty quickly. And when I want to cite an article, I can go back into the article itself, skim my summaries to find the exact spot in the article I'm citing, and verify that it actually says what I'm saying it says. \n\nIt takes about twice as long for me to read articles this way, but I never have to read an article twice any more (I still re-read some of my faves to get new insights as my understanding improves, but never just because I forgot the content). I no longer think of reading an article as just reading an article; it's building my database.",
