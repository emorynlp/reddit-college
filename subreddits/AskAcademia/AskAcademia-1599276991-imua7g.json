  "text": "I'm teaching a new course this semester and I think I accidentally made it too hard (too many assignments and difficult readings). As a result, a lot of students have dropped. On the upside, this means the class is small and the students who are sticking around are pretty awesome. Is this...fine? Good? Bad? Should I make it a little easier next time? It's an upper-level elective so I don't feel too bad about it but still, I've never had so many students look at a syllabus and then bail...\n\nHow do you decide if your class is at the appropriate difficulty level?",

Try to minimize this whenever possible. \n\nIf they are all to learn, consider allowing students to drop a percentage of assignments from counting towards the overall grade. That way they won\u2019t be as overwhelmed by the total assignments since if they fall behind/get busy/screw up an assignment, it won\u2019t jeopardize the grade.\n\nWhen I took classes, I would either pick an easy class that would balance out the rest of my course load or a class that is worth a bit of extra effort to learn something new. I rarely ever took super hard or time consuming electives that could jeopardize my GPA since it just wasn\u2019t worth the risk. I would rather learn the material on my own. This happened with my Machine Learning class. The workload was intense and didn\u2019t have any slack throughout the semester. I ended up dropping it and bought a few books.",

Ultimately it was my fault though, due to covid I decided early on in the summer that I was going to max out the amount of units I was taking because I thought I would have the time. After working for about 10 hours a day for 7 days I realized that I couldn't handle the work and that my grades would suffer because of this.\nThat might be part of the reason you've seen a higher number of drops this semester, but Im also at an earlier stage of my degree so I have time to take that class at a later time.",

Very few of my assignments assess comprehension - they instead ask students to work through a particular passage or apply an idea to a real-world problem or offer their perspective on the reading. There is no right or wrong answer most of the time - just answers that demonstrate deeper levels of critical thinking. I'm not really concerned with abstract notions of rigor and not at all with \"the appearance of academic superiority.\" My teaching is process-oriented rather than results-oriented.

Students who complain about the workload in \u201ctheir other courses\u201d is the issue.

      "text": "Awhile ago someone on this board suggested tiered assessment as response to my question on a method of fitting difficulty levels to individual students (ie, variable difficulty that fits the distribution).  Tiered assessment as I have implemented it is varying levels of difficulty with varying levels of maximum grade, with a small twist or two.\n\nI implemented the idea and it has been fantastic.  The slackers just do the \u201ceasy\u201d tier, collect their b or c, and move on.  The middle have a good percentage that try out the hardest tier, then some of them drop back to middle tier.  And the best students find themselves pushed harder than they have ever been and enjoying their he feeling of achievement while complaining about the difficulty.\n\nTook me a little while to tweak rewards system (I started out just grade) but one of the key things I did last that seems to have really worked is that for the hard mode students, they don\u2019t have to take the final exam AND I make assignments get easier in the last 4 weeks of the semester.\n\nIt is a juicy reward, teaches them to value up front investment and deferred payoff (as does front loading the hard stuff), and has really worked well.  I\u2019m now averaging 1/3 to 40% students choosing hard mode.  \n\nI\u2019m really happy with it and it might help with the calibration process of a new course.",
