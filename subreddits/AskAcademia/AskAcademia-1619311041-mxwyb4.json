You can do all the prep in the world wont mean a damn thing if you have a PI that exploits their grad students, or is verbally abusive, narcissistic, refuses to take responsibility for their own failures no matter how trivial (i.e. they think they can do no wrong... its always you, the grad students fault), or any other combination of behaviors that makes them a shit PI.  You can still make it through such a PhD, but the prep work isn't what gets you through. Willpower, resilience, and spite (and a damn good therapist) get you through that type of program.  \n\nSo, TLDR... I agree. Make sure you have a good PI.\n\nEdit: missed the *after signing the offer* part. In that case, I'd seek some alignment from your PI on expectations and get as good of a feel for their advising style as you can.",

He's also generally at least a little bit socially adept due to his training in better than average schools in his youth. There's a decent chance he did not go to public school. \n\nEach step away from what the system is designed for is an increase in the difficulty of the path. \n\nThe only thing I have going for me from that list is that I'm in the privileged ethnicity/nationality. My school is particularly... Caucasian. \n\nBut otherwise, I'm a mom, I was raised in a lower middle class home and subject to abuse, which didn't stop at the doors to my public schools, which spanned four states in the US. Even the minority students in my cohort went to private school. My mom didn't even graduate high school and had me before 18. \n\nOn top of it, during the seven years I've been working on this while raising kids, one got diagnosed with an emotional disability and between that and my own physical stress responses, we've got almost 10,000 in medical debt.\n\nI'm almost done.... But it's like I'm climbing a volcano without gear (and I had no clue how to avoid volcanoes because I didn't have the same training), while others are assigned a well-traveled  climbing route, they've got gear already, and have been training since grade school. And every time I climb a bit higher, another lava flow comes, I have to work sideways before going up again. Meanwhile, folks who started after me have ascended, all with kids strapped to my back and a migraine.\n\nIn a pandemic.\n\nAnd the graduate school is at the bottom, crossed arms, tapping foot, saying \"hurry up\"",

      "text": "Lots of good advice here. I'll add: \n\n1. Make some value driven rules for yourself. For example, I knew going in how stressed I was by all-nighters fueled by perfectionism. I made a rule for myself that I would never pull an all-nighter, and if I did, I would quit. Needless to say, I completed my PhD from the top program in my field and never broke my rule. So much will beat you down that it will be really powerful to have some rules/boundaries to remind you of your own agency in this. \n\n2. Always keep your \"professionally relevant\" skills relevant and fresh, or work on developing them if you dont have any. This is especially important if you're in a PhD field that isnt as neatly transferable outside the ivory tower. If you struggle to get a TT job, you'll be grateful for this active skillset to help you on the job market!\n\n3. Add something to your resume/CV every month, or 12 lines a year. This could be a conference presentation, publication, grant (start applying for small ones and then apply for bigger ones), award, certification, service, class you teach, research assistantship, etc. \n\nCheck out the book \"Getting What You Came for\" which is for students starting their doctoral programs. Good luck!\n\nETA: dont be overwhelmed by #3. I would have been when I was starting my program, but these things are easy to stack up. You'll likely have half of them just by being in your program doing normal stuff... so push yourself a little to make sure you're developing a stellar CV. \nAlso-- don't overdo service and committees. Focus on what is most valuable in your field + what you enjoy. Where those areas overlap is your sweetspot.",

      "text": "I will share some thoughts that go against the commonly repeated advice on this sub, including this thread. I see these comments repeated often and I always disagree with them (or at least with the way they are presented).\n\n1. \"You don't have to work evenings or weekends\". Sure, you don't have to, as long as your only goal is to finish your PhD and that's it. However, assuming that you want to stay in academia, after your PhD you will be competing for jobs with people who work 80-hour weeks. Can you stay competitive without working overtime? If not, then you will have to plan your schedule accordingly.\n\n2. \"Make sure you write every day\". I spent weeks without having anything to write about, and I benefitted tremendously from just reading and digesting new knowledge. I don't agree that writing is something that you should be forcing.\n\n3. \"You will often feel like you want to quit\". I have not felt this a single time in my career and I do not understand why someone would continue with a program that they want to quit. Before you begin, make sure that as many aspects of the program \u2014 advisor, group, project, location, university facilities \u2014 are to your liking so as to minimize the chances of ever having such thoughts. It's fine to think \"hmm, I wonder if it would have been better for me had I gone to university X instead?\"; it's *not* fine to think \"man, I really fucking wish I wasn't doing this\".",

Research suggests no on all counts. I'd provide some links on this, but at this point it's been demonstrated so many times in both studies and the real world that I'm not sure where to even start.\n\nThe only real advantage I can see is the widespread but false perception that more work hours = better worker, but I'm not sure that gives enough of an edge to be worth the consequences. The most productive academics I know in terms of research output definitely make time for exercise, family, and relaxation so they stay healthy and don't burn out.",

In mine, we expect undergraduates to answer questions we ask using resources we give them (and some they seek out on their own); MAs need to understand and articulate ranges of questions that define and shape the field and the methods used to \"answer\" them; PhDs need to demonstrate familiarity and agility as they develop and answer their own questions and/or methods. \n\nThe best PhD students (who also get the most out of their studies and generally have excellent career prospects) take charge of their own studies, are curious and excellent \"self-managers,\" and attend a range of talks in a range of fields (because they realize good ideas and models for thinking occur in unexpected places). They treat it like a 9-6 job but their curiosity means that they read \"around\" their subjects \"for fun\" in their leisure time. They also are very efficient: doing footnotes and literature processing at \"lower energy\" times of the day, for example, while doing harder writing at high energy points of the day. They think carefully about time and resource management -- teaching may be rewarding in many ways, but time teaching is not generally time learning or writing. Good luck!",

But in academia? And is everyone really so unaccepting of the choices of others around them? If it really is that bad then you gotta ask yourself \u2014 do you really wanna go down that road?",

Avoid being pulled into ongoing negative chatter in your department, whether about the program, the job market, a course, your advisor, etc. Someone is always unhappy in Ph.D. programs and for numerous reasons. Be aware of the problems or red flags but find the aspects of the program that make you happy.\n\n2. Take any advice from other grad students with a grain of salt (the exception may be   \nthose about to defend).\n\n3. Make friends outside of your department and university. This is both a quality of life   \nissue and a space issue. Find or maintain friendships that aren't academic ones. Having   \nfriends and family who couldn't relate at all to my academic pursuits was really good for   \nme. It grounded me and made me realize that my Ph.D. wasn't the only important thing   \nin the world at that time and that most of my struggles were minor.\n\n4. Prioritize your work in a way that best suits your goals. This will look different at the   \ncoursework stage and then at the dissertation stage. Is it getting the easiest tasks done   \nfirst that pleases you or doing  your work in order of due date? At the dissertation phase   \nmake a daily schedule to follow where you write a couple times a day as well as do other   \nnecessary things.",

      "text": "A student for whom I have a great deal of respect asked for advice last year as they were entering the same program where I got my terminal degree. Here\u2019s the gist of what I said to them:\n\n1.\tRegarding time: Schedule your time and be deliberate about its use. When you\u2019re supposed to be working, work. If you have leisure time, rest (whatever that means to you).\n2.\tRegarding workload: Coursework and research come first. Any extra related work should be strategically chosen to address weaknesses in your CV, or to emphasize strengths. Everything should have a purpose. \n3.\tRegarding mental health: 1 and 2 are designed to protect your mental health by establishing boundaries and priorities. Beyond those, make sure to take care of yourself. Eat well. Exercise. Go to therapy - even if you don\u2019t think you need it. A great therapist can do wonders in helping you manage stress and talk through difficult scenarios. \n4.\tRegarding networking: Your reputation precedes you, even as a student. Build your network by being involved and doing good work. Meet people and make a good impression. When you\u2019re on the job market, the assumption is that you can do your job well (evidenced by your CV). People want to hire who they know they can work well with. As I\u2019ve heard many times - all else being equal, it comes down to \u201cfit.\u201d Don\u2019t be a pushover, but being a team player and someone that\u2019s easy, if not enjoyable, to work with is important. \n5.\tRegarding your advisor: They want you to be successful (if they\u2019re any good), and they have placed tons of people into TT jobs (my advisor specifically). They also have decades of experience that you don\u2019t have. If they ask you to change something, do it. If they ask you to participate in something, do it. Your work will be better for it. Complain about it all you want to your friends during your bitching sessions at the local bar. But do it.",

Congratulations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnowing how to communicate, writing, speaking, lab or group meetings, classes,  is the bulwark for accelerated learning and success beyond academe.  Then knowledge of the software to do so: keynote, PowerPoint, Excel, Word, R, GIS, Adobe. Here's help on that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoXLXJmetH8&t=26s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoXLXJmetH8&t=26s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRb3zFuY17g&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRb3zFuY17g&t=11s)\n\nDependent on the thesis you'll need analytical, instrument, procedural or protocol knowledge. \n\nSuch as - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW8PcJ\\_6n6k&t=49s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW8PcJ_6n6k&t=49s)\n\nNetworking is always mentioned but never taken as seriously by students (myself included) as it needs doing. In academia, industry, lab groups, classes. Be positive and friendly. Make a good impression on how you conduct yourself - it may pay dividends in the future. \n\nFind balance in yourself, accept the truths, and fear not changes. The only comparison is to you of yesterday. There's the hotshot of every department, the project where kool-aide was drunken to lunacy, and the silverbacks of grumpiness all to give you a reason to doubt yourself. Stoicism helped me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in the modern world, some savvy with technology is needed or helpful. Those links are my growth through a program. I'm an imperfect human. Let's expand what we know about this humdrum world.",
