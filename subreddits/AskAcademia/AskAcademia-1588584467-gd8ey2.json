  "text": "Hello AskAcademia.I have severe social anxiety. I find it very hard to approach and speak to people. In conferences for example, I am worried that I am going to offend people if I don't already know who they are/what they work on. It gets pretty hard to build a conversation dancing around the fact that you don't actually know the person/their research (what if they are a big shot in the field?). I am horrible at remembering names, so it is extremely unlikely that i would remember a person by their paper unless I have read a ton of their papers.  This is just one example. I think i lack the skill to have and hold an interesting conversation that would build my network. Even if I gather the courage to approach someone and start talking, I notice that the conversation  dies down sooner or later and we are just blankly nodding and the other person looking for an exit.\nSo how does one go about being more confident in approaching and talking to people? \nPerhaps it is acerbated by the fact that I often have imposter's syndrome and I avoid speaking too much with the fear that they will find out I don't actually belong here?",

      "text": "Practice. I'm a very introverted loner, so I get where you're coming from, unfortunately I don't think there's a magic solution you've basically just got to force yourself to do it and gradually it does get easier.\n\n1. Very few people will be offended if you don't already know who they are (and those who do aren't worth worrying about *everyone* thinks they're an arsehole).\n2. Again, practice, I've found that mentally repeating someones name 10 or so times really helps remember their name, similarly look them up on LinkedIn (helps if you swap cards)\n3. this is something that'll develop overtime, a 1st year PhD probably doesn't have a huge amount to contribute to a conversation, but there's two things here, a) you can talk small talk (hows the conference etc b) let them talk, ask them questions, academics love to talk about ourselves\n4. conversations do peter out, so if you feel that happening close out and go \"it was nice to meet/talk to you I need to go to \\[next meeting/session/lunch\\] etc\"\n\nAlso make use of 'friendly' sessions, if your department has weekly research meetings, go to them, talk to people, do outreach events etc",

      "text": "My best advice for conference networking (and I\u2019m no expert) is if you start talking to someone, start the conversation light. Like comment on something in the room, or start small talk while waiting for a glass of wine. \n\nWhenever I\u2019ve approached someone, and was serious, and told them I\u2019m a big fan of their research or whatever, it\u2019s always a bit awkward and socially forced and the conversation usually never lasts long.\n\nHowever I have made plenty of conference friends and connections just by being friendly, laidback and, even jokey. Loosen up a bit, and you\u2019ll meet more people. Professors are normal people, they like idle chit chat, and can become awkward when some stranger approaches them and very seriously praises them.",

If there are any, I re-read the papers quickly, then try go talk to them. Sometimes they're easy to find, like if they are giving a talk. Sometimes they are harder so I try to ask people to give me an introduction.",

      "text": "As others have noted, this sort of anxiety is common. \n\nAt the moment, you seem focused on building your network by having short chats with strangers at e.g. conference coffee breaks. Others have some suggestions on how to do this well, but I'll add: trying to make substantial connections out of chance encounters with strangers is both very difficult and (for most people) not very rewarding, so maybe you don't need to try so hard. \n\nSome alternatives:\n\n1. At coffee, you can ask people what they're excited about. If it isn't interesting to you, you can just say \"thanks\" and leave! If it is, try to make a concrete next step (\"can I join your group for lunch?\" \"can you point me to the paper XYZ?\"), then leave! Coffee is not a great time to make substantial contact for the first time, and many of the conference fixtures will want to be looking around for their friends (and hence be a little distracted/uninterested if you don't have something concrete to say).\n2. Do try to join groups for lunch/beer/etc (you can go for beer even if you don't drink alcohol). Its OK to mostly listen and chime in when you have something to say (or even better, something to ask).\n3. Email people BEFORE the conference. One option is to just skim the list of speakers, then read 5-10 things that sound interesting and send 3-6 emails about meeting up. That way you're actually thinking about how to extend your network. I used to do this and most people would say yes; I'm now old enough that I get these emails, and I also say yes most of the time.\n4. At the end of the day, the quality of the connection will be determined by followup. Initial chats are about finding some area of common interest; you then follow up by actually reading and thinking about an issue, writing back, making plans for more substantial meetups, etc etc.\n\nOf course there's nothing wrong with pushing an individual coffee-chat a bit further if you like. It is OK to keep asking for details (and do some brainstorming) if you are genuinely interested/engaged and the other person seems game for it; if you're not sure, it is definitely polite to directly ask. \n\nDon't worry too much about not recognizing the big names. It isn't a big faux pas unless you're *really* close to their work. The one thing to recognize is that the big names sometimes get swarmed at conferences, and might be trying to brush off essentially everyone.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve dealt with severe social anxiety my entire life. Over time, with practice and medication, I\u2019ve got a good handle on it. \n\nThe most important thing to realize is that no one cares. You\u2019re not the center of the universe\u2014you\u2019re a blip on someone else\u2019s radar. You\u2019re a background character, an NPC, etc. in everyone else\u2019s story. Keeping this in mind has really helped me to keep things in perspective. \n\nSimilarly, I keep something similar in mind when presenting papers at conferences. People will be inundated with information. There will be papers upon papers and when they finally hear yours, they won\u2019t be able to follow it 100%. They\u2019ll get impressions and the overall gist, but most people aren\u2019t going to be able to remember some possible faulty logic in the middle of your third paragraph. It\u2019s partially because of information overload, but a lot of it has to do with the nature of oral presentations. It\u2019s hard to nit pick an argument if you don\u2019t have the paper in front of you. \n\nAnd, like others have said, practice! Start out by just saying nice things to strangers at the store (hey, cool hat) to starting simple conversations (how\u2019s that ___ you have in your buggy? I was wondering about trying that). \n\nAnother piece of advice: build a persona. Build a clone of yourself that\u2019s a bit more outgoing and confident. When I\u2019m in academic settings, I become weirdly funny. Like\u2014jokes and commentary a mile a minute. It can be annoying sometimes, to myself at least, but that\u2019s preferable to being shy in the corner. With that being said, also remember that you don\u2019t need to aim for perfection, just aim for being memorable and kind.\n\nEdit\u2014if you forget someone\u2019s name, it\u2019s okay to ask. You can also make a little joke about yourself and your forgetfulness to ease the tension in your mind. And, again, do you think all these people will remember your name? Would you get upset if they asked you again at a later point in time?",

However, I would advise to get a journal to practice cognitive behavioural therapy in. Simply begin by writing down your fears regarding this matter. And then counteract the fears. For example, write positively about how your voice and opinion is worthy and valuable and how your peers are by no means vastly more intelligent than you are, in fact many will fall below your level of intelligence. Try and reprogram your thought process in order to lower your perception of intimidation relative to your academic peers.\n\nChallenge your anxious mind by writing rationally about how many of your peers are likely to struggle socially too, how people are not so judgemental of minor discrepancies in social settings. Analyse how you yourself judge your peers positively regardless of when they make mistakes and how in fact when they do make mistakes you relate to them on a human level. Lots of people in the academic world are not social experts, it\u2019s not about this but it\u2019s about the sharing of interests and information, engaging in each others research.\n\nMaybe read a book about this subject, one I read was called Feel the fear and do it anyway. \n\nIt boils down to anxiety, confidence, self esteem and combating such things with resilience and slowly facing your fear.",

Familiarise yourself with the handful of schticks that define each famous individual.\n\nAbove all, in your area of subspecialty, know the specific works that are highly pertinent to your topic.\n\nCombining these (broad knowledge of the field generally + specific knowledge of subspecialty), you can have more 'ammo' for small talk. Also advisable to know what some of the still-poorly-understood topics are and their statuses. These open-ended research questions, armed with some knowledge of the current stage of development and famed names, can stimulate more organic conversations.\n\nAlso, smile and be present (be interested in the speaker).",

I then watched the video back and tried to give myself objective feedback on metrics such as my speed of talking, how comfortable I looked, my use of filler words, my ability to explain my project in 30-45 seconds etc. Then I just filmed myself over and over again until the videos weren't so painful to watch. \n\nMy lab has a really wonderful way of preparing students for their poster sessions and conference attendance. On the first morning of a conference, my lab-mates and I ALWAYS practiced giving our 'elevator talk' to each other: our organization, our current project etc. And gave honest critiques such as \"oh, remember to mention that we're funded by...\" Then when the poster sessions were being set up, everyone visited everyone else's posters to listen to their spiel and purposefully ask the type of questions that someone else may ask.",

I have social anxiety and HATE the small talk that normal people do to build relationships. I dig into that. I'm a weirdo. Everyone else at these conferences is also a weirdo. I use that. Acknowledge the awkwardness. If you are at the same conference then you have a common denominator of field. And once you lean into that awkward feeling it just becomes easier over time. Just like with anything else, it's practice. And knowing people. Once you make a few friends in your field who are also at those conferences, it will start to feel like another home and you will feel more comfortable. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

Start with an introduction, and why you are talking to them:  \n\n\"hi,  I am standard_human from reddit,  and I was very interested in your presentation\".  There, bammo, solid gold.  They are now delighted that you expressed interest in their own work.  There is nothing greater for a researcher.  \n\nThink of a couple of questions,  or comments about that presentation (or a paper, or something related to your common work).   \"that figure about widgets per time really highlighted the point\".   \"how did you deal with the widget evaporation problem\", etc.   Slide in your work by way of connecting it to their work. \n\nYou could always throw in some chitchat about typical common interest stuff,  travel/hotel,  weather,  etc.\n\nThen have an exit plan, \"it was a pleasure meeting you, it is ok if I contact you via email with other questions?   Have a great day.\" and walk away.  \n\nAdditionally,   a quick greeting if you see someone is always welcome. A simple 'good morning' or 'hello', etc if you see someone (even if you don't formally know them).  \n\nAs for forgetting names, it happens all the time.  I am especially bad at it, and I would venture that I am worse than you.  I don't think I have ever addressed another human being by their name in my entire life.  Even people I know I am afraid of messing it up.  Family reunions are a nightmare for me, for instance.",
