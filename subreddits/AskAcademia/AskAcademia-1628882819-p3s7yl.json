  "text": "I'm grading some writing assignments from masters students. The only ones who are using paragraph breaks are older non-traditional students. \n\nIs there a generational shift in how writing is taught? I'm on the stem side of things. Are there any other changes in how people write now compared to when I was in school?",

This is well and good for a short essay, but if you're writing a full APA-style paper, it's horrible advice. I'd get paragraphs that were several pages long! \n\nI think for the most part the only papers they've written are short essays, and confuse an \"introduction paragraph\" of an essay with the \"introduction section\" of a research paper.",

At the weaker end: no paragraphs, weirdly putting a space between a word and a comma/full stop/colon. I also found they often sent formal emails using \"text speak\". Also very limited vocabulary and an inability to figure out unfamiliar words from their context. I think it's because they weren't taught at school. Unfortunately, it's something I've increasingly seen in the UK to as we've slashed state school budgets.",
