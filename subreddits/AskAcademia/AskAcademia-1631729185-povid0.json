  "text": "I'll be applying to a STEM PhD program for Fall 22. One of my professors has asked me to write a LOR for myself and send it to him. He would then edit it accordingly and submit it. I have no idea how a great LOR for a STEM grad program looks like. Professors and academics of Reddit, could you share some sample (and anonymous ofc) LORs in dm which you would write for one of your best students? Also, would be a great help if you share some resources to write one at least. Already at my wit's end with writing a good SOP and now this! Might be an inappropriate thing to ask for so my apologies beforehand",

She was a diligent, hardworking assistant who showed great promise\u2026\u2019\n\nShe would then add info about my grades and awards and include some more info on my character. She would also include some info about my interests and past research. Finish strong with something like: \u2018student has a bright future ahead of her and would be an asset to any program\u2019\n\nWatch out for certain phrases. \u2018Strong personality\u2019 means doesn\u2019t work well with others. \u2018Has an interesting perspective on subject\u2019 means nutcase with crazy ideas. \u2018Strong moral compass\u2019 in my field translates to extremely religious.",

      "text": "I wrote a LOTR for myself one time. It felt very wrong to do. I was paranoid that the person reading it would be able to pick up it was my writing. I had to submit writing samples as well. Basically, when I wrote my own LOTR it felt like I was lying. \n\nEver since anytime someone has asked me to write my own LOTR I just found a new person. It saves me the stress.",

I\u2019m applying to grad school and fellowships now, liberal arts field (Spanish). Some of it is also because English is the second language of my recommenders but I think a lot of it is just that people are really busy and have tons of students, it\u2019s nice if the student can at least provide an outline of what the person should say (based on what the program they\u2019re applying for is) and a reminder of who the student is and what they specifically were working on. It\u2019s hard for professors to remember small details about every student, even if they remember you generally, especially when a lot of time has passed. They\u2019ll edit the letters if they please.",
