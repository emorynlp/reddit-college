      "text": "Yep.  I was the primary wage earner and insurance carrier for my family.  While I was offered a really nice fellowship package, it wasn't anywhere near enough to meet my household's needs, so I decided to keep working and just make it work.  It worked.  Mostly.\n\nI found coursework easier than candidacy/dissertation because of external deadlines rather than self-imposed ones (I'm also ADHD, so ymmv on that...). Toward the end, I switched jobs to one that was more aligned with my research and academic work and that made a HUGE difference because my brain didn't have to switch focus and ways of working constantly anymore.\n\nFor reference, I'm in the social sciences (no lab/field work) and had a kid, a partner (who stayed home with said kid), a mortgage, both sets of our parents within three miles, and a job that was reasonably flexible schedule-wise but not at all aligned with my studies. My job also offered partial tuition reimbursement which helped offset my tuition costs but didn't cover them all. I was well into my career at that point and the tuition costs were easier to stomach than a massive pay cut and having to pay ridiculous premiums for insurance for my partner and kid.\n\nI will say there is a big difference between a program that is willing to accept students who are working full-time outside of the program and programs that embrace students who are working.  Try to get a sense of this as you're considering applying.",

It truly depends on the stipulation of the institution and the program you\u2019re looking at whether this is feasible. I do caution you not to listen to people who say \u201cnever pay out of pocket for a degree\u201d when they don\u2019t know your particular situation. While this advice is typically apt, it largely leaves out people in exceptional circumstances. On the other hand, when people say you\u2019ll be burning the candles at both sides, it couldn\u2019t be more true.",

I had daily time allotted. Some times I needed it and it was great when I didn\u2019t. And each weekend I had at least three hours of dedicated, uninterrupted work time.

I would say the only exceptions to this would be something like a PsyD or EdD program where most people aren't funded and also work a full time job along the way. I've never met someone outside of these two fields that worked full time during a PhD. Most universities will not allow it.\n\nEven working part time during your PhD can be a huge struggle, especially during the first two to three years (coursework and quals). Your time management skills will need to be very good, and you will need to be excellent at using your allotted work-time to get work done. If you're a procrastinator you will struggle. Also, most universities have policies about how many outside hours you are allowed to work.",
