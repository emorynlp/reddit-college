  "text": "Today's my last day as a postdoc and in academia, and I don't know what to do with all the feels I'm having today, so thought I'd come here and mark the moment :)\n\nI'm excited to see what it's like out there (moving into gov), but pretty sad to be stepping away form focused research. If it's helpful to anyone, I;ll come and report back in a few months.\n\nLook after yourselves out there, and hope you can all have a relaxing weekend!",

      "text": "Enjoy! I did much the same thing years ago but went back to academia when I realised I was getting out of touch with fundamental research, and that the more I got promoted the more I would end up managing people and projects instead of DOING stuff that interested me. So keep in touch with your old colleagues just in case, would be my advice! (Assuming you dodn't leave academia because you hated them all!)",
