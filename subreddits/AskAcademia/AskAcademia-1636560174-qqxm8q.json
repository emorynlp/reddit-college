Generally this is toward the end of the degree (maybe year 4 or 5 under the American system). At this point, a little bit of push-pull between mentor/mentee is often necessary and healthy. Advocate for yourself.",

Sometimes, I am not good at communicating some research path, experiment or results and my supervisors have not clear of what I'm trying to say. Working from home also made this even harder. \n\nIt is also true that we as researchers are in the best position to understand our results and sometimes we forget to mention maybe something obvious for us, but no so for the audience. In addition, they have their heads in many things at the same moment. \n\nAfter that, I decided to put some work in my communtication skills and it has been somewhat better since then. \n\nDon't lose the motivation, trust your gut. \n\nHope it helps!",

I would suggest path A, but my advisor suggests path B, then C, then D, and then finally -- after forgetting the initial ideas -- also suggests A, then doubles down on it being the best path forward.\n\nTry not to get frustrated about it.  It's all part of the process.  The silver lining takeaway is that your intuitions are good, and you should take comfort in knowing that.  \n\nFor sanity and protection sake, I do recommend audio recording all of your meetings.  It helped me with keeping track of ideas and who said what, when.",

Sometimes your advisor will be right and sometimes you will be right. How often is this happening? How badly is it affecting your timeline/accomplishments? How senior are you? Are you new or are you about to graduate? \n\nIf it happens once in a while and isn't delaying publication tons, then vent to your friends and move on. Are there proposals your advisor was right to put off? If you're right some of the time but they're right some of the time, that's just life (believe me, I've been there\u2014but if I'm being honest with myself, my PI is right 9 times out of 10, so she's saved me a ton of time chasing up stupid projects. Missing a few things and having to do them after external feedback that convinces her seems like a small price to pay)",
