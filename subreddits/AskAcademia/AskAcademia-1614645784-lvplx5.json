  "title:": "Postdoc advisor refused to help me in getting my next job but now keeps contacting me",
  "text": "I was a straight-A student in my undergrad in electrical engineering, then did double masters, and a Ph.D. in the same stream. For my postdoc, I went under a professor who is very well-known in my area. Pretty quickly I realized that she counted among those advisers they warn you about.  The lab was always in flux with a huge attrition rate. The result was the responsibilities of exiting lab members would frequently fall upon the existing lab members and create a huge backlog. This would happen every few months. The effect was a largely dysfunctional lab environment where everyone is trying to pass the buck.\n\nI wrote several papers, grants, and even did a lot of non-research work for my advisor. However, when my term ended, she refused to write me a recommendation letter for my next job. The result was I was unemployed for the next year during which she would frequently mail me to touch base on some pending papers. My Ph.D. adviser then bailed me out and I landed a research job after one year of unemployment. My postdoc advisor has never enquired until today where I am; it has been three years at my current job + 1 year of unemployment after I left her lab.\n\nNowadays, I am publishing a lot of good research. For the past six months, she started emailing me to chat about some new projects that she would like me to collaborate on. I am puzzled by this behavior. After not helping me with any advancement in my career, why is she reaching out to me? There is nothing for me to gain in collaborating with her. I told her a tale of why I cannot collaborate (some personal reasons). But I am unable to figure out her motivations.",

She keeps throwing random offers of collaboration. I do not want to confront her by bringing up her past behavior because she has a pretty short temper and can harm me even more. She is quite persistent. But she has not asked me at all where I am or how I am doing. She simply sends an email asking me to collaborate. However, she rarely discloses the topic or details. Not sure if there is any project going on.",

Given her past behavior, she's shown she has little respect for you. I'm sorry you went through that situation.\n\nShe likely really needs the collaboration to boost her own situation. I've come to believe that academia is full of crazies like this. Once these people become senior, they thrive off of younger researchers in the field. It rarely crosses advisees' minds that some senior academics are actually rusty in their research skills and may not be keeping pace in their field. I've seen incidents where some faculty are totally relying on what their underlings produce. When you sign on to working on their grant projects, you may be giving up way more of your intellectual property than you realize.",

The way academia is currently set up in STEM and many social scientists, it's nearly impossible to have the \"impact\" universities expect without having a whole team executing your research.\n\nIt's just that many/most academics choose to acknowledge this and treat their graduate students and postdocs like humans.",

She asked me to stay for another year. So, I stayed for year #2. Then, when it was time to apply, I asked her again during year #2. She became very angry and told me that I am not focusing on the work (even though I was working 18 hours every day and more papers were coming out). She then stopped all regular meetings and would communicate only over email about the work. So, I missed all the deadlines but I still kept doing whatever work she threw at me. This also included shooting movies for her talks!\n\nA few months later, she became very nice all of a sudden and asked me to stay for another year. I refused (citing some personal reasons) and asked for time to discuss my future. She told me that she was going to Stanford for the summer and would try to fix a research position for me there. I got very excited. When she came back and I enquired what happened there, she told me that she did not have time to meet anyone there for me. Thereafter, whenever we met and I would ask for a discussion on my future, she would say she only has 2 minutes, 5 minutes,1 minute, etc., and would wrap up the discussion without anything concrete.\n\nOn my last day in the lab, I explicitly asked for a meeting to discuss my future job. In that meeting, she said she cannot give me any letter, that I must finish all other papers too, and that \"finding a job for me is not her job\". So, I left the lab without any job. Yet, she kept sending me emails asking for the status of the remaining few pending papers throughout the next year. I completed those papers but she still did not help me at all. That's when I reached out to my Ph.D. adviser.\n\nThroughout the time she was telling me I need to do more papers, she was recommending other postdocs (some with far less or even zero papers) to Princeton, Oxford, and other top places.",

It's neutral, it doesn't look like you're avoiding her, it's probably not a lie, and it is very unlikely to bite you in the ass. \n\nAcademia is a small world and the best advice I ever got was to never make any enemies. People know who the dickheads are and people don't work with them. The last thing you want is to get caught in a lie about your personal life when she talks to someone you're working with about something else and it comes up. Nobody wants that reputation.\n\nThe other route is just to collaborate. She's not your boss any more, if it would be beneficial to you then why not use her?\n\nWhatever you do I wish you the best of luck but I would really stop using personal reasons to avoid her.",

Another student had complained to the department about her behavior (not to mention a number of complaints from lab assistants she had fired) but nothing happened to her.\n\nI asked her about 6 times for a letter. In the 6th email, she said \"We have already discussed this many time. My response remains unchanged.\" During my last meeting, she told me that I must stay for more years and complete all other pending papers (which I did anyway during the following year).\n\nSurprising part was she would often praise my work in internal and external meetings in front of the others (at least when I was present).

              "text": "I mean your thread is titled, \"Postdoc advisor refused to help me in getting my next job...\"\n\nIf I hired a postdoc and within the first year they were asking for letters for their next job I would likely tell them that I haven't had sufficient time to evaluate their work and that the letter would reflect that. Thats the truth. I cannot, and will not, recommend anyone who I wouldn't want to hire for the job myself. \n\nLetters are only a small part of an application, and aren't often that important at the doctoral level. \n\nI have no idea what your actual situation is but it is pretty standard for both potential postdoc and potential advisor to establish at least an idea of an exit plan before committing to hiring. Was your advisor expecting you to only stick around for a year? I'm in a tangential field to yours and always hire postdocs who are interested in committing to at least two years. If they are interested in research intensive tenure track positions the reality is that almost no one is being hired into those roles with one year of postdoc under their belt (I honestly can't think of anyone in my field whose been hired in the last 15 years w/o at least 2 full years as a postdoc).",

                  "text": "Most postdocs in that group would spend 1 or 2 years and then move for a second postdoc to one of the top universities. She recommended a number of other postdocs to those top universities even when they had a far lesser number of papers than me and stayed for less than a year. Two postdocs spent only one year with her and went to Princeton. When they applied, they had spent only 3 months in the group. I asked for a letter after 1st, 2nd, and even the unemployed 3rd year, she refused to give one all along. Until now, she has not asked me where I am and if I have any job or not. She only used to email me about pending papers and nowadays for a collaboration. \n\nWhen I first joined her lab, our mutually agreed plan was for me to stay there only for a year. After two months, she told that she is so happy with my work that she would like me to stay for another year so that she can help me become a faculty member. She kept insisting that I must extend for another year. This was very difficult for my family but I decided to extend my postdoc for another year when I was five months into my first year. After I extended the contract, her attitude changed. She started giving me a lot of non-research work, most of it could be performed by even a masters student. Other postdocs were not doing any such work either. At the end of my second year, she wanted me to stay for another year. Then, I decided not to extend my time in her lab.\n\nAbout the exit plan, I asked for a discussion many times. She just would not let that discussion happen. Five minutes into the meeting and the topic is back to pending projects and papers. Many a time, the whole meeting will go into discussing some admin issues but not about my future. No matter how much I asked her for a discussion on that topic.",
