  "title:": "Idea stolen - what should I do?",
  "text": "A couple of years ago I I approached a colleague, let us call him Mr. Z, with an idea I had been refining for a few years. We wrote a proposal together, requesting funds for a major project. It was (by the skin of its teeth) not granted.  \n\n\nA year passes (more on this year below) and I notice the document we made the previous year being edited, I bring this up to mr. Z, and he said he wanted to re-submit the proposal - and that he thought we had agreed to do so last year. Fine, the situation was strange but OK. We revised the proposal together. However, as we were writing it he included others without discussing it with me - and had already had several meetings with potential contributors when I noticed the file being edited. This is not what I consider acceptable, but mr. Z is known for playing hard and fast - to get results fast - so I grumbled, thought seriously about asking him to leave the project - but unwisely let it slide. Eventually it was resubmitted and it was rejected again. Such things happen, right? After this I left the institution for another job (outside academia), and he remained. I thought no more of it, and filed the idea under 'will revisit when time permits'.\n\nYesterday I attended a defense for a PhD student close to his group, and during the dinner afterwards I learn that not only is the project idea picked up again by this mr. Z, he has gotten some funds for it - and set several students to explore it. A small lab dedicated to the venture. I find this to be of notable concern, so I would like to address the issue, and my desire to do so is further strengthened by his students at this dinner complaining about his lack of ethics, including him requesting a student in some considerable psychological stress to *not* seek help/counselling, but rather just work harder (on the heel of a student suicide at the dept. I might add). I am angry that he has taken my idea and, without my involvement, started a project. I find his ethics to be wanting (to say the least). I am also angry at how he seizes credit for our joint project (see below). I want to do something about the situation, but I am not sure what I CAN do. I can make the case that he has overstepped, but he has ingratiated himself with the H.O.D., the rector and more - and I have no hard proof. I fear that if I bring this up it will become yet another thing just swept under the rug by management, and my own career prospects hurt in the process. \n\nIs it worth it to pursue this? Should I just let it slide and be happy I am not in academia anymore?  \n\n\n(More on the year in question here: During which Mr. Z, I, and several others, completed a project resulting in several patents, a startup and quite a bit more. This is a long story, but we worked very hard on this - and divvied up responsibilities. While me and some others dealt with the nitty gritty development, testing, analysis - he served as a conduit to the HOD. The deal, orally agreed on, was that he would be an equal  partner, and streamline the beurocracy to facilitate the project. He has used this to get himself positioned in the eyes of management as the sole or chief inventor and originator of the whole idea. He has omitted names and contributions from his fellow inventors when speaking with the press, even omitted mentioning to us when we had a high ranking govt. official come to visit to see the work. The end of this is that due to this work he has gotten both a promotion, and several pretty nice awards to him personally - for work several people did, not just him. We, his colleagues who contributed to it and whose names are on the patents etc. are omitted from press, awards, grants.)",

Do they remain the in the possession of the university where they were drawn up, or with the originator?

Again, I know nothing about this field.)\n\nNot to diminish the ugliness of Mr. Z\u2019s behavior, but just to pose the question because it will likely effect your options, no?",

          "text": "Yes IP is almost always considered property of the university. However, universities generally don't get in to the issues of ownership though because it's just so difficult to navigate and for the most part will defer to the PI and deem them the \"owner\" to do what they will. It's very difficult for junior staff to claim ownership of an idea, partly because the PI invariably will have been involved in the development of the idea and they're the ones who will apply for funding and will hold any grants. Junior staff often can't hold grants.\n\nIt's worth noting IP rights change everything. Where there are IP rights the university will be a lot more interested and formal about ownership and how the IP is managed. \n\nTbh it's really not productive to think about ownership because unless you're the PI that's unlikely to be a fight you can win. It's much more productive to discuss who can lead on a project, acknowledgment, project development etc. \n\nIn this instance, the PI sounds very sketchy. I hate to say it but I think OP is on a losing run here and their situation is lose-lose. OP either gets in on the project and is then going to have to handle all the risks of a PI mismanaging the work and acting in highly unethical ways, or they don't and have to move on.",

      "text": "When you write a proposal together, typically both people make significant contributions to the design, planning, and formulation of the project. As such, both become owners of the project and both have a claim to work on that project.  It's likely that Mr. Z could/should be considered a part \"owner\" of the project. As Mr.Z and his lab continue to work on the project, figuring out how to solve various problems along the way, his share of ownership increases (since there is often a lot of intellectual input required to make a project work).\n\nSecond, ownership of an idea is very complicated. Many people often come up with the same idea independently. Who would get ownership? How would you know who came up with the idea first? How well developed does the idea have to be for one to claim ownership?  Ownership of an idea/project is further complicated by employment. Legally, ownership of any intellectual property belongs to the university. If you developed the idea while at work, wrote a proposal while at work, and/or submitted it as an employee of the university, then it is a work product of your employer. Thus, the project/IP would stay with the university after you leave. \n\nSo, in the end, it sounds like you would have the right to be a co-inventor if a patent is filed and a co-author if/when the work is published. You should be acknowledge in presentations, too. If you are not being given credit, that is something you should pursue. However, I don't think you can prevent him from working on the project - if anything, the university might be able to prevent you from working on the project (if you were to work on it now). If your goal is to get him to stop working on the project, I don't think you should bother pursuing that.",
