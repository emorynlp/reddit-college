      "text": "An easy way would be to track citation metrics. Search for the book in google scholar and look closely at the entries. That won't work if the book is very new as it takes time for research to get published. \n\nAnother method would involve searching for a review of the book in journals. Reviews are generally positive for academic texts, but it at least gives you more context.",

              "text": "That's how discourse works in every academic field. Foucault is one of the most cited scholars in humanities and social sciences and it's not because everyone who cites him is agreeing with his scholarship; people can build upon his work or critique it. It's useful to read scholarship not because you would necessarily agree with it but because you become a more informed citizen as such. I would hardly call myself conservative, but reading a bit of Edmund Burke provided a lot of context for political theory that I would not otherwise know. It's a very good idea to pursue whomever is most cited because they are a perfect jumping off point, and you will understand the scholarship that builds, and disagrees!, with them afterwards.",

You may look at courses syllabi (as mentioned by u/SapphireHost) on Universities websites or check Google Scholar to see how much this book has been cited. Ideally, the citation number should give you an idea whether the book is widely used and well accepted by Scholars. Note, however, that a low citation number does not mean that the book is \"not well accepted\".",
