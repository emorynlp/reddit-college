  "text": "Do you think administrations should concern themselves with faculty mental health? At my institution there is structural and soft support for the mental health of students and (to a lesser extent) staff, but not so much for faculty. I get the sense that there is an unspoken sense that because faculty are the most \"privileged\" group on campus we need to take care of ourselves. This was especially noticeable during the pandemic when faculty were essentially asked to take on more work and stress to support the mental health of students. I am curious to hear your viewpoints.",

      "text": "I'm a retired chair at a 5000 student state college. On my campus there is specific awareness of faculty mental health issues. We're part of a state system and have comprehensive health care including mental health. There is additionally a specific virtual mental health program independent of our health insurance that is rather similar to our counseling center for students--it provides overview services, brief therapy and referral (then involving health insurance) for more serious issues. As a chair I had the ability to (and did) modify teaching and other assignments for faculty having mental health issues and only involving the dean in an informational fashion without any paperwork involved. Information to the dean simply occurred verbally. Of course, a significantly modified assignment required some documentation from a licensed therapist to me. This occurred several times for tenured faculty without it being a big deal. For an untenured faculty member, it was of greater concern because of the possibility of impacting tenure. For the single untenured individual who needed modification for more than a year based on mental health, my letter of support for her tenure application simply mentioned that she had some alternative work assignments for a particular time and she sailed through tenure. Information regarding modified assignments only went to HR if they lasted more than a semester. That information never included why assignments were modified but simply that they were.\n\nIn my experience we are much more mental health-friendly than other academic institutions. My wife who spent her career in the local school system as an IT administrator was always amazed at how their system was so very less friendly than ours; I really believe ours came from the direction of a great president that we had for 15 years in the middle of my career. His ideas about having a generally faculty/employee-friendly atmosphere have continued through today.",

Faculty are grown ups, and should use their health insurance for this, not depend on administrators to care for them.",

      "text": "It's not spoken of much, but my impression is that the same mental health issues exist across levels in the academy. I've also had the feeling that many of my colleagues have suffered during the pandemic in similar ways to how undergraduate and graduate students have reported suffering (in studies, I mean). In some ways I think it's more difficult to navigate because we aren't supposed to discuss it, and the result is often a lack of communication and needs (ours and our students) falling through the cracks.",

One thing I noticed at my institution is that there were extensive efforts on the behalf of students, like reducing course loads without penalty or makeup, but not for faculty. We were just expected to work harder at teaching, and equally hard at service, to keep the institution afloat.",
