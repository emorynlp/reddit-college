  "title:": "Dealing with advisor's (empty?) threats",
  "text": "This morning got off to an awful start. I'm in my hopefully last year of my PhD and so far it's been rough. I have a review paper to write which is on the critical path to my graduation and am on a project which is less critical for me. However, this project is a multi-million dollar grant for my advisor. \n\nFor some context, my advisor is the caricature in PhD comics. He is disorganized, consistently changes his mind and unfortunately thinks he's the opposite. The multi-million dollar grant project was supposed to be a neat little final project for me to wrap up my PhD. Between monday and today, it has become a blue whale which I think I won't be able to finish at all. Less fortunately, I think I'll do all the grunt work (unpublishable) for some other person to do the cool bits and publish because I have to graduate next April. \n\nYesterday, I told my advisor that I'd really like to contain the scope so that I'm able to finish everything while I'm in grad school. This morning, he added another bloaty analysis bit. At this point I told him I'd spend half my time on this and the other half writing the research paper to finish. He then threatened to cut my salary in half because and I quote 'im paying you full time to work on this project'. Now, this is classic douchery on his front and he's done similar stuff before. He pays me for 13.5 hours a week but let's be real, I'm working a lot lot lot more. But I'd like to show my deep displeasure without a raging showdown. Help?",

      "text": "With a relationship this strained, it's unlikely you'll be able to communicate your full displeasure without a lot of fallout. However, that doesn't mean you can't alleviate these problems. \n\nOne problem here sounds like [scope creep](https://plan.io/blog/scope-creep/) on the funded project, which is a common phenomenon in project management with a variety of solutions. \n\nThe other problem sounds like a lack of boundaries regarding your overall time and responsibilities. If the review paper doesn't count toward your funded commitments, you might need to start tracking your hours. Make sure you spend exactly the number of hours you're paid for on the project you're paid for, and then switch over to the work that will get you graduated. If you have a graduate student/research assistant union, they should be able to help you enforce these boundaries.  \n\nSorry you're enduring such a crappy week. I know how toxic it can be to have a boss or supervisor that you can't openly communicate with about disagreements.",

      "text": "It sounds like there was an early expectation that you'd finish this project, but you feel like it's not possible with the timeframe you have in mind. So this needs to be clearly communicated and agreed on by both (a meeting of the minds). Otherwise, it just sounds like he's got a certain perspective in his head of what's critical (the project is the important thing, regardless of your 1-year timeline), while you're got another (finish in one year, regardless of the project). You should get his agreement of what's acceptable in writing (at least email him to confirm, after a meeting, to give him a chance to correct any misunderstandings).\n\nIf you don't finish it, and do the grunt work for someone else to finish, that sounds like what you'd prefer right? You can't have your cake and eat it too -- you don't want to finish the project, but you don't want someone else to finish it?\n\nWhy does he think you're paid to work fulltime on this, while you are only paid 13.5 hours a week? Seems like a huge discrepancy, so there must be a misunderstanding there to clear up. Same problem as the project -- it sounds like there's not a shared understanding.",

If they are getting their tuition covered as it sounds like here, then the student should have the other 20 hours for research pertaining to their PhD (and whether this project is part of the PhD seems like another point of misunderstanding between the student and advisor).\n\nSurely, no one would argue that on a regular \"20 hour\" RA stipend, PhD students are expected to do 20 hours of PhD work only right? It's that on a 20 hour RA stipend, the PhD student does 20 hours of work unrelated to their PhD for their RA, and has the other 20 hours for their own PhD work (which is expected to be more educational than grunt work).",

In my case, I\u2019m only officially paid for 20 hours, but my advisors and I have the understanding that this is a full time job where I\u2019m still being paid a fair wage. If I was going to be paid for 40 hours, my hourly rate would be cut in half - giving me the exact same wage at the end of the day. \n\nOverall, I completely agree with your take that there is a lack of communication and agreement with OP and the advisor! And without resolving this, things aren\u2019t going to work out well.\n\nEdit - I might also be privileged in that my PhD work is the same as my RA work. I did not think of that perspective.",

If it is PhD work, then the expectation is that PhD work would be 40+ hours -- so I'm just rebutting the OP's comment about being paid for 13.5 hours which is a false target. If the advisor sees this as PhD work, then from the advisor's point of view, they are providing full funding for 40 hours of PhD work.",

I\u2019m not saying I agree with the way everything is done, but to survive you certainly don\u2019t speak about a professor using the lexicon you have dug up. Not least because professors have reasons, often unbeknownst to the grad student, for doing what they do. Keep quiet (listen) and do work, eventually good things will happen.",

You're advising students to consent to what they know is abusive and unethical conduct, in the slim hope that it will get them career advancement someday. \n\nNo career is worth enduring abusive behavior. This kind of \"ends-justifying-the-means\" thinking is what motivates sociopaths to abuse their workers. They can mistreat them, because it doesn't matter as long as they get results. This is abhorrent behavior in a supervisor, and should never be encouraged in a student. \n\nToday's abuse victim might well be tomorrow's abuser, especially if you perpetuate the lie that abuse is part of the job.
