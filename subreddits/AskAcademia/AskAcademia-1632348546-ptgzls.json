  "title:": "Question about admission to a Master's degree or a PhD program with a criminal record",
  "text": "Hello!  \nI'd like to know whether having a criminal record of any kind in my country of origin (Spain) can affect or negate in any way the admission to an European or American Master's degree o PhD program. I'd also appreciate any information on how, if at all, it might affect the grant of paid scholarships, either from the University or from the government itself.  \nAside from this general information, I'm more concretely interested in minor crimes, accounted for in the legal system as civil offences rather than penitentiary ones. And even more concretely, crimes related to social activism of some kind, for instance related to the vulneration of private property in collectivizing it.  \nThanks a lot for reading this",

      "text": " I'm not aware of this mattering for a university, but it may matter for a visa. If you are Spanish, then no visa needed for EU, but if you go to America, then you will need one. The American immigration system counts only some crimes as inadmissible ones, and very minor civil offenses such as trespassing will not matter. But, something like minor shoplifting or theft is considered a \"Crime of Moral Turpitude\" and could make you inadmissible. I believe for a student visa, the decision is discretionary, but I presume they generally follow the rules for immigration.",
