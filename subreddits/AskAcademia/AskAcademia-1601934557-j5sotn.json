  "title:": "Incident happened in Zoom class and I don't know how to react",
  "text": "If this isn't the right sub for this, I am sorry, but I don't know where to go.\n\nToday started out as a normal zoom class day. We are going through class, and the professor makes a small comment that she is not feeling too well. She continues teaching as normal, and eventually the class breaks out into groups to discuss homework. This happens normally once in a while. About half way through the time we were supposed to be in groups, we get a message broken message through zoom saying along the lines of \"...food...not feeling well...\". My group and I did not understand it, and we thought she meant \"come back now\", so we went back to the main zoom room. In the main zoom room, she is not there. My group and I wait a bit, and then the incident begins. Next thing I see on my screen is my professor topless. I proceed to flip my screen shut. After five minutes or so (it felt like an eternity), I open my laptop up because I need to close the zoom class. When I open my laptop, all I hear is my professor crying very, very badly. I closed the zoom call asap.\n\nI feel terrible for her. I know she works so hard for the class. She definitely doesn't deserve for this to happen to her. I hope she is okay. Should I be doing anything? Should I email her saying \"its okay we are all adults\", or should I wait for her to email? Should I reach out to someone else? I don't know what to do. This is probably a unique situation, but any advice would be appreciated.\n\nUpdate: She emailed me asking to talk on the phone. I did not get back to her until late because I did not yet feel comfortable. I would like to thank each and everyone of you for giving advice. I would like to especially thank you who gave good advice. \n\nTo those who think this isn't real: I wish it wasn't real. What happened must be devastating for my professor. I came here as I was hoping to get professional opinions. I could have posted this on a much larger sub and gotten thousands of up votes. Instead I came here for honest help with a throw away. The only thing I am benefiting from this post is getting advice from professionals, to whom I would like to thank again.\n\nUpdate 2: We had a phone conversation. It turns out, as many of you have guessed, that she had sudden food poisoning. She had puked all over herself, and she needed a change of clothes immediately. She said she was sorry, which I don't understand what she has to be sorry about, and then I said \"These things happen, and we are all adults here\". I asked if she was okay as she was crying a lot. She said she was fine now. At the moment, it was too much for her hence all the crying. \n\nThank you again for all the advice. It genuinely helped me with this situation.",

      "text": "If you are worried about her, you could let her know that when you returned to the Zoom you heard crying and want to make sure she is ok.  Otherwise, the best thing you can do is ignore it.  She doesn\u2019t need to know what you saw.  \n\nHere\u2019s my wild guess about what happened: she ate some bad food and after trying to push through it and get through class, she threw up while you were in the breakout rooms.  She tried to let you all know, then went to change her top and was surprised that some of you were back early and saw her topless.  In her fragile state, that was too much for her and she lost it and started crying.",

If you've ever had severe food poisoning (or another similar ailment), you'd know that onset of symptoms is immediate and uncontrollable. The process of vomiting is very stressful both physically and mentally/emotionally and everyone reacts to that differently. \n\nFurthermore, we don't know the situation that the prof was instructing in. Was she instructing on the only computer she owned, did she not backup a crucial analysis immediately before class started, is it a loaner computer? \n\nTo this situation, and OP in general, I say be an adult and act like nothing happened, and encourage your fellow students to do the same. You may not understand it now, but shit like this happens to everyone and we need to be kind when it does happen. Wait until your child, or your niece or nephew, has shat themselves in a zoo/museum or other less-than-conveinent situation and needs to be cleaned up. Wait until your kid eats too much ice cream or crackerjacks and has an accident. Then you'll understand why we need to be kind to each other when we or they are at their lowest.",

Don't forget that gastrointestinal upset and disorientation are both symptoms of COVID. That's not to say she definitely has COVID, but imagine having a sudden onset of illness where you're puking all over yourself, utterly confused, humiliated, and probably afraid of losing your job. The only choice in my opinion is to act compassionately and reassure her that she has your respect. We all get sick sometimes and it can be hard, scary, and embarrassing.",

      "text": "One of the best responses I've seen to this was on the show Community, where one of the characters is reporting the weather news and farts on camera. She's embarrassed but addresses it the next time she is on TV. Says that we're all human and things like this happen. And then she moves on. I hope I can be as baller as that when I inevitably do something embarrassing on camera.\n\nI think language like: that this is a crazy and overwhelmingly exhausting time and navigating video life is to have a relationship with someone embarrassing themselves somehow, on camera. Hopefully we can all be gracious when our number comes up. Tell her that you see her no differently, and hope she would consider addressing it at the next class if she feels comfortable doing so. That you're glad to see that she isn't in distress right now. She probably has a faculty staff assistance program or ombuds office to help her with language/and managing the interaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe can move through this.",

After a few cycles of shitting out water and puking up more water I didn\u2019t even have energy to put on more clothes as I had already changed a couple of times. I just lay on the floor of the bathroom naked with the door open so my mom can get to me if I pass out. Sometimes your body just can\u2019t cooperate and you do what you have to do. So I really feel for your instructor. I think going to admin is cruel and uncalled for in this situation. She was sick and needed a change of clothes before she faced you guys for the rest of the lecture. She didn\u2019t realize you guys were back in the main session. It\u2019s unfortunate that you guy had to see her in that situation but you\u2019re right in that you\u2019re all adults. Just forget you saw anything and continue to interact with her professionally. And if I were you I wouldn\u2019t bring it up in front of other students just to respect her privacy.",
