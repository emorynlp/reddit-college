  "title:": "Advice for dealing with toxic fellow graduate student(s)",
  "text": "*Thanks in advance for any advice. I've been blessed with un-dramatic, secure, and emotionally mature friends (which is great), but it's left me unsure how to handle all of this. At this point, I mostly just want to be rid of the drama. Also, if anyone has any suggestions on making friends in grad school (particularly outside of their grad program), I'd really appreciate it. If you want/need details on my specific situation and why I'm asking, see below.*\n\nI started my Ph.D. last year, which wasn't the easiest time to move and begin a new program. Against the odds, I made friends with a few fellow students last February. Everything seemed great. However, a couple of months in, one student in particular (I'll call her A) started displaying some toxic behavior.\n\nAt first, it was things like subtly putting down others when they did well or did a homework problem correctly when A got it wrong. Then it was talking about other friends in the group (particularly a young woman I'll call B, but everyone) behind their backs. The badmouthing could take a lot of forms. For example, she would say that B's fiance (who proposed to her last semester) was an alcoholic and a drug addict (he's not) and that we would probably need to hold an intervention when the relationship hit rock bottom in a couple years. She spoke horribly about B when they got engaged (what did she see in him, he's awkward, B is settling, B just got lucky finding love, B's fiance won't be happy with her forever, etc.). Other negative comments included others in the group being immature, liking gossip, being bad/unethical about research, being unproductive, naive, stupid, bad with money, etc. Things escalated when she tried to ice B out of the group (B didn't do something A wanted; A never told B she wanted this thing). At this point, I stepped in and continued hanging out with B despite A. A then decided to make up with B (although she is still mad, even enraged, and will talk about it given a chance). However, B thinks that this was just a small fight between the two of them. She doesn't know that A stopped inviting her to things (and attempted to get me to do the same) or that B still continually badmouths her. B thinks they are still good friends. For some, some definitions of friendship, maybe they are.\n\nAfter that, I started to realize that A has a history of turbulent relationships. She is not friends with any of her friends from high school or college (her words). She has already fallen out with at least two members of her cohort (she has been here a year longer than I have). Despite this, A is both charismatic and manipulative, which I think enables her to continually get away with how she treats people. In any case, I realized that it was only a matter of time until she got angry with me -- which is what happened less than a month later. I asked her about it after I realized what was going on. Apparently, it's because I wasn't sure I wanted to watch a particular movie and because I corrected her on homework a couple of times (e.g., \"I don't think the answer to X can be Y because X divided by Z is not Y\" -- I wasn't mean about it). The last two things made her question our friendship. She also told me that she only became friends with me because she felt sorry for me because of COVID, that we only became friends she had recently fallen out with a different friend, and so forth. Just a whole slew of statements that I'm sure were designed to hurt me. I also tried to talk with her about the badmouthing thing, which only resulted in her gaslighting me - she tried to tell me that she hadn't said any of those things, which is just BS because she said them all the time. At that point, I knew there was no recovering the relationship, and I was no longer interested in interacting with her. It doesn't seem worth it. \n\nHere are my questions. However, really any advice or perspective would be great.\n\n* How should I handle this situation appropriately? I see graduate school as being a professional environment. How can I minimize damage? I'm worried about my reputation in the department given A's tendency to badmouth everyone. Typically if I didn't want to be friends with someone I would slowly distance myself by becoming busy with other things, but that seems hard given that everything with A generally seems very dramatic (she spread rumors and tried to complain to the department about one of the students she fell out with last year).\n* Does it make sense for me to distance myself from this friend group as a whole? Can I do that in academia or would that count as shutting the door on potentially useful relationships? \n* Does B deserve to know? I am inclined not to say anything because I don't think it would do any good, but I've had some friends give me the opposite advice.\n* Any tips for how I can avoid situations or people like this in the future?\n\n*TL;DR - I made a toxic friend in my first year of grad school. Now I'm just exhausted from all of this want to figure out a way of distancing myself gracefully and moving on with my Ph.D. without being totally socially isolated.*",

                              "text": "I would count my A as among the more subtle ones. Her behavior has a clear negative pattern, but she's very good at couching it in terms that seem sympathetic or pitiable. She likes playing the victim and she's good enough at it to keep some friends, at least in the short term. That said, I think she's best at it in small groups, which was great for her during covid but I don't think will work as well when everyone is back in person and on campus. I think that she'll likely either a) try to keep to a single group that she isolates, or b) be friends with one person, and use that friendship as a jumping-off point to bring a new student who doesn't know her well into her sphere. However, I can't see how either strategy will work for her in the long run. My experience with her suggests that she's always fighting with someone. She'll use a fight almost like fuel, if that makes sense, and while she's fighting with them she'll complain about them endlessly that that's 90% of what she'll talk about. Then once that fight has exhausted its self or been over for a while (because the person is out of her life) she'll move on to the next thing she can pin her discontent/upset on. She's also complained about everyone in our friend group (and all of her previous friends, even from before grad school) so I feel like everyone is fair game. I don't see how this could go on indefinitely without her gaining a reputation. That said, I could also see how some people might be reluctant to see the pattern.",

                                  "text": "So I had an A in my lab when I was doing my PhD. She faked results, was manipulative, lazy etc. We ended up going toe to toe verbally on multiple occasions. When I look back on it, I'm actually quite ashamed of my behaviour. At the time I was outraged by her behaviour and was young and naive and thought that when something is wrong it was my responsibility to fix it. The result was me probably starting as much drama as her in the end, even if I was well intentioned.\n\nWhat's happening with B is really nothing to do with you. Be there for B and support her, stand up for her in the moment if needed but other than that this is B's problem to deal with. Ditto where A dumps on other people. \n\nIf A says something mean or hateful, by all means say something like \"how embarrassing for you that you'd say something so racist/mean/spiteful/homophobic/etc\". But do it blandly and looking to shut down the conversation, not looking to get into fight in which you can hold a referendum about her bad behaviour because you'll end up wasting a lot of energy and the people on the sidelines don't want to get dragged into the drama.\n\nHer reputation is of no consequence to you, don't try and fix her and her relationships. Just focus on minimising contact. Don't socialise where you can avoid it. Where you can't avoid it just be polite and non-commital and don't get sucked into her bad behaviour.",

It might not result in any significant \"karmic retribution\" outcomes, but it can certainly earn her a negative reputation as \"difficult\" or \"prone to drama\" and make people reluctant to engage with her. It also might not result in any immediate reputation changes, but give it a few years and people will figure it out and spread it. People aren't stupid or blind to bad behaviors.",

      "text": "I was like you my first semester of grad school, never really had to end a friendship before because I just never encountered much toxicity among my friend groups. It wasn't until grad school that I encountered this kind of behavior and it pretty much nuked my friend group(partially because I didn't know how to deal with it, partially because I didn't want to admit to myself what was going on). Luckily things seemed to work themselves out. Now I'm very lucky and was able to interact with other students who are supportive. \n\nMost of the people in grad school are just like most people everywhere, and I really want to believe that means they're basically good. People in grad school also tend to pick up on patterns quickly. Put together that means they aren't going to want to hang around toxic people if they don't have to. It sucks in the moment, but I really do believe these things will usually work themselves out. I can't give you much advice on what to do right now other than hang in there and work on building a support network. Grad school is hard and there's no reason to make it harder because of interpersonal issues.",

I'm going to be a little vague to leave out any possibly identifying information.\n\nOne was easy to distance from, as that individual had a falling out with a lot of people at once. Our grad student union is rather proactive, and they thought it was their responsibility to report any grad student who participated in the union to the University admins. They did a lot of shitty things in the past, but that was crossing a line for a lot of people. \n\nThe second was a bit harder. I ended up developing feelings for this person and was turned down. That in itself was fine, nobody should be forced to go out with anybody. The problem was when they tried to take advantage of me immediately after the rejection and I just didn't want to believe it. I thought they were trying to keep the friendship alive, they were actually trying to get money to offset their rent. \n\nI blamed myself for being a shitty person for a long time over the second one. I didn't even consider that the fallout might not have been my fault until I heard they did similar things to three other people. After that the blinders started to come off and I saw a lot of the toxic behavior for what it was",

In my case what seemed to help the situation was to make sure that i continued to have a separate friendship/association with each person in the group. My A was trying hard to make sure that they became the main point of contact for everyone else(setting up outings, relaying messages (or not as suited the situation), inviting different people to different things and subtly/unsubtly freezing people out unless they fell in line). I had a few other friends groups so it wasn't too bad and i ultimately managed to salvage most of the members of this group through keeping up one on one interactions without A around.

She is not friends with any of her friends from high school or college (her words). She has already fallen out with at least two members of her cohort (she has been here a year longer than I have). \n\nEventually, she will alienate people despite her charisma, and this will sort itself out. For you, the trick is surviving long enough until that happens without catching her ire and becoming her next target.\n\nA secret of these people is they crave drama, to the point they will accept negative attention over no attention. Which means she will happily burn bridges and jeopardize her own standing there just to make you miserable.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t try to confront her, or try to band other people against her. If she gets wind of that she will make you absolutely miserable. You simply don\u2019t have the emotional resources to keep up with people like this, because they live for that shit.\n\nIn situations where it is not possible to go no contact, people recommend \u201cgray rocking\u201c narcissists which is in simple terms being as boring as possible. If she tries to suck you into drama just act like you are too dense or oblivious to get it, and drone on about some boring technical thing. Let her lose interest in you without realizing you are being boring intentionally. Let her ditch you because you don\u2019t give her the drama fix she tries to stir up.",

      "text": "Hey, I went through something similar. But mine happened to me in a very passive aggressive manner. I'll make the long story short, I am now still friends with this person regardless of what happened.\n\nI learnt from his/her background and found that they have been living a very socially excluded life, both at home and outside. They also lived a life where it was do or die for them. The mentally of go big or go home can really take a toll on people, no matter what age they are at.\n\nSometimes, I really wanted to lash out and say something terrible to them. But I think that you and me need to be the bigger person and just move past this. Honestly, people like this need time to learn and reflect. They can become better but we don't know when they will experience that change. I think it's important to not take on the role of the \"savior\" that will help them change. You need to give them space and focus on your research. \n\nIf anything, toxic behavior is VERY noticeable. It's not something you can keep under the covers for too long. You will almost always come across someone with baggage from their past that they have not made peace with. I chose empathy with this other person in my life and eventually, we still remain friends to this day.",
