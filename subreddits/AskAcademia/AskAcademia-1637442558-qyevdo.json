  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nSo recently I applied to a PhD position and couldn't even get an interview. I have a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry, a bit of research experience & 3.25/4.0 GPA. Pretty disheartened about it but I took a second look at my application documents and realized how (perhaps amongst others) low effort my cover letter was; I saw the opening late so I rushed to meet with the deadline. Anyway, I'm reapplying for positions next month, and I'd like to have someone else take a look and give me pointers.\n\nYes, I already know it's a piss-poor cover letter (wonder how I didn't see it earlier), but specific comments/pointers on how to make it better, what's lacking, what to rephrase, how to restructure and all that would be super helpful. \n\nThank you so much in advance. I need all the help I can get.",
