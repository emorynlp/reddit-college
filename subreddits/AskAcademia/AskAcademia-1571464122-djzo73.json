The kitchen was completely off-limits as we weren't trusted to clean up after ourselves (not that the staff would, either). We had to wash our dishes in the bathroom. They got upset that we were doing this, so they *literally* told us to use the commuter kitchen that was on the other side of campus. Seeing that sign was the first time I felt my blood actually boil. I was furious.\n\nWe revolted after that, and our new department chair saw through the bullshit and opened up the kitchen. Un-fucking-believable.\n\nMoving to Europe was a complete eye-opening experience. The administration at the university actually *helped* us, rather than being a thorn in our side and trying to flex their egos. Our department secretary here is actually respected, and fully deserves that respect. Our kitchen is stocked with an expensive espresso machine and unlimited coffee. We have an induction stove, so I can literally cook food here.\n\nEven as an undergrad in Canada, if I was employed as a student researcher, I was granted full access to everything as an employee.",

Grad \"students\" are workers who deserve to be paid appropriately for their labor, which should allow them to pay for their own coffee. But universities are more than just workplaces; they are also hubs of collaboration such that gestures such as \"free coffee\" can go a long way toward inviting collaboration to actually happen rather than only occurring as the result of a contractual requirement.\n\nEDIT: I'd also like people to consider that, in fact, *workplaces* themselves are more than \"just\" workplaces. They're also where people socialize, make friends, find meaning. Any place that doesn't pay fairly isn't worth staying at for long; any place that doesn't make itself more than a mere workplace isn't worth staying at for long, either.",

      "text": "Our lab always had a coffee machine everyone can use and different arrangements on who bought the coffee.  \n\nWhen I joined the lab, there was an old, very simple machine from a former PhD student, who didn't need it any longer. It was once of those machines where you brew a can full of coffee in advance, so they also needed to coordinate a bit. The coffee drinkers took turns in buying the bags of coffee (and occasional cleaning), otherwise it was \"free\" for them. Guests got coffee for free. They also tried to balance things out so that the more frequent drinkers bought coffee more often.  \n\nA while ago our PI bought a more expensive machine for the lab, that brews individual cups with dozens of settings, where everyone now pays per cup and one person takes that money to buy the next bag of coffee beans. It's something like 10 cents (\u20ac) per normal cup, so still dirt cheap. If you have a guest over, you'll usually pay for his/her cup. They occasionally recalculate it, just looking how much the last bag costed and how many cups were consumed (which is why it's important to also register cups that guests consumed). You can pay in advance, so just give 5\u20ac - 10\u20ac to the person in charge and drink until your deposit is depleted. Since cleaning is a bit more complicated now they have a list who has \"cleaning duty\". Silly thing needs cleaning three times a week but somehow it works. Sometimes people forget one cleaning but usually the others will remind them on the next day.",

This is coming from a pretty well funded STEM school with enough funds to build new buildings all over campus.
