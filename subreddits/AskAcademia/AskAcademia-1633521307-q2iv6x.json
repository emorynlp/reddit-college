  "text": "I am currently in the process of applying for postdocs in the US. Is it expected that one's current employer should be one of the referees? I have recently (2 months back) started a short-term fellowship, so I am unsure if it makes sense to have the Institute's in-charge as one of my 3 referees. \n\nI am confident that both my other referees will write strong letters, so I am wondering if it is worth getting a generic/superficial letter from my current supervisor despite them not knowing my work well. Is it a red flag if the current employer isn't one of the referees? Not like I have a ready-made alternative who could be my 3rd referee. But I am not desperate, and I can always ask one of my former teachers to write a not-very-detailed third letter.",
