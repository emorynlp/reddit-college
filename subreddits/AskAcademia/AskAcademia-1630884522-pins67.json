  "text": "Hi \n\nI am a Canadian who is looking at applied mathematics masters in Canada, but is interested in pursuing a PhD in the States or Europe if I enjoy a masters.\n\nShould I care about prestige for the masters? I have heard some people say that who your supervisor is and their relevance in their field is usually more important. Any thoughts or advice? Thanks!",

      "text": "In my opinion and experience, the general rule of thumb is that prestige always matters in academia. Academia is largely a rich get richer world (admission to PhD, postdocs, grants, all doors that open easier with prestige). Now that prestige might be located in an individual master's thesis supervisor, but then you're depending on committees to recognize that supervisor and/or your own work instead of the easy shorthand of a prestigious institution. There are lots of excellent mathematicians at non-prestigious institutions, and you can certainly get into a good PhD program with a good set of letters from a master's level department, but prestige has to be a consideration you keep in mind, especially if you consider a PhD.",

      "text": "I'd go for prestige in your masters. That would stand you in good stead when you're applying for doctoral programs. \n\nBy the way, without me having any data at all about math, you might well find that more prestigious programs also have more well-known faculty. You might well be able to do a 2-for and go for prestige in your program along with a well-known faculty member!",
