My teaching portfolio will cover undergrad / preregistration nursing as well postgraduate / post registration healthcare and nursing courses. I have a pretty small publication portfolio, but I have done a lot of service design, QI, and high profile work for NHS England so I think they valued my hands on practical experience of healthcare transformation in practice in lieu of a traditional academic profile.",
