  "text": "So long story short.\n\nI whistleblew on 2 cohort members that were doing some unethical stuff. Ive been to by Director of grad studies that student conduct board agreed there were some violations.\n\nSince then  since one of cohort members is also a lab partner..\n\nMy advisor has taken a rather shitty attitude towards me.\n\nHe made a few comments like\n\n\"Learn to work with your lab partner, or I will shut the lab down\"\n\nHe insisted i was a \"problem\"  looked at my very direct shaking his hands palms open, with a look in his eyes of anger. His emphasis on the word \"you\" was very strong as well as his rigid mannerisms.\n\nHe is co-chair to my depart. An anon letter was sent to chair.\n\nWhen I opened up to my advisor and basically ousted myself as the letter writer, he said he was left in the dark and knew nothing.\n\nI know this to be false because my advisor had met with my lab mate the day before I got my ass chewed.\n\nInteresting was day before i got ass chewed advisor was like apply to PhD program.\n\nThen next day he rescinded saying he doesnt know me well enough to make that recommendation.\n\nMy research interest align well with my advisor but since whistleblowing ive seen a dark side of him.\n\nI even tried to offer him a peace offering of a cookie, in hopes we could chat.\n\nHe refused cookie. Stating he couldn't take it. \n\nIve been told by director of grad studies that the school takes retaliation serious.. but when informed him of the aggression from advisor, he has not replied back.",

Advisors expect you to bend over backwards for them, sometimes they expect it even more when they can tell how badly we want to make them happy. You might just sit with it for a bit, take some deep breaths, and try to wait it out. If you did the right thing and your advisor is a good person, he will see it. Sometimes it just takes time (I say that as someone who had a prima-donna advisor who probably wouldn't have accepted the cookie either :/).",

I know someone said this already, but no matter how much you love your research if you have a bad relationship with your advisor it will be hell. Since you're so early in there's probably an option to change, and there might be another professor who respects that you put yourself at risk to stand for ethics.\n\nIf your advisor pushes back on this, try to work with your university's Ombudsman. They really can't/won't do too much (sadly a friend of mine had a similar situation), but given that you made an ethics complaint that was substantiated by the conduct committee and your advisor is forcing you to work directly with one of the offenders, they should be able to force him to let you switch labs.",

They won't mind if your masters work was in a different subfield.\n\nIf you're in psych (maybe some sort of biopsych?) I'm pretty sure you should be able to get into a PhD program directly with a bachelors. If you really don't like the other lab and your advisor is trying to push you out, then maybe you should apply to other programs and write this off.

If the problem doesn't get resolved, only then can you skip a few steps and go directly to the top. Imagine that you're a student's supervisor and you realized that your lab was having some problems among students, not because one of your students came to you for help, but because _your_ supervisor (or whoever) confronted you about it. When your advisor says he was \"left in the dark,\" he doesn't mean that he didn't know about the problem, but more that he was left in the dark by _you_.\n\nAs of now I'm not sure what you can do to make the situation better. One thing that I suggest you could do to make up for it is to 1) stop reporting things (for now) and 2) apologize to your supervisor. Don't apologize because you blew the whistle, but apologize saying that you didn't mean to disrespect them that way and that you only went against the chain because you were afraid of what might happen, and ask him if there's anything you can do to lessen the damage done. Obviously it would be nice if people wouldn't be so childish and take care of issues properly, but as of now you're the one who needs his support.",

But that doesn't mean that dropping a nuclear bomb like this is the only option you have. \n\nDid you talk to the students directly and raise your concerns? If they were TAing a class, what about the professor for that class as a next measure, if their behavior was serious enough?\n\nBoth of those steps should have been taken before anything like a whistelblower complaint was filed. And even then, that's a very serious thing to do. In so doing, you would be essentially saying that the students deserve serious disciplinary action or expulsion for their behavior. Did their behavior rise to that level? If they were taking bribes or something in exchange for grades, then sure - that would make sense. If they made a \"remark\" that you didn't like?... probably not. \n\nGoing back to your original post, in the last sentence, you mentioned that you already escalated again up to the director of graduate studies, this time related to the response by your professor. \n\nI'm absolutely not saying that you should turn a blind eye to bad behavior when you see it, but you have to find a more productive way of dealing with these conflicts than immediately escalating everything up to the highest authority figure you can find. That isn't a healthy way of dealing with professional conflicts.",

That would probably qualify as retaliation, but you have to understand that that bridge has been burned. You can't ask this guy for a letter of recommendation now. Your relationship is poisoned. You shouldn't trust him to write you a good letter, and neither you nor the dean can compel him to write you one.\n\n>The threatening to shut down lab and research?\n\nYeah, maybe, though it would be easy for him to pass it off as an offhand comment in a fit of pique.",

Also, a conduct board wouldn\u2019t find some \u201cviolations\u201d and do nothing. Especially with FERPA-related issues - those are serious problems. Honestly, they are less about student conduct and more about the integrity of the institution and should be taken seriously.\n\nYou said you are thinking of dropping out. Before you do that you need to document everything and write it up coherently, factually, and without affect. (Honestly, it needs to be written 100x better than the OP which is a complete mess.) It needs to include all of the student behavior and the faculty behavior. Make sure to note the hostile environment.\n\nNow you need to escalate it. First you need to take it to the department chair. No traction? Write up that interaction and add it to your document. Then take it to the dean of your college. No traction? Write up the interaction with the dean and add it to your document and escalate it to the provost of your university. If this really is a FERPA then someone will care. When you find the one who does, everyone below will be in trouble.\n\nThe cookies were a foolish idea. Most faculty would not have accepted it regardless of the circumstances.",
