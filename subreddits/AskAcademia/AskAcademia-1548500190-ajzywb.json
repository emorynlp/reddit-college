  "text": "I have given up on a funded PhD/lecturing position. I\u2019m sure to many of you that sounds mad as these opportunities are so few and far between, but I decided that I had to look after my mental health first, and this institution was active in its dwindling state.\n\nAs a first year PhD student, to be given the responsibility of creating and running a module, and regularly contributing to 3 others (including an MSc course) was far too much. Especially when in a department area different to that of my previous studies.\n\nI am 22. I have no experience in teaching and was overwhelmed, and was told that nothing could be done about the workload due to staff shortages.\n\nSo that\u2019s that, I gave up the PhD dream. Or at least put it on pause.\n\nFuck.",

Having some teaching in a PhD program is great, it gives you experience and training in teaching which is wonderful when you enter the job market after your PhD.

That's close to what I do and I'm a fully salaried lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor).\n\nThis isn't your fault, or your failure - it was a terrible program and you absolutely made the right decision to leave.  This doesn't mean you can't do a PhD - it just means you were in the wrong program to start with.",

But after a lot of reflection and reading about the conditions other scientists go through, I realize that my circumstances were sort of particularly bad and I can't put all the blame on myself (although some should be on me, for sure). To me it sounds like you dont have much cause to blame yourself, you weren't put in a reasonable position at all\n\nIn a way, I still partially feel like I should never have gotten into it, but for different reasons than I used to. Now I think the reason I should have never got into it was \"there isn't much career in it\" instead of \"I'm not good enough\", tbh. Academia is a real shitshow right now",

The second year was the first year I \"taught\", and it was a highly supported, 101-level class, an online, half-semester only section, and I only had 8 students.  I still got weekly support and planning meetings with all the others who were teaching this very intro class and we were all supervised by a tenured prof who led this major. \n\nduring my PhD, I was given a CONTRACT, supplemental to my TA/RA positions, to design a module. I had no real deadline (it was a year to finish), the support and planning of my advisor who began the project, and the entire online learning course design center to get the course up and running, and I got extra pay. And it was a course I had TA'd 3 times already in a face-to-face format.\n\nBasically I teach one face-to-face class a year and RA for an NSF contract the rest of the year.  You had an extreme amount dumped on you, especially as you were supposed to be taking classes too! You made the right call, but please don't think all social science departments are like that. If you want to look into school again later, feel free to PM me and I can tell you about my department/school in more detail. \n\nAlso, for our discipline, we are in the top ten of publications by department per year, so it's not that I'm somewhere known for slacking/not producing scholars.",
