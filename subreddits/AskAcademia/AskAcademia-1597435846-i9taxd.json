All these MDs at your conference are people, too. They are not omnipotent beings! Plus, from what I gather about MDs, many of them are somewhat out-of-touch with cutting edge research (particularly outside their specialty). In other words, in the eyes of many of the MDs there, *you* will be the expert, even if you don't feel like it. If that makes you uncomfortable, personally, I fall back on what I know and try not to speculate on what I do not. \n\nOne of the most eye-opening experiences I have had in grad school was at a conference outside of my major domain of study. I went with my advisor and two other faculty--each are very respected in their domains. During a particular session, I felt like an idiot because I just could NOT understand what was being presented. After the session, all four of us got together and they all felt the same way. The moral of the story being that it's okay not to know everything and everything, there is *always* more to learn. The main purpose for virtually all conferences is to share your knowledge with others. If we already knew everything going it, these conferences would just be an expensive, multi-day happy hour.",

Everyone is nervous and apprehensive before their first (several) conference presentations; I still get so nervous during conference presentations that I talk 8,000 miles a minute.  \n\nImposter syndrome is always going to be there.  I was applying to TT jobs this time last year and reading the admission requirements for the Master's program at a department I was applying to. And I caught myself thinking, \"Oh gosh, I'm not sure I can get into this program...\" and I felt really intimidated for several minutes, until I snapped out of it and realized I already have a masters degree (and a PhD and have done 2 post-docs) and that I was being RIDICULOUS.  It just never goes away! \n\nThe only way to gain experience is by DOING, and that's what I remind myself all the time.  If I let my imposter syndrome get the best of me I won't ever DO anything, and then I really won't have the right experience.

That, combined with finding a group of supportive people so you feel you belong, will be the best two things you can do to address this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first part sounds counterintuitive, but let me explain. Feeling out of place, feeling unsure, and feeling like you're beyond your comfort zone means you're exactly where you should be. You're learning, you're growing, and you're expanding your horizons. You don't want to change any of these things, as you want to learn and improve, but you definitely want to feel less uncomfortable!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally have this feeling all the time. I'm going into my 5th year of grad school, 8th year of doing research, and over 20th year of being an insecure overachiever (the last one is an assumption from a very young age!). The part that changed is not feeling like an impostor, but whether I'm okay with feeling that way. Now I embrace feeling dumb! I put my best foot forwards and focus on learning from the experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelonging helps. I talked about belonging at the beginning, cause it's such a basic need we all have. If you feel like you deserve to be there (because you do), then the rest isn't as much of a problem. Obviously this is a crucially important part, but it gets a lot easier if you find even a few people who value you for who you are. Best of luck.",

A hierarchy exists and there will always be much more smarter people in your group and much more experienced. Every stupid idea that one may come up with will have been thrown to the trash by the much more experienced people in the group and sharing ideas feels a big deal in group meetings as you fear being coming out as utter dumb in front of the biggies.\n\nSo it is natural to doubt your own abilities. But as someone else also commented, you know your work better than anyone. Own it. I always find it easy to convey my work as a story. You may not recognize but always coming out as perfect is not the most ideal way rather research is about learning and storytelling is crucial when presenting your work. The parts you struggled with, how you overcame those, a bit of humor here and there always helps. Of course you need to know about your work but never let that get to your head as if that's the only thing that matters.\n\nOne great thing about discussing your work with others is that may point out something very trivial that you may have missed and help you channelize your work better.",

      "text": "Second year (soon to be third \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31) grad student and I've never felt as stupid and incompetent as I do in the lab :D but it's ok. Grad school is essentially a learning experience. Obviously you'd want at least a publication out of it, but the main thing is developing new practical skills that you can then apply in your future work. So just do what you're doing, don't worry about messing up, keep working and that's all that can be expected from you really. Well done for the conference though, it means you're definitely better than you give yourself credit for :)",

Nothing will both increase and deflate your opinion of other academics like working in academia.\n\n\nI've been in the ivory tower for a dozen years now and I am still amazed by the number of really brilliant people I've worked with over the years and the number of doofuses with doctorates.\n\n\nThe basic rules of society apply, treat everyone with respect and be open to hearing their story. Everyone there has their own journey.",

Pushing forward despite the emotional trauma.  \n\nAs for speaking, if you've done something someone else hasnt done, then you have something to say.  There may or may not be pushback, but saying stuff to other smart people is the job.  No one is gonna beat you up afterwards, so just do the best job you can, sit down, feel like shit, second guess, and repeat until you graduate.\n\nI hate to put it this way, but fuck your feelings.  They're a shit barometer of how you're actually doing.  Unless you get fired, you're doing fine.",
