      "text": "You can submit and write many documents including personal or intent statements, but you cannot generally submit a letter of recommendation or serve as a reference for yourself that is written by you. (And definitely don\u2019t sign someone else\u2019s name to a letter you write without their knowledge as though they had written it.)\n\nAs a previous commenter mentioned, some professors will ask you to list out some important things to highlight which they then use in their letter and sign off on, but if they have told you they don\u2019t have time, I wouldn\u2019t push that. If someone can write a strong and positive letter on your behalf, they will make time to help with this. \n\nConsider which other professors you believe can write in on your behalf. Email or tell them about your new endeavor and how you believe you are well suited for it and how your work, knowledge, or behavior in their class has prepared you for this next step. Then ask if they can write for you.\n\nIf you have to ask \u201chow do they verify the letter\u201d, then whatever you have in mind is probably not a good idea. Your integrity (and the integrity of your work) should be of great importance to you even when you aren\u2019t immediately called out on things. Also, keep in mind that it\u2019s a small word and people know people.\n\nIt sounds like you need to continue to ask around or think of some other options. (Does it need to be from a professor or can it be a college staff member, boss, high school teacher, personal reference, etc.?) \n\nYour college career center or student services offices may have some insight for you to consider.",
