For me, there was also a bit of relief there. Having a paper accepted to a good journal and demonstrating that academic contribution meant I could feel more confident in completing & successfully defending my PhD.\n\nI think like the other posters, since then the 'novelty' has worn off a bit. There's undoubtedly the additional pressure of having published papers as a career metric. But still, despite all of that, it is always a great feeling to get that acceptance email in your inbox!

When you're a PhD student, you're very limited by the structure of the funding and the project and the opinions of your supervisor. Pressure to publish means that you'll have to publish your results as they are, because there's no time for refining and reconsidering them. Papers remain essentially incomplete. And then the funding ends, and that's what left into the scientific record.",

No one really cared, I didn't care for the format of the journal or for some of the edits I was required to make. I was excited to be accepted and to get the galleys, but the moment of truth was just... nothing. I felt the same when I finished my diss, when I defended, when I finished my book manuscript. I always expect I'll feel pride or elation, but it never turns out that way.",

It was like the peal of an angel's voice saying \"distance geometry\" (which was the solution to my problem). That moment of inspiration was so beautiful and exciting. \n\nBut it also made me feel like I had made a contribution to the world. I remember getting on a plane to give a talk at a conference after I had written the paper. And I said to myself \"Well if the plane goes down at least I will have done something positive in the world\" and I was at peace with myself.",

Putting the paper together felt a bit like a heavy shield trial run for my Master's dissertation and I actually really enjoyed it, stopping every now and then to read through and go, \"wow, this is my work!\"\n\nI was thrilled when the paper got accepted (to a very prestigious conference in the subject field) because, although by that time I was leaning more to wanting to do research, I thought that at least if it didn't work out I would have one piece of tangible work I could point to.\n\nThe conference went better than I could have dreamed. My presentation was very well received, I generated lots of useful and thought provoking questions and ended up winning the best in conference award. As a result, I was also published in a journal which publishes the award winners from a selection of related conferences.\n\nThat was last year. I've since got one more publication accepted with a few more ideas brewing and got myself into a working group for a conference in the summer. But for obvious reasons my first time was incredibly rewarding. I don't think I'm going to top it!",
