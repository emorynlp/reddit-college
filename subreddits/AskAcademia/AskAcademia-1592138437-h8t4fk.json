  "title:": "Do you also happen to get sad because you simply will never have enough time to get the knowledge you want to?",
  "text": "I was wondering if other people also get kind of sad because it is simply impossible to have enough time to learn everything you actually wanted to learn by a certain age/stage in life. Like idk, completing that list of books with important authors in your field which gets longer and longer while keeping up with the recent findings in your field. Or learning that additional programming language or further practicing the one your familiar with. Or learning one more additional language. And all of that on top of the workload you already have. \n\nSometimes that makes me really sad because there are just so many things I am interested in and curious about but the more I study the things the longer the list of things I want to learn more about gets. Idk if you can relate but I just wanted to share this and I would be really interested to see what you think about this!",

      "text": "I never thought about it but now that you mentioned it... Yess!!!\n\nIts kind of like when you read a review paper and they cite many other original research papers, and you wanna get through all of them but you dont have the time to do so. \n\nWhen you do attempt to get through them, you find yourself going down a rabbit hole. One paper leads to 10 other papers and each of the 10 papers lead you to another 10 papers... IT NEVER ENDS!! \n\nThen the timer goes off, you gotta run back to the lab to change whatever solution you've got your tissue incubating in. And those papers that you've found will be left as tabs on your browser, never looked at again (but never closed too). Until one day, your computer freezes up and you gotta force shutdown your computer.",

I always end up having dozens of tabs and pdfs open, not having the heart to close any of them, because they're all interesting and I feel like I need to read them! Few days later, laptop freezes, it shuts down. The real dilemma then  becomes: should I 'restore all pages'? Or leave them all behind and start another dreadful cycle?",

There are people who spend life times mastering individual skills and areas of study. The days of being able to know everything about everything that was known died out - literally - thousands of years ago.\n\nSo, you can sit and feel sad about it, or you can accept it and get on with doing what you can do. And - if you want a productive career in academia - that means you also need to give yourself peace and time to develop new knowledge and learn. There are tens of thousands of scientists working in related fields to all of us. Either we can spend our lives reading every minuscule byte of related information, or we can get ourselves to a working knowledge of a niche and try and contribute.\n\nI'm totally accepting and content with the idea that I will never be able to read lots of interesting things. Because the trade off is that I get to do lots of interesting and new things. The idea that you might get sad at not being able to read all the things feels a bit too close to the mentality of wanting to passively learn rather than actively do research (i.e. the step change between undergrad and grad education). Because you could always be reading someone else's work rather than doing your own.",

If they've since moved on in subject matter, they may not remember much of what they wrote.  This is as true for us as it is for them.\n\nSo with that understood, I've come to terms that the project of the the graduate thesis (and by extension academia), is the fine art of IDENTIFYING and WRITING only that which you are able to know.  You can't know everything, so writing around what you know and don't know becomes the skill.\n\nSorta like when I told my gf when she started a new job at a maddeningly byzantine organization: sometimes the meta-job IS the job.",
