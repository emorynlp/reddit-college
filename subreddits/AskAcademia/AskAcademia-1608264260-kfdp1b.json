  "text": "My final exam got messed up and instead of getting my accommodation of \"time and a half\" on a 3 hour exam i got \"half time\"\n\non a 866 point final with 14 problems, I got stopped at 1 hour and 30 minutes. I notified the Prof who told me to just log back in and finish the text. It began an \"attempt 2\" where he said to just do the ones I missed the first time around. My first score for 9/14 was around 530 points give or take. \n\nThe grade he presented with was the 53(4?) plus what he implied was an obvious 54 points from my second attempt. That seems bonkers low and I really want to see the graded exam so I know how and where I messed up.\n\nwhat reason would he have for refusing to let me see? after all, he is the one who fucked up my disability accommodations. Does the grading confuse anyone else?",

If there are students who have yet to take this exam, I can understand why the prof won\u2019t let you see it yet. It\u2019s not unusual to make a graded exam available after finals are finished.

Maybe he can just tell you what questions were wrong without showing you the exam?",

      "text": "I don't really have a comment on your main question but grading system is not necessarily bad. People for some reason expect 100 points on every exam. It is just harder to grade when the numbers of points for each question are small; not enough room for fine partial grading. Of course, I can just as easily use non-integers etc, when I had more energy for grading, I used to do that (I remember using pi, e etc. in my grading, lol) but not anymore. Another alternative is to make the total points in an exam equal to its weight in the course, so if the exam is worth 25 percent of the total grade, it would have 25 points. This is obviously harder for the grader for the reasons above but students understand the scale of things better in this way I think. In fact, another reason to have hundreds of points is that students complain less. Like if a student gets 40 out of 100, they will complain. If they get 100 out of 250, they won't, even tho they are the exact same grade. (I just finished grading 100+ finals so apparently that's all I can talk about for the next few days.)",

Each semester I change what I want to ask and it\u2019s hella lot easier to just assign points as I make questions then add up the points. If a student gets - 25/50 I do scale it for them to 10/20.

Some courses have opted to hold dedicated virtual office hours to go over the material on the exams, and so students can only see the test/quiz answers during that time (e.g., screen sharing from the TAs computer). What I liked the most - though not all faculty are comfortable with this - is uploading a document with the answers that is locked after a certain time window. Even if students download it, the document is not able to be viewed. There are adobe settings that made this option work really well for an intro class with 750+ students, which made scheduling dedicated office hours tough, since there were only 2 TAs. But this still required a level of trust with students, but at the end of the day, we\u2019ve taken the approach that we are all struggling during these unprecedented times and it\u2019s better to show compassion. Students want to - and need to - be able to see where they went wrong so that they can learn. So even though class-wide policies vary, our department is very much of the opinion that students need to have access to their exams, especially should they request it.",

In the case of my classes, we have virtual office hours where I put the exam up near the camera, then I walk them through what went wrong/how to improve.

Rather than receiving my time-and-a-half accommodation, the professor only gave me half the normal allotted time. When I brought this up, he simply had me log back into the exam and take it two more times as a way to try to give me the full time. I was supposed to only do the questions I hadn\u2019t done already. I tried to do this, but I really struggled with it and I don\u2019t believe my accommodation was fairly met. I wasted time trying to identify which questions I\u2019d already answered, and the additional hassle really stressed me out and reduced my ability to focus.\n\nMy final grade for the exam is confusing to me. Apparently I got a perfect score on the first attempt, and got very few correct points on the later attempts. This indicates to me that I was doing well until the formatting threw me off, and it makes me think that the assessment format (and lack of accommodation) influenced my grade negatively. I\u2019ve tried speaking with the professor to get some clarification on the grade, but I\u2019ve been able to successfully do so.\n\nCould you please give me advice about how to handle this situation? I\u2019d be more than happy to retake a second version of the exam with the correct accommodations, but I\u2019d also like to defer to your input about whether or not my accommodation was appropriately met. Any input would be appreciated!\n\nThanks,\nX\u201d\n\nHonestly, this is something that they should take over. It sounds like a severe enough violation of your accommodation that they\u2019d tell the professor to give you a make-up of some sort, and at that point the professor couldn\u2019t decline. Mistakes happen\u2014I know I\u2019ve forgotten to give an accommodation once or twice before\u2014but the remedy needs to either level the playing field or even default a little bit in your favor. You should never be punished because of a lack of an appropriate accommodation. But that office can handle this better than you can, and they can make demands of the professor that you can\u2019t make, so I\u2019d let them handle it.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d make sure you answer any questions that they ask you, but keep in mind your professor may see all these emails so don\u2019t say anything exaggerated, inaccurate, or less than complimentary. Do your best to always portray it as a mistake, not as anything else.",

But also the ombudsperson, your dorm head, the academic dean, any disability officer you know of, etc. I would be careful not to throw this on the professor as an intentional mistake. The school will most likely side with the prof.

(you're leaving a lot out, here...)\n\nOther people who say \"talk to the accommodations person\" or talk to the omsbudsman\" are missing the crucial first step.  Tackle this with the professor FIRST.  \n\nFrom a professor's standpoint, there are two issues:\n\n1) Who screwed up?  One of two things happened:  either you screwed up (by signing in wrong, following incorrect instructions, etc.) or she/he/they screwed up (set the exam-time incorrectly... VERY easy to do on Canvas or Blackboard or whatever system you used.)\n\nDon't assume it was the professor.  It might have been you.  Your job is to write a full, careful account of what happened.  Note:  a \"yo, prof, the exam done messed up, that's not fair!\" doesn't cut it here.  You need a full detailed explanation about how you logged in, what you did, what you expected, what it cost you (in terms of time, focus, and concentration), and then ask for suggestions on what, if anything, might be done.\n\n2)  What to do about it?   Clearly, your whole exam is messed up.  (multiple attempts, etc.) \nMost professors would get exhausted just thinking about this problem... and he/she/they have 400 other students to get final grades into the system for.  You are going to be LAST priority over those 400 other students, because you present a problem. \n\nGive the professor time, but be in full communication...  ask them to fill you in on what can be done once they have the time.",

But if I miss that deadline for 200 kids, that's two *hundred* grade changes.  And my department secretary and the Registrar and the Dean all yelling at me.  not good. \n\nSo, in this case, complicated issues--\"squeaky wheels\"--go last.  Indeed, I might even just throw down a 'placeholder' grade for them, just to get something in the system, and worry about what actually happened later.",

Or, if changing grades is not terribly difficult, then the professor can offer a new exam after the rest of the grades turned in. \n\nI'm not sure that most people realize what a big deal it is if the professor misses the grade deadline.

      "text": "The appropriate order of contact is: 1. the professor, 2. the chairperson of the department, 3. the dean of the school, 4. the VPAA, each contacted if you don't get an appropriate answer from the previous person. I would contact the disability services person with a copy of the email to the chair so that they're in the loop. If you don't get an appropriate answer from the chair, then I'd contact the disability services person separately. They will have their own processes to follow.\n\nAnd, surely you know not to use \"fucked up\" in any of your professional communications and, quite frankly, don't blame the professor for messing up your disability accommodations since EVERYBODY knows already that he is the one who set the time parameters and didn't do it correctly. Only if it gets to the level of the VPAA would I point that out. \n\nOne thing you could do is consider to what extent a mistake with the fix of your accommodation being to just start again with the questions that you hadn't done might have messed you up. You say it did in answer to somebody's post. If you really think it did mess you up you could argue for a whole new final exam, particularly if your accommodation involves anxiety. That would certainly not make the professor happy and I wouldn't suggest saying that unless/until you get to the chair level. I was a chair and if one of my faculty had done this I would have sat with him/her and asked what could we do to make it completely fair for the messed-up student given the accommodations. There are several possibilities and one is a complete redo.\n\nBy the way, the numbers are fine. Faculty do that for a variety of reasons, including making their grading non-obvious to students or a belief that a given problem is worth 50 points while another is worth 54 points, and so on. I think that belief is likely magical thinking, but faculty are free to do so if they'd like. The numbers available on the exam are not likely to be a topic of conversation between the faculty member and higher-ups if this goes up.",
