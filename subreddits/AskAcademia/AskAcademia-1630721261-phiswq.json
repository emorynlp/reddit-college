  "title:": "Turned down a job offer and received the rudest email\u2026 any thoughts on how tor respond",
  "text": "I applied for a PART TIME job as a program coordinator for a scholarship program at a local college here. I was told on the second interview that it was an in person requirement\u2026 nowhere on the job posting does it say that. When I was offered the position I politely declined the position due to the requirements. For reference I am 25F. I received this private response from someone on the hiring committee :\n\n\u201cAllow me to say that this is very bad form. This job was presented as in-person from the beginning. Frankly, you should not have participated in this process and led people to believe you would accept it if chosen. I\u2019ve been managing people for 50 years and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this kind of thing \u2026\u201d\n\nThis man is 60+.\n\nI am so upset and disgusted. Is there anything I can do to report this??? I am literally at a loss for words. Could I forward it to the rest of the hiring committee and mention how inappropriate this is?? Under no circumstances did I say I was going to accept the job.\n\nUpdate: I want to thank everyone who weighed in. Ultimately, I will be doing nothing (as I knew I would). I do not wish to burn bridges. While I found the email inappropriate and offensive, ultimately I do not believe it will make much of a difference in the long run.\n\nWhat I was maybe more in search of was additional confirmation that the email I was sent was impolite and out of line. The majority of you confirmed this. Some of you made it  clearer why someone would feel okay sending an email like this. \n\nUltimately it is a learning experience and one I will appreciate as I go forward.\n\nI live in a place where we have been remote working for the majority of the pandemic.\nMost of our schools are still hybrid or completely remote. As a result, non-essential staff whose role can be performed from home are remote working still. In fact, most of my interviews were conducted by staff in their own apartments.",

They can call other applicants and say actually, the position's reopened and we'd like you interview you after all (also very common).\n\nAbsolutely none of this places any obligation on the applicant to accept a particular offer and it's weird to assume that someone will definitely accept an offer and have no backup plan for how to fill the position if they don't - what if OP had already accepted a better full-time job offer?",

A candidate assuming a job is remote and never bothering to clarify in the first interview on the otherhand is just wasting both the candidate's and the company's time. *Especially* in a pandemic like this, asking what percentage of the job is remote was one of the first questions I would ask.\n\nAgain, the hirer isn't the only one affected by this. The other applicants are really my only concern since one of them likely wasn't invited to move onto the second round. Having just gone through a year of unemployment until finally landing a job fairly recently, this is *highly* irritating.\n\n\nDelaying notice to the other applicants is an absolutely horrible practice. By the time OP had their second round interview, its probably been more than 2-3 weeks since the first interview. In my experience, I would have recieved notice long before then except in the situations where I was completely ghosted. I also have my doubts that an organization would contact the cut candidates with egg in their face and say \"hey actually you *did* make the cut, whoops our mistake.\"",

And I've been contacted to potentially reinterview for jobs I was rejected from when they ended up reopening them. This also happens a lot.\n\nYeah, OP should have clarified more in the interview process and that's an oversight, but the hirer still needs to be prepared for someone to reject an offer for any reason, good or bad, and it's pretty nuts to send a cranky email suggesting that no one ~ever~ turns down a job offer. I don't really think the behavior of other applicants is what makes the application and hiring process so miserable.",

People are allowed to send grumpy letters.  It is legal to ruffle feathers and be impolite and even to tell people off.  He's annoyed you wasted his time.  His best move would be to let it go and be a bit more professional, but at the same time, it's not a requirement that he be nice to you.  After all, you dont work for that institution!  He is not your boss and is in no position of authority over you by your own decision.  He's just some guy now.\n\nLook, you're young and this got under your skin which is understandable, but the working world is not always an ideal place where you can appeal to a perfect authority and have justice served.  The person you would 'report' him to would go down the hall and say \"Hank, that woman complained about that email you sent\" and he'd say \"So?\" and that guy would go \"sigh, I just thought you should know, maybe dont do that\"  and he'll go \"whatever\".  \n\nTake this as a chance to take a deep breath, relax, know that you'll never have to deal with this guy again, and grow a slightly thicker skin.  Dont let him live rent free in your head.  \n\nIt's ok to have an emotional reaction to this, it was unpleasant.  But what professionalism is is keeping those emotions in check and making smart plays that benefit you and further your reputation while developing habits that will serve you.  Ask yourself, if you 'report' him, what is in it for you other than some nebulous sense of catharsis?  Will the person you report it to be an ally who may want to work with you someday?  Or might they remember you for being someone that dragged them into some nothing drama? Considering all he did was write a letter expressing his displeasure at your decision, there is nothing really actionable here, so you arnt saving anyone else in the future either.

If you found out during the second interview that you had to actually go to the job you were applying for and that didn\u2019t work for you, you should have said it right then and there that you wouldn\u2019t take the job. You wasted their time by not being upfront. I think you know this and are looking for a reason to be mad so you can convince yourself that you\u2019re not the one at fault here.\n\nNow, bring on the hate from all you touchy, feely idiots.

It\u2019s common advice to tell people that they\u2019re interviewing the job, too, to determine a good fit. That\u2019s what the interview is for - you gather more info and if you don\u2019t like the benefits or the company culture, or the job duties sound a little different than what you\u2019d thought, you keep looking. And it\u2019s standard practice to apply for multiple jobs at once and take the best offer you get, which means you\u2019ll be turning some down. I agree she shouldn\u2019t have ASSUMED it\u2019s remote even in COVID times, but she\u2019s free to decline their offer for just about any reason.",

The working world is full of people who are just not nice and it's not illegal for them to be pricks.  It's a sign of youth to get so worked up by an email like \n that that has no impact on your life.  He cant fire you, retalliate against you, block your promotions, offer quid pro quo or anything because you dont work for him.   He didnt actually cause you any tangible injury and 'reporting' him is putting that on the same level as a secretary who is fully employed and being grabbed at and degraded by a boss who can ruin her life.  Or the whistle blower who sees a company defrauding a client.  You did not experience anything even remotely on that level.  It's a bitchy email.  Delete and move on.",
