      "text": "Check your constitution and bylaws for:\n\n1. What it says about a vote of no confidence (probably nothing).\n2. Make sure you understand the authority the bylaws give the voting body over the position (probably none, in this case).\n3. Confirm what your parlamentary authority is (it's probably the current edition of Roberts Rules of Order, Newly Revised). Get a copy of that book and see if there is anything specified about a vote of no confidence (probably not. It definitely isn't in Roberts Rules).\n\nIf my assumptions above are correct, then all it will amount to is just putting the opinion of the group on record, but without any specific action taken. \n\nHonestly, votes of no confidence are rarely a good idea for a university faculty to take. There are much more effective ways to achieve the same goals.",

One of those calls for a no confidence vote. The other doesn't, but it can seem like it in the heat of the moment.",
