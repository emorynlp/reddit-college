  "text": "Seriously considering getting a second master's degree (MA Communication) because of genuine interest in the field and for wider career options.\n\nI have a master's in a related field: library and info studies.\n\nI am thinking if this is a good idea? What potential opportunities career-wise could an additional MA in Comm lead to?\n\nCurrently working in academia so going straight to a PhD in Information/LIS is an option too; but I am more inclined to go that route after MA in Comm.",

Things like small group decision making (I know people who research engineering design teams), diffusion of innovations (how do organizations communicate to get people on board with new technologies), science communication (how do we communicate complicated ideas to a non-technical audience)? \n\nCommunication is kind of unusual this way, but I know a lot of people who didn't start out in comm, but got here somehow and found ways to apply communication theories and research to the technical context they were already familiar with.",

Though, I think (a formal education in) communications isn\u2019t as valued in industry as engineering, so I\u2019m still a bit surprised just in terms of career prospects\u2026 But the prospects for PhDs in even very academic fields is way better in industry than for lower degrees.
