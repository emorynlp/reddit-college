  "text": "...and who take time out of your incredibly busy schedules to come answer the same questions you've probably seen a million times, and advise us clueless students and academia young'uns. You all are doing a great service.\n\nThis process of applying to grad school and making a career in academia, especially as a clueless international, can feel like such a raging shitshow of complexity at times, and you all make me feel there are compassionate, complex humans behind the process, and not just scary gatekeeping gargoyles. I probably wouldn't be applying, and wouldn't even think I was eligible to continue to academia, if it weren't for some of the advice I've gotten on here.\n\nMay you get ALL the appreciation and all the karma and all the other good stuff, and I wish you a good Thanksgiving (or Thursday or whatever it is where you are).",
