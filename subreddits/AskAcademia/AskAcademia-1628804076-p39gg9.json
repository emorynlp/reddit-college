  "text": "Hello! I am teaching a new kinesiology graduate course entitled Critical Analysis of Research this upcoming fall and was wondering if anyone had any good reading recommendations that helps students develop a more critical mindset in academia? In similar courses that I have taught before, I have discussed Teixeira da Silva & Dobranski's (2017) Compounding Error: The Afterlife of Bad Science and similar articles, but I am sure there is a lot of good resources out there that I'm not yet familiar with. Thank you!",
