  "title:": "Didn't get an authors approval of a manuscript - how big a deal is this?",
  "text": "I am in the process of submitting a revision for work I did while in undergrad. The whole time I was writing the paper I was mainly corresponding with my PI. I did send an early draft to the rest of the authors (who were involved with creating the dataset I used, but that don't know who I am), one of whom gave feedback and the rest didn't. From that point on, I just assumed that my PI knew I was only sending drafts to her. When I originally submitted the manuscript a confirmation email went out to all the authors, so they all know about the submission, but I never emailed the final draft for approval before submitting. Now, just before submitting the revision, my PI goes \"just to confirm, so and so saw and signed off on the original submission, correct?\" I don't know if I'm catastrophizing, but I feel like I really screwed up. Is this a big academia faux pas?? I have no idea why she's only asking about the one author. It doesn't help that I'm not even apart of the lab anymore so the communication is not the best. Any advice is welcome.",

Just apologise and make sure everyone is happy moving forward. \n\nIf you've not submitted the revisions yet, I would delay it for a week and give people time to comment.",

      "text": "She probably only mentioned that one author because they said something to her about it, or asked a question about it.\n\nIt's a pretty big faux pas (in my field at least), but also it was her job to guide your through the process, including the step where you get the final sign-off from all authors. It's understandable that she forgot to tell you that detail, and it's also understandable that you didn't think to do it (especially if you've never been on anyone else's papers and seen them do that).\n\nYou should tell her clearly what you did (and didn't) do, so she can do a good job answering questions from the other authors. She might be frustrated or a little angry at the error, but if she's a good mentor, she will not take that out on you. Similar things happened with me and my PhD supervisor, and the sequence of events usually went like this:\n\n1. I explain what happened, he tells me I messed up, he acknowledges that he too messed up. In this conversation he is pretty clearly frustrated and holding it in, but he doesn't yell at me or say anything mean or say anything like \"you should have known\". I am not thick-skinned, so I would feel a bit scared during this (and I'm sure he could tell), and I would feel like crying but I wouldn't.\n\n2. We continue our regular meeting schedule (no avoidance). In our next meeting, he would apologize for being frustrated, and reiterate that it was his fault for not clearly explaining to me what I should do. Sometimes he'll give some constructive criticism like, \"next time, if you notice this thing, just write to me right away...\"\n\n3. In all subsequent meetings, he totally frames the error as 100% his fault. It's clear that he's written the incident in his memory that way.\n\nIn my opinion this was a pretty good way to handle it, and if a supervisor expresses any more anger than I described above in item 1 then I would have a low opinion of their mentoring ability (that would be kind of toxic).",
