  "title:": "Are there benefits to accepting a Research Assistant position?",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I recently left a job where I was a junior lecturer. I'm 25 (f) and not in my doctoral program yet, but despite this I got a lot of 'wiggle room' in my role as a junior lecturer- I got to design and teach my own undergraduate course in my discipline and was able to teach first-year master students as well (again in my area of interest which is African gender studies). \n\nI recently got offered a research assistant position to someone who is an extremely high profile academic in my field of study. I am very excited but also a little hesitant because the position would involve a whole lot of admin work (like a lot ). I was wondering about people's experiences as research assistants before pursuing their PhD. How well did being an RA prepare you for a doctoral position, if at all? How does it read on an academic CV? \n\nI also got an offer to lecture full time in a masters program around African Studies and Global health, which I have not yet declined. To be able to fully make an informed decision, I just wanted to hear some experiences from others :) \n\nThanks a lot!",

      "text": "\"Research assistant\" is not some kind of standardised position - it can be almost anything: a glorified admin, a random group minion, a lab technician, a programmer or data analyst, a PhD student's stipend, or even a junior postdoc.  \n\nYou're asking very sensible questions, but no one here can give a reliably meaningful answer without an actual job description.  \n\nAs for your CV, again, it doesn't mean anything on its own.  What matters is whether the specific skills, experience, and  professional network that you gain there will make you a stronger candidate for whatever you're applying for.  You'll need to consider what your weaknesses are as a PhD applicant and evaluate whether this particular job will help boost your credentials in those areas.",

      "text": "I'm doing a PhD in a fairly highly ranked Australian university so I can only speak from my specific experience, but I would be thinking about the research output you could demonstrate via the RA job. Will you be an author on papers? Ideally first author on at least one, but I know that might be unrealistic. \n\nBeing an author alongside a highly influential researcher means you are likely to get a relatively high number of citations for your field and level of experience, which in my realm is very desirable.\n\nAnother good thing for an academic CV is to be listed on grants.\n\nI too would be hesitant about the amount of admin work. In my experience RA positions are VERY easy to exploit. I've seen highly competent, eager people who struggle to say \"no\" and set boundaries pushed to burn-out because they end up doing several people's jobs. Again, just my experience.\n\nPersonally I might not mind grunt work if there was a payoff in the form of publications.",

              "text": "Given your other comments about not being accepted in a PhD program, I think that training and database stuff will definitely be handy! \n\nIn my experience being accepted into a PhD isn't the hard part, it's gaining a scholarship/grant so you can be paid while you do it. Here people straight out of undergrad need good grades in the very least, but across the board the more research skills you can demonstrate the better. It sounds like an RA position alongside an influential academic will go a long way toward that goal which is great. I brought up publication because papers are a concrete example of your skills AND there's that pesky publish or perish mentality out there. \n\nAt the end of the day you need to convince the people paying you to do your PhD (or maybe the people giving an opportunity for a PhD regardless of pay, again just my experience) that you are a worthy investment, where the payoff they want in the end is to elevate their academic image.",

But I do know some fields often have papers with very few listed authors so maybe they work differently. I'm in psychology and as long as someone makes a contribution to the idea, data collection, analysis, writing, and/or editing of a paper then they can generally be authors. A good lab should have a predetermined set of criteria for what constitutes authorship, for fairness.",

I learned a lot about how real professors do research, I got paid, and I got to show the professors that I could do it myself. The latter pays off in spades when you later need letters of recommendation (which you will, for fellowships, for jobs, etc.) \u2014 it's a chance to show a professor what you are capable of, above and beyond what they'll see in a class.  It also teaches you a lot about how universities work (and don't), and also teaches you a lot about how to manage researchers working for you in the future (and how not to). \n\nNot saying that every RA position is equal, but it's definitely useful if you are planning to go onto a career in academia. I know in my case my performance as an RA was way more impactful on my advisors' understanding of me than my performance in classes was. Everybody can be sort of OK in classes in grad school, but I was able to gain a reputation as an excellent and dedicated researcher, and that made a huge difference.",

If you know that's what you're getting into then you know what to expect. It kind of doesn't matter what is \"standard\" if the PI is being very clear about what they need and is letting OP decide if it suits their interests.\n\nFor what it's worth I know plenty of RA's & lab managers who were hired to admin heavy positions in social science labs.",

If not, I would jump at this chance regardless of whether you'll be a coauthor on research. In economics at least doing a high-profile RA position is super helpful for doing a PhD at a top program. \n\nIf you're already accepted, the benefit is a lower but I'd still do it. You're going to learn a lot from this person just from talking. This will read as much more impressive on your CV than the lecturer position you're also offered, even if admin work is not that exciting.\n\nLast question: is there any way to discretely ask around to see if this professor is a decent human being? If they're a jerk this opportunity sounds much less appealing.",

      "text": "Business PhD student here, so take this with a grain of salt. I was a research assistant during my Master's program just to get some exposure to research before applying for a PhD. In my field, it is the norm for PhD applicants to not have any research experience, although most fields I believe are the opposite. \n\nThat being said, my experience as an RA ended up being the strongest point of my CV for a few reasons:\n\n1. I RA-ed for a well known professor in my field, who later wrote an amazing letter of recommendation for me. Although I obviously haven't seen the letter, it was mentioned to me multiple times during interviews that my interviewers knew that professor personally and were very excited to interview someone with his recommendation. \n2. If you do any research work at all, you will likely be working on a paper that is co-authored with someone else (hopefully someone at a different institution). If you can connect to them while you're RA-ing, it will make a world of a difference if you end up applying to their institution. I personally didn't get to interact with any of my professor's co-authors. However, it was very helpful when applying to a certain university to be able to say \"I've already worked on a paper written by a professor at your institution.\" (also makes a great talking point during interviews!)\n3. This may be field-specific because of what I mentioned earlier, but getting a PhD is a huge commitment for both you and for your university. They invest a lot of time, money, and effort into you and don't want it to go to waste if you drop out. This is especially important in my field because many applicants haven't even touched research before and therefore might be unprepared for academia. RA-ing shows that you have had some experience with research, have exposure to the world of academia, and have a better grasp of what being a PhD and later being a professor will be like. All of that means that you are less likely to drop out halfway through because it wasn't what you expected or wasn't for you.\n\nOther pros: It is also a great interview topic and if you can be an author on papers, it will boost your CV. Hope this helps! Good luck!",

The job involved a LOT of admin work, but in exchange, I got to work on my own research project (which I presented at a poster), and a research story that I can talk about in my graduate school applications that demonstrates my ability to apply my academic interests to a research question. I also got to go to talks at the institution and explored the field I was interested in. \n\nThe administrative experience was not fun. It was thankless and tedious, but it it gave me the perspective of what is needed to run a laboratory and the skills to balance a research calendar in addition to supporting the research goals of others.\n\nI'm applying to grad school in a related field, I was able to demonstrate my research skills. I was delayed by the pandemic and my personal medical rollercoaster so I can't say how successful it is in academia but I do feel like it was a worthwhile experience that gave me opportunities in academia (which were only hindered by a weird turn of events).\n\nThe quality of the job was shaped by the lab culture and the PI's experience and investments in his mentees. It has helped me get both research and agriculture jobs too.\n\nI would do it again both for experience and networking/support within the field.",
