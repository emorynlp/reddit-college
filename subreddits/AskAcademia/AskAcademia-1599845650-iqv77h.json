The idea that the \"best\" candidate will actually be the one who performs the best is pretty shaky.\n\nOf course, the odds aren't necessarily good that a \"lesser\" candidate will perform better either. Rather, it's just a very, very noisy process.

          "text": "I think fair is an unattainable attribute of admissions in the first place. Is the current system fair? No, not in the slightest. Underrepresented minorities are underrepresented at every stage, including in admissions, grants and journal committees. When we bring up the argument that we might have to discriminate against over-represented candidates, there's this implication that the current system is a fair and level playing field, and that tilting it towards underrepresented minorities is making it unfair. I don't believe that's true.\n\nOne could argue that oh, well there are candidates with objectively better backgrounds. But backgrounds are not objective. A white man born to an upper middle class family^1 has specific economic and social advantages that help him build a better background. He can afford to take unpaid research positions. He comes from a similar social background to many of his professors and can navigate the norms and customs with ease. He can use familial contacts when needed.\n\nThis is why undergrad admissions is not just a straight ranking of credentials and grades. We'd only get the students who can afford better credentials, who can afford private tutors and good schools.\n\nBut this could be done earlier no? This isn't an issue with our admissions, it's a pipeline issue, right? The problem with that argument is that it's inductive. Every stage can argue it's a pipeline issue. We can't hire underrepresented professors because it's a pipeline issue. We can't hire underrepresented post-docs because it's a pipeline issue. We can't accept underrepresented grad students because it's a pipeline issue. Of course we should do a lot of work at the early stages to help underrepresented minorities, but that doesn't mean the buck should be passed along. Later stages should acknowledge that credentials are subjective and that taking the risk on someone who may not have a stellar background can pay off.\n\n1: I make this distinction because at this point, white working class people are underrepresented in academia as well. However, there are disproportionately more black working class per capita, due to the massive wealth gap between black and white Americans.",

      "text": "The elephant in the room here is that a small number of hyperwealthy institutions, like Stanford, gobble up the lion's share of research funding and talent. There's a tremendous emphasis in the USA on a few elite universities and getting a tiny number of scholars, underpresented or otherwise, into them. The ad says the PI wants to increase diversity and equality in the health sciences. Gestures like this may appear noble - but they are ultimately self serving and help to perpetuate inequality (to be clear I'm not criticising the PIs intentions, I'm sure they are noble). However the subtext here is that by applying somewhere else applicants are not contributing to the field. Bear in mind we're talking people with PhDs looking for jobs in health and data science - smart motivated people who are already kicking the system in the ass. The tacit implication, and the entire mindset, is that wherever they \\*were\\* planning to apply and build a career - \\*Stanford is better and they're better off joining in\\*. I can't be the only one who believes this sort of thinking is actually patronising and part of the problem - however well intentioned?",
