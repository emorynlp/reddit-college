  "title:": "[Wrong Answers Only] What personal website to link to your department profile?",
  "text": "My department gives us the option to add a personal website to our profile pages. Someone used to put a link to her online store there, and I thought it was both hilarious and awesome! I mean, the university has been exploiting our cheap labor, we might as well take advantage of their free advertising platform while we can! ;)\n\nObviously I'm just indulging in some crazy fantasies here, but what else could we link to our department profiles? Instagram? A YouTube channel? A GoFundMe page for a \"feed a poor grad student\" fundraiser? Only Fans? ... I can't stop laughing at the idea of this last one hahaha",

We laughed about it for a while but did eventually tell the department, who took MONTHS to fix it. Retrospectively should have just told the prof, he probably would have been much more motivated to get that fixed.",

          "text": "If it was a real porn site then it probably wasn't a bitter student, but the professor probably forgot to renew the domain name. Porn sites snap up unrenewed domain names because they can have pretty high PageRank (because a lot of other sites link to them, which is especially the case for professor websites, which are linked to from \"well-respected\" sites like universities) and so come up in Google pretty well. I had this happen with a site I helped a professor with; if the person they had in charge of renewing it changes jobs and the university changes the P-Card number (which happens periodically to avoid fraud), two years later or whenever it is they will miss the renewal e-mail.",
