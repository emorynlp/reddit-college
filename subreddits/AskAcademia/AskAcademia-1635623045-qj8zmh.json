  "text": "Hi all,\nI recently completed my research based masters in computer vision and currently working in a company as a computer vision researcher. My current role requires a lot of paper reading to improve the existing models. I really like doing research and am satisfied with my current role. I have the following questions \n1. If I decide to pursue a phd, I will not be able to save money for next 3 to 4 years. Which is better 4 years of PhD or 4 years of research job experience?\n2. My long term goal is to get a job in big companies like google and Facebook. Most of the computer vision roles in big companies require a phd with multiple publications. Can i join such companies without a phd?\n3. My company encourages publishing papers. Let\u2019s say if I publish some papers in next three to four years, would that help me in competing with phd degree holders? Or I would still need an official degree?\n4. How hard is to get admission in a good uni after some years of research experience with no publication record?\n\nI would be thankful if someone could comment on my questions.",

      "text": "If your goal is to do research, then you will need a PhD. You won't be taken seriously otherwise.\n\nIf you take a break from academia, whether by choice or by misfortune, you will find it hard to get back in.\n\nAlso once your life gets complicated, with family, or any kind of debt to repay, then spending a few years below the poverty line won't really be an option. So if you want to do this for the sake of employment, do it now.\n\nIf you want to do it as a personal achievement, I've seen people do it during their retirement. When the money isn't such an issue, when they have a supportive and secure home life.",

      "text": "1. Which country are you planning on doing your Ph.D. from? In the US, a Ph.D. is > 5 years at least. The main question though isn't the lost salary for the 5-6 years. That's an important factor of course, but an important \"feature\" of Ph.D. is that you're essentially locked into your program until you finish. You can't switch universities, you can't (at least not easily), be like, hey I'm going to take a year break. \n2. You can definitely get *a job* at FAANG companies without a Ph.D. but you'd find it hard to compete with those with a Ph.D. for research-based roles.\n3. Not sure about this one. It definitely will help, but it might not help enough to push you over the finish line. The thing is that there are enough awesome folks who want to work for these companies, who have a Ph.D. \n4. It depends on the program, but I suspect you'd find it relatively easy with an otherwise good CV and good letters.\n\nJust my two cents.",
