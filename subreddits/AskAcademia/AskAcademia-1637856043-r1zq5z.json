  "title:": "No recommendation letter from my postdoc advisor",
  "text": "I am in STEM and will be applying to faculty (US) positions this cycle. However, I do not want to get a letter of recommendation from my post-doc advisor and I am afraid that this will be a red flag...\n\nThe reason is that he was extremely discriminatory towards female students in the group, after which we contacted the department's diversity office (3 female students in total). The department took this very seriously and told us they would talk to him. A short time later, the students were transferred to other groups and the professor moved to another university (I am not sure whether his departure is related to our case).\n\nDuring my postdoc, my advisor was always threatening people with negative letters of recommendation (e.g., \"if you go to this internship instead of working at the lab during summer, I will write you a negative letter of recommendation\"). And after we talked to the department, he made some comments suggesting that he knows I was one of the people involved in the case (and honestly, it's impossible that he does not know, because the department wanted specific examples from us so they could talk to him and correct his behavior with concrete examples).\n\nSo I feel like he will want to get even, and given his past of threatening others with negative letters, I am sure he will do the same to me. On the other hand, if I do not get a letter of recommendation from him, what would the schools I apply to think of me?\n\nI talked to the diversity office, and the head of the department decided to write me a letter of reference instead. But I am afraid it will be a standard reference letter and will not make much difference since I have not worked with him.\n\nWhat should I do? I do not think I can explain this situation in my applications as it would sound weird, but I feel that without a letter from my postdoc advisor I have no chance as people will wonder why.\n\nOn the other hand, I do not think I can ask the department head to explain this situation in his letter as it would sound strange as well...\n\nIs there anything I can do or should I just submit my application without his letter and hope that the people reviewing my applications will not notice that I do not have a letter from him?",

      "text": "Unfortunately it will be noticed and will be considered a concern. Even so, I wouldn't risk a letter from your advisor. The best option is to get the letter from you department head. They might be able to say something to smooth things over. Talk to them about it and see what they say. Like maybe they could say, \"Due to certain circumstances, I am writing letters of rec for all of Prof. X's students.\" It implies there is a problem w Prof X, and that it's not something specific to you. Or, perhaps a little stronger..  \"Due to the recent departure of Prof X and and the best interests of our department, I am writing letters of rec for all of Prof X's students.\" \n\nAlso talk to your PhD advisor. In some cases they can call people at schools you apply to and help alleviate any concerns. \n\nI would not try to explain it in your apps. There is a high risk that you will be viewed as a trouble maker. Don't complain or discuss it at your interviews either. If they ask, keep it vague. If they really press you for info, keep to basic facts -i.e. there were some complaints, the department looked into it, and Prof X ended up leaving.",

      "text": "You or the department head must explain the situation. Otherwise, it does look bad for you. It can be explained in a way that doesn\u2019t make you look bad and ideally the department head would do it, but they are limited in what they can say about the faculty member, while you are not.\n\nI\u2019m a former university Vice President and if you want an example of some effective language  to address this, I would be happy to draft a few sentences for you (or review any that you have written), but I am in the middle of preparing for Thanksgiving. If you send me a message, I will respond later today or tomorrow.\n\nFYI, I think the best approach is to concisely describe the circumstances of the faculty member\u2019s behavior, threats, and departure (including the department head\u2019s decision to write letters in his place), in generic terms, i.e., as applying to his female students as a group rather than to you specifically, without saying anything specifically about yourself or even using \u201cwe\u201d.",

      "text": "I am so sorry that this happened to you.  I agree that it is not ideal.  From the perspective of the hiring committee, the lack of postdoctoral advisor letter will likely be seen as problematic.  I agree with the other poster that it may be good to explain what happened (possibly through the department chair; something like 'Title IX Investigation pending' would probably do the job).  \n\nI am currently a pre-tenure STEM faculty member.  I think for those of us who are under-represented in STEM, it is \\*extremely important\\* to vet potential advisors/mentors to ensure that we're not jumping into the boiler, so to speak.  One way to do this is to make sure (if they're fairly senior and have advised a lot of people) that they have successfully mentored other underrepresented folks, and that these folks are relatively happy with the way they were mentored.  This means talking to past (and current) members of the group.  I know many of us don't do this when we're looking for graduate advisors (we literally don't know any better, which is another topic/issue), but it is essential when looking for a postdoctoral position.  \n\nI wish you the best with this difficult situation.  It's not an easy one.  I knew folks for whom this happened with their graduate advisors.  As soon as they stopped getting reference letters from their grad advisors, the interview requests started pouring in.  This is one of the (many) reasons why the STEM pipeline is 'leaky'.",

      "text": "I know you're worried it would be weird if the department head addressed this in his letter for you, but please know that that's actually the norm in situations like this (in my field, anyway). It would not be weird.\n\nIt would be good to have a candid conversation with the department head so he can advise you on how to address this situation in your interviews if it comes up. All the advice you've gotten here is great, but nothing beats the view of an experienced person who is aware of the norms of your field. That conversation will let you get on the same page about how he plans to write your letter, too.",
