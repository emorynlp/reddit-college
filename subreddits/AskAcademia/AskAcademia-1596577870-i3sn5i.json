  "text": "As the title says, I just recently heard about spousal hires and how they can be part of the hiromg negotiations. Can people please share their stories? I'm in Canada so any Canadian insight would be lovely!\n\nEdit: I was not expecting this many comments!! I posted this before I left for holidays and logged back into to a nice surprise! \n\nThank you to everyone for sharing your stories! My partner was the one who mentioned this while we were joking about getting married to speed up the process to become a permanent resident. He made a comment about being married could also help with spousal hires which I had never heard of before. All 5 new profs hired in my program in the past few years were all young, just finishing their PhDs and unmarried.  He is in STEM and I'm in Humanities so it  doesn't seem like it is a possibility for us but still nice to joke about \ud83d\ude01",

      "text": "At my R1 this is discussed in faculty meeting during hiring deliberations fairly regularly. Certainly by the second visit. We are in a college town and there aren\u2019t that many opportunities in the immediate vicinity outside our institution - especially academic ones. So realistically, either you are going to make someone an offer they are unlikely to be able to accept - certainly not long term, unless the partner is willing to commute over an hour each way to nearby larger cities - or you find ways to hire both parties in a couple. They have to stand on their own merits - often a problem when one outclasses the other - but we coordinate across departments and/or other units to try and make something happen. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t always work, but it\u2019s narrow-minded to expect that a candidate walks in as an untethered individual with no personal ties and requirements. Also, slots have a habit of evaporating if you don\u2019t fill them when they are available, so it\u2019s in the department\u2019s best interest to consider candidates\u2019 partners as part of the picture. This doesn\u2019t mean co-hires or exceptions to requirements.",

I was contacted by the Dean of my school who wanted to bring me over, and was told basically if I got a Canada Research Chair they would create a position for my partner. The Dean knew of my situation and created the spousal deal as the major point for bringing me over.\n\nGot the grant and they followed through. I'm tenured, but my partner's position is non-tenure track. Long-term though, so it does give us security for the duration of the CRC. We are happy with the deal but know that unless your partner is really good, their position would most likely be NTT. From what I've been told, the most you can aim at is at two TT positions, maybe one tenured and one not but most likely it will be one TT and one NTT.\n\nAsk away if you have any questions.

On the one hand it\u2019s good for the university because you get at least one rock star (someone so good they can justify two TT lines). Every spouse I\u2019ve worked with also ends up being highly capable and accomplished in their own rights (one just got an R01 as PI).

Last year I chaired a search committee that found multiple strong candidates. Unfortunately that TT line was shelved due to covid, but lo and behold a spousal hire was still approved.

      "text": "Spousal hires are definitely not a thing of the past, at least at large research universities. It is true that if the pair is in the same department, many departments cannot swing it, but most departments (not all!) will try to find some kind of accommodation for the trailing spouse. I know this because I personally am a member of an academic couple (different fields though), and we have received dual/spousal offers at two different R1 universities in the past 3 years, as part of a spousal arrangement. I also know of several other couples that negotiated spousal hires (mostly tenure track), both at my university and at other universities, within the last 5 years.  And, actually, my undergrad mentor, my PhD mentor AND my postdoc mentor were all married to academics and had arranged tenure track spousal hires. I was also on a search committee a couple years ago where an academic spouse was sprung on us at the last minute, and we found accommodations for them in a different department on campus. Things might be different right this moment due to COVID, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will continue to be. I mean, pretty much nobody is hiring anyone at all right now in the US. Despite all that, universities definitely don't WANT to do spousal hires, so don't offer that info up immediately!

They may be considered for adjunct work, maybe a VAP line if you're really lucky, and not likely starting at the same time as you (maybe the next year or the year after). If it's a state school, they will be one candidate among many applying to the open jobs because if you think the state will make a job just for your partner, you are mistaken. \n\nYou might have better luck at a private school - I have seen one private SLAC with a large endowment go out of their way to keep partners happy by making tenure track lines with a sham of a job search for show but that was pre-Covid. Even then, the timing isn't perfect - a partner may be a VAP at first and then start in a position the next year or it may be something in your second or third year if you've shown enough value that they'll hire your partner from their tenure track job halfway across the country if they know it means you might leave. \n\nAnd again, you have to be a big deal. NEH million dollar grants and basically famous sort of big deal. Not regular people who might have been a strong applicant or the best of your program sorry of person.",
