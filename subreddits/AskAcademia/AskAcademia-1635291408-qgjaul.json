Being able to quickly and efficiently sift through heaps of poorly-organized data collected by someone else is *incredibly* useful.\n\nAlso, as much as it pains me; the above also includes learning how to manipulate data in Excel. Yes, it's painful, tedious, and a waste of your talents, but in a lot of settings outside of academia that may be the best you have access to until you can build up a library of scripts/functions in your programming language of choice that allow you to function in your workplace's data environment.\n\nAlso, not really a talent, but; get in the habit of exercising *before* or (at the latest) early on in grad school before things get tough. It's good for both your physical and mental health to work out your frustrations physically.",

          "text": "I want to second the programming thing (if as mentioned your field will have anything to do with data). I would recommend learning Python or R as they are both free and relatively easy to learn and should be able to do anything you need them to do. If you don't already know a language, I would recommend Python as it is a general purpose language and is therefore more flexible. Being able to program the analysis will save you tons of time, increase the reproducibility of your research, and allow you to do more complicated analyses.",

Three additional soft skills according to my colleagues:\n\nLearn to present / talk about your research and adapt it to your audience in terms of length, context, jargon etc. Useful at job talks, conferences, or an interview with an industry company. \n\nLearn to build your network through meeting people in your field / subfield. How to be memorable, make friends, etc. \n\nLearn to maintain your network in your field / subfield, which includes identifying people who don\u2019t have your best interests at heart and being civil with them without attracting gossip.

Develop your opinions based on multiple sources, find new ideas, learn to distinguish what is known, what is conjectured, and what is mythologized.",

      "text": "The existing advice here is solid. But I would add the instruction to learn how to place your work in the context of our broader society/universe. Accept that most people you meet will not understand your topic or care about it, so you must explore ways to build their interest anyway. If you can\u2019t explain it to a layman with gusto and excitement, then you\u2019re not ready to discuss it yet. And if you can\u2019t explain why your work matters to the society that likely funded it, you don\u2019t fully understand it yet. As a student, this will help you with external funding, and will be helpful in job interviews when the time comes.\n\nFor those of you going into academia, learn and adopt a two-way communication style with students and colleagues. You might be a brilliant scientist in your lab, but your students won\u2019t care about that and neither will your colleagues. They will care what kind of person you are - patient and open vs. an arrogant lunatic. Force yourself to communicate simply and patiently, and to be an active listener. Help your students to be as excited about your field as you are, and don\u2019t ever treat them as a nuisance to your \u201creal job.\u201d Educating others IS your real job, and it\u2019s far more important than that next journal article you\u2019re writing. Also, as a faculty member, learn how to be a good department citizen. Be a team player, and work in ways that support your colleagues and grow the department or discipline. You\u2019re not on a rocket ship to stardom all by yourself. You\u2019re on a faculty of equals who took a chance on you once. So don\u2019t ever let yourself feel too good for them.\n\nLearn grants, and the people/systems that manage them. If you\u2019re smart enough to land a multi-year federal grant, then you\u2019re smart enough to sit down with the grants office and learn how university finances actually work. Don\u2019t simply snap your fingers and expect them to make your grant do this or that. \n\nGain an understanding of power dynamics among humans at your university. Faculties are often overflowing with feuds and hostility, and this may affect the makeup/conduct of your committee. Who are your advisor\u2019s friends and rivals, and how will this affect your plan? Does the chair like your work and appreciate you as a researcher? They should, and that support can be helpful down the road. Are you on good terms with the office administrator? She can make your daily life miserable if you cross her, and she\u2019s not even of fancy faculty rank. Senior faculty have a lot of soft power that must be respected if you want their help. Learn their individual emotional currency. Some people respond to cheap flattery, or punctuality, or jokes, or people who challenge them. Figure out what pleases them, and find a way to transact some of that to gain their help when you need it. This is mildly manipulative, but it\u2019s also simple social intelligence. Hone these skills, and you\u2019ll succeed in the many areas of scholarship that have nothing at all to do with lab work or publications.",
