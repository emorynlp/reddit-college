  "title:": "I can't write proposals. Should I leave?",
  "text": "Hello fellow academics!\n\nLittle background: I'm at the end of year 3 of my postdoc at a national lab in the US after a PhD in Europe in a STEM-field with a decent publication track record. To make the step to a faculty position my understanding is that it is important to secure grants, but for the life of me I just can't seem to write them. Writing papers does not come easy to me, but eventually I do manage to get words down on paper. For proposals not so much. I feel being a PhD/postdoc taught me how to do research, but not really how to write a grant proposal.\n\nI am supposed to be submitting a proposal in a little over a week and have barely anything. I scheduled a number of days to work on this well in advance, but ended up literally just staring at my screen every damn time. Now I feel I am too late to produce anything that will pass the bar and I feel I let my collaborators down. On one hand I want to give up on the current proposal altogether, but I feel this would let my collaborators down even more.\n\nAt this point I'm even wondering if it makes sense to stay in academia if I so vehemently dislike one of the main things that I would be expected to do the rest of my career. Of course there is always self-doubt of whether I'm good enough to 'make the cut' to stay in academia, but I wonder if my inability to produce a proposal is an indication that perhaps this line of work might just not be for me. Should I stay to improve my skills in the face of adversity? Or should I cut my losses and find a job where writing proposals is not the main part of the job? \n\nSo curious to hear from you...\n\n* How do you transition from paper-writer to grant-writer?\n* What are your best practices for writing a (successful) proposal? \n* How do you deal with a lack of ideas when the submission deadline is looming?\n* Is this a plain lack of experience or am I just not cut out for the job?\n\nThank you",

      "text": "Proposal writing is very important, that's true. You get better at it with time, so don't be so hard on yourself.\n\nSo if you have a topic about which you're truly excited, chart the course for the next 3 years of things that would ideally want to do. Then you need to cut this down to a coherent program that fills the three years with work that makes up a meaningful package (all bits need to be necessary and contribute to the goal, none of the work must be kept 'hanging' or seem optional -- this is the tricky bit of proposal work package design), and in the end many of the text blocks are not so radically different from what you know from writing a paper.\n\nWhat is super helpful is having a (successful) grant proposal as a template. I always give people in the lab one of those, this makes it all seem so much more attainable, and we've had a very, very high success rate.\n\nIf you find budgets and Gantt charts daunting: I don't know anyone who likes those, they are pretty mind numbing. Just got to get through that...",

          "text": "I just finished my first ever proposal writing during the last few months so hopefully this will be useful. \n\nYes. You read a good proposal and you\u2019ll have some idea what a proposal will look like! The language used in papers and proposals are different. Papers are \u201cpast tense\u201d and proposals are \u201cfuture tense\u201d you are describing what hast not yet happens but trying to illustrate the big impacts and draw reviewers attention. \n\nThe other thing I wanted share is that a lot of times the reviewers are not necessary the expert in your field. Therefore your language in proposal need to be tuned so that general scientific background of ppl would understand. This is something I started to understand more when I became a reviewer of DOE proposals\u2026if I cannot understand the goal within reading the first two pages I became very frustrated (I was also super busy during that period of time, and reviewers could only be busier). So I\u2019ll say it will be a good idea explaining your proposal to someone outside of your field and get some feedback. In the end of the day it\u2019s more like the act of salesperson (shark tank?!) instead of a researcher. \n\nFor new ideas. This is something challenging! I asked a friend he thrives in national lab. His answer is very straightforward: think about new ideas every day. It could be when you just watching TV shows for fun and you suddenly think of: hey why don\u2019t the main character have a water filter powered by li ion battery? Crazy fragments of idea are ok but just keep your brain thinking about something new. \n\nDigging out review papers is a good way. There\u2019s one time my advisor wanted to start researching something new, like none of us touched this field before. So 10 of us (scientists, postdocs, grad students) organized a study group and every week we take turn talking about what we learn from review papers for certain key words. This activity lasted 6 months or so, and turned into a 20 page proposal.",

The writing and more important the successful writing will be one of the most important aspects of your future. The more you rise in the ranks the more writing you will have to and you immediate future will depend on it. I agree things can be learned and you might get better at it, but if you really dislike it I will say you will  never come to that point where its good enough to keep you going in the highly competitive academic landscape. Its not a shame not everyone is good at those things and there is a whole interesting world out there that is not academia.\n\nI hate writing, I am really really bad at it. I knew with this I would start to hate academia at some point when I am confined to doing something I absolutely dislike. I now work in a medium sizes company and do R&D.  So think long and hard if you take up the fight and go try it but keep in mind if you are just no good at it, so be it there is something else out there.

Unlike OP I didn't struggle with writing grants, but I absolutely hated it, I hated the feedback and I absolutely loathed the fact that as a combined cohort scientists were putting in thousands of work hours into writing these proposals, of which at least 85% go in the bin. That to me was almost a crime against the tax payer. I left academia for another career, although somewhat ironically ended up doing that career at a research institute where I'm now a senior manager and occasionally writing grants again (although it feels very different now). \n\nI definitely would not recommend staying in academia if you hate writing grants as that is probably the single biggest occupation of your time as you get more senior, behind teaching. Furthermore, they worryingly say they don't have any ideas. That's an absolute pre-requisite for any career in academia and once you've been in academia for a few years post-PhD, you're going to be expected to come with some research ideas even if you stay relatively junior.",

Similar to what you have published earlier?)

That you find something interesting isn't enough. That you can point to the need for further research isn't enough. Your reader has to refuse 9 out of 10 applications, which all claim to be important. Why is your project more important than the others, or at least top 3?\n\n**Write for generalist, NON-EXPERTS**.

I will be very surprised if American institutions don't do that. That might be a good place to start. \n\nIf not, then try to find successful proposals from last year's iteration of the same\u2014or similar\u2014call. This might be trickier, but some research foundations allow individuals/institutions to request them. If that is not the case, then either ask within your institutions or any colleagues that you feel close to.\n\nBefore applying to be a PI in projects, join other consortiums (if that is a thing over there) or be the co-applicant in a few proposals.

      "text": "Just write one and submit the thing. Borrow a template and do the best you can, and give yourself a set number of hours to write the thing so you don't waste too much time. You'll get rejected, but you should get feedback from the panel on where you failed. Then you can revise and submit again. Proposal writing is unfortunately a numbers game, so learning how to write efficiently -- and not care too much if it's not 100% perfect -- is good. I've written big proposals in a couple of days using this approach.\n\nIf you can co-write the proposal with your collaborators you should. Learn from them.",

They can show you what needs beefing up, and what to ignore. \n\nA lot of granting agencies offer grantsmanship courses or workshops with program managers that give you a lot of insight into what will work.\n\nWith a week to go, I'm usually doing final revisions of the budget to correct for the discrepancies the accountant in the grant office found, getting that last letter of support from the person who promised to send it a month ago, and working with a co-PI to get the management plan realistic.",

I am also a postdoc at the third year and thinking of leaving academia because I really struggle with coming up with ideas. I think I am not really cut out for it.\n\nThank you OP for posting and the people who answered for giving useful comments. Best of luck, whatever you decide.",
