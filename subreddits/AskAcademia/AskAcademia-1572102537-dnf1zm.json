I\u2019ve heard some horror stories (MD Anderson!) about data theft during travel to China and will be taking a \u201cpersonal\u201d laptop without data or IP on it. I\u2019m less certain what best practices are for cell phones and for accessing email while abroad. Suggestions (STEM)",

If you check your email your login credentials will be compromised and they extract passwords. Don't login to grading software, as it will give them access to your student's papers and assignments. We are not to take personal phones or computers, but both are provided at no cost during all Chinese travel. Basically, we were told that anything taken into China will be considered compromised completely, as they are pretty sophisticated in basically all respects, and go after foreign academics pretty hard.\n\nSo take a clean university computer and don't log in to anything while you're there. Otherwise, consider everything compromised and report back to IT on return and they'll change all your logins, and check for duplicate passwords and reset those too.\n\nIt's totally over the top, but I think it's very reasonable. Let's say a student writes an article on the economic implications of China's Uighur repression on international trade with Muslim countries. I check my email, China gets the login, they get my grading login, they start reading papers and a student's family gets picked up for treason.\n\nIt's not that big of a jump, and China has the capabilities and personpower.",

I have done secure computing research and had many briefings on these issues, including recently from federal agents in my current role as chief research officer for my campus.  This is not paranoia, it is fact.  They don't necessarily scan every single device, but if yours were ever out of your hands, even just in your hotel room while you went out to dinner, it is possible that they have done so.\n\nMy favorite security training was one that ended with a  video featuring the the former head of the KBG standing next to the sign for one of our national labs, saying that before he became head of the KGB he personally oversaw spy activities related to that lab and (paraphrased), \"We know the name of everyone who works here, where you live, what time you leave for and return home from work, what you do in your spare time, the names of your family members, where your kids go to school, your hobbies, and everywhere you travel, including every trip abroad.  We will do whatever it takes to get information from you, and we are very good at it.\"  Anyone who thinks China is any less aggressive in pursuing their national interests is sadly mistaken.\n\nI personally know a German/American researcher who, while visiting Beijing for a research conference and a few extra days as a tourist, was followed from landmark to landmark and repeatedly approached by two young Chinese men with very good English and very weak cover stories, who offered to take him out drinking.  The only thing missing was the hot young Chinese woman who was really into western men.  I assume she would have shown up later.",

Don't install Dropbox, and don't \"remember\" your email or Google password in the web browser. Basically, consider what someone could access if they opened your computer and poked around in Firefox/Chrome: could they get at your work/personal email? Banking? Shared Google drive?\n\nConsider using \"incognito\" or \"private\" mode for all use of your web browser. Note that this will not encrypt/protect your browsing (though VPN will), but if someone opened your computer, there would be no saved passwords for E-mail or other sites.\n\nAdditionally, use your institution's VPN service when accessing the web. Not only will it get you around the website \"blacklist\" in China, but it will add a significant layer of security to your web browsing.",
