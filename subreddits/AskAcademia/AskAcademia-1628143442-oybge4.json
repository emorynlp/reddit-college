  "title:": "How bad is it really to finish PhD without any publications?",
  "text": "Okay, so as the title suggests, I'm due to finish my PhD thesis in the next few months. Besides a mini-review, I couldn't get any of my work published due to myriads of project changes, supervisory changes and whatnots. At this point, I'm just struggling to finish my degree. My PI recently suggested that I invest a few months after submitting my thesis to finalise publications from my thesis.\n\nFrom a career point of view, I'm interested in continuing my career in research. I hope to work in a lab (not picky on locations) where I can continue working within the field of tissue/stem cell engineering and cancer biology.\n\nHow vital are publications from a broader perspective? Is committing to an unpaid position for a few months after thesis for papers worth it, or would my thesis be enough to highlight my technical expertise? Are the chances of getting a job in a research lab worse if you have no publications under your belt?\n\nI come from a country where we have no coursework in our PhD degrees, and the degree duration is 3-4 years maximum.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n I will actually be seeking out a research-based non-academic position after my thesis like hospital scientist, or an industry scientist. My current background is cancer cell biology and I have worked with a lot of in vitro complex models. I can't publish at the moment since my thesis lacks in vivo studies and patient samples. Lastly, I'm from an Australian institution, so our PhD thesis do not consist of coursework or mandatory publications. Thanks again for all of your valuable suggestions!",

Particularly if you work with more complex models (e.g. mice) and are dependent on other factors (e.g. not readily available patient samples) it can take 3-4 years to gather sufficient data to graduate, never mind a first author paper. \nHowever, if your PI is offering, you should spend the time getting additional data and stay in the lab for a few more months. Will make you far more employable. You can spend the additional time in the lab working on applications too - if you\u2019re far enough along you can state the paper is in preparation/review or in pre-print.",

You might struggle I think to get a research job in academia and industry without publications, but a hospital scientist position is possible without publications. You might have more luck if you put manuscripts on your CV and tell your PI and job prospects that you're definitely absolutely writing up those papers, because it's hard with an Aussie 3.5y PhD to get papers out, lots of students have to finish them from their next position or get help from others left in the lab. \n\nIt's a tough job market here at the moment though due to covid funding woes in the University sector. There are a lot of postdocs who you will be competing with on the job market. But I could also never in good conscience recommend working without pay as a postdoc. Best of luck.",

My PI is also not tenured and is struggling to keep his position at the university.

So the whole thing has been a mess, and at this point I would just like to submit and move on to the next phase of my life. However, I have struggled so much throughout my degree that I would rather not see it go to waste if my thesis is useless without any substantial publications arising out of it - hence the debate.",

              "text": " That all makes total sense. \n\nIf you do stay to finish your manuscripts, will your PI commit to letting you upload them as preprints to biorxiv / medrxiv etc while they go through review? If so that could be a great compromise that could really help you and minimise your risk, because the issue I see is that getting publications can take such a long time, not just a few months. Once you've got enough data to submit, then there are revisions etc. But if your PI is happy for you to upload preprints at the point of submission, while the review process plays out, then you've got evidence of productivity for your job interviews, a doi for your CV so that people can read them,  and will stand a much better chance at finding a job whatever field you go for.\n\nDoes your PI expect you to handle revisions as well or just get it to the point of first submission? Make sure you're in the same page there. The difference could be 6 more months of unpaid work. \n \nThe other thing to negotiate with your PI is what job title can you put on your CV during this time? If you're working for them, albeit unpaid, you want to ensure you get to list a legit sounding job on your CV for the time spent. This too will really help with the applications - it's always easier to get a job while you've still got a job. \n\nBest of luck",

Most european countries impose a minimum number of publications during PhD to validate the thesis work. This being said, you can still find a lab position even without publishing during the PhD, it's just more complicated and you'll to defend your application differently. In this case, a recommendation from your supervisor, or co-workers, is extremely important. \n\nIf there's any chance you can publish your thesis results, and want to follow a career in research, I'd give it top priority. In same universities, you can write some of the thesis chapters in the form of papers. If this is a possibility for you, then it would save you a lot of time an energy.

My research just never amounted to a positive result (all my data was negative and my PI wouldn\u2019t change direction then left for another job).
