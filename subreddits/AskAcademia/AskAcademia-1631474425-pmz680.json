  "title:": "Comparing research paper graph with mine",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI have made a program on Monte Carlo simulation of light propagation and now I want to compare my result (like fluence vs depth graph) with the research paper one. What I did is -\n\nFirst I used the Matlab Grabit function to extract the datapoints of the research article's graph and then I normalized it by diving the whole points by the maximum value. Also, its y-axis is on a log scale (base 10).\n\nThen I normalized my graph by the same procedure and plotted it by taking the log10 of the y axis.\n\nIs this the correct procedure? Because when I am plotting them on the same window I think the paper's datapoints are again converted to log scale.\n\nIs there any other way to compare both graphs?",
