He passed away recently; maybe this story can be heartening to a few people.",

Nine of the men received tenure, she says, and none of the women did.

But the department's overall record of 90% men tenured and 0% women suggests that, maybe, there was something else going on too. Some of the psychological research suggests that when judging superstar, exceptional candidates then women may have some advantage over men and receive higher evaluations. But make it a little more ambiguous--with borderline cases or candidates with one or two weaknesses--then women get treated much more harshly. So in this case, a lack of conferences is a weakness but would her department have similarly pounced on and rejected a male candidate like that? Given their track record I'm not confident.",
