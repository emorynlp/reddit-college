  "text": "Was it easier to become a professor a few decades ago? I just finished my PhD in physics, and I'm doing a postdoc now, and I'm starting to think about life on the tenure track. It sounds very difficult to get one of these positions and it sounds equally harder to obtain tenure. \n\nWhat was it like getting a tenured position in science say 30 years ago? How much more competitive is it now compared with the past?  \n\nI have several anecdotal examples from family friends that it was easier to become a professor in the past but I've tried googling this myself to find more concrete sources, but I keep finding articles about what it's like to be a history professor, lol.",

One of my friends is an Ivy League prof who got his job in the mid-late 1970s. He was competing against THREE other applicants (not finalists-- applicants!). When I was on the job market a few years ago, jobs at rural R2s routinely had 100-350 applicants. One way of putting it is that the market for me ca. 2017 was up to 100x worse than the market for him ca. 1976.",

                  "text": "For one thing you get paid a lot more than in academia. Yes, faculty who got on the TT before every TT job required six years of postdocs in random nowhere schools on janitor wages will say this is shallow and that it shows I don\u2019t really value research and science. Well they didn\u2019t face the academic labor market that we do.\n\nFor another, instead of being treated as a disposable drone from a big pool of adjuncts, my expertise is respected.\n\nI don\u2019t want to reveal too much about myself except that turning a PhD in STEM into a career in industry is very doable but you have to be smart about it: try to incorporate marketable skills into your education and research. You can do this even in a very theoretical, non-applied area.\n\nBroadly speaking I see two ways a STEM PhD can leverage their degree into a career in industry:\n\n1) They\u2019re already in an area industry likes. My friends in optics, condensed matter, semiconductors, plasma, quantum computing research, working regularly with lab equipment and/or knowing a lot about the theory side. It\u2019s very important that these people attend conferences and network, because industry people will be there (unlike in my field which isn\u2019t currently application-heavy). PhDs of this kind have the greatest chance of continuing to work in their area.\n\n2) They use marketable skills as part of their research in a field with \u201cno practical use.\u201d A lot of particle and astronomy people are using machine learning and lots of programming, lots of data analysis. For me, I had to intentionally shoehorn programming in to my research because it was very analytical (it paid off, I believe I would not have the job I have because of that six-month project I assigned myself and that *didn\u2019t* lead to a paper). People in this field have the smallest chance of continuing to work in their area. I happened to have lucked out here and still have chances to scratch that itch as part of my job duties, even if only obliquely. These people need to network too, probably even more than the first category.",

Admittedly I only briefly looked through it I am not sure I agree that these results show that the expected trajectory of declining productivity after tenure is wrong. I think it depends on how one defines productivity. Fig. 7 shows a clear drop in the fraction of papers that they are first author on and a massive increase in the fraction of papers that they are last author on. Many of the people counted are becoming co-authors on papers that they are not really contributing much too, and this becomes increasingly true as they get older. I see this in many older professors who used to be scientists but have now transitioned into funding manager roles. This is of course itself a type of productivity and maybe we should define scientific productivity to include that, but these people are not scientifically active in the normal way.",

Suppose that there is an aspect of luck involved in making a research discovery, but that productive researchers pursue research ideas more frequently. In other words, suppose that research discovery is a dice roll, but productive researchers roll the dice more frequently. Note that productivity here isn't defined just as 'working hard'; it is probably some product of 'working hard' and 'working smart', (and all the other qualities that define an effective researcher). \n\nLet's model the 'discovery of ideas' as a Poisson process, where all ideas will eventually be discovered, but certain specific researchers discover them first and 'winner takes all'. The competition between researchers for discovering ideas can thereby be modeled as a competing stochastic race. (Just looked around on google and this idea seems to be in line with [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23260163?seq=1)). Productive researchers have a lower Poisson time constant, meaning they are *more likely* to discover novel ideas first, but occasionally, even unproductive researchers can occasionally get lucky and come across an idea first. \n\nIf we agree with the assumptions of this model, then as a *policy*, we should aim to hire and fund productive researchers. We should *not* aim to hire and fund unproductive-but-lucky researchers. Would you agree? \n\nThere are of course a lot of subtleties here on absolute definitions of what is productivity, what is 'worthwhile research', blahblah, but the overarching thesis is that we should make a policy of funding productive researchers over unproductive ones, and we all have a sort-of gut feeling for what distinguishes the two.\n\nPeter Higgs is a sort of extreme example (Nobel Prize-worthy work once, not much work after, sort of like Josephson from the Josephson Junction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Josephson). Perhaps in cases like these the policy should err on the side of funding them, just in case. But this is more of a risk-management strategy discussion than a general policy discussion.",

                                      "text": "I actually heard about my position approximately 1.5 years before I finished my PhD. At the time however, I didn't really think I was 1.5 years out from finishing, probably more like 2.5 years out. I still had to finish another year of data collection, and then get to writing, which at the time seemed like an insurmountable feat.\n\nMy advisor shared the open position with me and suggested I apply. I told him that it seemed like it was too soon, and his response was something like \"the timing is the timing, might as well apply and let the search committee decide.\" So, I apply (mid-summer or so) and heard nothing for several months. I actually don't remember if I even received a disposition letter like \"you didn't make the cut.\" In any case, I just stayed focused on my work and didn't worry too much about it, simply thinking that I indeed wasn't selected for an interview.\n\nAround late-autumn, I get an email from the search committee chair, asking if I was still interested in the position. She tells me that the first search ended up failing to find a candidate, and that they were going to have a second search. She explained to me that though I was somewhat highly considered for at least an interview, the committee felt that I was too far out from finishing. I ended up speaking to the search committee chair over the phone (my idea - I like phone conversations) and explained to her that indeed, it was early, but now I think that I could be done within a year. She said that the new posting would go live on such-and-such date, and encouraged me to apply again. I applied again before the end of the year.\n\nEarly Spring, I get an email that I've been selected for a Skype interview. They actually sent me the questions ahead of time (a few hours I think), so I had a moment to gather my thoughts before the interview. The Skype interview went well, and I was selected for an in-person interview in late-April. \n\nThe in-person interview was EXHAUSTING. I get flown up to campus on a Sunday evening, and was met by two (future) colleagues (who weren't on the search committee) for dinner. Nevertheless, I knew that they'd be giving their opinions to the committee, so I had to be on my game. Early the next morning, I give my seminar in the department, meet the dept. chair, various other faculty, lunch with grad students/faculty, and tour the dept. By late-afternoon that same day, the committee chair and I left campus to drive down to the agricultural experiment station (where my position is based). We make it half way to a hotel, and meet some stakeholders for dinner. The next day, we leave early in the morning, and finish the drive to the station. I give my extension talk to the wine growers, meet the station director, other faculty and staff, etc. just like on campus. \n\nTHEN, finally at the end, I get sat down in the conference room face-to-face with the committee, and they ask me another list of questions. At this point, I'm DED. No more ability to be \"on-stage,\" which was the point from their end.   You just are kind of broken down to your core functions/personality. I answered the questions, was taken out for a last dinner, and was flown out the next day. I was told that they'd have a decision for me in a month. \n\nI get a call in about 3 weeks with a verbal offer from the station director. He says they want me, and asked me if I still wanted the job. I said yes, and he asked me to draw up a start-up budget for the lab. I won't bore you with the finer points of the negotiations, but I worked out a pretty good deal. The only stipulation (of course) was that I had to have my degree in hand by the time I started. It's late-May at this point, and I was supposed to start in late-September. The next four months were pretty much a blur of writing my ENTIRE thesis. \n\nI will add that since my entire committee was basically old farts who were retiring, and probably didn't care about publication ready papers. They were pretty lenient on signing off on my thesis, and really just wanted to do everything they could to make sure I got the job. I will never forget that, and remain eternally grateful in that regard.",

That's why there are so many graduate students being pushed out every year, even though there's no real market for them. Its because the Unis *need* the Graduate students. And senior academics are aware of this, but in lots of places systematic reforms would require them to potentially sacrifice some of their own job security. So its easier to bewail the system without suggesting any real reforms.\n\nI'm not saying its true everywhere, or that every professor with tenure out there is part of some grand conspiracy. But its not very different from the immense salary divides between senior university execs, or coaches that gets commented on. The people who are in a position to make systematic changes are also the ones least incentivized to do so. And having the current system be a rat race for the dwindling tenure track positions allows Universities to lean heavily on their young career researchers to invest deeply into research which Universities institutionally profit from. Its not the universities who, after all, get burned by academic burnout.",

      "text": "The number of jobs available, and the number of people applying for them, has definitely changed over time. Not to belabor the history professor aspect, but here's how History PhDs-per-year compared with jobs per-year [over the last 40 years or so](https://www.historians.org/assets/Images/Perspectives/AHA%20Today/2017/11/Advertised-Job-Openings-Compared-to-the-Number-of-New-History-PhDs.jpg). You can readily see that there are at various times different trends, and the huge mismatch since 2008. \n\nI don't have similar statistics for other fields, [though the number of PhDs in physics has fluctuated wildly in the 20th century](https://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/USPhDs.jpg) \u2014 this is an area where we have a lot of statistics (because the American Institute of Physics keeps them). What I don't know is the number of TT jobs in physics per year \u2014 that also is going to change over this time (and is one of the reasons that you see that huge drop after 1970). \n\nAcademia on the whole seems more competitive in part because after 2008 the number of new TT lines decreased across the board, and it does not seem to have recovered. In the field of History, the offering of \"early retirement\" to many older scholars loosened up the number of jobs initially but then locked in a cohort of relatively young people, disrupting the normal regularity of the retirement cycle. Historically, these disruptions can happen across the board but some fields have been better insulated from them. The historian of physics [David Kaiser](http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/DKResearch.html) has spent a lot of his career tracking how this works in Physics, but also in other disciplines \u2014 if you are interested in the demographics of the profession over time, check out his stuff (notably [this article](http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/Kaiser.ColdWarReq.pdf) and [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/667831?seq=1), but his book on _How the Hippies Changed Physics_ is also relevant to this conversation, because it is about the crash of physics jobs around 1970).\n\nOne of the things that Kaiser's work also does \u2014 and what makes it so interesting beyond just the trends \u2014 is that he makes arguments about how the demographic aspects of fields affect the kinds of intellectual content that is pursued. So he argues, in his book _Drawing Theories Apart_, that the proliferation of Feynman diagrams was directly related to the change in pedagogy that came when the number of physics majors ballooned after World War II and Sputnik. He has also shown, in other work, that the choice of topics in the humanities undergoes similar sorts of changes when the perception of the market as \"small\" or \"large\" happens (e.g., increased or decreased specialization). It's interesting stuff.",

      "text": "The answer, for the US at least, depends a great deal on which decade your're speaking of and which field you are in. Broadly, though, there was a huge downturn in the academic job market in the US in the mid-1970s, after the Vietnam-era draft ended and people stopped going to college to avoid the war. Public investment in schools declined as well, as the Boomers aged out of college and the baby bust (Gen X) reduced demand. Things didn't really improve until the mid-1980s when the economy recovered from the 70s inflation spiral and the Reagan recession. By the late 1980s there were people saying we were soon to enter a golden age of academic employment as the 1950s/1960s faculty all retired and a whole new generation of professors came on the stage-- including me and my friends who were in grad school in the mid-1990s.\n\nBut that didn't happen. Instead, the neoliberal university model took hold and while enrollments went up budgets did not; tuition skyrocketed as conservative legislators slashed per capita spending on higher ed and faculty lines were shifted from tenure track to contingent (term) labor. Meanwhile, a generation of grad students who were fed stories of mass retirements was waiting in the wings for jobs that never materialized. (Me and my friends.)\n\nThen it got worse. In 2008-2010 almost every US school was under a hiring freeze. Entire cohorts of new Ph.D.s were jobless. When the market restarted there was a multi-year backlog of applicants waiting for jobs that were even more likely to be non-tenure-track because admins \"learned their lesson\" in the recession: you can fire contract workers easily when times get tough.\n\nBut yeah, it was easier to get hired in the past because prior to this all happening it was in fact commonplace for some departments to simply hire by calling up an old graduate professor and saying \"send me your top \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ man.\" I say \"man,\" because that old boys' network was real and it pretty much only served up straight white male candidates. Even after that faded the market self-selected for the same type of candidates, as departments sought to reproduce themselves. So for quite a few schools you can go back and look at CVs of people hired in the 1980s and they are pretty weak by comparison to today. That's due in part to the simple fact that there are *far* more people applying for jobs today and graduate school has become so professionalized many new Ph.D. now have longer CVs than associate professors did a generation ago.\n\n/history professor",

In 2004, one of my advisers went from mid-tier R1 PhD candidate to mid-tier R1 TTAP (roughly lateral in ranking) with zero post-doc and like 2-3 papers. She said it was totally normal, and only one or two of the people she ever knew in grad school did postdocs. Until the 2008 recession it was almost unheard of for someone in her field to bother with postdoc.

As far as I can tell, career teachers focus on their duties earlier than later. For example,  Hilder up their tutoring, teaching fellow, joint publication and grad representational positions. After their graduate, or near graduation, perhaps a short term contract is opened up, and said applicant moves in. From there, your pretty much secured a chance to publish and teach, and hopefully, transition into a full time faculty position. Then it\u2019s up to grants procurement. You can\u2019t get a professorship without bringing in grants to your department or selling many copies of a used textbook. Anyway in physics I\u2019m not as sue as humanities. I say this is a seen approach in today\u2019s times because in contrast to earlier days, things were much more given.\n\nOne thing I think about from time to time is how easy it is to get into uni, get scholarships, pass your degrees and masters all which lead for hopefully phds. In my department self funding students have about a seventy percent drop out rate. In general, apart from the Ivy Leagues, The quality of student work is appalling at times. Whereas thirty years ago, you know that people at uni only made up fifty percent of students who passed high school. Then they had fail rates for university. Ie, it was much tougher to graduate and when you had, a certain generation was put into place to teach increasing relaxation of standards in grading, including the now modern neo liberal approach to bums on seats. This influences how tenure track ps work today. \n\nIn short, a position like professor is a hard earned one made up from many high quality and impactful qualifications, a series of cited tbooks, and specifically, grant acquisition. Included in this may be more beaucratic positions such as senior program leaders, or deputy roles etc. it\u2019s a senior lecturing position but high grant earner. \n\nIf you want to fast track your tenure journey in physics I would guess you would want to finish your post doc with impactful publications, try find a teaching fellow position, start becoming involved with your department and faculty, and then, secure funding and grants. This last one is key. If you bring a grant into your department, you will be seen as well liked and competent. RSL is the name of the game in modern academia.",
