  "title:": "Mendeley EndNote Mashup",
  "text": "I'm an academic writer and editor and use both Mendeley and EndNote, whatever my clients prefer. I often have to recreate bibliographies that come to me as plain text--a huge PITA, especially if references aren't indexed in PubMed.\n\nM excels at importing any reference from the web, but formatting is kind of a pain. EN needs 3+ discrete search terms to locate references, but editing formatting styles is easier.\n\nI just figured out to use the Mendeley web importer to pull references and do an XML export/import to put them in EndNote for formatting\n\nIt's a small thing, but it'll save me (billable but tedious) hours of work over the course of a year.",
