  "text": "Hi all, i was wondering if I could get some opinions or advice to the following situation: i\u2019m in my seventh year of assistant professorship, three of these tenure track US and four of these in a permanent position (UK).   I am getting ready to apply for promotion. However there are a few issues. First my spouse and child absolutely do not like it here and want to go back to previous country. Second, i\u2019ve been working my ass off especially post covid. I have ten undergrads, five PhD students, led two courses this semester with over 100 students in them. I do the grant applications (not going great but there are small steady funding amounts) and the publishing thing (very productive despite not having many resources or time).... I had to remodel my two courses to work remotely because of  Covid whilst homeschooling. Well: just got my evals back and students loved the first module but absolutely hated the second! That one is a difficult, technical subject which is mandatory and half of them usually really loathe it even during non covid times. Others who are more interested love it\u2014- smh. The spread of these evaluations goes from \u201cbest course i ever had\u201d to \u201ci\u2019m gonna change my degree now\u201d... I think I might be having an oncoming burnout or something but I just ... want to quit..... right.... NOW! I\u2019m normally calm and rational but i feel like I am trapped in a nightmare. \n\nI got scared of myself and have just taken leave over the holidays to let all of this settle - i normally never take any time off since i started in academia about 20 years ago- but i think i want to try getting into a different job. I\u2019ve applied to a museum job on a whim the other day and they want to interview me. The more i think of it the more i like the idea of doing something practical that isn\u2019t such a terrible 80 hour/week slog all the fucking time. I\u2019m so tired and nothing is ever good enough. \n\nOn the other hand it\u2019s a secure job with benefits and they allow me to do my \u201cresearch\u201d at night times and weekends .... \n\nI\u2019m so confused.",

I find that admin people have literally no idea of what we do and how much time work takes up for us.  Academics are either burnt out or highly driven people, all of us want to lead our research domain.  Inevitably that means lots of hours that go unrecognised by the institution and if you have a shit boss, which this person clearly has, you end up burnt out.\n\nTeaching is not just a few hours face to face, as a minimum you need to double for prep time, plus admin load plus out of hours student contact plus marking.  Then you add on research student management, honours students.  \n\nThen there\u2019s research\n\nThen there\u2019s networking\n\nThen there\u2019s industry engagement \n\nThen there\u2019s assessing and reviewing journals, grants etc\n\nThen there\u2019s dealing with administrative work that people like yourself create without thinking who it impacts.  \n\nI\u2019m not surprised this poor person is doing 80hrs a week.

Changing positions, especially when under strain, could lead to an even worse situation. The job security of a tenured (equivalent) position is nothing to scoff at these days.\n\nYou've pointed out some nasty aspects of academia. The final backbreaker by your account is student evals after some hard effort. I'd take those with a grain of salt. It's hard to please everyone, especially in trying times (especially in the US, if that's where you are). \n\nRegarding the work hours (80). It really depends on whether you still like your academic work. Maybe you're taking on too much, and have to say \"no\" to more things?\n\nBest wishes.",

In my culture, family is paramount (given that their reasons for hating life where my career is at are legit reasons, and not fluffy snowflake reasons). Fuck Academia if it means divorce and my kid wasting their future.\n\nNow, if you're going to go for the direction of \"Screw Academia,\" make sure you don't screw those under you. Talk to them, give them honest plans (no, don't hide shit, don't hide the big picture, don't hide \"information you think isn't necessary for my students to know because they'll underperform if they know it\"-assumption based information. Prepare for all of them a plan of what they have to do, and even after you leave - you don't formally have the duty to, but - I believe you're obligated to help them and not waste years of their lives.\n\n====== Now this is a part that has heaps of assumptions and is a bit biased against you, don't feel offended by any of that though; just consider it part of the reddit collective ======\n\nAnyway, that's for my culture. But since you've mentioned that you've been working your ass off, maybe that's why your family is pissed. I'd suggest to get closer to your family and have a long talk with them (you're already in tenure, you know, it's a good thing) and understand their perspective, understand their problems, and then see a way to solve these problems.\n\nYou're a goddamn professor. If you do half the therapies you do with your PhD students with your family, you'll find a billion solutions. Just calm down, don't take more than you can handle (assistant professors, unfortunately, have to act like rabid dogs after publications to get to the next step. Just slow down and relax or you'll lose a lot, being a year late for the promotion on a tenure track isn't the end of the world) and get your shit together. Leaving a country - and a career set in stone - is a big decision.",

When you\u2019re seeking change, if you do your best you can find your perfect place.

Pretty much found my niche in life and I hope you do too! Try not to stress out too much and make a risky decision but if it seems like a good idea, it\u2019s best to try and see how it goes.

There wasn\u2019t a lot of opportunity to pause and think about what else I could do.

I\u2019d be just as productive and happy if not more in any other job.

So I just decided to use all non-academic ways of thinking I have access to in order to think about academia itself. I just took this decision because I easily get trapped into my rational thinking (even while having an emotional decision to make about my career). \n\nSo I bought a book about visual thinking and tried some other creative techniques to link metaphorical thinking towards rationality. It helped me a little to come up with new ideas but then, I tried to apply my very own method of decision making. In your case, it would be something like making 4 lists with either good or bad aspects in both ways (quitting or staying). Cross out the intuitively/emotionally more easily to find least important arguments for quitting or staying on each list. The result should be a positive list with the most important arguments for leaving or staying. \n\nIf you think about the problem in the traditional way (by asking \u201cwhat are the best arguments on both sides\u201d \u201cwhy should I stay/quit\u201d) you tend to use a way of thinking that has already been criticised by Ancient Greeks. But it\u2019s \u2018via negativa\u2019 - by reversing your question - that you can find other solutions you would never have thought of in an active way by asking positively. This strange mixture of using logic and emotion tricks you into following your intuition while using an intellectual framework.. and it even uses negative emotions for rationality.\n\nWell, have fun taking your decision, I will just take a walk and discuss my lists again with a friend :)",
