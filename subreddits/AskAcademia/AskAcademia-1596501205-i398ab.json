  "title:": "I had to leave academia ... and didn't want to",
  "text": "**EDIT: Thanks to everyone who weighed in here.** I appreciate the feedback so much and the willingness to share common experiences and pieces of advice and larger perspectives about this thorny career field. I won't be able to respond to everyone (the 40-hour work-week being what it is), but I wish I could. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know everyone who says they left academia for a non-academic job is usually happy about it and glad to report that the non-academic world is better ... but my situation's a little different in that I was forced out this year, something that was going to happen anyway but definitely hastened by Covid-19. I finished my PhD in a humanities field in 2015. Published. Won awards from national journals and fellowships from major libraries and archives. Was a finalist in more than one major job search.\n\nBut could never land that TT job.\n\nI spent two years as a lecturer and three years on a teaching postdoc, trying my damnedest to publish and get a job ... but my teaching load was heavy and the chips never fell on my side of the table.\n\nThis past spring I was a finalist for two jobs. I came in second in one search. The second search suddenly disappeared. Later I discovered I was the top pick (supposedly) but the entire line was lost because of Covid-19.\n\nMy teaching postdoc had run its course, and the university I worked for laid me off at the end of the academic year.\n\nI knew this was coming (and I knew my PhD was getting stale), so I'd been applying for other non-academic jobs like mad ... and fortuitously enough, I got one.\n\nThis is a good thing, don't get me wrong! I'm not independently wealthy and I don't have a spouse, so I'm my own breadwinner and have always lived with the knowledge that academia might not work out for me. (Adjuncting for a living was never going to be an option.)\n\nI know I'm super lucky just to have a job AT ALL in this economy, and especially a job that's okay-paying and in a \"do-good\" field ...and I hate how entitled this sounds (and I got a PhD in humanities, what did I expect) but I'm just incredibly sad to have arrived at this point. I really, really wanted to be a professor. I liked the work. I never had the \"ew academia sucks\" attitude that I've seen in other people--and not that there's anything wrong with that attitude! I understand it, and, I mean sometimes, it's just not for you.\n\nBut tbh, I really liked the work, I loved the scholarship, and everything I did as a grad student and then an instructor was miles above what I'd previously done for a living BEFORE going to grad school.\n\nAnd I currently hate my non-academic (or post-academic?) job. For me, walking \"away\" was never a choice; it's what I had to do to survive.\n\nSo, anyone face something similar? Does it get better? What did you do?",

      "text": "I've been in a similar position, OP, and it is hard. I know. Several years after finishing my undergrad degree, I went to grad school because 1) I realized that the industry I was working in was unethical and 2) I'd always wondered \"what if\"--what if I'd done a Master's and PhD, like I'd wanted to. What if I'd tried for an academic career. I did great in my MA program, and finished my humanities PhD. Not without some struggle, of course, but I finished. I published while a doctoral candidate, and my scholarship won awards. \n\nBut I couldn't get a job. Couldn't even get a postdoc or a vap. I tried everything I could think of and that people advised me to do. Wrote more. Went to more conferences (on my own dime). Networked. Networked. Networked. Retooled my CV. Wrote dozens, if not hundreds, of versions of my cover letter. Applied for seemingly hundreds of jobs. I made the job search my life. And I couldn't get a job. Oh sure, I was a finalist. I got campus visits. I was told, after being passed over, that my materials were great, my talk was great. I'd get something. I didn't. So I left academia. I got a non-academic job with relative ease compared to how much work I put in to getting an academic job. \n\nI hated my non-academic job. I knew by the second month on the job that I hated it, so I re-entered the academic job search, partly because I didn't know what else to do and partly because I genuinely loved teaching. And . . . I got a teaching job. It wasn't the job that I once thought I wanted, but it was a teaching job. I loved it for the first three years, but now I wish I'd stayed in my alt-ac job. I made more money, and I had a better work-life balance. Plus, my last company is behaving ethically and insisting that its employees work from home, while my college is demanding that we all return to face-to-face classes in two weeks even though covid cases in my city are spiking. I originally sought an academic career in part because I believed higher ed to be a more humane, ethical way of earning a living than the corporate world. I now realize that this isn't necessarily true.",

And I'm almost stunned by much easier it was to get a nonacademic job--*in a pandemic*\\--than to even get an interview for an academic job during those non-pandemic years.

The job that spurred me to go back to school was writing documentation for a firm in the finance industry. The alt-ac job I got after I gave up on the job market was sort of creative project manager/senior technical editor role. It was a good fit for my skills and experience. I worked with three to five different teams at a time, guiding and mentoring them as they gathered information from subject-matter experts within the company, determined what type of documentation needed to be produced considering the user, offering revision suggestions, keeping track of deadlines and deliverables, attending meetings where I provided management with progress reports on the teams' work, and sometimes giving presentations in which I delivered a team's work. In a lot of ways, it was like being a professor, and I think my teaching background helped me land the job even more than my tech writing experience. It was varied, which I liked, but it wasn't going to work for me long term.",

But, many of them moved on to do great things outside of the academy.\n\nYou're so right. You are not a failure for leaving academia, for any reason. But academia has certainly failed nearly all of us. I'm close to submitting my PhD and I know (given my research output) that academia doesn't want to play with me anymore. And I no longer want to play its game either. So much passion and interest drained out of me. I wanted to love the academic profession, but the academic system has not loved me back. \n\nGrass is greener where you water it, I guess.

Had it been 6% when I started out (or if I'd had a time machine into 2020) ... I never would have gone.\n\nThe sad thing is that there ARE retirements--in my field there are a ton of people retiring. My department retired two people at the end of this year. Even before COVID, there was absolutely no possibility that the department would get two full-time TT people to replace those retirees. \n\nAnd I suspect we'll see more retirements in the coming years from older people who don't want to to risk their health, but they won't be replaced.",

There are a lot of us that are actually doing quite well, getting interviews, and enjoy the work but are now facing impossible career prospects, with no way to get back in to the \"Ivory tower\" after the economy (eventually) recovers. The only advice I guess I can offer is that this situation won't last forever - my guess is these events are going to cause cataclysmic changes in higher education and research that will further open the door to those us of that got kicked to the curb. \"Non-traditional\" scholarship, in that you might not have a full time job at your affiliated university or a (hopeful) dismantling of the current career tracking system and insanity that is the academic job market, will likely become more common. \n\nIn the meantime, make your situation known to those you work with. We are about to lose an entire generation of gifted intellectuals whose contributions to society could have been far greater than previous generations. Given the current sea change in public awareness of how historical processes and policy affect the world, the social sciences and humanities are more important now than ever. If nothing else, this COVID situation lays bear that overly technological solutions, like finding a vaccine, a necessary task to be sure, still fail without adequate social policies that are ultimately grounded in work done by social scientists and humanists.  \n\nIt's a great loss, particularly during a time of unprecedented changes (climate change, urbanization, globalization, etc)  when I personally think we need more social scientists and humanists shaping the global conversation and facilitating cross-cultural dialogue.",

I suspect the same was said in the 80s.\n\nThere are certainly gonna be cataclysmic changes, but I don't think they will benefit academics. You're certainly right about opening doors to people who got kicked to the curb, but I don't know that I like those doors. For example, a school in my area recently fired most of its faculty and then extended offers for them to come back as adjuncts. Maybe \"getting to\" teach a college class or two in your free time is a way to stay in touch with academia, but I wouldn't call it dignified employment. I don't love the notion that's been going around lately, that the adjunctification of academia is some kind of golden opportunity for former academics to \"give back\" and \"stay current\" while giving their labor away for free or near-free to an exploitative institution.\n\nAs for humanities being more relevant than ever, of course they are (and they never stopped being relevant), but that humanities academics think so (and they always do) doesn't necessarily mean that there will be change in policy or consumer behavior. Practically, what happens in times of economic stress is that budgets get slashed (usually on things like support for the arts, education, environmental protection...) and consumers become more conservative with their spending and expectations both. The latter is partly responsible for the '08 boom in \"practical\" degrees. Even as people realized post-08 that econ has problems, the Washington Consensus was well and truly dead, and America will never be \"great\" again, the conversation didn't turn to how can we valorize the humanistic fields of study that have been telling us those things all along, but how can we encourage young people to get in-demand skills and good jobs so that they can afford a standard of living they've become accustomed to in childhood. Everyone, from fiscal policymakers to you and me, is thinking about their pocket right now. That's not historically a good time to expect positive fiscal change in areas that most people consider superfluous.",

Academia learned to make do with less, so even when universities *could* hire people again, they didn't. \n\nMy sense is that something similarly bleak will happen after this pandemic is over.

I'm not advocating that OP go for adjuncting or anything like that. All I'm saying is that if any of these tenured profs at universities have a shred of humanity left, they should recognize that many of us are doing all the right things but getting fucked over. There should still be a dignified place in the academy for credentialed non-professionals. That being said, I'm not sure that it will pan out that way. \n\nHowever, I do think that this current situation is pretty different than the '08 financial recession and I disagree that it's a given that things will go back to the way it was in a decade ago or so. I'm ready to be wrong here, but I really believe that this is will be watershed moment for higher ed. Many colleges and universities will close. Staff and faculty are losing their jobs in record numbers. Most students are no longer really interested in the model of education that these universities provide, they just want the prestige so they can go to work for Big 4 or Apple or whatever. Basically all other sectors of the economy have been gutted, leaving them with few other viable choices.  \n\nI hope that situation is no longer sustainable and that big (positive) changes are coming but that will require the people on the inside to make good decisions. Unfortunately, most of them are boomers who have systematically fucked over American society. \n\nAnyway, I'm just suggesting to OP to try to take the long view here. What is happening now will not be the case forever. This century is going to be crazy ride for all of us (assuming we make it) and I think we may as well embrace the chaos as best as we can, work towards a better tomorrow, and try not to get too down on ourselves for \"failing\" in what appears to me to be collapsing model of research and education. There are new and exciting opportunities all around us. You've got a PhD, you worked hard, and you are good at what you do, you can be flexible and do other, hopefully more profitable, work while you figure out your next moves.",

Many colleges and universities will close. Staff and faculty are losing their jobs in record numbers.\n\nLike, *why is any of this good*??? Like I guess it's good if you've been waiting for your chance to gloat at the people who have academic jobs (I'm not here to judge anyone, schadenfreude is natural and probably healthy) but what other positive outcome do you envision of the entire system being decimated and people losing their livelihoods en masse? All the analysis I've read or made indicates that, once lost, these lines will be lost forever - America's demographic situation, stance on student immigration and the new generation's appetite for education (as you note) just doesn't warrant the number of colleges we have today. Whatever new academia rises from the ashes, however equitable, won't have the space to support all the people in it today, much less people who are currently outside. Your chances of getting a job in post-covid academia are worse, not better. \n\n> I do think that this current situation is pretty different than the '08 financial recession\n\nYou're right: it's much worse. 08 was limited to financial and real estate sectors and had the most impact on countries that were overexposed to international credit markets. Today we are facing a massive real economy contraction that affects the whole world. This is in fact worse than 29 at this point.\n\n> and I disagree that it's a given that things will go back to the way it was in a decade ago or so.\n\nThings didn't go back to the way it was in 08 either - 08 initiated a major decline in academic financing from all sources. The job market never recovered to pre-08 levels. It's why you hear people saying that COVID brought to an end a story that began in the 80s.\n\nLike, maybe I (and like 10 academia commentators) am totally off base here and if you have some blueprint or idea for how academia could emerge improved from this mess, I'd really like to hear it. But aside from that, yeah, I don't know how you justify your optimism.",

While I would really like to see our public infrastructure (including universities) restored to some functional capacity, that is definitely not a given and for many people maybe not even a desirable outcome, given that many Americans (esp Republicans) now think that college is a poor investment and does far more harm than good. I obviously disagree with this position, but its harder and harder to defend the utility of a college education when students are not only getting a low quality education but also becoming wage slaves. \n\nIn the meantime, I guess we keep grinding through this pandemic and its aftermath and see what happens....",

Humanities professors offer good things--sharp analysis, great teaching, and (especially) an approach to the world that just isn't replicated *anywhere* else, or in any*thing* else.   It's important.\n\nAs the political forces (and political-economic pressures) that are crushing the Academy in the US (and worldwide) increase, they are destroying one of the few things that humans invented that (historically) have actually carried humans *beyond* their monkey-brained, selfish instincts. \n\nGood luck in your new career.

OP is right; Ph.D.s get stale and few search committees will even consider someone who has been out of academia for even a couple of years when the pool is full of \"fresh\" Ph.D.s.\n\nThat said, OP: almost everyone from my Ph.D. cohort ended up not having traditional faculty careers. Most of them are happy. Many are doing really interesting things. Some are in education, some are not. I get the sense of loss. But nobody can take away your education, your title, or the lessons you've learned-- and despite what some might say, the skills and knowledge you've amassed along the way are valuable and will lend themselves to successful careers in all manner of fields. American academia was teetering *before* COVID and even if the virus magically goes away the demographic cliff is still looming out there 4-5 years down the road. But there are all kinds of interesting career paths out there-- you'll find one in time. If teaching still interests you consider private high schools; I was contacted by a headhunter at one just today so they are still hiring, and the good ones really want faculty with Ph.D.s if they can get them.",

      "text": "I'm in a slightly different position as I'm finalizing my PhD this fall, but I'm stressed out from trying to plan the next step.  My supervisor thinks I should just focus on my dissertation now and deal with the postdoc stuff later, but I am worried about having to get an industry job. Luckily I'm on the computational side of digital humanities so I shouldn't have a problem getting an industry job as a data scientist, but just like you: I don't want one.\n\nI have 5 postdoc grant applications submitted or about to be submitted and I even managed to land an interview for a TT job (the requirements looked like they copied my CV  for a very niche job). I am so stressed out by the idea that none of those will pan out and I haven't even completed my dissertation yet. And I'm the breadwinner in my family.\n\nI know I'm junior to you in the academic world and quite likely what is valued differs between countries and institutions, but I'm on the teaching evaluation committee of my university and have seen hundreds if not thousands of academic CVs of finalists. It seems like the biggest issue for most is that they don't have a balance between their research output, teaching experience and official merits (like courses in university pedagogy or other teaching accreditation), student thesis supervision, and other academic merits like international collaboration, creating teaching materials and developing academic programs. Being on the teaching evaluation committee has really helped me make sure my CV is fleshed out in all these aspects. I've ensured that given my merits I would technically be eligible for a full professorship by my university's requirements (of course I could at best only get an assistant professorship realistically speaking and even that would be incredibly lucky) by teaching more courses than is required by my contract, by supervising both undergrad and graduate theses, by collaborating on research with people from other institutions and countries, taking all the possible university pedagogy courses,  and taking up extra tasks such as being on the teaching evaluation committee, a steering group working directly with the president/rector of the university, and I'm even on the ethics committee. Still, it certainly doesn't mean I'll have it easy getting a job in academia. Perhaps I would have been better off focusing on my research for getting that postdoc position which would allow me to get my foot in the door for a TT position.\n\nSince you're single, have you considered applying for jobs abroad? I spent ten years working industry jobs before starting my PhD studies and people have only seen those ten years as a positive thing on my CV. I don't think working an industry job between academic jobs is necessarily a bad thing, especially if it is even remotely related to your research interests. I'm sure you're on all the mailing lists for open jobs in academia, but have you looked at [Japan](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/seek/SeekTop?ln=1) for instance? There's a push there at the moment to hire more international talent and the pay is good. With COVID, interviews are on Zoom at the moment (a great thing since the cost of attending the interview is generally borne by the applicant, unlike Europe where the universities tend to pay to fly you over).\n\nI guess this didn't exactly answer your question, but just because you got an industry job, doesn't mean you have to say goodbye to academia for good. I certainly don't intend to if I end up having to take an industry job.",

      "text": "I am feeling the same. I finished my PhD in 2015, defended in 2016. I had a string of postdoc projects but not yet a big one. I failed the Marie Sklodowska grants two times, been unemployed for almost a year and most of the time I was employed parttime. Only by living in a shared house and not spending a lot, I have been able to live decently. I want to give it one last shot, maybe a few years, save up money and leave academia. I really would like to stay, as you I always wanted to be a professor, even before knowing what I wanted to study. But at a certain point you have to say enough. When working on shortterm projects, I am always on the lookout for the next contract and cannot give a 100% for the current one, which is very frustrating. also the lack of be part of a community, let alone have a family, is challenging. I hope I get something for this year, and while on that job I will look for a good escape-route.",

Academics like to pitch the idea of academic vs non-academic as if it is two alternatives with 50/50 coverage.  The reality is that 99.9% of all work, all jobs, all opportunity is non-academic.  In all likelihood you will find something you will enjoy doing even more than the concept of professorship.",
