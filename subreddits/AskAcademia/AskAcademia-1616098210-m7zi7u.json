I can't reasonably and honestly tell myself it's worth it to pursue that since I'm low income, and on top of that, I've already lost most of my 20's and that period to risk experimenting. If I go for it and flounder, I'll be in my mid 30's by the time I get a masters and I'll have no safety net.\n\nBut I also don't have any other ideas what I want to do with my life, so I feel screwed no matter what.",

                  "text": "All I will say is, you really shouldn\u2019t paralyze yourself with fears of failures or what/ifs. It takes too much energy to worry about things that haven\u2019t happened yet, when you should be devoting your time to making things happen.\n\nFirst step, I would start with counselling to try and get someone more qualified than I am (we are) to help you come to a grounding of what might feel like a life worth living to you. We can chase dreams or accomplishments (which is the nature of academia), but forget to LIVE the life we want.\n\nI know many people who have all the accolades you think are necessary, and are still very unhappy. I know people with jobs and CVs I would be giddy over that are praying for a way out. Happiness is subjective, and I can promise you that finding it will not come through the material (but this is my perspective).\n\nIf this burden is already off your back, and you KNOW what you want to do. Then I highly recommend doing it. Whatever age. Work from the position backward to save yourself time in \u201cbecoming\u201d. I.e. What is the minimum you need to get in the door? \n\nIf academia is not your ultimate goal this is a lot more manageable, since most industries will have very clear descriptions in their job listings what is necessary to get hired (grad degree + 1 years exp; undergrad + 3 years, etc.). Continue to build your resume around that and keep banging your head on the door until they let you in. \n\nOn age, family, debt. You just have to weigh what you want with what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice. Many who go onto academia / grad school, end up poor into their mid-30s with debt. Many end up divorced and/or only can dream of starting a family around that time. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve thought fuck... I should have done a law degree, because I\u2019ve seen my college roommates go on to make 6 figures in cozy jobs, while I\u2019m just breaking even now. But that path would not have made me happy.\n\nMy suggestion is to really determine what you want out of life, and to have a candid conversation with yourself about the cruel reality that you will inevitably not get everything you want in the end (and that\u2019s honestly okay, but necessarily takes some sacrifice). \n\nIf the career path you described is absolutely what you want as a first order, and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice other things for it. The time is now.\n\nIf you grow up poor, marginalized in any way, you\u2019ll know how you\u2019re feeling and I empathize. I think our \u201crealm of the imaginable\u201d becomes constrained and all sorts of dreams and hopes become paths for somebody else - who has more money, who is smarter, who started earlier.  I would advise you against falling into that trap and believing in yourself. \n\nBill Burr is perhaps rightly in the news again for the wrong reasons, but a quote I saw of his sticks with me and stuck with me through my (later aged than you!) struggles:\n\n\u201cRealize that sleeping on a futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. You know what's worse, sleeping in a king bed next to a wife you're not really in love with but for some reason you married, and you got a couple kids, and you got a job you hate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s crass, but I think about it a lot. The \u201ceasier\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201ctimely\u201d route is rarely the best.",

This weasels out stories of the failures, and if they describe the unsuccessful person and it sounds like you, believe them.\n\n-Ask where their previous graduate students have gone on to.\n\n-Ask the PI specific questions to test their competence and mentoring.\n\nWhat is your mentorship style? \n(My red flag here is \"hands off\". This means you will not be getting training. Other types of mentors will describe how they mentor. Hands off is a cop out... they can't give you details about mentoring because they can't describe something they don't do). \n\nCompetence questions: \n\nWhat types of data analysis does your lab typically do? What programs do you use?\nHow do you organize data?\nWhat does the process of data analysis look like with you and your graduate students?\n\nWhat do you expect a typical week to look like for your graduate students?

However, most responses to this post and similar ones seem to focus entirely on supervisors who are either toxic or unresponsive, both of which can break your academic career. An even more common way that supervisors break their PhD students' careers is by simply not being famous and well connected enough and not introducing their students to the right people at the right times, or by not giving their students projects that are likely to lead to well cited glamor-journal papers on fashionable topics. The students finish their PhDs as unknowns with no connections and only a few papers in decent journals on topics people don't care about. Good luck starting a career like that.",

There are some people who are just superstars who would get jobs anyway, and some people who just aren't gonna cut it even if they had a CNS pub, but I would argue that for the majority of people who are in the middle, a huge publication can absolutely be the make-or-break factor.",

Plus, if you are FGLI or from an otherwise underprivileged background, your experience of grad school is significantly different from others, and being the only such person, can't find resources to talk about this to anyone. If you're an international student, you're always at the risk of losing immigration status if you end up with poor grades and can be kicked out of the country, something that doesn't happen to citizens. \n\nYou're experience =/= ultimate truth.

And with the huge oversupply of PhDs compared to available jobs, you teeter on the edge of unemployment as each contract ends.\n\nI should also mention that for many (most?) PhDs, the only way to \"use\" your PhD is to stay in academia and become a professor. By that I mean, no other jobs besides professor requires that PhD, and leaving academia would likely mean taking a job that only requires a MA, BA, or lower degree.

And, in general, I wish that education as an industry could get out of the major/topic/degree = specific job trap.\n\nI volunteer as a college admissions counselor with low-income/disadvantaged students, and although I do realize things have changed a lot since I was in college, so many of these kids are *so* pre-professional. It's not that they want to be - most of them are smart and curious and industrious - but they feel like they have to be in order to succeed. And it doesn't seem to be just because they are poorer; I also used to get paid to do college counseling with the exact opposite end of the economic spectrum, and my graduate degree was at one of those fancy places with a 5% acceptance rate and a $60K price tag. If anything, the wealthier students have a much strong pull in this particular direction.\n\nI am in a job that really only requires an MA (although in practice, most of the people on my team have a doctoral degree). As a doctoral student, I learned skills in program management, writing and communication, teaching/leading workshops, navigating bloated bureaucratic bullshit, giving presentations of varying different lengths, persuading people to give me money for things, managing a team, and juggling a whole bunch of things at the same time, just to name some things. Also, my graduate field is on face not super relevant to my work, but in reality I use the actual content and research I conducted in my doctoral program all the time - just applied to a completely different sphere.\n\nThere are lots of jobs like that.",

Thinking more deeply about what will make any individual successful will be more useful than chasing a name.  I can only speak to my experience - anecdote not data - but not once has the origin of somebodies PhD come up.  Sometimes advisor names come up (grad or post doc), so take that how you will, but because committees are diverse usually its meaningful to at most one person.\n\nOverall, saying that there's a pattern of professorships going to top tier graduates isn't saying much without also measuring and accounting for covariates - one big one being that those are often the better students to begin with. Without accounting for that  the analysis is fundamentally flawed.\n\nAll that being said, yeah, the pattern is there. Yes, students should very much think about all this sort of stuff going into it.  But it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy unfortunately, and it's not going to change without that perception - that a Ford is *fundamentally less quality* than an Audi, to use your example - also changing.

Graduate students are primarily roped in to ease the workload for TT professors. Graduate students are a disposable workforce. By the time a graduate student is in the back end of their education, exhausted and disenchanted, and ready to quit, a new crop of first years is arriving bright-eyed and ready to study their passion for a living.  \n\n\nAlso, meritocracy is largely a myth. People get published, get teaching awards, grants, etc. for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with how good a researcher or teacher they are.",

If anything I prefer it in industry - at least everyone is *up front* about the fact that schmoozing is the name of the game.",

              "text": "It's not really an analogy. Academia is a [tournament-oriented labor market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_theory) that has a pyramid power structure built on at least two layers: (1) a rewarded and protected top class (e.g., professors) that controls and exploits (2) a cheap, skilled labor force (e.g., undergrads, graduate students, and postdocs) that is highly motivated by promises of future ascent into the top rank. In many instances, the lower level is actually *paying* the top level via tuition or voluntary time for these future rewards. There are other power layers to the pyramid (e.g., deans, provosts, presidents, funders), but the bulk of the operation is these core two layers. Practices and organizations with similar power structures are drug [cartels](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2013/11/academic-cartel).\n\nLike a lot of 'apprenticeship trades', power in the academy is highly asymmetric concentrated at the top of the pyramid, where there are few positions that everyone wants. Members at the bottom of the pyramid seek to progress, but that progress is entirely dependent upon the close personal approval and support of the powers above them. Further, those at the top either directly or indirectly exploit those beneath them using the 'carrot on the end of a long stick' method to entice cheap/voluntary labor (e.g., publishing, writing grants, supervising other students, peer review, side-projects) that benefits those at the top. In return, those at the bottom are rewarded not with real forms of compensation, but instead with a non-guaranteed support to progress their careers.\n\nThe main saving grace is that *some* academics aren't malevolent about any of this and mean well. \n\nWhile the above features are similar to other corporate structures the main differences in academia are: \n\n1. academic labor is grossly underpaid and non-permanent (a MSc + PhD + Postdoc might see 12 years of their prime with an average annual salary ~$30k for that time and can be let go rather easily), \n1. your ability to progress is personally controlled by only a few people (none of which is you), and \n1. there are far more people trying to get to the top than can possibly attain that goal.",

Yes, things ease up and life improves in many ways, but the game doesn't change all that much, you just become less vulnerable and more inured to it.",

I run into this problem every time my contract is up for renewal.\n\nSure, this happens a lot outside of academia too, but having worked both in and out of academia it is definitely stronger in it.

Academia is largely about *ideas* and less about *action*. Universities make a statement about being against systemic racism? Great, here's how I've been affected -- and continue to be affected -- by it! Wanna help? Every single person who has the power to alleviate pressure tells me I'm dealing with *personal problems*. *No shit, that's how systemic racism works, and what it looks like.* I've been at multiple universities now, and all of them are horseshit. The most recent one I was at wouldn't give me a start-up bonus that I needed in order to make the move, and leveraged me into doing a two-month salary advance that I had to pay back over 6 months -- non negotiable, because it was \"the best they could do\". Enter COVID: suddenly they're offering $10k (roughly the same amount as a two month salary advance for me) that any faculty member who was affected by covid directly can pay back over **3 years**. I'm sitting over here for 6 months practically starving, unable to pay my bills or debts because they cut my wages in half....and I don't come from wealth because of the racist legacy my inheritance had to put up with ----\n\n--- oh but the University is *totally* against systemic racism.....\n\nThey'll have all kinds of seminar talks about these things and about ideas, but its largely a circlejerk because most of the people in attendence are those who already agree with one another. They focus all of their progressive talks and shit to other faculty and students  -- but those who have the power to change things, and make a difference (Dean, Provost, President, etc), are seldom -- if ever -- in the room. If they are in the room, they'll go along agreeing with everyone else -- passively ignored at the fact that *THEYRE* the reason this is an on-going issue in the first place.\n\nEdit- for some minor errors",

I was rejected for a PhD I was put up for by my PI (I was doing my masters in their lab and they felt I was well-qualified for the project) and was told by a member of the recruitment panel it was because other candidates had done industrial placements and years abroad so they were more competitive. I explained that I couldn't do that, because of care responsibilities, and they said I should have put that in my application (like sure, I'll drop it in the \"reasons I couldn't move my life abroad for a year\" section). I wrote a letter to the head of department, and pointed out that the burden of care responsibility falls disproportionately on women which may lead them to being unable to uproot their lives to become more \"competitive\". They basically brushed me off with a generic \"gosh, we acknowledge your points, although that does sound like a YOU problem\" reply. I got my PhD through alternative funding, but the \"we support women in science\" poster drives me up the wall.\n\nMore recently, some senior members of staff were talking about how they were recruiting a PI for a committee, and they couldn't think of a single younger woman or person of colour that they could put forward for the position. The department is majority female and we have a healthy proportion of POC, yet for some reason they're not in positions of seniority. The women in the department who are PIs tend to be a lot older than the male PIs, and the people of colour are... few and far between. It's almost like they pat themselves on the back for the raw representation numbers, without thinking about the systemic structures that prevent certain people from rising to the top? /s",
