  "text": "To start I am getting a phd in the humanities. Right now I am doing interdisceplenary work with disability studies. I am, myself, neurodivergent with ADHD, extreme Dysgraphia, and Bi-polar disorder. I try not to harp on my brain differences and most people wouldn\u2019t notice. \n\nThere are no disability scholars in my program but an African American Studies scholar agreed to be my chair. I thought it would be great b/c they would be well versed in minority identites and the intersections of it.\n\nBut my chair has fought me every step of the way. She refers to a lot of disabilities as \u201cdeformities.\u201d I\u2019ve never once used that word. And instead of helping flush out my ideas, they\u2019d just full on challenge them. They said things like \u201cdisability stories didn\u2019t belong\u201d and that I was trying to hard to \u201cforce a discourse.\u201d\n\nThen it got worse. They didn\u2019t want me to use a recorder, or voice to text software when speaking to her. A laptop was also out of the question. This was difficult since dysgraphia makes it difficult to write. But though difficult, not impossible, I complied. Eventually though, she was vocal against my stimming. To stim, I just draw dashes or stars in the margin. You can barely notice. But she said that she met freshman with more control than I did.\n\nSo last week I broke down. I went to my university crisis center, then to the emergency room, then a hospital for two days. It was rough and the anxiety was really getting to me. TBH, I was close to downing a whole bottle of adderall.\n\nAnyway, word got back to the department chair and he invited me to coffee, just to check in. I told him everything and also provided some emails in which she said I was a bad representation of neurodivergence. She also said that bad work would make things harder for future autistics. I am not autistic. But even if I was ??? \n\nThe department chair then looked over some of the things that I submitted but were ultimately rejected by my chair. He didnt say much but he said that that kind of treatment wasn\u2019t normal. \n\n\u201cIf you decide to retaliate with a case, please talk to me first,\u201d he said. I dont want to pursue or retaliate in anyway. That statement came as a shock. I was just glad that someone with authority could look at me and say \u201cno, she\u2019s wrong. you\u2019re doing good.\u201d I was really beginning to doubt myself. \n\nI do not want to cause an uproar but some of my peers are now writing and signing a letter calling for more need of awareness and respect to grad students. They are not pointing any fingers but this spreading story is contributing. I did tell many of my friends why I was in the hospital.\n\nBut should I continue to go along with this? I have not signed the letter. I don\u2019t want to cause trouble. What should i do?",

Retaliate makes it sound as though she harmed you so you want to harm her, when it would more accurately be described as her causing harm and you documenting it. You don't have to pursue any formal steps, but I think it's important to recontextualize what would actually be happening: a professor who has demonstrated harmful behavior toward you (and likely toward others) would *potentially* receive likely very mild consequences for her own bad behavior. She set this in motion, not you or anyone else.",

I'm no longer at university, but as a neurodivergent student myself, and an autistic it would destroy me to be treated like that, like you I think there would have been a risk of OD. I was lucky, my dissertation supervisor was a great guy, especially once he knew about my issues, really couldn't have done enough and went on the initiative to ensure things were accessible. I think that was because I went to a uni with roughly 40% disabled students, and the lecturers knew how to handle that. But as a grad student its all the more important for you to be given that help to succeed, and for someone to be blocking that? They need to be sorted out, one way or another for you and other students, to whom she is likely doing the same thing",

We should be calling it out when we see it. OP's \"whole world\" wasn't \"crushed because someone was a dick,\" but rather she noted that her rights were being violated, and she she sought out advice on how to deal with it appropriately. She's been very conservative in her reactions so far, especially contrasted against her department chair (who rightfully notes that the university may be liable for retribution) and the other students (who have championed her cause.) \n\nWhy be a dick to someone, just because? What has OP done to you to warrant your condescention and snarkiness? Are you personally offended by her disability?\n\nLet's make note that OP's professor didn't \"look at her funny,\" but engaged in systemic harassment, and quite possibly violated the ADA, depending on whether or not OP's request for an audio recorder/computer was been approved by the disability office.\n\nGood God, when we see injustice, how about we fucking stand up for the right thing, and support the rights of those whose rights are being violated?

Even if they aren't registered, these accommodations shouldn't be a burden to any PI, unless they are openly discussing confidential information (e.g. HIPAA records).\n\nWe also know that the treatment that this student is receiving is not appropriate, and that even a department chair believes that this student has grounds for recourse, legal or otherwise.\n\nSo what's your point here? That neurodiverse people don't belong in academia? That allowing accommodations to people with disabilities is a mistake? Should we get rid of the ADA altogether?

                  "text": ">\"...beyond normal ones for blind or hearing impaired...\"\n\nHeads up, disability advocates! There's a new guy that can tell us which accommodations are legitimate and which accommodations are not legitimate. Apparently sensory loss is a \"real\" disability, so we can give 'em braille and hearing aids and crap. \n\nUnfortunately, cerebral palsy didn't make the list, just sensory loss. No broken legs or paraplegia, either. Blindness and deafness are the \"real\" disabilities, according to him. Good - all those people in wheelchairs, taking up the whole sidewalk... I'll be glad when /u/savealltheelephants gets those cripples off our campus.\n\nThough I don't know, maybe he wasn't talking about wheelchairs. Maybe he's fine with people whose legs don't work. Now, people without arms... they're screwed in /u/savealltheelephants's world. After all, if you can't write something down on paper, you belong in a trade school. I'm not sure which trade takes people without arms, but I'm sure they'll find one. \n\nBut, you know, sometimes those armless people actually have valuable contributions. I've heard 'em say some clever stuff before, maybe we'll keep them around. After all, if you give them a computer with voice recognition (or eye gaze) to write their papers, and maybe let them use an audio recorder for note-taking, they can do a great job. After all, they just have *physical* disabilities, but their brains are fine.\n\nBut wait a minute. It turns out that our OP, /u/MinervaMinkMink, needs the exact same accommodations! All she asked for was a computer and/or audio recorder! Why would we give these accommodations to a student with a physical disability, but not a student with a cognitive disability?\n\nMaybe students with cognitive disabilities are just stupid. They belong in trade schools, according to /u/savealltheelephants. But wait... it actually turns out that [intelligence is separate from these cognitive impairments](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325715.php). You can have some [very smart people](https://addadult.com/add-education-center/famous-people-with-adhd/) with cognitive disorders such as ADHD or dysgraphia. (Maybe not Paris Hilton or Glenn Beck, but I see some M.D.s and Pulitzer Prize-winners on that list.) \n\nSo, I guess people with cognitive disorders can be decent at this whole \"education\" thing, if we just give them the reasonable accommodations that they need. And the emphasis is on \"reasonable.\" I know you say \n\n>It's college, it's supposed to be tough and sort out the weak\n\nbut nobody is asking for you to give them the answers or lower your standards or expectations. The accommodations that people request are deemed \"reasonable\" by a disability office that understands these people better than you do, and they allow people to overcome very specific deficits. They aren't admitting neanderthals to college and rigging the system to let them succeed, they are admitting students who have demonstrated that they are qualified to take on the academic challenge, and putting them in a position to show off their knowledge and understanding.",

Until people like her get a seat at the table, it will just be people like you talking about how much of a hassle it is to make sure everybody's included. Good God, she asked for an audio recorder, and you told her she's not fit for academia. Her department chair supports her position!

Change chairs, graduate, and then laugh every time in the future the university calls you asking for a donation.  \n\nHowever, if you want, you are entitled to run this up the flagpole.  I assume you are in the US.  Read your university's discrimination policy.  There will be a mechanism for you to file a complaint and an office on campus that handles and investigates these complaints.  If you would like someone to help you through the process, someone in either a disability/accessibility office, or the Dean of Students office, or in an ombuds office should be able to help you understand your rights as a student at your university.  \n\nSometimes in these policies, it asks to see if you can solve the problem locally before filing a formal complaint.  That is what your department chair is offering when he asks that you meet with him first.  It is possible that he can do something to help your situation so you can feel comfortable completing your degree.  It is up to you to decide what your ultimate goal is.",

At my university, having an accommodations plan (typically made with your professors with a mediator) gives you rights (for a lack of better words) for when your advisor starts asking for things that are made complicated due to any differences you may experience. \n\nSecondly, maybe having a conversation with your dean of students or head of apartment in conjunction with your advisor might resolve the issue.
