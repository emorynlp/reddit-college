  "text": "Im a master student about to submit my first ever manuscript for publication. For some reason my multiple supervisors kept throwing responsibility to one another on giving me an example template. Now I can reach neither of them. \n\nI have never seen an editorial letter before and a bit desperate since the deadline is Monday. So any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: as it turned out (as my supervisor had confirmed), it is indeed an editorial cover letter and not an LTE. Not sure why she said it as \"submission letter to the editor\" and refused to just say \"cover letter\". Thanks for all your help and sorry for the confusion",

See this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor) for more details if you're interested.\n\n\n\"Cover letter\" = what you're talking about.  It's a letter to accompany your paper, to explain why you think it should be considered/published.  The explanations and templates you found online are fine, and you can google \"journal paper cover letter\" to see many more examples.  Honestly, just look at the examples online and write one - it's a bit silly to stress out waiting for your supervisors to send you something that you can easily find yourself with a few seconds on google.",
