      "text": "Its always been this way. I am reminded of this anecdote from 'American Prometheus', a biography of Oppenheimer:\n\n> When the young physicist Harold Agnew challenged Oppenheimer to explain why a plumber could earn nearly three times the pay of a college graduate, Oppie replied that the plumbers had no idea of the laboratory's importance to the War effort, whereas the scientists did\u2014and that, explained Oppenheimer, justified the pay difference. The scientists, at least, were not working for the money.\n\nIt makes you laugh but also makes you sad.",

          "text": "Not only did the plumbers not understand the importance, most people in general didn't (and don't). Demand for some service (and it's price) is greatly influenced by most people.\n\nI'd put a different spin on this though. Say a plumber and a physicist are working on some big campus. How many people near the campus could use a plumbers services? How about the physicist? The plumber can easily find other work in the surrounding area. The physicist would likely have to move to find different work. In that sense, it's easier for the plumber to leave and so they need to be compensated for staying. The plumber also benefits from people's urgency. You want your toilet working NOW. The physicist is all about making improvements to LATER. Most people seem to value NOW more than LATER.\n\nI'm very appreciative of the contributions made by scientists and academics, but explanations like Oppenheimer's make \"ordinary\" people look stupid, when I don't think they are. Specifically, I think most non-college educated people are smarter than the college educated give credit, and most college educated are dumber than society gives credit.\n\nOur society has, in a sense, fetishized abstract thinking. This made everyone think it best to go to college, where such thinking is practiced. There are a lot (dare I say most?) of jobs though that have to do with physical or social skills and little to do with the abstract. Such jobs are important and often well paid. Choosing to take one doesn't make you dumb, nor do only dumb people choose to take them.\n\nThe older I get and the more people I meet, the more I think maybe us abstract thinkers are the idiots. Trying to cut the ropes to reality so we can hoist some big idea into a sterile place we can work with it. A lot of us float away with our idea and never figure out how to tie it back to reality.",

It\u2019s a simple fact:   If people with options take lower-paying jobs, it\u2019s because they\u2019re motivated by something other than pay.  \n\nThat\u2019s why working in the video game industry sucks:   Because people think making video games is cool and will accept shit working conditions to do it.   It\u2019s why nonprofits get anyone to work for them, in spite of being hugely underfunded and often hugely dysfunctional places to work.    Maybe it\u2019s helping people, maybe it\u2019s designing awesome cars, maybe it\u2019s the status boost that you get when people call you \u2018professor\u2019, maybe it\u2019s getting interesting abstract problems to work on, maybe it\u2019s six weeks of paid vacation a year.

The colleges have to compete at least with the low-end of the scale to retain them. This is less of an issue with hard science PhDs as there are fewer avenues for them to leave academia, but they are still somewhat well compensated. This is a non-issue with some humanities and liberal arts PhDs, because there are almost no [lucrative] venues for them to pursue private employment. I suppose a lucky few will find amazing jobs as say the bioethicist at google or something, but so long as there is a surplus of qualified individuals willing to work a TTAP job for $60k a year, the university won't pay a penny more than they have to. As it stands each TTAP posting in the humanities gets 300+ applications, so the university can basically low-ball everyone and still expect to find excellent candidates.\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"deserve\", as almost nothing in our society does.",

CS also pays well, and decent business schools can start junior faculty on $200k+ in fields like finance/marketing). \n\nHowever in many euro countries (eg the UK) there are academic unions which are basically run by useless humanities/social science professors who demand pay parity across disciplines, with the result that academics in computer science/economics/etc end up getting paid the same salary as academics in sociology/media studies/etc despite the former having far better industry options.
