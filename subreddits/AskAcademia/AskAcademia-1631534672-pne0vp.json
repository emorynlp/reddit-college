  "title:": "Looking for a good fit for a doctoral program",
  "text": "Good (whatever time),\n\nI'm a data scientist (B.S. in aerospace engineering, M.S. in computer science with emphasis in M.L.) who's interested in melding human and machine learning in ways that increase the effectiveness of a population of human learners. My research has already begun and I'm working towards a final, useful, application.\n\nI'm reasonably sure that the level of research is appropriate for a doctoral program and I'm looking for a program that will work well with / for me.\n\nMy dream program would be fully remote and part time. The field of study is interdisciplinary but could probably nest under a computer science, neuroscience, cognitive science, or even educational science program.\n\nAny leads / pointers would be very helpful and thank you very much for your time.",

      "text": "Honestly, I would say the most important part is finding faculty that support your work, rather than the label of the field it is under.\n\nObviously you've done a bit of research on this already.  What I would suggest is to reach out to those who have published research/papers that most closely align or resemble the project you have in mind, and reach out to them directly - maybe giving them a sample of your work, and asking if they would be willing to oversee your doctoral project.  If they don't have such space, then you can ask which programs they would recommend.\n\nHope that helps",

Even if you can find a program that would take you on these terms, you would instantly be at the bottom of the priority list for your advisor's time, which is the most valuable aspect of a doctoral program. \n\nYour best bet is some sort of industry focused professional doctorate, but keep in mind you would probably be paying out of pocket for this.",
