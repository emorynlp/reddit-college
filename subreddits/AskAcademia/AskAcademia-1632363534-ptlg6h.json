  "title:": "Should I request authorship on a paper that has my data in the supplementary info?",
  "text": "Hi all, I was reading a recently-published paper which was authored by my former undergrad mentor today. I did a year-long thesis with her in undergrad. When I was browsing the supplementary information, I found about two pages worth of data/analysis as well as one figure that was pulled directly from my thesis work. The writing itself was not mine, but it very closely paraphrased certain parts of my thesis. However, I am not sure if this means I am owed authorship on the paper given that my work only appears in the supplemental. What should I do? I am applying for graduate school this year so evidence of contributing to a paper would be really helpful for me..",

      "text": "I think people often get confused over data ownership. Was it your idea that you collected data for, independent of your mentor, in that you were self-funded and not funded as a larger part of their project? If you are funded as a part of a grant, or the work that you did was considered to be a part of that grant, then the IP is your mentor's, regardless. Having, said that data curation is a major contribution that should still be acknowledged. \n\nI think that as it is supplemental material only, then it is not a significant contribution to the actual piece of work but you should have some citation or acknowledgement.\n\nMany academics and universities are now using the credit matrix:\n\nhttps://casrai.org/credit/\n\n As an undergrad, you are not supposed to know this stuff but in future, it is always best to be up front and ask if there is a possibility of authorship from any work you are doing, not saying this is the case here but senior academics often take advantage of juniors and it needs to stop being the norm. In my experience, no one ever gets angry at you for asking this question, if they do then they are not a mentor you should be wanting to work with. First author papers are generally what are being looked at but there is also nothing wrong with you noting that you contributed to the paper in this way.",

      "text": "Wow these comments are a lot more nuanced than I was expecting! In biology (and I'm imagining a lot of the sciences), if data that you personally collected was used anywhere in the paper, including the supplement, then you are definitely owed authorship. \n\nThe exception would be if your data is part of another publication that was just reproduced in the supplement of this other paper for convenience",

If you only did an expt without knowing the big picture, goals, and outcomes, it may not be enough for an authorship. Again, it depends on the field and the community.",

      "text": "I've been author on a paper for much much less. You should definitely get credit for your work. It is a tricky situation since the paper is already published. I suppose it may be possible to add you as an author with an addendum. But this is a journal-specific thing and you likely wouldn't get cited as often (people don't always have the addended versions when citing). Either way,  it would take some serious pressure to convince your ex-advisor to go that route. Whether that would be  worth it depends on the value of this paper vs. the value of your relationship with that ex-advisor. My instinct is that you should treat this as a wash and forget about it so you don't hurt relationships. That is a really shitty situation. I'm sorry.",

Two pages of data and analysis has a much different impact if it is part of a 5-page supplement and the work serves as direct inspiration/template for the main paper, compared to if it is part of a 60-page supplement summarizing previous work from the lab. The former may warrant an authorship, while the latter may call for a mention in the acknowledgements, maybe even a general one (along the lines of \"thank you to past students\"), or nothing at all.\n\nRegardless, it is still something you can mention in graduate applications.",

My guess based on what you've told us is that this is more of an acknowledgement situation rather than an authorship, but of course we don\u2019t have all the details.",

      "text": "Different PIs have different definitions of who should be on the paper. Unfortunately, the ruling will always go to the corresponding author that had the grant used to fund the paper. Academia is very political. \n\nDo you need this PI for a recommendation? If yes, then don't ask. Email the PI and point out your contribution to the paper and ask her to mention it in the recommendation letter. I got into grad school with no publication but had great letters. If you don't need her recommendation, then you can ask her for her reasoning, but she will most likely push you off because 1) they're busy and don't want to waste their time on unproductive things, 2) they don't want to look bad to the editors because even publication is political and dependent on who you know, and 3) you are of no use to her now, so why does she need to do anything for you? \n\nIf I were the PI, I would totally give you authorship, but I'm not the PI. My PI has an unspoken policy that once you are out of his lab, then you won't get authorship regardless of your contribution unless it was agreed upon prior to leaving. \n\nGood luck. Don't feel too bad. There are more opportunities and more injustice waiting for you in this extremely long journey!! \n\n(sorry for being so cynical but these are all lessons that I have learned while fighting for my own authorship battle).",

The overarching concept is that of a 'significant\" contribution to the work.\n\nIf the PI followed the ICMJE guidelines, again, you would not qualify for authorship as contributing to the writing and revising for 'intellectual content\" are also requirements.\n\nThat being said, I personally ensure that all who contribute data are included as authors (by making sure they are involved in the writing process).  That being said, the PI in your case does have grounds to not include you (although you could check specifically the journal guidelines on authorship).\n\nLastly, just be aware that if you do decide to pursue it, your PI is likely to fight tooth and nail.",
