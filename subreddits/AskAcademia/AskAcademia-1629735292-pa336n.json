  "title:": "Is it possible to conduct research in different disciplines that are not necessarily related?",
  "text": "Hello. \n\nI have interests in computer science and cognitive psychology (also psychological counseling). I am aware these two fields can be combined in order to do artificial intelligence research. However, I am interested in cognitive psychology mainly because I dream about increasing human intelligence, just like bodybuilding. So, that is an unrelated field of study (Working memory training, far transfer, near transfer, training neural substrates etc.) from artificial intelligence. But I am also interested in computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\nCan I do research in both? Is this possible in academia? Perhaps this is a bit of a stretch, but can I also do psychological counseling on the side? It is fine if I can't do that, but I really want to do research in both.",

Usually people who do this focus on specific areas like modeling a specific cognitive faculty and then training ML algorithms to perform similar behavior.",

      "text": "I think it would be extremely difficult to become an expert in two unrelated sets of methods and theory in order to be a functional researcher in both fields, let alone also developing the competency to be a counselor, which would typically be a 3rd doctorate. And then you would be obligated to keep up with the evolving literature in each area if you want to remain relevant and you would need to work across all the field somewhat continuously in order to not lose your competency in the methods.\n\nIn general, the realistic way to do research in two different areas is if they share a knowledge base (e.g., doing counseling and separately doing human subjects research on memory) or if you are applying the same methods to different areas, which you would typically do in collaboration with subject-matter experts in those fields (I think AI could apply here, certainly statisticians and economists do this a lot).",

Most investigators are barely able to get funded for one area of research.\n\nIf you'd like an example, [Erez Lieberman Aiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erez_Lieberman_Aiden) is someone who is a professor of CS  (amongst other accomplishments) and has been able to be involved in multiple fields in academia, but this is very rare.",
