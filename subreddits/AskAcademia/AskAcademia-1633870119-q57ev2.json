  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm on a one-year contract for a Visiting Assistant Professorship. After I was hired, one of the members of the search committee told me that I should \"definitely not be thinking of this as a one-year position,\" even though the original job posting didn't state anything about the possibility of renewal.\n\nThe chair of the department has indicated that there *may* be the possibility for another year, but didn't say anything more than that.\n\nAt the moment, I'm very concerned about what I should be prioritizing. This is a teaching-heavy VAP \u2014 4/4, writing-intensive classes, all new preps, no TA \u2014 and I assume course reviews and a teaching observation will impact the decision to extend a contract or not. Then again, it may have more to do with their budget, and I'm not sure what that looks like right now. At any rate, I'm applying to other jobs this year, so I need to keep up my research activities. But it's been difficult to do research with so much teaching, and since the possibility of renewal is a definite \"maybe,\" I've been putting most of my eggs in the teaching basket so far.\n\nWe're halfway through the semester and I'm at a bit of a loss. Would it be appropriate for me to ask the chair about the factors that may impact this decision? My instinct tells me \"no,\" but I could be totally off here.\n\nOne more thing: has anyone with a VAP or postdoc found it really hard to get to know your colleagues? It's like there's a wall around me due to my precarity and lower rank. I've seen TT faculty interact with other contract faculty in this very distant manner, and I really don't care for it!",

      "text": "I was a VAP for three years. I never had a problem with the TT faculty, but only made friends with the permanent NTT faculty.\n\nIgnore the possibility of renewal when it comes to job searching. You need to prioritize finding other jobs. They could be 100% honest that their intention is renewal, but no one you talked to actually controls the budget for hiring faculty, and even if they did, budget cuts can still happen that eliminate the position later this year anyway. Until you have a contract for next year, you NEED to act like you wont have a job here next year.\n\nAlso, for a VAP renewal you really only have to be good at teaching, not great. Most chairs/deans will consider it better to keep a VAP who\u2019s pretty ok (and not do a new search) than have to go through the search process again.\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do a good job, but if you\u2019re focusing on excellent teaching to keep this VAP vs research productivity to get a TT job, your priorities are off.",

      "text": "I did a three-year VAP prior to being hired on the tenure-track.  But it was advertised as a three-year VAP, so I knew renewal was not on the table.\n\nHowever, I didn't want renewal. I wanted TT.  So like every other (sensible, forward-thinking) VAP, my focus was on my research.  So should yours be.\n\nDo a competent teaching job.  Get to know your supervisor (chair, senior colleagues, whoever) by making an appointment to talk with them, by sharing your syllabi and ny asking questions.  Asking for their advice gets them invested in your success.  Never forget that they are going to be writing a really important letter of rec for you as you apply to TT jobs.",

      "text": "Some thoughts, speaking as someone who was formerly a VAP and is now in a tenure-track position:\n\n1. Do not assume you will be rehired next year. This was advertised as a one-year position, and you should assume that is the only thing that is promised. It may very well be possible that you are offered another contract. It's also possible that you are not. It's even possible that the department *wants* to offer you another one-year contract but the institution decides not to due to budget or enrollment reasons. Unfortunately, that is the reality of contingent employment.\n\n2. Balancing teaching and scholarship is difficult, all the moreso with a 4/4 teaching load. (I hope you have at least one multiple of the same class and/or can teach the same class again in the spring, which will hopefully cut down on the future teaching workload.) For what it's worth, your scholarship may have a heavy influence in your ability to land a tenure-track position but will likely have little if any influence in whether or not your contract is renewed as a VAP. My suggestion would be something along the lines of the following: A) focus right now on developing strong courses and doing an effective job as an instructor, B) on applying for jobs, and C) any low-hanging fruit in terms of scholarship (e.g., submitting research you've already conducted for publication). Next semester, put more time into newer research projects, to the extent possible (hopefully teaching courses that are not new preps makes this more possible).\n\n3. Find opportunities to talk with people you trust in your department and/or your department chair. You can be direct: you're trying to find a balance between prepping and teaching courses and your scholarship, and want their advice on finding a good balance. Everyone will have been in the position of teaching a bunch of new preps before (and all the more recently for the junior tenure-track colleagues), and many people will be happy to provide advice or tell you how they went about trying to balance these different obligations.\n\n4. As far as what you discuss with your chair, you might frame it in terms of something along the lines of the following: 1) you're applying for positions elsewhere (which any reasonable person would with an expiring contract), 2) you enjoy being at your current institution and have heard that sometimes one year VAPs have their contract extended, and 3) you are wondering what kinds of factors might influence a renewal--particularly anything you can do on your end. I would recommend this being a conversation in real time rather than an email.\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to be in a new place, prepping several classes, trying to find time to be an active scholar, and also applying for jobs elsewhere. Please be kind to yourself as you navigate this all. Best of luck about the possibility of renewal or, even better, for your tenure-track applications!",
