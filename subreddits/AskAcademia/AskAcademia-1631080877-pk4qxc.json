  "title:": "Postdoc burnout - No real excuse - Need advice",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019ve completed my PhD in Economics a year ago at a good department in the middle of the Covid pandemic, and was offered a 3 year-postdoc before even going on the job market (which I think is very specific to Economics). I ended up in another good department, with very nice people. I have a super supportive advisor, I cannot complain about the work environment at all. \n\nYet I am crying every single morning. \n\nWork-wise, I have a few research projects going on, not all of them very promising and therefore hard to push for good publication. I also need to find a new job market paper (understand a new thesis project) for next year if I want to stay in academia. This makes me feel completely drowned in a fuzzy and disorganized never ending and panic inducing to-do list. \nPersonally-wise, the pandemic was associated for me with a lot of traumatic moves cross continents and 8 months without a real home, so the idea of having to move to a new place at the end of my postdoc and then eventually at the end of my tenure track possibly is making the future terribly stressful in my eyes. \n\nNone of this comes from my work environment, and more from my feeling that academia is a constant (very competitive) selection process. And I was fine with it until now, where I really feel like I\u2019m not good enough to go through it smoothly, and I\u2019m not sure anymore I can take the stress of it. Is this a common feeling? Or is it the sign that I should get out and pick a different career path? Because right now I feel like I\u2019m in flight mode and would leave my job in a heartbeat if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I genuinely like my co-authors and don\u2019t want to leave them hanging.\n\nThanks a ton.",

      "text": "I'll offer my perspective as an early career TT faculty member and from the perspective that your post reads less about the uncertainty of academia (because of your successes to date, which are significant given COVID) and more as opening up about trauma from COVID.\n\nWhile the culture of academia and its job market are daunting and near soul crushing, the compounding effects of experiencing it during a pandemic should not be taken lightly.\n\nIn 2020, I defended in a bedroom in my in-laws house, sitting on the carpet. I committed to a job a week before institutions started pulling their job listings, scared to email the search chair to see if my job would still exist in the fall. We moved across the US to a city my wife and son had never visited because COVID meant we couldn't just fly out to check it out. We didn't look for houses because of this, and because we waited for a few months, the housing market blew up. The list goes on, of muted successes, missed chances, or seeming failures, all because of COVID.\n\nI thought I was somewhat alone in this, until I participated in a fellowship for early career faculty in my discipline this past summer. We were all 'successes', defending and landing TT positions in a pandemic. It was wild (and oddly comforting) seeing how many of us were struggling with mental health issues because of the isolation COVID has wrought.\n\nI say all of this to preface two recommendations: (1) don't give up on your postdoc or any desire to stay in academia until you devote time to your feelings about work from COVID-induced trauma, and (2) as part of your program development during your postdoc, allocate hours, particularly during year 1, to your mental health recovery.\n\nI do better if I treat my mental health as part of my research program, as another task I allocate time to. However you handle it, what are you doing for your mental health right now? What's your plan for it for the next year, and what's your long-range plan for it?",

But already during my PhD, the pressure I was feeling was so intense that two therapists suggested separately to put me on antidepressants. And so I did have a treatment for half of my PhD (incredibly helpful btw), before COVID.\nAnd so perhaps this is 75% me and how my brain is wired, perhaps 15% my department (which was one of the good but tough ones) but I keep wondering if there\u2019s not a remaining 10% that\u2019s because of how academia is and that it clearly doesn\u2019t mix well with my 75% stressed out brain.",

The thing is, even if you beat the competition and land an AP job, which in itself isn't going to be easy in this market, the game will only continue. Academia isn't for everyone and I think it is perfectly fine to recognize those feelings and look for something else. The good news is, as an economist, you will have an easier time transitioning to industry or government jobs as your skillset is in high demand. I'm a sociologist, on my second tenure track and feel very similar. Took me a while to act on it, but I'm applying and already getting bites (and so far, feels way easier than any academic job market I've been on).",

In academia after your postdoc you will need to find a new job and even if score a permanent position, they still can fire you if they decide to downsize the department. \n\nIf you can, move out of the academia ratrace. You can still do research for example be an economics writer or so. But the search for the Uni positions is very hard and can burn you out indeed. \n\nIf you find a new job, don't worry about your co-authors, they will be fine. You can still give some assistance to the paper you want to publish with them but the big academia stress will be of your shoulders. Seriously, look outside and find a new job.",

Mental health isn't a competition, you feel, how you feel. \n\nSo personally I don't think liking your coauthors and not wanting to let them down is a particularly good reason to stay in a career. There are good people in lots of jobs and  people move on all the time so they won't be your coauthors for very long. That's not to say you should jack in your job and quit but I do think you might want to really think about what you want to do. It took me over a year to decide to jump from research into a different career, which did end up being at a research institute but doing something quite different and I have no regrets and not sure why I needed to take so long to decide!\n\nI recommend this a lot but if you can afford it try having a few sessions with a career coach. They can help you identify the things that are important to you about your career and get you thinking about options and next steps but in a manageable way, plus it can be a bit of light therapy just talking through your feelings and issues with a sympathetic professional.",

Do nothing associated with work. Just take some time to breathe. \n\nLong term, assess how you felt before the pandemic. Did you feel this way about academia / academic stress prior to the pandemic? Do you think you could see things getting better once you have a better grasp on a 'good' project and once you're more settled in your work?",

Definitely recommend taking a step back and reevaluating how you want your life to look like (is tenure track worth the stress?).
