  "text": "I'm a second year grad student who just attended his first conference. It was online via zoom, and I presented a poster to a modest audience of ~50. \n\nOne member of the audience really didn't like my work (big name prof at UCL). He had a few valid criticisms (I was a bit too liberal in my conclusions and interpretations that I should have seen and fixed) but he took it another step and called my experiments meaningless. Now a group of 50 of my peers think I'm an idiot. My advisor was chairing another session so he wasn't there to hear what happened.",

Everyone\u2019s always worried about running into one of these overly argumentative people at their talk (and it really is super rare), but as an audience member when I\u2019ve seen things like this happen I always think poorly of the person arguing in a public setting, not the speaker. \n\nIn fact one of my \u2018favorite\u2019 instances of this happening at a large international meeting, I can\u2019t even remember what the speaker was talking about, who they were, or what the issue was, but I ABSOLUTELY remember the audience member stomping around at the microphone repeatedly yelling \u2018I\u2019m an expert on this!\u2019 and yet really not adding anything of value outside of saying they didn\u2019t believe the speaker. Sometimes I\u2019ll still randomly yell \u2018I\u2019m an expert on this!\u2019 to colleagues that were present at that talk lol. \n\nAnd to be clear- sometimes a heated debate can be constructive. But it\u2019s the people that just seem to lose their minds and want to try to belittle someone else\u2019s work to make theirs seem superior that are the problem. And that it tends to be directed at younger trainees just trying to do their best is what irks me.",

OK, fair enough - in some ways getting these questions is great prep for your PhD defense (where professors might even be nicer than Dr. Super Critical here.) Anyway, that guy got up to give his talk and it was terrible, with slides that were all small size text and very few photos or plots. I've yet to see him at another conference since.\n\nIn cases where the mean guy is a famous professor, believe me people talk and it's not good. Nobel Prize winner?

      "text": "My egomaniac ex-supervisor did something like this to one of their own students during the questioning part of the presentation at a seminar. The student was visibly hesitant and uncomfortable, and one of the senior profs stepped in to defend them politely against their own supervisor. I was at the back and could see the other researchers in the department look at one another with confusion, and a while later, I was chatting with some of the other students, and they commented on how bizarre that was. In almost every presentation, it was guaranteed that this supervisor would attempt to put the presenter down somehow (their own student or not) to show how clever they were. The worst part was that often it wasn't really valid criticism meant to improve the research, just attempting to poke holes for the sake of it. You could literally see people sigh and shift in their seats every time this supervisor spoke. \n\nSorry you had such an awful experience. I doubt the audience thought you were an idiot, but rather that that prof was a jerk regardless of how valid some of their criticism might have been.",

It's part of science/academia/research to be wrong, and you should take that as a learning experience and focus on the nature of his criticism rather than the fact that he/she publicly criticized you. Of course, I realize that this is 100000 times easier said than done, but I think this is the way to think about it. \n\nAlso, \"big prof\" usually means big ego and no kind of diplomacy or patience with things that do not fit his/her perspective of things. That's very common place in academia, and not changing anytime soon I reckon - so my advice, again, would be to avoid taking it personally at all cost (and avoid inflicting the same when you'll see someone doing things you disagree with at a conference in the future :) )",

He congratulated me and then asked me if I was interested in studying a PhD with him. I didn't reply. Years later he stepped down as head of department as they didn't have enough PhD students and the whole department was really going through rough times because of that.\nMoral of the story: fuck those people.

There was a notorious lawyer whose hobby it was to appear and dissect the defender's work, apparently trying to publicly out every flaw they could find.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, many people are assholes and there's nothing you can do about it except change how you react to it.",

People were sympathetic and said it told them a lot more about how awful he was and they didn't take his opinion on board because they were judging him as a human. I'm sure, no matter what your work is, this is the same.",

Basically, he was upset with me for using a term that is now very common in my field but which he (frankly, because he is older and has not kept up on the literature at all) found derogatory. I tried to defuse the situation but he would not stop about it. Multiple people during the Q&A and then afterward basically told both him and me that I was right and he was wrong, lol. Keep in mind that most people watching your situation probably thought the guy in question was being a jackass and not that it reflected poorly on you in any way.",

The person on stage always struggles, it\u2019s a vicious position to be put in, but the whole audience sees through it (*edit: sees through the questioner) So put it down as a bad experience, learn from it by armouring yourself against it and your next presentation you will be stronger against it or hopefully it won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not something you can avoid, if someone\u2019s going to act like that they will find a way that makes you look daft (to them, the rest of the room is probably aware of what they are doing) and all you can do is find a way to make it water off a ducks back",

      "text": "Happened at my first conference presentation a couple of years ago in person (and my only international/proper one to date). It was during my MPhil (Masters) degree, and people in general throughout the conference seemed to be a little lenient with me because I hadn't even started my PhD (I assume). People in general were really friendly. But one guy turned up to only a couple of the talks, one of which was mine, and really took issue with something I said. \n\nHe pressed me on whether I meant logical necessity, epistemological necessity, etc., wanting some exact terminology. First, it wasn't relevant to my overall paper, really, since I was explicitly presupposing a position to see where it would lead if we did something else with it, but he was questioning the position itself (which is fine, but doesn't affect my overall argument(s)). Second, although I didn't know the exact terminology for the type of necessity I was describing, I explained both in the presentation and in my answer to him that by necessity I meant that the concept of the thing in question necessitates that there could be no cause of the thing except itself (or something like that), so I was quite precise. (It says something that this is the one question/answer that I can remember out of the countless others). \n\nIt would have been fine except he got quite shouty about it, and kept saying he just couldn't understand how what I'm saying makes any sense, demanding I tell him what type of necessity I'm referring to, not letting up, and so on. It was quite uncomfortable, and others there looked quite uncomfortable. Luckily my supervisor was at the conference with me, and we were both on good terms with the host/organiser, and they both took over answering this particular assault for me after it went on for too long (and my supervisor then ended up having a firm debate with him for a couple of minutes). I was glad they took over, and I don't know what I'd have done if they didn't. I was super flustered. I remember thinking at the time that if it continued I'd just say something like \"I'll take this as a comment and move on, because you're clearly not willing to take my positions in good faith\". I'm glad I didn't have to do that, though, because I'm not sure how that would've looked. After the presentation I went up to him and shook his hand and said thank you for the comments and I'm sorry I didn't have a more clear answer for you, and he just looked annoyed and grunted before leaving. \n\nSome people are just assholes. I like to think that if that happened now I would respond more firmly and tell him he's not taking my arguments in good faith and so on, but in the moment who knows, it's quite frightening when it's happening.",
