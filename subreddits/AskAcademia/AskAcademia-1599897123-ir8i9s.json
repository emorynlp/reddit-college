  "text": "I noticed 3 PhD students in our group call the supervisor by his first name. He always signs off with first name. We NEVER call profs by their first name where I'm from, and I feel awkward. What should I do? Should I go with first name?  Another MSc student goes with Dr. last name, however.\n\nBtw, this is a Canadian university.",

Never assume that you can just address someone the way other people around you do if they don't use formal language ( I mean in situations like this). \nTo be honest I wouldn't call this person by their first name, it changes a lot in your interactions and often not for the better.",

Since they're comfortable with both, **I encourage you to do what you're comfortable with.** And keep in mind that it can **change over time.**\n\nEarly on in my PhD, I preferred the formality of referring to faculty as Dr./Prof. These people were not my colleagues or friends, but my superiors in every way. To be honest, I think maintaining that boundary, even in small ways, helped me deal with criticism better than some of my peers. Not everyone who uses first names thinks they're \"buddy-buddy\" with their advisors/committee, but some people do, and any negative feedback ends up being a sharp reminder that they're not equals.\n\n**However,** some time after coursework and exams, I switched to first names, because relationships do evolve. Progressing through the program means that you're moving closer to a symmetrical relationship. It also means they're no longer grading me (beyond assessing the dissertation defense).\n\nMy preference was somewhat related to culture and being a first-generation undergrad/grad student, but also related to *temperament*. So, do what works for your personality and don't be surprised if your preferences change.",
