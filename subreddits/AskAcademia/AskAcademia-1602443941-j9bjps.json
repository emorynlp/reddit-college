  "title:": "No matter what I do, I keep feeling the pull back to higher ed. I'm 28 and will probably apply for a PhD next year but feel like I'm too old and the market is too volatile. Thoughts?",
  "text": "I graduated from university several years ago now. I had intended to apply for a PhD straight out but didn't due to a combination of health issues, feeling insecure about my chosen PhD project, and imposter syndrome.               \n                     \nWell, at the end of last year it became clear to me that my mind was never going to stop gravitating back to higher ed. I just fucking loved it. I loved taking classes, I loved going to guest lectures and panels and doc screenings, and I really loved being a research assistant.          \n                           \nAnd, in a weird way, I felt a sense of kinship with my discipline (in the social sciences) and my professors. It's hard to not feel gushy about it all, but I felt it then (even when it wasn't easy) and I feel it now.               \n                       \nMy intention was to apply this year but all things 2020 really took a toll on me mentally, to the point where it really started to impact my physical health. So, sadly, I am not ready to apply for programs this cycle (and a lot of programs closed their admissions anyway).           \n                             \nAt this point, the insecurities have started flooding in. Partially because I feel like I'll be starting my PhD very old and that it will make me incredibly unattractive in an already unstable and volatile higher ed market. There is also the good ol' imposter syndrome drilling away at me HARD.             \n                         \n               \nI'm honestly just looking for any personal advice/thoughts. No one else in my life has any real grasp on the academic or higher ed space. So I'd just love to talk to someone about this.",

The upside would be that it only takes 3 years (probably 4 with fieldwork) and the work-life balance tends to be much better for UK academics. The application process is also much quicker: In went from application to starting within 4 months, although for overseas students it would again be a bit longer, probably.\n\nGood luck in any case. I finished my PhD (in the UK) at 33 and while I sometimes think about being \"behind\" in terms of career development, it's really not too late at all.

Due to my abusive supervisor making an error, I discovered I had to re-analyze and re-write the 3 manuscripts I had ready by the end of my 4 year program. I'm now doing it on top of a job, still working on my first manuscript (of 4, ideally). I'm 32, so when I finish I will probably be relatively \"old\" as well. Luckily, I have a great co-supervisor now. She has taken on another PhD student who had stopped her PhD due to an abusive supervisor and regretted it some years later. Thanks to my supervisor, she now has a PhD.\n\nI know it's very different to your situation, but I understand the sort of gravitational pull that research can have. If you really love research, don't let age (or anything else for that matter) stop you. The best advice I could give you is to consciously chose your supervisor. A good supervisor goes such a long way. Starting your PhD at an \"older\" age can have many advantages. A supervisor that is concerned with your development into a good researcher, will probably be able to see those advantages. A supervisor that just wants you to execute without questionning so (s)he can advance his/her own research will probably not see the advantages of taking on someone at 30, but you probably don't want that kind of supervisor anyway.",

My concern is that you'll enter into a program, be lulled into a feeling of security for the next 5-7 years, and come out of your program at 35, competing for a limited pool of TT positions (projected to decrease) with candidates much younger than you.\n\nAsk yourself this question:\n\nWhen you say you can't imagine yourself doing anything else, are you envisioning the TT professor with office hours, a research schedule, attending conferences, and having stable benefits, or are you envisioning the struggling permanent adjunct who's rotating at three institutions (which is the more common scenario of today's grads)? \n\nIf you're truly okay with either scenario, then go for the PhD.",

We picture the life of a professor being research and teaching, mostly involving pursuing one's own interests in both with obviously some mind-numbing grading to do from time to time. This is not the life of the modern professor, most of whom spend most of their time doing administrative tasks such as sitting in faculty meeting and applying for and managing third-party funding.",

                      "text": "I would agree with CaptainCornerCamper. I\u2019ve been a social sciences prof at an R1 for 13 years (I should note that I started my PhD program at age 29 - my wife started hers at almost 35), and I\u2019d characterize much of my experience as disillusionment. I spent six years stressed out about tenure, only to find that tenure didn\u2019t make the stress go away at all. I\u2019m busier than ever, and to be honest, very little of the work is truly gratifying. Teaching has its moments, but when you\u2019ve taught the same course a dozen times, it\u2019s a challenge to keep it fun and fresh. Advising grad students can be rewarding at times, but it can also be incredibly draining- and I never trained to be a life coach, which is a big part of the job. I have never had the opportunity to devote myself to research the way I was able to during my PhD program, and now it\u2019s hard to keep up, fight burnout, deal with rejection from grant proposals, etc. The guest lectures I was so excited about in grad school now feel like chores to attend, and I can barely keep up with the ever-increasing service load. There are plenty of great people in academia, but I\u2019ve learned that all it takes is one narcissist to make life in a department almost unbearable.\n\nLook, I know I\u2019m painting a gloomy picture here, and it\u2019s not the whole story. Although I\u2019m definitely looking forward to retirement (massive understatement), I\u2019m not miserably unhappy, and I know I have a lot to be grateful for. I\u2019ve had some great opportunities in this career.\n\nBut that said, my advice before you plunge into a PhD program with the intention of pursuing an academic career is to talk to a few professors who have \u201cmade it.\u201d Tell them you want them to be completely candid about how they feel about their careers. If possible, talk to people in more than one setting. In a PhD program, you\u2019ll only see what it\u2019s like to be at a research university, but you also need to hear from the folks who are teaching 4-4 loads in conservative small towns. And there are huge differences between teaching at an Ivy League school and a second-tier public research university too. \n\nAlso talk to people at more than one career stage. Associate professors like me are often the unhappiest (there have been some good articles about this in the Chronicle, etc.), and their perspectives will be different from someone just starting out or on the verge of retirement.\n\nIf you still want to go for it, knowing that TT jobs are not only disappearing, but also not all we dream they will be, then go to the best program you can get into and find the most supportive advisor you can - and have a backup plan. None of my former PhD students are TT professors, but most of them are doing just fine in other careers. \n\nAgain, though, you\u2019re definitely not too old!",

We were mostly late 20s, early 30s and honestly, my impression from a lot of the faculty is that they prefer students in that range. Older students are often better at work/life balance, better at communication and professionalism, and better at thinking for themselves and doing work independently. I know several PhDs who are in their 40s or even 50s who went back after working in industry for many years. To be fair, it's way easier in Australia to go back to school and there's not as much anti-intellectualism where the PhD puts you behind. Plus it pays better here than it does in the states. I do often think about the \"opportunity loss\" of doing the PhD. If I was working in industry I'd be making more than double what I do as a PhD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think you should be more creative in envisioning your future. Sure, there are not a lot of tenure track positions. The market is shifting and changing all the time and things don't look good for academia. I've realized that academia culture isn't what I'd hoped- hypercompetitive and overly emphasizes output and productivity- just like so many other industries. There's this idea that because the work is your passion, you should overwork for shitty or no pay at all! I say fuck that- I have hobbies and a social life and a partner and actually, it's a job. A job that I love and I want to stay in, but still a job. I don't think I want to end up in academia- I'm looking into the idea of starting my own consulting, working for government and NGO research sectors, or figuring out something else. Be open to different pathways and opportunities! Make opportunities for yourself if you can. And don't do a PhD if you think it will leave you in more debt than you started with- definitely not worth it, particularly in the US.",

You will slowly start to feel better about what you are capable of and your ability to learn.

My younger peers just live with semi-abusive conditions and depending on the department, that could work against you if they \"other\" you out for working differently.\n\nEdit.. Just wanted to add that if you've worked professionally for a long time, it would become really noticeable how accepted norms in academia won't fly elsewhere. It's a culture issue and this could get frustrating since we can't do much about it as grad students. Younger peers are at an advantage since they don't know otherwise",

It'll peak during your PhD, but from then on your career will slowly turn into one where you enable others to do research that is more or less related to your interest. You'll slowly become teacher, supervisor, manager, fund raiser and admin and loose the ability to do a lot of research yourself. How much time you have to do any research yourself depends on your field and position. In many fields you'll have a pure support role and not do any active research.\n\nSo if you want a job where you actively research yourself, you might want to look for another position. Sadly, academia had no widely available alternative. Roles as \"permanent researchers\" that aren't professorships are more rare than professorships, since academia follows this weird system of putting together a new team of specialists for each project and releasing them afterwards instead of having one core team. The permanent researcher roles also often come with another set of compromises, since often you'll be closer to a lab tech that has to help everyone out instead of following their own projects full-time.  \nThese roles really only exist in industry, where they often give you the option to either advance to a specialist or a management role.  \nIf you get lucky you might also find a company that'll happily invest in you attending courses to hone your skills and depending on the direction they might still pay for conference visits, so these things aren't necessarily research specific.",

      "text": "All I can really share is what I did and what my concerns were. I left my job as a supervising attorney at age 31 to get a PhD in a policy field. Some of this may apply to you, but some may not.\n\nI decided to try for grad school when my health started affecting my work. My original plan going to law school was to get my degree, get a job, pay off debt, build some savings, and then try for a PhD. My health became an issue before I was in the financial position I wanted. I decided to do a selective test year of applications, only applying to a few good programs within driving distance of my house. I also did initial research, and I went in with a rough dissertation idea that was solidified within my first year. With careful research into the faculty and precise placement of committee members, I am on track to finish this year, which is year 3 for me. My program normally runs 4-5 years.\n\nThere are important qualifications I have to mention. First, law (my professional area) and policy are closely related. I'm doing a legal scholarship-style dissertation, so I was able to hit the ground running. Second, I was able to get support for the massive pay drop associated with going to grad school (a family member moved into my house with me). Third, I have plans B (post-doc), C (policy work), and D (going back to law) ready if I can't get a tenure track job.\n\nI am happy I went back. Even with everything, my net workload decreased. My health improved. I had time to start dating, and I am about to get married. I am published, and I was able to get an adjunct job teaching a class for experience (with permission from my department). For me, it was the right decision.\n\nAs for my advice: do your research into programs and submit applications. It takes time and money, but if you can't do that, it isn't the right time. Think about some ideas for research, and do some preliminary research to get reacquainted with everything. If you get in, take a few days and think about it. Come up with backup options. Look up the faculty and see who you want to work with. Email anyone you might want to work with and set up a time talk. If you feel secure, go.",

There have also been outliers of women and men (equally few) who are over 50 pursuing a graduate degree. I went continuously from BA to MS to 8-month \"break\" between December graduation and Fall start of PhD (don't recommend it as I faced some serious burn out right after 2nd year and then had to do prelims before trying to get past it). I started the PhD at 25 and will be finishing this May (turning 31 before then). The most recent student to graduate from our lab started at 27 or 28 I think and was out by 33. She just started a tenure track position after spending 3.5 years in postdocs/visiting scholar positions. For her it was definitely who she knew/worked for in those postdocs that got her to that point. In terms of volatility, it did cost her her marriage and she considered choosing an alternative career after getting shortlisted and passed over for other candidates when she was applying for tenure-track jobs.   \n\n\nWith the increase in programs announcing they are not accepting new applicants/cohorts for the upcoming 2021-22 year, you might want to plan for that possibility and the consequences of that fall-out with an influx of applicants who would have gone to school X o(r others) as their top/only choice now applying to A, B, C, Y, and Z schools who are taking students.",

I think I always knew that I would end up going back for a PhD and am glad I took the path I did as an assurance of my decision (if I get in)! \nI guess for me, age was never a major consideration as my dad did his PhD when he was in his 30s and with a young family but timing-wise, I feel like this is exactly the right age I needed to be to pursue this path. \nApologies if the above doesn\u2019t flow, using my phone.",
