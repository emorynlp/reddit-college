  "text": "I hope this is allowed here. I don\u2019t really have anyone else to celebrate with or who understands the difficulties of finding an academic job compared to industry, so I thought I\u2019d share it here.\n\nI\u2019m a current graduate student who decided to take a gap year before my next steps. I wanted to get a teaching-oriented job during that time, as that\u2019s where my passion lies. I started to lose hope that this would be a possibility, but there was one position that seemed potentially promising. It was a visiting assistant professor position at a teaching-focused institution. I worked SO hard on the application material and job talk - more than I ever have for any other job before - and I was notified today that I got the job! I\u2019m still waiting on the offer letter but I\u2019m so excited! I never thought this would happen! I had basically accepted my fate as an industry worker (or potentially a high school teacher), but it really worked out in the end. Yay! HUGE thanks to everyone here who helped me through various parts of the process.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the kind words and encouragement! I really needed this. I was pretty bummed going through this alone (though still ecstatic that I got the position!) since no one around me seemed to care or understand why it was such a big deal to me. It\u2019s great to have such a supportive community here who does understand and is virtually celebrating with me!\n\nAlso, this post got more popular than I expected, so I\u2019m editing it slightly so it\u2019s less easy to identify who I am. I am keeping the bulk of it up to encourage others in their search.",

I would love to share it all here but I think that will make it very easy for someone who knows me to identify who I am because it was a bit of an unusual path. \n\nAs for the general process, it was very similar to what you read about online. You have to submit a standard application, give a job talk, interview with the faculty and administration, and then you\u2019re notified if you were selected for hire or not. \n\nThe thing that had the biggest impact, in my opinion, was my job talk. It is a teaching-focused institution, but most people are so used to excelling in research that they give a talk that shows how amazing what they did is in a manner that is not easy to understand for undergraduates. Instead of doing that, I focused on simplifying my work (I didn\u2019t even present all of it), explaining the problem and its relevance to the students\u2019 lives, and most importantly actually teaching the basics of my methods to the students. This not only helps show the committee that you can teach well, but it also helps them understand your research better if your committee is coming from a variety of fields. (That\u2019s actual feedback I got from them, not something I\u2019m making up.)\n\nHope this helps!",

I'm sure it varies between different disciplines and countries, but in the UK doing health research its very difficult to get stable academic research-only jobs, but there are a lot more opportunities if you want to lecture. I'm research-only (apart from two lectures a year that I do voluntarily) and these days there is no job security at my level, just a constant grind of looking for funding. So as a result there are plenty of lecturers who don't necessarily have the motivation or skills to be good lecturers, and that's a shame. It's great that you're enthusiastic about teaching, everything works better when people actually like their jobs!",
