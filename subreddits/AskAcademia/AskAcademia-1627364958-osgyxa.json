  "text": "I submitted an abstract to a hybrid conference that will happen both online and face-to-face. I'm wondering what it would be like and what to expect.\n\nI imagine that we'll be in a room with a camera on, and when a presenter is presenting online, we (the people in the room) will be watching the online presentation together and asking questions via Zoom.\n\nBut I guess, for socializing (coffee, dinner, etc.), only the people who are physically there will be involved?\n\nFor those of you who (physically) participated in a hybrid conference, what was it like? Just like any f2f conference with an online option? Or something completely different?",

      "text": "I was just at a hybrid conference last week. It was definitely weird (I\u2019ve attended 3 previous ones in-person, last year was fully online, and then this one was hybrid), but it was good. I organized and convened one session where we had 5 speakers. 3 were in-person, 2 were online. Our IT people were great. Our conference has the option to let the virtual people present online and pre-record ahead of time, which is what our virtual speakers did. The IT guys just had to pull it up and hit play when it was their turn. We also had a round table Q&A at the end, were the in-person presenters sat in chairs at the front and the virtual presenters joined them on a live video feed. Honestly, that session went really well. \n\nI attended other sessions where everyone was online, and even one round table session where only one presenter was in-person, and he didn\u2019t want to be the only one on stage, so he just got online from his hotel room in our conference city. \n\nFor the more social aspects, I still got to catch up with friends I haven\u2019t seen in 2 or 3 years. It was much smaller groups than normal, but I was okay with that since it\u2019s honestly safer right now. We also had virtual coffee hours for the online student attendees that anyone could attend online. \n\nI just had a hard time focusing on our virtual conference last year (and won a travel scholarship to attend in-person), so I much preferred the hybrid conference format to virtual.",
