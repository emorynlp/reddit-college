I think conscious perseverance really helped though attitude-wise?",

The man point to consider is do you actually enjoy physics, you definitely will need to have an interest in the subject if you're going to stay motivated through 4 or 5 years of study!",

You will learn it from your supervisor, they learned bit from their teachers... Once you have the base you build on it, this is when really fun part stars. If you do not go to theoretical physics math is really not that hard. My supervisor likes to say \"math and physics are things you get used to\".
