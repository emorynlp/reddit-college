  "title:": "Supervisor seems like he wants to delay my graduation",
  "text": "OK this is part rant, part asking for advice.\n\nMy relationship with my supervisor was always a little tense. He never gave useful input but I actually loved that because then I was able to do my own work and write papers I would be interested in. Due to coronavirus shutdown, I accelerated progress and was able to write 3 papers in 2020 and basically am on my way out. \n\nOne of our submissions was just returned with request for major revisions due in 15 days. I asked immediately for a meeting, which he ignored and even told me to not use lab resources to make room for other people. Luckily his input is worthless anyway and I am almost done with the revisions. \n\nThe problem is he wants me to work for him as much as possible in the lab as well as for his company. I said I don't want to pursue this field and will do something else and while I think he got the message, he now seems to think if he can't benefit off me (he once told me verbatim \"he will milk me as much as he can\" LOL), he has no problem extending my stay. \n\nI will quit if I don't graduate by this summer (I wrote a first draft for my thesis and surprise, he hasn't read it). It may sound stupid and dramatic, but I need money (my family needs support + I just bought an expensive computer thinking I would be out in a few months). I don't want to give an ultimatum because at worst he'll have someone else carry on the last mile and publish those papers + even if not, he is a tenured professor who is in his 60s, doesn't give a shit. \n\nWhat do I do? \n\n\\--------------\n\nSome other gems:\n\n\\- When my first paper was submitted, he told me it needs more work and probably will be rejected. When it got into a really good journal, he was shocked and visibly upset (cause we need only 3 papers)\n\n\\- We discussed me leaving before and even though I had 2 conference + 1 journal + 2 in review, he said what's the rush? He was so happy to pay me $25k/year when an engineer at that level asks for $200k+/year for a starting salary. Mentioned it a bunch of times.\n\n\\- His instincts are terrible. Every time I get a note \"add this\" or \"remove that\", we get feedback saying this is unrelated or why didn't you describe this in detail. I don't think he is sabotaging me here, it's more like he takes about 15 minutes to review the work and just wants to say things.\n\n\\- Since I completed my thesis and every single requirement, I asked him if I could work full time (or even part time). He said no way, people never finish their thesis if they work because they underestimate the work required to complete (exam, revising thesis etc). Now I'm sitting here and before this rejection/rebuttal had nothing to do. But he found me work: I help some of the newcomers, comment my code and prepare documents for future use. I don't object to these, even though in my last 4 years this type of work never amounted to anything.",

You'd think this doesn't fall under their purview but that's NOT the case. \nMy friend had a similarly shitty supervisor and she knew she had to get out of there. She did so by approaching other faculty and the ombudsman of her university. That's what they are here for. She switched to a different school and is much happier now with her current advisor.\n\nOP, I realize your situation is different as you're close to graduating, having met requirements, but I think this makes your case stronger.",

      "text": "First, you need to be proactive. You should talk to your supervisor about when YOU intend to graduate, or complete other milestones for your degree and ask if they have any objections. It sounds like you have done the work to be able to graduate, you just need your supervisor's ok. So you should have a conversation with your supervisor explicitly about dates etc.\n\nIf he blocks you for the reasons you are suspecting, and you don't trust that he will let you graduate (so you basically don't trust him as a supervisor), then you can talk to others in the department that you can switch to. With the work that you have done, it might be possible for you to graduate under other supervisors. Of course this comes at very big risks. This is why it is very important that you follow through the path in the first paragraph (have faith in your advisor and work with him on an explicit graduation timeline).",

We submitted that in December LOL. \nDo you have any experience/anecdotes of anyone following the route you talked about?

Also get his graduation requirements in writing. That way if you go to the authorities in your department that handle stuff like this, there is a paper trail. I did this in undergrad when I was blackmailed to work for my advisor over the summer in exchange for the final grade I needed to get my undergrad degree, which would have then delayed my going to graduate school. From that experience, I learned to document almost everything my advisor said to me in writing. It came in handy the year before I defended because I held my advisor to a timeline in writing. She tried to go back and tell me to do more, but I pointed to our agreement and that shut her up.",

What procedures do you need to kickstart in order to defend? \n\nYou mentioned in another comment that your advisor won't have time until February to read the thesis and this pushes your defence back until June - this seems pretty insane. If your thesis comes from published work, there shouldn't be much to revise. Can you get your other examiners to start reading your thesis?\n\n> Since I completed my thesis and every single requirement, I asked him if I could work full time (or even part time). He said no way, people never finish their thesis if they work because they underestimate the work required to complete (exam, revising thesis etc).\n\nHonestly, while everything else you have said here is a giant red flag on his part, I agree with him here. Out of the 5 or so people that took up jobs before defending in my cohort, only one of them ended up actually defending. The rest took up demanding jobs and basically gave up on the PhD. \n\nIn one example, my friend took up a job before even finishing his last research project, and it's been about 2.5 years, and he's still working on it while working 50-60 hours a week at his company. It caused him a lot of immigration issues because he didn't have the PhD in hand when applying for his work visa, not to mention his work-life balance is shot. \n\nOnce you've defended and handed in your thesis, I would ignore him if he still objects to you, even if there are revisions.",

          "text": ">Do you have your doctoral committee set up?\n\nDo you mean exam committee? If so, no. Our committee is set up from the start (3 people including the supervisor). After each meeting they ask if I'm happy with my supervisor and I say yes. The thing is this time I'll meet them during the exam haha. So saying I'm not happy is kind of similar to bashing them in acknowledgments section of the thesis.\n\nFeb to June timeline, it can be faster (at best May) but I think this isn't too crazy. How long does it take for a paper to be reviewed? Anywhere between 4 weeks to 6 months. This is 4+1 papers content text. Also note we'll have to send out examiner requests to multiple people. Also to your point, my supervisor won't let me send the thesis to my committee members before proofreading it.\n\nYeah I accepted no job & I will be losing quite a lot of money but again, if it's 4-5 months it's ok. If it's 2022 it is not OK. My parents are not in good shape and they supported me for the past 28 years - time to return the favor.",
