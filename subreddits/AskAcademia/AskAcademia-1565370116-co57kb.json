  "title:": "Found my masters dissertation was plagiarised. Where to go from here?",
  "text": "A PhD student from the lab where I did my masters 2 years ago submitted his/her thesis earlier this year, and as I was reading it, I noticed a number of similarities in the writing. I looked back at my dissertation and found a number of sentences and a whole paragraph from the literature review and the conclusions were either very similar or copied word-for-word. His/Her conclusions were drawn from mine because one whole chapter was a repeat of my masters work. Only two small parameters were changed: used Brand B instead of Brand A with the exact same specs and used a different arbitrary constant in the calculation. The end results were virtually identical, so it wasn't like their changes improved what I had done or built on top of the work in my dissertation; it was a repeat without the hurdles of optimising the parameters. Nowhere in the thesis was me or my work acknowledged or referenced.\n\nI don't know what to do. On the one hand, I'm gutted that this happened. I am not confident in my writing at all, and I worked extremely hard to produce a good, coherent literature review and conclusions; I never even discussed my ideas with them, only my supervisor, who must have given them a copy of my dissertation. I knew my work would be in their thesis after I submitted my dissertation because our supervisor said he/she would use it (I learned all this after I graduated). Although I wasn't thrilled about it, I knew to expect it. On the other hand, in the worst case, this is two people's careers at stake, and as angry as I am, I don't believe my masters dissertation is worth two careers.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?",

I don't think this needs to ruin their career, but it needs to be acknowledged and fixed. Either this was intentional and then I'm sure others would find more examples of this. Or it was a mistake, and OP deserves their citation, and the PhD needs to correct it.\n\nEdit: I'm assuming the level of plagiarism is relatively low, like maybe a c+p'ed paragraph, or sentence or two  and a missing citation, not a 100% ripped off piece of work. Nothing career ruining. \n\nBut if it is career ruining, they did that to themselves. OP isn't going to unjustly ruin someone's career. If it does ruin their career it's because the offense was that serious and people outside of OPs control made that decision.",

Possible consequences for your advisor range from nothing to some sort of administrative penalty.  He is highly unlikely to be fired or lose his job.  Possible consequences for the Ph.D. student range from nothing to being required to revise the dissertation to having the Ph.D.  revoked.  It really all depends on how serious it is determined to be.  \n\nMy gut suggests that your work was related to and part of a larger project that was the Ph.D. student\u2019s work, and that you did a piece of that work and produced some results within that context.  In that situation, it is common to include those results in the dissertation.  It is improper to include someone else\u2019s text directly (unless from a coauthored paper), and very improper to have done either without appropriate attribution.  The part where they changed some details could represent falsification of results, which would itself be a very serious problem.",

The issue when it comes to publications is that you are representing your submission as entirely original unpublished work.  If you submit a paper that contains verbatim portions of another publication (yours or someone elses's), that representation is false.  But even that rule is not 100% black and white because, for example, with technical papers it is not uncommon for people to reuse snippets of a related work section from one of their own prior papers and nobody cares because that section is not expected to represent novel work.  In any case, it is ok to paraphrase your own prior publications, but anything important should be cited just like you would cite anyone else's prior work.",

It is baffling to me that that at the very least didn't pick this up.\n\nBeyond that though, there is a difference between basing a chapter of your thesis off of someone else's work, and straight up lifting from that work. The first is basically how a lot of research develops, the latter is (as you identified) straight up plagiarism, and should be reported to whomever in the university is responsible for research ethics and integrity. What they decide to do with that information is on them, but for your sake, your department's sake, and honestly the sake of everyone who honestly earned their PhD, please don't let this slide.",

One that also doesn't really cost anyone time or effort, but is an extra protection to keep everyone honest.\n\n\nEdit: Also, happy cake day!",

However, it might also be worth asking what happens if you don't. Not long after my PhD, a student a year or two behind me, who I had helped quite a lot, published a paper. When I read said paper I realised that it copied portions of my thesis, some just the structure, but also an appendix which was verbatim code, used without attribution. Was I angry? Yes. I complained to our supervisor (a co-author), with whom I was on good terms. He should have known, but like many busy PIs he hadn't realised. He apologised and had already fallen out with the plagiariser.\n\nI could have taken it further, but the truth is that the person in question was never going to go far. She became a lecturer, but it ended badly (some gossip there I heard!). I knew that she was not technically very capable and unlikely to have a successful career. Our paths were unlikely to cross again. So I let it slide and haven't regretted it.",

It might be that this paragraph was so heavily edited by the PI for both of you that it came out the same. I think that part you can breathe easy about and take as a silent compliment on your writing skills.\n\nThe more problematic part is the results and the conclusions. The question is did he do all the work too? Did your PI help both of you with the results? Was this data published in a peer reviews journal?\n\nI think since things written an a masters dissertation will very likely not be read by anyone ever (sorry) there's a low level of repetition that's acceptable so the work you did can get out there (which is the point in science, no?).\n\nBottom line - I think you should contact your former PI and tell him you think you should be acknowledged and your thesis referenced.\n\nDon't think that anybody would think there's even a slight possibility that it wasn't you if this gets reported and that can have fallout for you.\n\nTo plagiarize Leonidas from \"300\": \"THIS. IS. SCIENCE!!!\"",
