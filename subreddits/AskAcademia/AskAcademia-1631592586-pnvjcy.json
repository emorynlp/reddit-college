      "text": "I suppose this goes a bit beyond just academia, but I would change the normalisation of working long hours.\n\nIn the UK at least, it seems like a badge of honour if you're the person working the longest hours. I remember in my first year, I felt really guilty leaving the office before anyone else.\n\nI changed when I received an email asking for people to do a teaching course. It was unpaid, had little value in terms of employability, and involved maybe 10-15 hours a week. I queried how they expect us to fit the time in and whether we'd be eligible for a slight deadline extension to our PhDs, and the response was essentially 'we expect you to work long hours, this is the norm so get used to it'.\n\nFrom then on I worked 30-35 hours a week and changed the scope of my thesis rather than increasing my hours. I still passed, still did a load of extra stuff that landed me a job in industry, and allowed me to enjoy the process.\n\nMeanwhile, many of my co-students worked 50% more than me, and some went on to ask for formal extensions due to stress.\n\nI just hate that people expect you to give your life up for it. For me it was always a means to an end.\n\nThat said, people are just as bad in my current company!",

          "text": "I totally agree (and the issues are largely the same in STEM). The perverse culture we all live with is beaten into us in grad school, so if we were to actually change academia in a meaningful and permanent way, a fundamental change in the way we train and treat graduate students would be essential. Another critical thing within that theme would be changing the way we present the possibilities after graduate school. At least in STEM, in many programs there is a pervasive impression that the only respectable career after graduation is staying in academia and anything else is some kind of failure or a sign that you weren't good enough to land that TT gig. This leaves students with unrealistic expectations but also pushes lots of people to try to enter the academic pipeline who probably don't really want to be there and would be much happier doing something else. For those who definitely know they don't want to go into academia from the start, it can make them feel like second class citizens. In general, the pushing of students toward a career that has very few openings and the lack of meaningful training for other good careers is incredibly problematic and leads to a host of problems which ripple through academia.",

This means there are lots of 'admin' tasks that I don't need to do and is honestly a waste of my time being things I have to do because if I don't do them then they don't get done. I'd say the same thing for teaching, is soaks up time I should be spending doing research because I'm doing more teaching that I really have time for because there aren't enough of us! \n\nSimilarly research funding and similar things should be more streamlined, fortunately I don't 'need' to secure funding but I do work with a lot of STEM colleagues who do and its just insane the amount of time and effort wasted just chasing funding to do work that we want them to do!",

      "text": "One thing which would be transformational is if our students, their parents, our politicians and even our managers actually understood what academics actually did. I work in the UK, but my sense is that this is a wider phenomenon.\n\nAlmost no-one outside the profession, including people who have been to university, journalists, and the politicians empowered to control higher education, actually understands what we do, both as teachers and researchers. This is particularly acute in the humanities, but I think it's pretty universal. If we, as a sector, did a better job of explaining how we were different from schools, what things like peer review were, what getting a PhD involves, what research looks like in terms of inputs and outputs, and what we actually do all day, we could begin to shift bigger narratives about fees, workloads, funding, \"employability\" etc. etc. I've had this conversation with graduate students a lot over the last few years, and many of them told me that they didn't understand what an academic job involved until after they'd finished their doctorates, in some cases.\n\nHonestly, I think that's the big issue which ultimately sits underneath all the others. \n\nThe micro-case in my discipline is instructive. I'm an art historian; millions of people visit museums and galleries every year, read books and watch films about art, etc. But a vanishingly small number of those people understand the edifice of professional research which sits behind all those things, because they've never really been told. Where knowledge comes from is utterly opaque to the general public.\n\n I am told repeatedly that my subject is silly and pointless, and the very fact I'm an expert in the history of tattooing seen by some sneering cynics is literally risible to some people, but, for example, I've given evidence in civil and criminal cases, produced TV shows seen across the world, worked on consultancy for global brands and put together exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors. (ETA: I don't mean to instrumentalise the humanities, or research more generally. I simply think that even the methods by which we discover things, and the relationships those methods have beyond the academy, are too little understood.)\n\nI hear similar stories from social and hard scientists, law academics, historians, literature scholars, poets... Imagine asking an education minister to explain what a poetry scholar does!\n\nNone of this, I should also say, is the fault of the general public, or of students. Our profession has done an absolutely awful job of explaining what we do and how we fit into every other corner of cultural and social life, and we urgently need to get better. I now run an intro course for my undergraduates which explains the practical and philosophical realities of academic life, and every student who's taken it has told me they found most of the content entirely new information!",
