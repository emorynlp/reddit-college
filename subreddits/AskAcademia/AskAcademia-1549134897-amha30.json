Then P2 is actually citing P3, which in turn is citing P4. \n\nWhy hasn't P1 just cited P4 directly in this case? And is there any convention against this type of thing? \n\nFor example, I wanted to use this statistic, could I just cite P1 in future?

Sometimes these citations get twisted over the years and it's not ever correct information anymore. However, p1 probably isn't just taking the exact information from p4 anymore. If you're doing more than just citing a simple statistical fact, it's alright to cite the p1 that you're reading because they analyzed (not just regurgitated) papers 2-4 to get to the point that they were writing about. If it is just a statistic, you should try to find a more recent primary source to make sure it's still relevant. ",

Regarding the latter: often, it's fine in practice to cite the paper that cites the paper that cites the paper... because this is *in theory* sufficient to show that whatever information has been cited is accepted by the community (i.e. peer-reviewed). The busy folks writing these papers often have a good deal more important things to be doing with their time than digging for deep citations as it is.\n\nThat said, it's *best* to cite the original source, so if you have the time to do so it is probably the right decision.",

If the citation is for a statement of opinion or fact, then cite the paper that you think would be most useful for the reader. This may be an early paper, or it may be a later review. The reason why I wouldn't worry too much about finding the first paper in the chain is that often there isn't one - perhaps one paper presented some roots of the idea, and then another paper strengthened the argument substantially. Most influential ideas aren't the product of one person's thinking - they represent the considered view of a branch of the scholarly community.\n\nTake the statement \"smoking causes lung cancer\". Most epidemiologists would point to Richard Doll's 1950 paper in the BMJ as being the first to prove that smoking caused lung cancer. But similar analyses were conducted by Schairer and Sch\u00f6niger in 1943 in Nazi Germany (and then forgotten). At the same time, there were experiments in animals, in cellular pathology and in chemical analytics - all of which provided supporting evidence. And links between smoking and cancer had been noted going back to the 1700s. So while Doll's paper was massively influential, there's no way one could claim it had priority. If you wanted to provide a citation for the statement \"smoking causes lung cancer\", you could cite Doll BMJ 1950, but you could also cite a more recent review of the topic that has systematized and synthesized evidence on the topic - go with whichever you think would be most useful for a reader of your manuscript to look up.",

In first 5 years after something happened, there are no good reviews, so you always cite the original paper, but at some point they start to fade. \n\nThen some social science happens and some papers achieve cult status, and are ritually cited in the introduction, while some others fade into the hase of \"generally accepted facts\" that are cited via reviews.\n\nFor stats it's even worse. Some stats methods had become mainstream so fast that now they have like 10000 citations on Google Scholar, at which point, is it really necessary? Look at the \"false discovery rate\" by Benjamini; it was published in 2001, and has 2500 citations. At this point it's probably time to stop citing it. The original pagerank algorithm (Page 1999) has 12587 citations. Really?\n\nAnd then sometimes citing the first paper is weird. For example, I studied a certain thing, and wanted to reference a statement that it exists in certain species. A paper about it cited a paper from the 70s. That paper cited a paper from 1930s. I found it, and it cited a paper from 1880s, written in German, which I cannot find anywhere. Do I cite it? Or is it weird?

This element had a complicated history, and a particular history has become \"common knowledge.\" In the process of writing, I came across a reason to doubt this story, and investigated further. Sure enough, the earliest report of the element was of an alternative method. I then checked the declassified \"diary\" of one of the lead scientists, and it confirmed the method. Papers on the subject had cited the same paper again and again, but neglected to follow the paper trail to the original report. It was a game of telephone, over seventy years. ",

In MLA 8^th ed, to point to something that's quoted by someone else, you would use (1, qtd. in 2). MLA has no provision for tracing primary sources through secondary sources without quotes. This is, presumably, because unless you are citing a historical document, which you would be doing in a case where the (quotable) language is important, there are very few situations in the humanities where you would not be able to disambiguate in the text itself, with something like, \"1 takes up the idea of 2 and uses it to...\" The humanities are, on the whole, not concerned with replicability.\n\nAPA handles this as (1, as cited in 2) because the fields that use it, very much like the sciences, require a citation mechanism that efficiently represents authors' attempts to  replicate previous results.",
