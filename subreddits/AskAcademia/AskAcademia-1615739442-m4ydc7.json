I'm very much conscious of \"200 MB should be more than enough for anyone\" or whatever that quote is.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that they will probably always be accompanied by classical processors, and so the actual user experience will not require such a huge overhaul as the person above me suggested. By the time quantum computing comes to the casual user, the user interface will probably not be noticeably different from any classical UI of the time. If you want to order food, you'll go to the Postmates app. If you want to deliver the food to several dozen people via the most efficient route possible, you'll still use the (delivery version of the) Postmates app, but the route-finding may use quantum optimization (probably server-side in that case but who knows). This is just a prediction, but I think quantum vs. classical processing will mean about as much to the end user as CPU- vs. GPU-based processing: well-understood by some, known to some degree by many enthusiasts, and largely ignored by most, even if it changes the world hugely from under the hood (as many computing innovations have).",

If this is the case, then within 5 years some companies will be using quantum computers to solve interesting problems.  \n2. Such algorithms don't exists, or we can't find them. In this case we will need fault-tolerant quantum computers. The best estimates we currently have say that we need at least millions of physical qubits to do useful things with such machines. So just for the quantum version of Moore's law to do its thing, we will need at least 20 years of exponential growth in the number of qubits to get these numbers. Alternatively, we find better error correction methods that drastically reduce the number of qubits needed for error correction, or we get so good at controlling qubits in the lab that less error correction is necessary.",

I think some good candidates are rare earth metals (especially  indium and gadolinium), since most models show a (roughly) 20-fold increase in demand, but only a minimal increase in supply based on current extraction and exploration methods. Of course, there are other unconventional mining techniques like seafloor mining that could prove more economical.\n\nFinally, if space travel starts becoming a big thing and orbital construction happens, there will probably be a shift towards iron-nickel alloy from asteroids, and aluminum, possibly from lunar regolith. At this point though, we're firmly into the realm of speculation so it really depends on how things develop in the next 10-20 years.",

About 100 years later, ecologists realized its indirect effects include ocean acidification, coral bleaching, changes in how plants photosynthesize, and more.  \n\nBiodiversity loss is sort of the new climate change. In the last 50 years, humans have removed 70% of wild vertebrates from ecosystems, especially large animals. In the short term, we know removal of large animals directly reduces biogeochemical cycling, reduces ecosystem productivity (e.g., carbon storage), increases fire size, and increases population sizes and densities of small animals. Among other effects, increased pest population densities means greater likelihood of disease and spillover of disease to humans. \n\nSo I find the most exciting ecological research to be characterizing long-term effects of biodiversity loss (often using the fossil record) in order to predict and combat the changes we are about to see.",

              "text": "For one; energy density. Batteries will have a difficult time getting beyond 12-15 MJ/kg, and even the best hypothetical battery chemistries are limited by thermodynamics at around 24 MJ/kg. By comparison, diesel and gasoline are both north of 40 MJ/kg, and hydrogen is 120 MJ/kg. Internal combustion doesn't have to get much more efficient in order to get beyond the reach of any theoretical battery chemistry. That's not as big of an issue with respect to commuter cars, but as you get to higher and higher necessary energy and power densities, batteries will simply not function correctly. Thus, battery electric vehicles will be everywhere, but they will not be every*thing*; you'll see *either* diesel *or* hydrogen-fueled vehicles on heavier-duty vehicles, all the way from medium pickups to long-haul trucking, in addition to a lot of hybrids.\n\nThis also doesn't remotely touch the issues of long-range air travel or international shipping, and it's considerably easier for those sectors to switch to a synthetic renewable kerosene-esque fuel which the automotive diesel sector will lean on as well (because honestly, what do you think is cheaper, less energy intensive, and less environmentally damaging; ripping out the powertrain of every plane and ship in the world, or just changing their fuel to something that is carbon neutral?).\n\nFor two; there's the issue of sourcing enough material for the batteries; there simply isn't enough lithium that's easy to get at, meaning we'll either have to start mining the more difficult and expensive (and energy-intensive) sources of lithium, or we'll move towards the battery chemistries that make regulators a little more uncomfortable. Things like Nickel-Metal batteries, and *particularly* Nickel-Cadmium. That inherently means limitations on how much lithium is available, in turn leading to a price spike in lithium that will make any lithium-based battery pack wildly unaffordable.\n\nFor three; battery storage isn't going to resolve the issues of intermittency in renewables because of pricing and usage issues, and as a result it's going to be economically impractical to move intermittent renewable market penetration very far past 25-35% of the overall energy contribution of a given markets' electrical grid. This issue is already cropping up in regions that went too heavily into renewables, hence why Germany, California, and Denmark all have extremely high energy costs relative to their peers and neighbors. Once this becomes more widely understood, it's going to become apparent that an all-electric vehicle fleet is not really possible or sustainable unless you're willing to make electricity from coal or natural gas, which of course means that electric vehicles will no longer be worth the environmental costs given that they increase the need for fossil-fuel plants. Oh, and unfortunately nuclear can't really save the day here, as while nuclear is GHG-neutral(ish), literally every other power production method we have plays better with renewables.\n\nFor four; EVs just flat-out don't work for the overwhelming majority of the world's population because of a lack of infrastructure. Expecting Africa or India or central Asia or much of South or Central America to be able to magically switch to battery-electric powertrains is naive and incredibly patronizing, and is about as misguided as the whole Kony 2012 thing was to many of these nations.",

I'm a computational person so I'm really excited that we are on the cusp of some really high-fidelity whole-device computer models of fusion experiments - kind of the holy grail of computational plasma physics, that simulate everything from atomic processes at the wall to the micron-scale effects such as ionization and redeposition in the near-surface plasma, to impurity transport in the meters-long scrape-off-layer, to the hotter than the center of the sun core - it's an exciting time for fusion computation.\n\nTo learn more about fusion, there's no replacement for graduate classes, but Chen's Plasma Physics text is a great, advanced undergraduate-level starting point.",

It is not caused by point mutations, but rather complex DNA damage often stretching for tens of thousands of bases (insertions, inversions etc) or more. In theory, if we detect those mutation, we can assist an immune system and design \"vaccine\"  to eliminate such damaged cells. The issue, however, is that no current genome sequencing tech can detect such large DNA rearrangement or are too error prone. That is, until last year PacBio got a breakthrough and solved this issue.\n\nNow there are no obstacles that i'm aware of to solve Cancer as we know it. In fact, BioNTech and Moderna COVID vaccine tech was designed primarily for cancer cure in particular, while CureVac/Tesla designed a portable machine to basically print these \"vaccines\" to each unique cancer, on site.",

This is not somehow \"the major barrier\" in oncology.\n\nIf we assumed that the first premise was correct, then it still wouldn't matter because we absolutely do not have a bridge of understanding between the map of a genome and the expressions and behaviors of cells and tissues. \n\nIn that respect the illusion (which any hope that full mapping will do much to cure cancer is...) is similar to the illusion that a full mapping of cortical connectivity in the human brain will bring about understanding of how those connections give rise to the functions that the cortex carries out. An oft used example is that we ahve full mappings of animals with 3-6 orders og magnitudes fewer neurons than us, and have no clue how they produce their results.\n\nWe do know a lot. We know many many pathways, but they are vastly outnumbered byt he pathways we don't know. We have small \"stones in the river\" that allow us to jump back and forth and create *some* diagnostic and therapeutic avenues especially for the monogenic varieties, but the bottleneck in curing these is not and has never been mapping. \n\nNeoplasia (of which cancer is a subset) is not one thing that is easily distinguishable from normophysiological tissue. \n\nWe all have tons of neoplasias at any given time. For a neoplastic process to develop into a cancer that can cause the death or serious illness of a person, many many things go wrong. And even in the few cases where it is literally one mutation which can easily understand the malfunction of, we can't fix it - not because we need genome mapping, but instead because the selected tissues are difficult to reach/treat, especially when trying to do so without hurting the rest of the organism.\n\nEdit: i apologize for the tone in the start of this comment, i'm just tired of having seen 20-30 years of \"THIS finally cures cancer\". I love mapping, and it is VERY interesting. However we should distinguish quite clearly between the \"Mapping\" as in finding all of the genes and then knowing how they produce the biological products.  (The latter which is what we need, could instead be considered akin to something like the table of elements, which although having \"mapping\" aspects, really is more a summation of the *principles* of dynamic interactions between the elements, which is what genomic mapping doesn't even begin to do).\n\n\nEdit2: Cancer \"vaccines\" also have nothing to do with mapping, they are important tech, but stimulating the immune system to produce a more effective response to cancer is not new, and it is not without problems at all. People tend to think that because it is \"using the bodies own defenses\" it is somehow a golden key that evades the problem of hurting the organism itself. This is also wrong.",

Cancer involves very complicated changes at the chromosomal level - one common form of chronic myelogenous leukemia is caused by the BCR-ABL gene, which involves a chromosomal translocation between the BCR gene on chromosome 22 and the ABL gene on chromosome 9. Lastly, even if a method of reversing a single translocation is found, cancer occurs by turning off genes involved in monitoring mutations, so even if a cancer is \"derived from\" a single event like BCR-ABL, the actual genotype of the cancer cells is highly heterogeneous and probably cannot be directly fixed.",

If you step outside of that window, you either misfire, or you blow a gasket, but because combustion is hilariously temperature-dependent when it comes to timing, you have to continually chase this window for every speed, load, and throttle-up/down condition imaginable.\n\nVVT is still a workload, but generally speaking most of the workload is taken care of by prior calibration, and the valve timings will still be held to a pre-set window where basically the engine always runs, just maybe not quite as optimally as it could.\n\n>Like 5) alone breaks my head... so many species that can tell you if you're burning cleanly or not!
