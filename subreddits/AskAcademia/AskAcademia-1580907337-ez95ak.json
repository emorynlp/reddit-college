  "title:": "I have manipulated data in my research paper and it is killing me from inside. What should I do?",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am highly embarrassed to post this . I am currently pursuing my masters at a reputed college(I am in my first year), however I had manipulated some data in my undergraduate thesis which would easily be detected if someone looks with a closer eye. It was unfortunately selected for publication in a reputed journal and we have recently received a notification. I honestly had no intent of deceiving anyone, I didn't realize it at all at that time and it was out of my inexperience. I have recently read the consequences of data manipulation while doing my course in ethics. Had I known it earlier, I would have never committed such a sin. The article is yet to be processed and I believe that we can withdraw it. However, I am confused what should I say to my advisor, if I tell him the truth, he will report me to the dean and my degree will be revoked, and I will have to literally beg to survive(I am from a very poor family). Please suggest me what should I do. I fear that in case the journal editors come to know from the reviewers about this, it will destroy my career as well as reputation. Please suggest me what should I do.\n\nPS: I don't have any past history of indiscipline(undegrad GPA\\~3.92), nor have I manipulated any data in my other work. I have just realized what have I done and want to repent for my mistakes. But at the same time I don't want to lose my degree as I am the only one to financially support my family\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments. Sorry for not being upfront about the details. I am detailing the case here. Basically I had one figure in my bachelor work wherein I tweaked two data points(increased its value by a factor) in order to make my conclusions more justified. The data points if kept unchanged would not change the conclusions. However, recently I realized that I had made a severe error in the paper, the same figure was placed at a different place by mistake and was missed by the reviewers, however, if anyone would look carefully, they would look the same, and when they analyze the value in the figure, one of the data point that I tweaked is impossible to achieve. So if I tell them the reason that the figures are same, a decent person in the field would realize the manipulation. The work that I did was groundbreaking(even if the data remains unchanged), and would receive larger citations if published. But I don't want it to be published as the consequences would be disastrous for me as well as my advisor. I had deleted the raw data once I completed my undergraduate. I have been trying since the past few weeks in order to replicate the work but I am failing(the amount of effort I had put in was quite intensive).\n\nI know that if I confess in front of my advisor, he would report me to the dean and I would be expelled immediately.  I am trying to figure out ways to convince my advisor to withdraw the article. However, my prime concern is that in case the reviewer/editor comes to know about it(before/after withdrawal), the consequences would be even more severe.\n\nEdit2: I e-mailed the dean keeping my advisor in cc and got a reply immediately. They were furious as their e-mail suggested and told me to report to the institute in a week. My advisor called me and told \"I never knew you would turn to be like this\". I am thinking to end my life if they expel me/revoke my degree by taking the entire responsibility on my shoulder and make it public if needed that it was all my fault and my advisor was not involved. I am finally happy that I was able to stop myself from contaminating the literature. Thank you guys for your support. I am ashamed and proud of myself at the same time.",

You were an undergrad and were still learning how to do research; so mistakes do happen - which is one of the reasons it's unusual that an undergraduate paper get's all the way to publication. If you go to your advisor and say \"in hindsight, and with more experience, I think this and this is wrong\" you should be absolutely fine - much better to find this now instead of during the peer review process. \n\nIf you intentionally changed your data then I can't help you.",

Outside is also unlikely because it'll be marked on your transcript/degree and any LoRs will mention it too. You've burned those bridges.

It's one of those things where if you cross the barrier just one time, it's so much easier to do it again and again for the rest of your life. \n\nThere is one rule that we all (well, most of us) hold sacred: you present the truth of the data. You don't purposely move bad points around to fit your narrative, and you certainly don't do it in secret, with no justification and no raw data presented. But you *have* done this, and that makes you fundamentally different to the rest of us. \n\nThey can never trust you again. To be honest, I don't think you can ever trust yourself again either. There is endless temptation to fabricate data or fudge the facts a little bit, and if you've given in when the stakes were so incredibly low, how can you possibly resist when it feels like your career or funding is relying on you getting a certain result? Will you have the strength to tell the truth of the data or will you try to move points around to suit your pre-arranged conclusion again? \n\nYou can't answer this and neither can anyone else, and the risk of a \"no\" answer is enough to dissuade anyone from working with you.",

If OP fabricated data when there was no clear need to do so, academia likely isn't the right place for them anyway. There's a lot of temptation and not a lot of checks and balances, so our conscience is really the only thing stopping us from doing the same thing every day. Like a student who skips class for the first time, OP is probably going to struggle to resist that temptation again in the future. \n\nKnowing what things tempt you and avoiding them isn't weakness, it's the height of strength. I avoid alcohol because I know it will tempt me. I avoid weed because I know it will tempt me. There are many other paths OP can take that won't involve their temptations or require a regular struggle against them.\n\nI hadn't seen the edit, so I apologise if my tone was too harsh. OP should look into counselling to help them disentangle personal value from just normal, human fallibility. It helped me a lot to learn to see my weaknesses as things to manage, not as a death sentence.",

I think the same broadly applies to any bad habits, and if you know you tend towards one bad habit then you really have to go out of your way to avoid the temptation and put failsafes in place. Habits are very easy to form and very hard to break. \n\nThere might be some cases where someone e.g. cheats on an exam under a moment of sheer panic and then can't take it back, and maybe they wouldn't be as likely to cheat again in the future, but if it's a very carefully-made choice over many months, that person has really thought it through and has still chosen to do the wrong thing. In their eyes, it is justified. They can come up with the same justifications in the future.",

Being caught and punished is simultaneously the best and worst thing for them as a researcher. \n\nI would be wary of comparing exact treatments that involve alcohol and drugs. There's an element of physical addiction there that can trump willpower, and that has to be treated alongside the willpower issues. It's unlikely that you'd be addicted to cheating on your spouse though, or raping people, which your second example says punishment seems to work for.",

But for this to work, they have to trust that the raw data we've provided is real. OP hasn't just made a little mistake, been a bit overzealous with the outlier removal, or made a poor judgement call on the method of analysis: they have tampered with the original data, are passing it off as real, *and* have destroyed all of the untampered data to cover their tracks. \n\nThe editors can't tell that the raw data itself has been manipulated or fabricated. Readers can't tell either until they fail to reproduce the results, which might not be until millions of dollars are handed out in grant money worldwide, especially if the result is as \"ground-breaking\" as OP claims. This is *public, tax-payer money* that would be wasted just to prove OP is a liar. Even just to publish a paper showing OP is wrong costs *you* money.

There is no way someone could think manipulating data for their own gain was the right thing to do. They chose to lie and cheat. They then made the exact same choice every second since then when they didn't fix it and didn't retract the work. *They* submitted it to a journal or gave permission for it to be submitted. And they didn't fabricate data because of any worry about being homeless, since they've admitted the fake data doesn't change the results. They just lied for the sake of it. It wasn't a decision made under duress. \n\nMaybe their degree will be revoked. Maybe they'll just lose whatever their undergraduate thesis was worth and have to do it again, or have their grade/classification adjusted. Fixing what they have done will be a long and difficult job, but they do need to fix it. They can't be given a slap on the wrist and allowed to continue. At best, they keep their previous degree but do not continue with the Masters, which may be reasonable if it's just one part of the thesis. \n\nThis is the exact same argument students give when they \"really need\" an A in some class and think that their need for an A is enough reason to get one. If you really need a good grade, show up and do the work and earn that grade. If you really need a degree, don't lie and cheat and then make many decisions which lead to those lies being discovered.

Life might be bumpy for OP for a while, and frankly they brought these consequences upon themselves (an innocent mistake is one thing, but frankly it seems like there\u2019s still much OP isn\u2019t sharing with us about why this is so serious (and why they didn\u2019t own up sooner)). But bumps happen. There\u2019s still a whole wide world outside of scientific research that is open to OP.\n\nLying about data is the worst thing you can do in research. It can and does have real-world effects. Scientific research isn\u2019t a fun little game of who can get the most publications, whose data looks the prettiest, who made the best points. It\u2019s a furthering of our understanding of the world, our ability to manipulate it, and our ability to *survive* in it. Falsified data, depending on the field, can jeopardize the survival of individuals, species, economies, countries. It\u2019s not something you can or should take lightly, and people who do it should not be allowed to participate in further data collection, analyzing, or communicating it.\n\n*But research is not the only thing that exists in the world.* You wouldn\u2019t let a money-embezzling employee continue to work in finances, even if that\u2019s how they were supporting their family. You\u2019d fire them. You\u2019d ensure they don\u2019t get the same job with the same opportunities for embezzlement elsewhere. BUT THEY COULD STILL WORK A DIFFERENT JOB IN A DIFFERENT FIELD. (After the whole \u201cthat\u2019s a crime\u201d thing is over, anyway.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re speaking as though OP would never be able to do anything else to provide for their family after facing the consequences of their actions. Again: obviously we do not want OP to take their life. This, frankly, is no reason to do so. There\u2019s a whole world of careers out there that are not research/data based.",

If so, you would (should) have known at the time that you were doing something wrong. I am not sure what could lead revokation other than something really egregious like falsifying data or plagarism. \n\nIt's not uncommon for students to be anxious about whether you have done something correctly.

You are a human being with multiple values and purposes - your life is meaningful.

This could come back and ruin your career at any point in the future if you hadn't done anything about it. There are very famous cases of prominent researchers committing data manipulation to publish in high impact journals and when it got out, the repercussions went even further than the individuals and their institutions. So, you definitely feel terrible now, and the paper should be drawn, but in my opinion, in the long run, this was the only way to handle things properly.",

Please do not take your own life and let your family feel unbearable pain for the rest of their lives.  Sometimes in academia, life seems like it has to be a straight path.  You write papers, you complete degrees, you move up.  You feel that you can't live your life because that path is being cut short.  It's not.  Even if they take your undergraduate degree...that's fine.  You know how many hustlers out there making more money than I will in a life time, that don't have a degree?  You will provide for your family because you have wit and you're ambitious.  You made a mistake.  We all have at one point or another in our lives.  Please please please see past this one event in your life.  My friend almost killed himself.  His mom intervened and now he is married with two lovely daughters.  He would have left a hole in our hearts if he cut his life short.  Your advisor and the dean will be upset....and that's fine.  They have a right to be.  But I promise you that they don't want you to end your life and neither does your family.  I don't know you, but I wouldn't want you to end your life.  You are so valuable.  They will be angry but that doesn't mean you are a bad person.  It just means you made a mistake and you have the ability to change.  Live life to the fullest.
