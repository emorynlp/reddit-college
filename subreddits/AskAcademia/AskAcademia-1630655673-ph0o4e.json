  "title:": "My undergraduate project supervisor made himself first author as well as corresponding author on a paper which was mine. I don't know what to say.",
  "text": "I am a PhD candidate now. But nearly 4 years ago during my undergraduate I did a project which I wrote down as a paper. Due to lethargic attitude of my supervisor it got very much delayed and was not submitted. I am applying for scholarships now so I asked him to submit it so that I can mention it. After some back and forth he agreed to finish it up and submit. To my surprise when I got the submission mail I saw he has put himself as an equal contribution first author along with corresponding author in the final draft. This was not discussed in anyway.\n\nThe work is done entirely by me and I was the one who has to drag on this for publication last 4 years due to his lethargic attitude ( which potentially cost me  scholarships in masters ) and now with no care he has gone and taken credit for the work I did. \n\nI am devastated. We are on a really good mentorship terms and I always cherished working with him (except his laziness) as we also connected quite well on ideas beyond our research. I never imagined he will do something like this. I don't know what to say to him. I was thinking either he removes himself as first author and remain as corresponding author which I am totally fine with. Or if he wants so badly to be a first author he should make me as a corresponding author.\n\nI am still trying to process all this. Any advice will be helpful. I understand what he did was wrong but I also don't want to sabotage things with him as I have known him for so long and apart from this our relationship has been quite good.\n\nEdit : By finishing I mean reviewing the final draft (making minor edits) which I send to him ages ago and then submitting it. I didn't have any grant to cover me up for this project so he only submitted it. We decided he will be the corresponding author I am just shocked on putting himself as first author without consent",

      "text": "The corresponding author is often the person with the permanent position that will remain at the university.  Students are too transient so the address and email will be out-of-date very quickly.  Even if the professor moves, there is often an easier paper-trial to locate their new position than a student that may never publish another paper. \n\nThe other thing the corresponding author does is communicate with the journal about revisions, etc.  Once again, it makes sense he would do that.  Plus, I assume your talk about grants means he is paying for the publication fees. \n\nAs for co-first authorship, this will be lesson learned that you should negotiate these things in advanced if you care.  However, if you are going to have a long career in science, one co-first author vs solo first author will make very little difference.",

It makes complete sense to be equal contributors on the paper. In the long run it still counts as a first author paper for you, at least in my field an equal contribution first is just as good as a solo first. It would also make sense he is the corresponding author because A) he is senior to you and B) you are no longer in that lab at the time of submission. I was not listed as a corresponding author until I had my own grant and even then the first paper was a co-corresponding spot because my mentor was the senior author on the paper.",

You asked him to submit it, and he finished up the paper.  If you wanted to keep first authorship you needed to tell him that you world have liked to submit the paper, and if he could review a final version before you submitted it.",

And finally he's the corresponding author, he's responsible for all decisions about the paper including authorship. I realise it's disappointing to you and he's not handled this situation well, but I'm not sure you have much grounds to be upset about the authorship itself and ultimately you still have a first authorship paper.",

They just navigate the submission process and handle re-submitting. They should share the reviewer comments with you and that's it. Its literally an irrelevant title to your career. You asked them to submit, they will be corresponding author. It is what it is, move on.\n\nAs for first authorship, it seems they made you co-first. Being that this was done during your undergrad, I am sure you BOTH had a great contribution to writing simply because you very likely didn't have the writing skills to generate a submission ready manuscript (this isn't a knock on you, its just related to experience writing scientific papers).\n\nThe only issue at hand is leaving this paper for 4 years not being published. Whos fault that is, maybe them.....maybe both of you for not having much urgency to get it out somewhere. You still can note papers 'In-Prep/Pre-Submission' or 'In-Review' when you apply to places.\n\nI honestly don't see anything wrong with this situation. You're getting credit for your work, hes including himself as well being your supervisor/senior author, its getting out",

      "text": "I see so many assumptions in these responses & everyone is jumping to vilify this professor/PI, but without knowing the field, university, etc., we have no clue. In many fields, first authorship DOES matter for professors. In addition, it is not simply \u201ctheir job\u201d to do research with undergrads. It may be, but in my field & my particular R1 department, ANY research I do with undergrads is essentially volunteer work. It isn\u2019t going to do anything much for my reviews and promotions. I do it a lot, but it\u2019s solely because I care about them & want to help students succeed. \n\nNow, looking at the facts presented here\u2026 The OP said they did all of the work and writing. I literally don\u2019t know (and have never heard of one) undergrad who could\u2019ve written a full manuscript without extensive work on the part of the PI and/or an advanced grad student.  Maybe OP is super special, and maybe this happens more in other fields, but I find this suspect. More likely, OP worked their tail off but so did PI. OP just didn\u2019t realize it because PI was gently guiding and letting OP feel ownership over it, as opposed to red-penning the thing to death.\n\nI also find it pretty suspect that the PI is \u201clazy.\u201d Maybe, but more likely that person is drowning in work. \n\nFinally, the paper is four years old. Even if it was in great shape when OP wrote it, OP says PI had to finish writing it. Plus, surely the PI had to do a new lit search, update the writing, etc., after four years. \n\nOP, I think you should give that PI the benefit of the doubt until you see for sure how much rewriting was done, etc. You said you had a good relationship\u2026 and I believe it because PI was willing to pull this from the file drawer and resurrect it because you asked them to. From this, you got a first-author publication. Rather than be so angry and assume the worst, why not believe in the good relationship you said you had? \n\nJust food for thought.",

OP is claiming the professor was lethargic and dragged the paper out.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways, either OP is incorrect/lying and the professor didn\u2019t do this, or the professor really was the problem and should shoulder the blame for their lack of conviction on their commitments. If you are assuming OP isn\u2019t lying BUT the professor still isn\u2019t obligated and was doing him a huge favor, then I can\u2019t see how you\u2019re doing anything but simping for a guy who is shitty at his job just because he is higher in the food chain in this scenario. \n\nI can\u2019t ultimately determine if OP is a reliable narrator, but neither can you. I am responding with the assumption that OP is presenting a true side of their story, however your comments seem to be responding under the assumption that even if OP\u2019s story is true this poor professor doesn\u2019t owe the student they took on anything, even if he himself was the reason this project dragged on so long and contributed almost nothing to the research or paper.\n\nThat\u2019s bullshit. Professors shouldn\u2019t get magic passes where the onus is always presumed to be on the student because we should all be absolutely aware that there are plenty of awful academics and it\u2019s not at all hard to imagine that this guy really did just flub for years and is now finally making up for his commitment but flubbing yet again\n\nSo even if you don\u2019t want to assume either side is true I think it\u2019s ridiculous to do that thinking it doesn\u2019t change the outcome anyway.

If you guys get rejected from your desired journal, which happens often, then edits would have to be made to fit the requirement for the next journal, and so on until you find a journal that would even send it out to review. I have had so many 1-2 day rejections, then the entire process is very discouraging. Then there are reviewer comments and potential rewriting/additional experiments to do. And if it is accepted, then there are a million tiny things that the editor would want you to do. The whole process can take an additional year due to the waiting times and unpredictable additional work. \n\nYou have done a lot of the hard work, but the work on its own is not publish ready, no matter how much you believe it is ready. One reason is because the work has only been viewed by you, your PI, and your department peers, but it's very different for the journals. It has to go through the editor, then experts hired by the journal, and then three volunteered PI/reviewers, who all do not have relationships with you and will give you the hard truth - whether the paper fits with the journal, or if the information is appealing and can generate views/references, or if there are problems with the findings/conclusions. \n\nIf you do plan to do all of this work, then I would fight for single first author. Otherwise, it is not worth the effort and you should focus on your current PhD project.",

If you think they don't deserve co first authorship you should discuss with them right away and be frank, though for correspondence if you wanted it you shouldn't have asked them to submit. Usually the corresponding author submits, and that's part of what corresponding author is to begin with, so that one they probably shouldn't get much heat for when you asked them to do the submitting rather than just asking for approval of the final manuscript draft. That was a reasonable move in that position I'd think, almost implicit when you ask them to submit and prepare all the submission stuff, but first author position you should discuss right away.",

If you doubt it, I would suggest that you look at the journal it was submitted to and check out a variety of articles. My guess is that you will be hard pressed to find an article that has an undergrad listed as a first author and/or corresponding author. You have no idea where you will be in six months. He will more than likely be in his current position. This doesn't diminish the work that you did, it is just the way academic journals work. \n\nGood luck on your job search and make sure to mention the article. It's your work with your name on it. You can discuss the material. It's all good.\n\nInNae",

Don't be tempted to work with him again in the future despite his honeyed words (I had a very, very similar experience.)\n\nIn the future, always discuss order of authorship early and if you want to be the corresponding author you should submit the paper yourself. If someone is dragging things too long just let them know you'll be submitting yourself and inform them of their authorship position if it was not discussed before. This may get the ball rolling.",

Most research is fully done by lab assistants, students going into their masters to do more research, and you don't self publish until you have your own phd. And even THEN you will be sharing credits with whoever advised you, revised your work, or was part of the review or thesis defense team. You must share credit with a professor. You are representing your school through your paper and it must have a professor to tie the work to. This does not lessen the work completed alone. Everyone knows it's A big deal to be published and they assume the professor did NOT have any hands on directly in the research so dont worry too much. It is normal.",

How anyone could see that the professor who delayed the paper and made small edits and submitted it deserves first author is beyond me. If almost all of the writing, and especially the research, was done by one person (the student) then of course they should be first author. First author status is also infinitely more beneficial to the student than an established prof so even if it was 50/50 I\u2019m sure most rational profs would give their student the lead.\n\nCorresponding author because they submitted it makes sense, but first author is weird. Unless it\u2019s like\u2026 last name alphabetical order only, as some fields do. But all of the top comments are assuming the poor busy prof took time out to submit it even though writing is obviously the bulk of the work of a paper and submitting is more formatting. As you said imo the prof was just doing their job by revising it for submission. who would submit a paper they haven\u2019t reviewed?",

I get it, you are proud of your work and it feels as if your contribution is dimished by sharing the first author. In everyone elses' eyes you are an first author.\n\nHowever, I would like to add something else. I am routinely submitting studies to differnet journals and every single one of them asks the corresponding author to confirm that all authors have read the submitted version and agree with submitting it. This includes of course the title page, on which the authors are listed in order. \n\nThe fact that you learnt about the author order only afzer submission tells me that your supervisor did not show you the final draft before submitting. In theory, you could contact the journal and tell them, that you had no possibility to read the final draft... Thos would of course be a kind of nuclear option.",

In my field, Microbiology, first author is the lead researcher, corresponding author is the senior author and last name on the paper, usually. The senior author is most important. It\u2019s their lab, their money (usually), and their research. Everyone else on the paper is \u201cal\u201d as in et. al. I usually list authors in order of descending order of contribution. I even encourage visiting scientists to be corresponding author to help their career along. I have zero motivation to be both first and corresponding (or senior) author. \nThis has been an issue at my agency. They seem to think only first author publications count. I will not shortchange my students. Last year we published 18 papers because we were shut out of the lab due to the pandemic and had years of data to publish. I was senior author on eight of these. During my yearly evaluation, my boss asked if I was writing any, \u201cfirst author\u201d papers. I just smiled and said, \u201csurrrrrre, I am doing that.\u201d  All of the work that comes out of our group is mine or my partners. Our agency requires two papers a year, and I got 18??? Is that not enough? I\u2019ve gotten over 120 pubs so far in my career, I think I know what I\u2019m doing. I will cut him some slack though, he\u2019s an engineer and maybe they do it differently. Anyway, when you run a lab, give your people proper credit and help they\u2019re career along. It\u2019s your job as a mentor.",
