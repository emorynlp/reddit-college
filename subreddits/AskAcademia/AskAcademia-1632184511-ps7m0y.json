  "title:": "Does it matter what I major in for a physics PhD?",
  "text": "I'm a junior majoring in physics and math at a well-known school (not an Ivy but around the same level), and I'm considering getting a PhD in physics after I graduate. The problem is that the physics major at my school requires a full year's worth of a class in experimental physics (basically a lab class). While I'm not opposed to this in theory, I feel like a full year is kind of excessive, and the fact that it's only offered as a full-year thing (i.e. you have to start in fall and end in the spring of a single year) makes it really difficult for me to schedule my other classes, especially math/physics electives that I also want to take. If I were to not take experimental physics and instead take additional electives (which would mostly but not exclusively be in math or physics), would this be detrimental if I want to go to physics grad school, whether that's for my application or for research, even if this means dropping the physics major to a minor? I also don't have any research experience at the moment, but I'll be actively looking for research opportunities once I start school.",

      "text": "> even if this means dropping the physics major to a minor\n\nIt's definitely not going to help, but it won't be the end of the world.  The thing with graduate admissions is that there's usually some minimum cutoffs (degree level/type, grades, minimal experience, etc) which get your application considered, and then after that it comes down to who are the most qualified applicants of the bunch.  So the physics minor route might be sufficient for the minimum admissions cutoff, but it may render you less competitive than the other applicants.  If so, you'll need to make up for this some other way: for example, through substantial research experience, relevant work/professional experience, great letters of reference, a fantastic application & research statement, etc.  \n\nHowever, you need to do some research yourself to figure this out, because it depends on your plans and ambitions.  So the questions you need to find answers to (all available with a little bit of searching online):\n\n* Do the physics PhD programs that you're interested in require a major in physics?  What language do they use about degree requirements?  What other requirements do they have which you could knock out of the park?  If you aren't yet interested in specific programs, now is the time to start identifying universities & professors who are well-regarded in your subfield of interest and look up their admission requirements.  Note that these may be quite different between countries.\n\n* How many people in these programs have/don't have an undergrad degree in physics?  It's one thing to say it's not strictly required, but if all of their student have one then that's the real answer.  What other qualifications did they have?\n\n* What about at the level of the research groups you're interested in - do they all have physics degrees?  Do some have math degrees?  \n\n* While you're at it - do your target programs require (or expect) research experience?  Do they require a masters?",
