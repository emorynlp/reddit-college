  "text": "For EU students, the tuition fee will more than double starting next year And they will no longer be able to get a loan by student finance, meaning they will have to pay 20k \u201cin cash\u201d / directly each year. I can\u2019t imagine that the Unis will still be as popular after Brexit. There\u2019s also a high chance the European health card no longer works and they will have to get private health insurance while studying there. The rich kids will still be able to attend but all the other \u201cnormal\u201d EU students will most likely study somewhere else I think. What\u2019s your opinion?",

When I read the news about how much they want to charge us now if I went on to do a masters in the UK, I knew it wasn't a possibility anymore and went on to look up universities elsewhere.\n\nWhy tf would anybody in their right mind (even IF they are super rich) spend over 20 thousand euros on an education they can get for FREE or very little in Sweden, Finnland, Germany etc.?",

And it's no fun being out at a bar being left out of a conversation you don't understand because there's a critical mass of people who speak the native language. It also depends how how deep into society you wanna get. Side job? Relationship? Friendship pool with low turnover (ie not Erasmus students)? Or even internships and volunteer possibilities. Not saying it's impossible. Far from it. But it is definitely a factor. Everyone has their own threshold of what is tolerable when it comes to language discomfort.",

It makes no sense for unions to put pressure on students in order to get their plights through as, at the end of the day, we (students) have 0 saying in how payments and pensions are handled by the Universities.\n\nAdditionally, the argument a lot of the Universities used to not provide refunds, discounts or even help to international students was that \"fees were all inclusive\", making it sound like international students flew 6000 miles to another country just to experience the benefits of a shite Student Union and a couple of Uni-run pubs.\n\nNow here is where things get extremely annoying from my perspective: I come from a country which, before Covid-19, usually had 1-2 teachers & students strikes per year + 1 general strike and yet most (if not all) lectures lost would be rescheduled. There was a time when I was doing my BA that, in order to preserve the next academic year, I had to go to lectures in the last week of December and all the way through the last day of January so that we could safely begin new year/semester on the 1st of February.\n\nMind you, I was studying at the time in a severely underfunded public Uni which had 4 departments close to shutting down for good due to lack of payment and all in a third world country filled with corruption and whose education system is severely underfunded. How come that rescheduling lectures is something commonplace here and not in a top 100 Uni at a first world country?",

                          "text": "The demands have not been met. Pensions are still a big problem as are the general problems regarding workload et cetera. \n\nOf course the students are not the instigators, but that is what a strike does: the employees use the consumers as a pawn. When they complain loud enough, the boss will give in to the demands. \n\nOn doing a refund: it is quite complex: tuition fees pay for a lot of things but let's assume you pay \u00a318000/year as an overseas student. You get roughly 18 hours of lectures every week for 30 weeks. So you are paying \u00a3600/week. Not all lectures are spread evenly over the week so some students will miss 5 hours, other 15 hours and so on. Now imagine all the administration you would have to do to refund everyone for missed lectures. And then we are not discounting that part of your fees are going to the library, buildings, equipment, mental health support, cheap food, et cetera. So from that 600 a week, you will get only a small part back and to what expense. The administration will be more flooded with processing refunds and will not be able to help with other things. \n\nOn rescheduling: you will run in problems with space (let's forget about the pandemic and assume you can work at full capacity): lecture halls cannot be double-booked. If you have a class with 100 students, they need a large lecture hall. You cannot teach on the college green. Employment law and health and safety will make it very difficult to teach over the weekend or out of hours. So there are a lot of factors that make rescheduling a very complex thing. \n\nStudents have been on the picket supporting teachers. They understand that staff are being exploited. Students have the right to ask why teachers are on precarious contracts. If staff is happy, they will be better teachers. If you know that at the end of the semester you will be chucked out by the Uni, you will not invest too much time and energy in creating a syllabus. It is demotivating to study very long (it takes around 10 years to do BA-MA-PhD) and then having to work precariously is not fun.",

The Universities here care about their bottom line, so if students are going to leave if they don't get X, then that happens. They don't care if faculty leave because they can be replaced or other people can be forced to do their work for no more pay.",

And given how much the economy is suffering because of COVID, funding might decrease overall. \n\nA big selling point for UK unis was the freedom of movement for students who wanted to travel.
