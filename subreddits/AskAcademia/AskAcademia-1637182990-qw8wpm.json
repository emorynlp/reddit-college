  "text": "My friend has a PhD in arts and humanities but is interested in transitioning into an area of computer science. He has extensive experience in coding but no training in scientific methods of research. Would it be possible for him to transition from one to the other? If so, what would your advice be?",

As compared to all the applications of people with related terminal degrees.\n\nYou might want to start off adjuncting to show your worth and capabilities then do a handshake agreement with the department head to hire you... but that's still not an easy road.\n\nGood luck..",

I personally think he is pretty capable of doing that because he has skills in his field of interest, just not the academic background to support it. But yes it is a drastic transition nonetheless. (I am also not sure why the question has been downvoted, so double thank you for answering.)",
