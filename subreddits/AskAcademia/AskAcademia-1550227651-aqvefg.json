  "text": "The issue of impostor syndrome is quite a widespread one and I doubt many people haven't felt it at some point. It might be interesting, and perhaps helpful for some too, to see whether anyone has ever actually come across an individual in an academic position, where their having expertise would be essential to their role, whom they thought was actually an impostor in some way.

Or faculty who get jobs on the basis of teaching who flub research. \n\nAll the hats you have to wear, teacher, grant writer, paper writer, researcher, technician, mentor, employer... Its not surprising that not everyone is good at all of them.",

This was early 90's, so a bit before my time, but I believe she was able to pull it off because (1) she talked the talk really well, and (2) people didn't want to admit they'd been conned, and (3) very early internet times and so it was much more difficult to check her story~ essentially she was vetted when hired, was who she said she was at the time, and so no one followed up to confirm she had completed her Ph.D. \n\nThis tale was told to me by a couple of older fellow profs who knew the person involved. What I really wish I knew is why she had gotten so far along, even been hired on the tenure track, and didn't just finish the damned dissertation... ",

After a long period, after the abuse we both were subjected to by her ex, my Mom was understandably wiry of Men, she begun dating again. She met this highly charismatic fellow, who was Partner at one of the largest law firms in L.A.  I really liked him, he even bought my first Gi for Tae Kwon Do. After a few months my Mother suddenly cut ties with him, which actually upset me because I thought he was nice, smart, and would provide us with financial security. Do to my constant barrage of objections my Mom gave me the real reason she cut ties, he was a Con Artist. He had managed to get his position despite not having gone to Law School. In fact he wasn't even a High School graduate. I know that this is not in the context of working with an impostor in Academia, but I had to share this story, as it still has me guessing to this day how he did it. I mean this was not just a lie he was a lawyer told to my Mom, we went and visited him at his office, in a legit law firm, with his name on the building. Now, before I'm flooded with questions, I can't explain any further as this was almost 30 years ago, and I was just a child. Did he pull a Frank Abignail, and generate fake transcripts, and just studied really hard for the Bar exam? I do know that this has left me with a lifelong fascination to study for the Bar exam, and take it as proof to myself it can be done. Nevertheless, it is something I'll never forget.",

I was in speech and debate in college which, for those of you who aren\u2019t familiar, basically consists of groups of nerds and their professor-coaches gathering at different colleges for tournaments. Well, my coach was talking to a couple of her friends at a tournament one day and one of them told this story: he had just found someone at this university who faked their PhD. He was using their research in his research and asked them a question about a footnote and they acted super weird about it. So he did some digging and discovered all of that person\u2019s research was fake. He reported it to the university and the school investigated and found out that person had faked their PhD. As the coach is telling this story to my coach, someone else in the group piped up and says the same thing happened to them! They tell a very similar story and\u2014totally as a joke\u2014this group of friends decides to name themselves \u201cThe Committee to Ferret out False PhDs.\u201d A new coach happened to overhear them talking about their \u201ccommittee\u201d and, because he was new and didn\u2019t know them (debate is a small world so everybody knows everybody and no one else would have taken this at all seriously), he thought they were for real and TURNED HIMSELF IN TO HIS UNIVERSITY!! As it turns out, he had faked HIS PhD and was lying about all of his research. Although they remained on the (highly sarcastic) lookout, The Committee to Ferret out False PhDs never did find anyone else. But that\u2019s my story about how I was two degrees away from not one but THREE imposter professors! \n\nEdit: typos",

This is especially true in writing and grant applications.\n\nAnd this isn't all that specific to academics. It happens everywhere. That is why people's instagram lives seem so much better than your own _real_ life.\n\nI feel like there are two ways to deal with your own impostor syndrome. You could 'cure' it, by convincing yourself that you're not an imposter. Then you will probably end up like that senior faculty who confidently makes asinine suggestions that sounds good but lead nowhere. Or you could manage it by recognizing that impostor syndrome can be a healthy reminder to not be overconfident and to always be learning and challenging yourself on if you actually understand something that you think you understand.

It is not good at weeding out people that choose to be lazy post graduation or are predatory/unstable assholes, but as far as knowledge relevant to their degree goes?  Everyone I know with a PhD has that.  General intelligence is less valued in the applied sciences and I know a lot of PhD's with a lot of knowledge in a limited area that aren't 'generally brilliant'.  They may not be movers and shakers but they get the grunt work done.  Not everyone is going to be the next Richard Feynman and that is fine.\n\nAs others have mentioned, it takes minimal effort to not fail out of a graduate program.  Simply quitting is much more common.  There are instances where a predatory adviser/committee member effectively forces a person to quit, but in the majority of cases it is a personal decision by the student.  Don't quit because you feel you are not 'good enough', or because your adviser disagrees with you on something.  That is a failure to yourself.\n\nGrad students are STUDENTS.  The best advice I can give is to be humble.  If you are wrong, you are wrong.  No big deal.  Don't beat yourself up over it, just learn.",

A gross generalization, people drop out for all sorts of reasons, but I do agree that getting through means one isn't an imposter.  A PhD may not be TT quality, but that's different.  I suppose pedigree may also be of interest - I am thinking a degree from an R1 versus an online university, not the petty differences.\n\nAs for actually existing imposters, there is a JD who works adjacent to my field and teaches at a law college.  Their evidence is incredibly comprehensive and informative, amazingly so.  However, the conclusions they draw and get published are weak and sensational.  A lot of reinventing the wheel and not understanding implications - it is clear they never took any theory/epistemology/philosophy of science.  This person has also been caught listing visiting professorships on their resume when they were brought in as a lecturer or adjunct.  ",

It's like an undergraduate that discovers the built in thesaurus in word. They compare their research to our top flight researcher claiming theirs is in the best journals and so on. If you manage to avoid any topic that makes them feel like they need to compare they are pleasant but heaven help you if you trigger them.

They talk about how their colleagues' grants are based on terrible ideas, how they can't believer person X got *that* job. People give talks and there are people in the audience who, during the Q&A after (sometimes during, if they are real jackasses), will just try to unravel everything that was just said in front of everyone, appearing to try and expose this person as a fraud. (In this last case, it is almost always that the questioner hasn't really listened - and maybe the speaker didn't communicate very effectively either - and generally has a penchant for this kind of public theater.) Departments are full of drama about factions against Professor X or Y, because people think they are idiots and didn't deserve their degree much less that job. \n\nIt starts right away with students, the faculty will sit around and just decide who they feel has \"it\" - some intangible, undefinable quality that is rare and necessary, but not sufficient, to be a scientist (the frequency of this type of thinking varies widely with the field, however).\n\n",

Because I've seen exactly this situation - something wrong, and in my opinion, highly dangerous - written by a \"competitor\", and I imagine that people could conceivably think that I'm just trying to sabotage the author. I contacted the author, and he is clearly very upset with me and suspects I'm trying to undermine him. God knows what he has told other people.  \n\nBecause of exactly this perception, I have not really said anything publicly, or even privately to mutual acquaintances. Part of me thinks I should speak up more publicly, as a service to the field, but this is just reinforcing my belief that people will think I'm one of these people you describe. In general, I'm very generous with giving credit to other young people, and I don't have a reputation for deliberately sabotaging people. My solution has been to ignore the problem, figuring that other people will figure out in their own that the material is flawed.\n\nI\u2019ve also found that, surprisingly often, the department curmudgeon is actually right about things. And people write him off because of his previous behavior. I can\u2019t really defend him or it might affect people\u2019s perception of me as well.",
