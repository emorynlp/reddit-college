  "title:": "When offered multiple postdoc positions, what were your deciding factors?",
  "text": "This is not an inquiry for a 'general guide' in criteria to look for when deciding a postdoc position and choosing between multiple offers. Things I am already aware of and am taking into consideration:\n\n* Expertise (i.e., research niche of PI -- do you like the questions/models)\n* Funding status/success (e.g., R01s in USA)\n* Mentorship style (you and PI getting along on an interpersonal level)\n* Trainee input (i.e., experiences/successes of past/present trainees under the PI)\n* Publication history (e.g., journal impact, frequency of publication)\n* etc...\n\n**What I'm curious about is more personalized reasons why you chose one postdoc offer over another?**\n\n(Basically, I will likely have multiple offers from PIs that meet all the standard check boxes... so what are some nuanced considerations after the obvious is accounted for?)",

      "text": "Am also trying to choose between multiple good offers right now. Some personal things on my list include: Where would I rather live? Is it close to the mountains? How big is the city? Is there a farmer's market? What are the politics and healthcare like? How far is it from my family? How is the subculture for my hobbies?",

      "text": "I had two postdoc offers at one time, both good, but also both representing fundamental differences in the kind of work I would be qualified for in the future.\n\nI ended up selecting on two criteria, which luckily matched: first, one of the PIs was an egomaniac cunt (which I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t like but could have also dealt with), and second (and maybe more importantly) I chose based on which direction I could see myself going in the future and for the long term. \n\nSo PI personality played some role, but more importantly where did I see myself in five or ten years? What was it I *really* wanted to be when it was over?",
