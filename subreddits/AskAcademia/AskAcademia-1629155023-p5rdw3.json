  "title:": "Dual careers in physics and philosophy of science?",
  "text": "I'm in theoretical physics but over the last year have become extremely interested in philosophy, especially the history and philosophy of science. I really enjoy my current job (I'm doing a postdoc whilst finishing up PhD) but I absolutely love philosophy. Ideally I'd love a career where I can pursue research in both fields but I can't see how that would be possible. Ideally I'd continue as a physicist but write papers in philosophy alongside, but I am also considering applying for a philosophy fellowship. I'm trying to set up collaborations to help achieve this, but my question is: does anyone ever manage two academic careers? It seems that grants, teaching, academic progression etc are all geared up for someone who is based in a single department. I know people who have switched fields but don't know anyone who is research active in two simultaneously. Is there any hope?",

      "text": "One of your big issues is that, at an R1, physics will often have a dollar amount in grants tied to tenure, either implicitly or explicitly. In contrast, philosophy will often have no dollar amount expectation (it's a nice bonus, but hardly required) and is more tied to books, papers, and community perception (invited talks, etc). It's quite possible to write papers outside your main field, especially if you have a relevant post-doc experience, but those papers would essentially be useless for physics tenure progression. The reverse (philo to phys) would be nearly impossible due to lack of funding and departmental resources.\n\nA better alternative is to work on an interdisciplinary project with a philosophy professor. I do this kind of work as an engineer collaborating with the philo department. The object is to come of up with relevant topics and then each focus on your specialty. However, this type of work is actually easier at less research intensive schools since the grant requirements for physics professors are lower.",

          "text": "I did collaborate with a creativity theorist and it was disastrous. He was only interested in bizarre misrepresentations of science and taking famous words completely out of context. It was exhausting, and I ended up having to pull out of the project. I know many other philosophers of science who are far more intellectually robust.\n\nOne of the main reasons I am taking this seriously is that I believe that as a physicist I have genuine perspectives that I can contribute to philosophy, and understanding philosophy will deepen my understanding of physics. I don't really mind writing papers that don't contribute to tenure progression as long as they make a noticeable impact in philosophy. The trouble of course is the time required to make both work. \n\nA benefit of doing a part-time philosophy degree is the 'excuse' to write papers in that field.",
