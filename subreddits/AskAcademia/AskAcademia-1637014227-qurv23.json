This is just a rough rule, certain journals are still highly regarded even if they have low impact factor but it depends on expert knowledge. \n\nHopefully this gives a starting point about how to evaluate journals.",

It will take at most five minutes in a discussion before someone calls Scientific Reports \u201cNature Trashcan\u201d and mostly for good reasons.",
