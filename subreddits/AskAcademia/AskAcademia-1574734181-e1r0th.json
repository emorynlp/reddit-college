  "title:": "Professor here, why don't undergrads reply to my emails when I'm offering them help? Even if they initiate the exchange?",
  "text": "I'd say this happens at least 50% of the time, maybe more.\n\nIs this a generational thing? Younger people now just read emails, take in the information, and don't write back?\n\nStudents often write to me requesting extra credit assignments. I always comply because it is stated in the syllabus that any student is eligible. I'll construct an assignment, or give them some options, but then they won't write back to say yes or no, or anything. \n\nSometimes a student will miss a big assignment or an exam. I'll always follow-up with an email to those students to remind them to hand in the assignment or check-in about missing the exam. Rarely do they write me back.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your input. It seems the majority of responses say that it is depression and anxiety that are the cause. I find this very ironic as I suffered from very severe depression during undergrad that was undiagnosed and untreated. However, I responded very differently to these types of situations - which is probably part of why I did, or even could, become a professor. \n\nI do not feel insulted, but it does feel very frustrating. I feel I am reaching out to help these students, and I get not even a \"thanks but no thanks\" response. It seems undergrads feel their professors are aloof and uncaring, I never wanted to be like that. But when I reach out, it doesn't work. I will have to find some other way.",

      "text": "Advisor here. I get students in my office all the time telling me about how they're failing a class. First thing I ask is whether they have spoken to their instructor; it's almost always a 'no.' Why?\n\n Because the student feels they're an inconvenience, a burden, that they're doing everything wrong and that fading out of sight is making way for you use your time helping 'good' students. I've noticed two trends:\n\n1. Anxiety. Rapid interconnection of technology now means that most people can't get away from all the online negativity if they tried, whether it's politics, world events, etc. This instills a generalized anxiety and powerlessness which affects them in other parts of life, like school. And because of this anxiety, even the slightest perception of annoyance on your part in an email can trigger the student. Not that you ARE showing any annoyance, I'm sure, but remember that an email is a pretty emotionless medium, and an already anxious student will fill the void with their own emotional perceptions. I find that you kind of have to spell out your intentions of support so the student's anxiety can't run wild.\n\n2. Misinformation about instructors. Maybe this is tied to the anxiety, but I always have to convince students that going to office hours isn't inconveniencing or burdening the instructor. I legit have to tell them, \"Your professor is being paid to have those office hours, it's part of their job.\" They seriously don't get that.",

                  "text": "I was that student! A little background about me! I am a first generation college student and I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Sciences from the University of South Florida (USF). I also attended Florida State University where I studied Organic Chemistry for 3 years until I was dismissed from the program. \n\nBefore studying at USF, I attended community college where I felt comfortable asking professors questions in a 20 student classroom setting without having the feeling that I would be interrupting the lesson or that I would ask a dumb question and be laughed at. Once I transferred to USF, I felt less like a student and more like a number. Because of this, whenever I had unanswered questions I would tell myself that I was just being dumb or that I wasn't studying enough and that the professor wouldn't have time to answer my silly question. So I would leave most of my questions for the TAs or spend entire Saturdays and Sundays studying for the class. \n\nThis self-destructive behavior carried over from undergrad to graduate school. As you know, in order to succeed in graduate school you need to keep in close contact with your advisor. A skill I had never practiced in undergrad and which made things even worse for me while trying to teach and spending 60+ weekly hours in lab. I became super stressed after my third year of this pattern and it was all downhill thereafter. I was burned out.\n\nI now work as an organic chemistry tutor where I encourage students to talk to the professors since I now know that they are actually there for you and willing to help if you would just ask. I think that the major problem is that as students we don't know who the professor is anymore. We just see a tiny figure in a 250+ student classroom and it's very difficult to see that behind the professor is an actual person that cares and just wants the best for you and that they are doing their best to pass on their knowledge. Maybe we should have more technical schools since there is now a surplus of students that are told that the only way to make money is to go to medical school? Maybe education should be more personalized and the classrooms should be smaller? I'm not sure what the solution is to this problem but it's one that I've been thinking about a lot lately. Let me know your thoughts!",

So depressed I didn't care, didn't respond to emails, or just didn't check it for days. Text messages and calls were the same; I'd get a notification, swipe it away, then turn my phone over and continue doing nothing.\n\n2. So depressed I was on the edge of an anxiety every minute of every day. Each time I thought about how behind I was in class and research, I would go into full blown panic. The (good-natured, helpful, concerned) professor would reach out, and all it reminded me of was that I was doing so noticeably shitty that I was being called out, out of all of my peers. I would spend so much time stressing and attempting to draft an email reply, but nothing seemed good enough to answer for my mistakes, so I buried my head in the sand until the semester went away. \n\nGhosting was my specialty for months on end, through no fault of theirs. Though, some students are just lazy. Either way, try not to take it personally; in the end you know you did the most you could for the students, which is more than many professors can say.",

Trust me I went down kicking and screaming, but I spent the time learning how to stop and breathe without swinging into either extreme, and most importantly I learned how to forgive myself. No one will die if I don't answer that one email or if I need to take the day off of work and social plans to be by myself, or if I submit this paper a couple days after I had planned to.\n\nIn the preceding 10 years before the Big Incident during my PhD, I simply stayed in bed for a week or two, collected my dismal grade, and spent the next semester or two taking 20+ course credits, which was indeed incredibly stressful, so rinse and repeat.",

This actually made me realize something that, as new professor for undergrads, I didn't realize. \n\nI think the reason students might not respond is that they view me almost like a parent. Parents do dozens of things every day for their kids that they are not thanked for or responded to, nor do the parents feel they should be. If someone else did those things, sure, it requires a response. but there is a tacit agreement of non-reciprocity among kids and parents. If your parents buy you a bicycle, they don't expect you to buy them something of comparable value in return.\n\nWith graduate students (whom I usually teach) the relationship is different, I think. It's among professional colleagues, though one is more senior than the other. And grad school is a closed system within a department, usually. You are hyper-aware to avoid pissing off your professors because, not only will they turn up everywhere in your life during your graduate career, they can turn up at any time to influence your career for as long as you stay in the field. As an undergrad professor, unless they want a recommendation from me, I am essentially disposable to them.",

I had a poorly managed physical illness throughout undergrad that was fatiguing. It was like a depression, and perhaps I was depressed. \n\nEither way, I had the same exact behaviors, even simple emails were so difficult to write when things were spiraling out of control. I constantly ghosted and couldn't communicate with professors despite knowing I should. Just imagine trying to start a car, stomping on the gas so hard, but nothing happens. That's exactly how life felt.\n\nI'd also add, I constantly had the feeling that I don't know these people, and they shouldn't be dealing with my shit, so it was super difficult to be proactive about things. Every literally email became very overwhelming. I think a lot of students also can feel very embarrassed.",

They do this on their phone, they are used to the communications being for social purposes, so they kind of thing that only the first bit is important.  So when I say, I can't give you a make up BUT here are you other options, they literally did not know there was a \"but\". \n\n These are the students that showed up, outside normal class hours for extra review, and generally the best of the bunch, so I imagine this is probably worse\n\n3)  They read stuff immediately when it comes it, regardless of if they are in class, or driving (god help us all), with no idea that class and work related stuff has to have some kind of time devoted to it.\n\n4) Once they realize that this is going to be a longer thing and they will have to read it later, they forget to deal with it.  Yes, you heard me right.  Because they don't have any concept that emails or communications have to be organized and that you can't remember everything and they don't know what a folder is and they do everything on their phone.  \n\nThe almost direct quote is  - I kind of remembered that you said you would allow me to do something but then I kind of forgot about it because I had another test and when I looked back the deadline had passed.\n\n5) I didn't think you meant it.  I said I can do a face time, other office hours, a phone tutorial - whatever.  They said they felt bad because it would be a bother.  I now do a 20 min routine on how I am a horrible person so if I offer something I really mean it is ok to take me up on the offer because such a mean sociopath only offers something when it is really on the table.\n\n6) They weren't going to do the thing (a resubmit, an exam re-do) because they didn't have any clue how to do it.  Part of the 20 min routine now - things that I will boot you out of the class for - cheating, being mean to other people.  Things I have unlimited patience for - young people who are stupid and who would prefer to be not stupid.\n\n7) The felt singled out and weird.  I pointed out that they have no idea of knowing who else I sent emails to, spoke to etc, and they were like - oh yeah, I didn't think of that.  They really personalize all of these interactions.\n\nI am sure there is more, but this is straight from the mouths of babes.",

The younger generation is so used to just getting what they want through the internet, we often stop the  email exchange after we get \"what we want\" from the professor (i.e. extra credit assignments or make up dates). \n\nAlso, some students would consider a professor's reply as a \"yes\"/final answer, hence the delayed/absence of response.

The first time I went, 15 years ago, professors never had an issue with responsiveness from students via email.\n\nFive years later (2010), all of my professors (but especially older ones) took issue with it. \"If I write you an email, you have to respond! Why aren't you responding to my emails? What is with you kids?! Grumble grumble!\"\n\nBy the time I was in grad school (2015), teachers wouldn't even bother with email, and instead interacted with us only on blackboard.\n\nSo, sure, I think depression/anxiety could be part of it. But I also think it's the product of an age gap. I think for most undergraduate age students today, email is a communication method of last resort.\n\nThere are so many other, flashier, more convenient social media outlets and chat apps that they are constantly checking. So many different avenues of conversation other than email, and those other avenues are prioritized. To me, email is just as valid as, if not more valid than, any other option. But I think that validity has worn away for younger generations. I think that if you remember the sound of a dialup modem connecting, then you probably remember to be responsive via email.\n\nHowever, even for me, at this point I have turned off email notifications on my phone, because I get so many that are just empty fluff, notifications, reminders, and junk that need no response. Or, it's an attachment someone sent me that they couldn't get to me via another, more \"direct\" method. I think people mostly use their email today in the workplace, where undergrads are not yet located, or to sign up for things memberships and accounts all over the internet.",

My impression is that undergrad classes are usually huge and not exactly \"committed\" or specialized, meaning undeclared majors, etc.. So the email inquiries about extra credits might just be them being curious about how hard it is to get an A in this course or so, and when they realize it\u2019s a bit too much for them they just stop responding (maybe in some cases because they don\u2019t know how to say no to a professor?), and move on to other aspects of the \u201cvibrant college life\u201d, or other deadlines.",

That's what they chose. \n\nBut we definitely felt bad that all our offers of help just didn't get through to the students.

      "text": "I just wanted to add something to all the great point already made. Something I always found stressful in responding to emails from professors was that writing the response took a looooong time. It takes a lot of energy to figure out how to write a professional, competent sounding email, especially when nobody has really taught you how to write emails before. Your only prior experience is writing to your friends where you may well end every interaction with \"c ya later babe xoxo\". In my first experience with university email, I remember freaking out because I didn't know if I was supposed to put a kiss at the end or not. And more commonly used methods of communication like Messanger and Whatsapp don't require \"signing off\". They happen in real time and once you're done talking, you just stop talking.\n\nI also remember getting frustrated that I would get emails from professors that required a response, and that response might take me 3 hours to write, even if it was just a couple of sentences. It frustrated me that they didn't understand just how much of my time they were wasting by needing me to respond in a way that sounded as good as how they wrote. I was always so worried about what they would think of me. It might take a whole day of my headspace just to write one email. (and yeah I had depression and anxiety too).\n\nNow, having seen the speed at which professors respond to my emails over so many years, I am less worried about firing off spelling-error riddled responses just for the sake of getting shit done.",
