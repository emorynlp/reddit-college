  "title:": "What does it mean for someone to be \"good at research?\"",
  "text": "Sorry if the title is a bit ambiguous and broad. I was chatting last night with a couple of people from my lab. One of them is a recent PhD who's a year older than me and is one of the lab's \"assets\" in the sense that he's done some good work in our field and many people look up to him. Let's call him Tom. Tom also happens to be one of those people who I would call \"pretentious\" in the sense that his usual attitude is \"I don't need people who work hard I need people who are actually good.\"\n\nJust for some background information, I'm a second semester MSCS student. I plan to applying to PhD programs abroad this fall so that when I graduate next spring I can start right away.\n\nThe context of how the title of this post came to be is that Tom usually tells me things like \"among your line of batchmates (people who entered the lab the same year) A and B are going to be the ones who shine\" (I may be taking this the wrong way but the way he says it seems to imply that I'm not good enough), \"I get that you enjoy research, but you really need to ask yourself if you're actually good at it,\" etc. and last night that really got me thinking.\n\nWhat exactly does it mean to be \"good at research?\" I asked him the same and he didn't really give me a straightforward answer after I retorted that everybody has their own measures of success. I took a look at [this Quora question that's answered by one of my favorite Quora people](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-if-I-will-be-a-good-researcher) but I was curious what other people on this subreddit may think.\n\nMy personal criteria for one to be good at research is to first and foremost actually enjoy it (e.g. enjoy the feeling of realizing how \"dumb\" one is and enjoy the process of filling in knowledge gaps). I personally don't hold \"publish a lot of papers\" as a criterion but I've noticed the majority of people do.",

      "text": "There's a few things that I think come together to make a person a strong researcher:\n\n1. Self motivation - this one is absolutely critical. If you are a person who needs reassurance and pick-me-ups from other people at any kind of regularity to keep on with tasks, or as a clap on the back for completing a task, this is not the space for you. I absolutely encourage people to build positive workspaces where those things happen, but the reality is that on month 6 of a project when you realise everything you've been doing since Christmas has been a waste of time because of thing X, you need to be able to find it in yourself to start over and get going at it again with a modified approach/whatever.\n\n2. Time management - When you're left to your own devices you need to be able to schedule yourself reasonably.\n\n3. Thoughtfulness - If you are a researcher you need ot be able to critically think about what you and others are doing. What's working, what's not working, where are the gaps, what might things mean, etc etc. It's entirely possible to love doing the data gathering but never really cross that threshold. However, this is also where most of the imposter syndrome comes in, as you convince yourself that others in the field have some kind of wiley mastery over the black arts. The reality is that most of us are metaphorically grabbing a few threads and trying to tie them together.\n\n4. Clarity - This comes with experience, but you ultimately need to reach a point where you can express your thoughts and ideas clearly and precisely.\n\n5. Luck. It really really helps if you can be in the right place at the right time. Find yourself in an area that suddenly becomes a hot topic. Graduate at the right time for the right job to be available. Bump in to person Y at a conference and have a surprise conversation that exposes fruitful research idea z. etc etc.\n\nA final one I'll add; Be kind. There's a proportion of arseholes in academia. They're not everywhere, and hey're not even the majority. But they exist. Counter their fuckwittery. Support your colleagues. Let them help support you. Be constructive in your feedback, and be proactive in sharing your time and effort with people you trust or - as you become more senior - have influence over. Try to be a positive role model. I have forged so many successful and productive collaborations (and friendships) by saying yes to things, by sharing data, by being supportive of people trying to achieve things. It's played a part in job offers, and it's resulted in probably 70% of my publications. It's resulted in all sorts of funded travel opportunities. If you're good people to work with word gets around.",

The ability see how an idea developed in one field could be extrapolated in novel and unique ways to problems being explored in other fields. The ability to make connections that most people miss. \n\nAll the qualities you list are what I would put in the category of being a good worker, a good colleague, etc. You can be all those things, and still be shitty at research.",

I've had people like that at various stages in my life, and yet, here I am.\n\nI think a good researcher is someone who has strong critical thinking and organisational skills, and is open-minded. The person also has to be curious and have a lust for knowledge and discovery.\n\nEven though the fact that you enjoy something doesn't mean that you are good at it, I believe that the passion you have for it will motivate you to work hard and by doing so you'll get good at it. Natural talent is good and all, but there's a certain grit that comes with hard work and learning things the hard way. You never forget it and it becomes a part of you.\n\nBasically, I'm saying that whether you were born with it or you had to work for it, if you're good you're good. Doesn't matter how you ended up there. Just keep doing what you're doing. If you've made it this far then you must be doing it right, right?",

          "text": "> I think a good researcher is someone who has strong critical thinking and organisational skills, and is open-minded. The person also has to be curious and have a lust for knowledge and discovery.\n\nI would also add: \n\n- Someone who is patient and thorough \n- Someone who doesn't see difficulties and setbacks as failures but rather part of the process\n- Someone who is more interested in getting rigorous results than looking smart or getting an answer that looks good (this is exemplified in someone who is comfortable asking questions all along the way)\n- Someone who doesn't stop searching just when they get the answer they want\n- Someone who is careful and precise, and takes good notes\n- Someone whose work is relatively easily repeatable\n\nI agree that \"Tom\" here should not be the final arbiter of OP's future, but I think I get what he's saying. I have had so many undergrads who *loved* science and had great recs from their professors just burn out on research when they really had to do it in a meaningful way in the lab. There is surprisingly little overlap between the skills that make someone a \"successful\" science student as opposed to a research scientist. \n\nI think, for every scientist, there is a point in your career (usually in getting a PhD), where research can become very frustrating - there are no more textbooks to refer to, no more people to ask for help because you are the one who is doing it all for the first time. This can be exhilarating when it goes well, of course, but very stressful when it doesn't and you don't know when it will start to work.",

You wrote an incredibly thoughtful post here that involved a certain level of self-reflection. To me, this signals a willingness to improve and a certain level of \"anxiousness\" to \"get the right answer\" that's required in research. Furthermore, you were willing to challenge him, even knowing that he's a \"star\" in the eyes of those around him. \n\nFinally, you asked him his own question and he couldn't answer it. Did you ever think that maybe he thinks *you're* the star, and he's a little jealous and/or trying to make you feel bad about yourself? People like Tom tend to dislike having competition :)",

Now what defines a good scientist? I think the absolutely essential points are:\n\n1) curiosity\n\n2) logical/analytical perspective\n\n3) resilience/persistence\n\nThe not absolutely required but remarkably important:\n\n1) passion/patience\n\n2) adaptability/resourcefulness\n\n3) critical and lateral thinking\n\n4) intra and interpersonal skills and social dexterity\n\n5) open-mindedness \n\n6) aptitude for learning\n\nIf you have at least the essential points, you could be as good as the best scientist out there, provided luck and intellect are permissive. And frankly it's quite difficult to judge someone's potential to be a good scientist before at least 1 or 2 years in the PhD, so I wouldn't care much for what Tom says and I would instead focus on bettering myself all the time regardless of what others think.

If you've been out of a doctoral program for five years and have one low-level publication, someone could come to the conclusion that you are not good at research, regardless of your intellectually-curious, openness to failure, collaborative nature, and all the other things that it takes to be good at research. You either don't have the right methodological chops, time management ability, interpersonal skills, or something else.\n\nOne of my mentors in graduate school used to joke that \"nobody gives awards for reading.\" We actually had one intellectually-curious student wash out of the cohort behind me because although she loved reading new ideas, she could never complete a project. She'd read a book, get an idea, do 10% of a literature review, get sidetracked by another book, and start another literature review. She didn't make it past comps. One of the skills that it takes to be a good researcher is that you are driving towards the conclusion of a project. \n\nThere will be changes and speed bumps along the way. You may have to pivot during the review process, add another author, send it to a different conference than you were expecting, or your funding sources might dry up, but you're always trying to get whatever it is done. That is what results in publications, presentations, grant awards, and all those other performance metrics that we'd use to say someone has been a \"good researcher.\"",

But I think I need to add pure dedication to it. At least in the \\~life sciences\\~ a lot of your success and productivity comes down to just working hard and putting in the hours. All things being equal, the scientist who gets more experiments done and generates more data simply has more material to work with, write about, analyze, and expand upon. And that's what ultimately drives your career forward. It's really easy to be lazy and not get enough work done if you don't have a burning passion for your work.  \n\n\nI wish I had a solution to this culture of overworking (and eventually burning out) in academia... I don't want to accept that \"this is just the way it is\" because I think it leads to a lot of people with amazing potential for science to be driven away from academia.

      "text": "There are character traits that can make you a good researcher, and there are general work ethic type behaviors that will help you succeed anywhere. Tom seems like a jerk, but there are definitely also learnable skills/mindsets help you stand out as a researcher. \"Enjoying learning\" is not one of them. These are the things I aim to teach my students:\n\n* **Asking the right questions:** Good researchers intuit the best paths of inquiry. The first thing you learn in a PhD program is that *you know nothing.* You do not have gaps in your knowledge; you have tiny islands of knowledge in a vast ocean of the unknown world. It's a skill to chart a course from there. What research questions are interesting? Which will produce more questions, and which just ask old questions about different things? What questions can be answered with available methodology? My most frustrating research experiences have been when manning technology for colleagues with a very poor sense of what kind of questions that equipment could answer.\n\n* **Working at different scales**: Good researchers are comfortable with data *and* theory. We all know those theory nerds who can't get their mind out of the clouds, and those tech geeks who can't get it out of the dirt. The scholars I most admire are those that best understand how theory organizes data and how data constructs theory. The \"middle range theory\" of going from information to theories is surprisingly difficult.\n\n* **Reaching across disciplines** Good researchers don't silo themselves into one field. That can mean as much as high concept interdisciplinary projects, or as little as keeping up with the literature in another related field. The best ecologists are the ones familiar with the anthropological implications of their environmental studies; the best art historians know their social history too. \"I don't need to know how to write, this is math class\" is an attitude that should be killed in middle school.\n\n* **Presenting your research:** Good researchers share. For many people, this means publications. It's not the best system, but journal articles and book chapters are the best way to ensure that what you've found is preserved and accessible. This can also mean investing in teaching. In my field, it can mean supporting public archaeology programs or museums.",

If it is self-defined as you say, then why would one need to ask it? Clearly, there is some vagueness about it that someone at OP's caliber had to ask it here. Without it being defined properly, it is hard to give the proper feedback the OP requires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Enjoyment is a complex emotion, that can depend on a variety of variables (success being one of them).\n\nNo, enjoyment is not a complex emotion. It is quite simple. What you want to say is perhaps, one can enjoy doing research for a variety of reasons. In this context, however, it is moot. OP wants to do research because he enjoys it (general), not because he wants to be successful (specific).\n\nDo you learn a foreign language because you want to be competitive? Could be one of the reasons. Or would you learn it because you want to watch movies in foreign language? Could be another reason. As long as one finds fun/enjoyment in whatever it is, it doesn't matter what the motivation is. Academic research is same. So if OP is bothered if he should focus on the result (papers), and not the process/feeling, then, I would advise against this kind of unnecessary thinking.",
