  "text": "Edit. I was offered accomodation and lunch during work days. Who knows, judging by the company it's going to be stellar accommodation and food right.\n\n\nSo, more of a rant.\n (Sorry, this showing off is for context)  I'm finishing off my PhD. Before that I completed my Masters in the same field graduated with honours and cum laude from the No3. Ranked university in the world for the field. My master thesis resulted in a direct research grant, still referenced quite often 5 years later. I've won a few research prizes, faculty prizes, I do pretty much ok. There are maybe 200 people in Europe who have my background and expertise. (Again, sorry, this sounds really pretentious but I'm livid)\n\nToday I got an email from, one of, if not, the largest industrial player of the field of technology I work in. Their offer ? Because I'm a foreigner, I have to undergo an unpaid 6 months  internship.\n\nThis is basically equating to free professional labour. It's wrong for bachelor students, but to give this as an offer from somebody with a doctoral degree is really beyond me. The most frustrating part, these guys are really well known in the field - if it was a startup with no money it's one thing, but this is just pure greed.",
