  "title:": "Is academia (teaching/research at the university level) a good career path for someone who prefers to work thoroughly vs. quickly?",
  "text": "I really enjoyed doing independent research for my Master's. I've been in the professional world awhile also, and I know that I struggle a bit in fast-paced work environments where I have to move between lots of small projects. However, I'm intellectually curious and my work gets good feedback when it's a bigger project where I have enough time that I'm not cutting corners. I was diagnosed with ADHD as as an adult, so that might be part of why I do better in jobs where I have a fair amount of flexibility on scheduling and work hours.\n\nI'm curious if this sounds like it would be compatible with academia? Or do you think this would still cause problems?",

So it's largely a self-contained ecosystem. For example, someone with a PhD in I/O from a business school would receive strong preference for being hired at a business school over someone who received a PhD in I/O from outside a business school.",

Smaller grants.\n\nFriends of the school are coming for a visit; can you please give a talk about your research/teaching?\n\nTravel to conferences.  Presentation at conferences.  Reviews of journal papers.  Organizing conferences.  Reading so you don\u2019t get hopelessly behind in your field.\n\nPreparing your students to pass PhD qualifying exams.  Administering qualifying exams.  Going to thesis defenses (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctoral).

Developing a new course is a big project.  Tweaks to a course you\u2019ve taught before might be small projects.",

Because when it comes to expected speed and deadlines everything is relative. I'd say when I was in school as an undergrad or grad student, my professors seemed hard-working but not always the most organized or fast-paced workers relative to corporate norms. But that's largely an outsiders' impression, of course.",

It\u2019s inherently a slow process.  In industry I once served on a Quality Improvement Team (dating myself here) and it was the same.  Most industry decisions are made by individuals with the power to enforce them, which is an entirely different pace.\n\nProfessors don\u2019t have many serious deadlines.  Proposal submissions have to be on time.  And most places, grades.  Beyond those two, things can usually be late without grave consequences.",
