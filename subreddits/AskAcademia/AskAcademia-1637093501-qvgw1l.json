  "text": "I've been really intrigued by marine archeology for a really long time and I think it would be something I'd want to study further (currently have an unrelated bachelors). Does anybody have any thoughts or know more about this?\n\nI know that there are schools in the UK and USA who have the ability to do masters etc in this area but I wanted to hear other people's thoughts on the area, i.e. is it too niche etc.\n\nOpen to any discussion \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "My alma mater, East Carolina, is one of the programs in the US \u2014 the Program in Maritime Studies offers an MA in Maritime History and Nautical Archaeology that\u2019s a mix of history and archaeology coursework, alongside conservation lab work, field work, internships, etc. I did my MA there in medieval history, but most of my friends were maritimers. I think the other program that I\u2019ve heard a bit about is at Baylor, but I don\u2019t know anything else about it.\n\nA good friend of mine (now a professor in the UK) did his MA at ECU and then followed up with his PhD at Southampton, so if you\u2019re looking in the UK, that would be one place to look. I also know a couple of people in the field who studied or worked at Flinders in Australia, if that\u2019s of interest.",

      "text": "East Carolina University and Texas A&M are the two big underwater archeology programs in the US. Most people I know who work professionally in that field went to one of those schools. \n\nMy alma mater, Indiana University, has an excellent academic diving program through the Office of Underwater Science, but there's only a few graduate students. Most are technically in the anthropology graduate program.",
