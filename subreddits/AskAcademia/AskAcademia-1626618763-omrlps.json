      "text": "When I was still teaching, I learned there were lots of different reasons why students plagiarized papers - so I learned to talk to the student and figure out what was going on. (Not necessarily take what they say as face value...but at least try to figure it out.)\n\nMany of them were just lazy, or they waited until the last minute to write the paper so they just copied and pasted thinking I wouldn't figure it out. Whatever, 0.\n\nWith a few, I learned they were so scared of writing - or had gotten such bad marks on their writing in the past - that they simply did not know what else to do besides plagiarize. This isn't an excuse for it, and there's heavy overlap with these kids and the ones in the first group, but in a few cases the student genuinely wanted to learn how to write better (or were at least interested when I offered to help them learn how to write).\n\nSome simply did not see the point of learning how to write, because they didn't see the overlap between writing a paper analyzing a novel or exploring a research topic and writing emails at work or other kinds of business communication. While those students were also largely in the first group, it *did* make me modify my approach a little when I taught writing - I drew more parallels between the types of assignments I gave and 'real work' and also gave a wider variety of assignments. This improved interest at least with the serious kids.\n\nThen there were the rare one or two who genuinely didn't know they weren't supposed to do that. These are not the kids who turned in someone else's paper or copied large unattributed sections from Wikipedia - these were the kids who would copy like four lines and then cite it, thinking that put them in the clear, but they would do it all throughout the paper. Often it was because they'd gotten poor writing instruction in the past; I once had a social studies teacher in middle or high school who taught some really poor writing skills that would engender this type of behavior (I distinctly remember her telling us that a paper should be mostly quotes with citations behind them. Not just that you should cite your work - that the bulk of a paper, like 80%, should be literal quotes from other works).",

It's almost never only a paper. For oral examinations, the only way to pass is to study the textbooks you've been assigned in their entirety, because the professor might ask you about anything in those books. Usually it's questions from all chapters, and the examination might last from 30 mins to 1 hour. It's very rare for students who have studied for an oral examination to hand in plagiarised papers, because they really studied, for real. Now, I wanted to make things more comfortable for my students, given the pandemic, and only asked them to write a paper. But I won't accept plagiarism. So in September I will reinstate the oral examination. Paper+oral examination. I had no other choice",

We're talking about a conscious choice, not an oopsie doopsie mistake.\n\nI'm British and went to a British university so perhaps our system is more detached and rigid. A large portion of the time, professors/lecturers/their marking team do not know which student submitted which work. It's marked anonymously. Academic misconduct was taken very seriously. Paper submission was taken very seriously. If it was literal paper, you filled in a submission form and got a receipt back.

It doesn't feel like a single professor/lecturer/TA should have the discretion to over look a complete lack of integrity in a student. \n\nProfessors and lecturers also have 100s of students to deal with.

My words, my understanding,  my offering,  almost no effort involved.  \n\nHowever,  the effort to research,  understand,  provide context, properly format, cite, and present as part of a larger cohesive concept is all my work. If students aren't putting that work in and get credit for the assignment they negate everything I do. Professors have a duty to the students who put forth effort to protect our interests against plagiarism. \n\nI get a degree through hard work and someone else gets a degree by plagiarism and we are up for the same opportunity that requires the degree. That is a real world consequence. \n\nI worked for a woman to build her a cottage business of early childhood education.  I thought she was quite brilliant.  I promoted her vision with my effort. Then after a few months of developing the business side of things,, I began the process of reading her original academic works to be submitted for copyright under her brand.  This woman did not speak or write that way in her normal life. So i asked her to explain a word that I knew, but knew she did not know. She couldn't explain it. I asked her how she had come to submit this work as her own. She said the ideas were already there and she agreed with them so why should she rewrite them. 0.o\n\nFucking plagiarism.

So you'll read a couple paragraphs that make no sense and then you'll get one that looks like it was written by a scholar.\n\nOr sometimes the topic takes an odd turn to something only tangentially related (aka a student trying to shoehorn in something that sounds smart). Or it'll cite some obscure source, or primary source material, that I know the student doesn't have access to (or wouldn't find on their own because I know this particular student, lol!).

Some sentences come straight away from the textbook and I recognize them right away. But in general yes, I always use a software to detect plagiarism.
