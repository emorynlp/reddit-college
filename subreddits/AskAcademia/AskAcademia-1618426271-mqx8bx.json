  "title:": "PI Told me to master-out. What routes do I have? (Pharm-Tox)",
  "text": "So I have had a number of complications. I joined the lab in Jan 2020 and then COVID, and then a family member passed away. Ultimately a lot of rough stuff. Thankfully, the PI in question was very understanding around all that. But in spite of that, I haven\u2019t produced the research that demonstrates the \u201cpassion\u201d that\u2019s required in academia. He wants me to pivot and is saying that from his assessment of me, it seems I just want a technical, stable career but not a PhD-level career. He highlighted that we\u2019re not burning bridges, and that he\u2019s going to connect to his alums and try to network me some opportunities but I really just feel terrible. It\u2019s like getting laid off or being told \u201cyou don\u2019t have what it takes\u201d.\n\n\nWhat routes do I have? It may seem childish but I really would like to do a stint in industry, come back around and get a PhD, and have a killer academic career (perhaps out of spite), but that\u2019s just one avenue. What possible careers do you know is looking for entry-level MS Pharm-Tox? Most job searching sites seem to highlight PhD employment or many years of experience.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m a bit sad, and not too picky. I was originally hoping to be part of the pipeline for DMPK or regulatory tox, but now I\u2019m just looking for a job because mastering out would be done in about a month. I just want to be somewhere in science doing good work :(\n\nI\u2019d like to return to academia eventually, but my PI highlighted some real poignant truths. I\u2019m interested in PhD level work, but just am not *as* passionate as my peers, and I don\u2019t have some of the hands-on research go-getter attitudes. I\u2019d like to find a way to get experience and circle back.",

There are a lot of jobs in chemistry-related fields (don\u2019t know about pharm-tox) specifically, where a PhD can actually make it harder to get a job, and it may not be the kind of job you want unless you like meetings. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s saying \u201cbased on the kind of work you seem to be interested an MS will be a better choice\u201d more than \u201cyou aren\u2019t good enough for a PhD\u201d.",

A lot of the tenure-track or other long-term academic positions, teaching or research, that used to exist have disappeared or are dependent on the PhD holder getting external funding, ie a federal grant, which has also become harder to do. Pharmaceutical companies closed a bunch of labs since 2000, accelerated during the 2008 recession, and now seem to have their business model to be waiting for a small startup to develop something, buy that company, and then fire all the researchers who then try to find jobs at other startups. You can find jobs for PhD chemists in the right places (very large cities on the coasts mostly) but there\u2019s not much job security in EDIT: *most* of them. The ads in my area are entirely term contracts for about a year.",

Also, if you need a bridge position until you can get a job, your PI might be willing to hire you as a research assistant for several months. Obviously, I have no idea of the financials of the lab.",

Grad school is so intense and stressful that we can end up with blinders on. If we\u2019re not careful, we can start to make our research or career path part of our identity. It makes any setbacks *really* personal. I love research and I am passionate about what I do, but that\u2019s been me before and I\u2019m glad to have stepped away from it. \n\nIn reality, grad school is a job, and if the situation isn\u2019t right for you, you should find one that\u2019s better. This year was extremely tough for reasons outside your control. The stress was immense. I can\u2019t tell if your PI is being fair to you or not, but either way, I\u2019d move on. This doesn\u2019t seem like the right fit for you. And given *gestures around*, I wouldn\u2019t prolong any frustration or struggle on your end. \n\nI understand that \u201cmastering out\u201d has that feeling of failure attached to it right now, but please give that time. You will soon be a person who graduated with a master\u2019s, and you will have earned it during a very challenging, trying time in our society. You did well. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, in addition to wherever else you\u2019re job hunting, I would sign up for job alerts on USAJobs. Also check state agencies and contracting companies that the feds and states use.",

I\u2019m\nnot sure I could say a reliable, sober, and above average intelligence grad student should master out under these circumstances. I\u2019d probably give you another year to see if you even out.\n\nBasically, assess if leaving is truly what you want. If it isn\u2019t, be willing to fight to stay in\u2014you can even get a new PI and start over. Life happens, shit happens. Only master out if it\u2019s what you truly want.\n\nPS I\u2019ve seen A LOT of half assed and ridiculous people get PhDs. Some stay in academia, some go to industry. Some never touch a bench again. You don\u2019t need to master out just because you don\u2019t have the tenured professor passion. That\u2019s bullshit.",

          "text": "I kind of disagree. I obviously don\u2019t know OP, but I\u2019ve seen too many students who should have been told to master out get strung along for 7+ years because they didn\u2019t have the drive or, frankly, the understanding to do the work required of a PhD. But instead of their PIs having the difficult conversation with them, these students ended up low-key embarrassing themselves at seminars and conferences because they clearly just didn\u2019t get it. I think it\u2019s a sign of a good PI to recognize when students may not make it early on and have them reroute their life for a bit. It\u2019s better than potentially wasting time effectively going no where and getting burnt out. \n\nOP, that being said I\u2019m really sorry this happened and I\u2019m sure it was a shock to hear. This does not mean you are not cut out for a PhD. It may mean you should get some experience, work for a bit, stay on top of recent literature in your field, and come back into a PhD program more focused with specific project goals. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have any concrete job advice to give you. But I can tell you that in my PhD program, the students who returned to grad school after working for a while were much more focused, organized, and driven than the younger students. Working and earning/saving money for a few years can be a really good move! Pardon the cliche but life is a very winding road - it\u2019s okay to not follow the prescribed path you may have envisioned!",

              "text": "I may be biased as a student, but when I've seen someone not reach their potential it's 99% of the time been the PI's fault. In my field at least, people do not go through the arduous process of applying to PhD programs without significant research experience. And folks do not get admitted without being pretty qualified (e.g., 2+ years of research experience with known professors). Although there's a bad egg here and there, I'd say that most of my colleagues are consistently failed by their PI's in a dozen different ways. I know a lot of people who were wishy-washy on academia vs. industry and the main difference in outcome and career quality has been how invested and helpful their PI has been. A good PI is the main difference between a truly mediocre student and an incredible student. Most PhD students are doing it because they really care, and are motivated to succeed. But they are often not met with the level of mentorship, honesty, and assistance that is required to make them successful. Of course, some people are never going to be successful, and some will be successful no matter what. But a good PI should be able to communicate to their students what the right level of \"motivation\" is, have conversations about how to structure the workday/prioritize tasks/etc., and should inspire passion and excitement in their students. A good PI should be able to \"make\" a good student, as long as that student wants to and is committed to learning!",

But I\u2019ve known one case personally where the student was essentially kicked out within the same week and had to just write up what he had without any further lab work because the advisor wouldn\u2019t work with him anymore.",

I've seen full-time programs that have no viable or affordable options for childcare, so women left after having kids when they couldn't meet the demands of the program. On the flip side, I've seen advisors refusing to sign off on paperwork for students to progress through programs because they are integral to keeping their lab running. \n\nI've also worked with some of the most amazing people I know, so don't get me wrong, but ultimately this is a really weird system in which advisors have a lot of power. There are lots of opportunities for things to go sideways. I really would advocate for a more generous interpretation that doesn't rely on an assumption of personal failure.",

I know this won't help alleviate your feelings but be mindful that they probably don't know what is best for you. Their assumptions about what it takes to be successful and the value or assumptions a degree gives is based on their own personal bias.\n  \nForget whether or not someone has told you if you are suitable for a PhD because they only know themselves and so how can they assume the rules that dictate their behaviour also has to dictate yours?\n  \nSo what do you want? A PhD can open a lot of doors that don't have to be classic \"PhD careers\" like academia. It could set you up as a lab manager, or project manager, or research associate. You can work in industry, in government, you can start a company. You can do both stable and unstable work. Just because you have a PhD doesn't mean you can't do work that academic elites would sneer at, and wanting a PhD while also finding a \"non-PhD job\" is fine too. It is your life.\n  \nI would suggest not to do the PhD with this person though; they seem to have a narrow view of what they expect from you. If you still like this person and the work, the Master's might be a good idea. At least this way you have time to think about the next step while earning a higher degree. It would also really set you up for doing a PhD because you will have ~2 years under your belt already with a lot of developed skills you might not have now.",
