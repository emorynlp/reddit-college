  "title:": "[UK] Should I work for a year then do masters? Can I work as a software engineer part-time during masters?",
  "text": "Hello\n\nI am currently a CS student going into my final year of UG degree this September. I really want to do a masters degree to both boost my career and because I enjoy learning and have a passion for CS, I am on track to get a 1st class degree and I am hoping I can do my masters degree at a top uni like Cambridge Imperial etc, but as someone who comes from a non-wealthy working-class background I am not sure I will be able to pay the fees for these top institutions. \n\nI would be happy to work during my masters degree as I will not be pressuring myself to achieve top-grades as I don't want to do a PhD. The masters degree that appeals most to me is Computing at imperial but the fee is quite high and the CoL is ridiculous. \n\nAs a postgraduate student will it be possible to work as a software engineer part-time or will I need to get a typically more student-like and flexible job such as a waiter? Should I just go straight into work and hope the company will pay for my tuition after just a year of employment? If I go to a more costly-university then I may end up having to take out a private-student loan, is this so bad? I think a masters would still enhance my starting salary by more than I would need to borrow.\n\nThanks",

      "text": "I did a FT masters and worked PT. It's possible although intense (I had a ball doing it, but probably couldn't have kept it up for much more than a year). I think a part time job like a software engineer might work better than lower paid shift work because you may be able to be much more flexible with your hours - depends on the company and you do have to be careful that you don't end up working a full time job while being paid for part time - a common problem. \n\nOne thing you should check out though before you apply to Oxbridge is whether you'll be allowed to work while studying. It's one of the ways they keep the hoi poloi out, by barring you from working during term time (they would say the reason is different, of course).",

      "text": "Personally haven\u2019t heard of anyone working during their master\u2019s at Cambridge, except occasionally research assistant work (even then that\u2019s mostly PhD students). Working while studying is generally strongly discouraged. Not sure about Imperial. \n\nThe financial question seems partly a personal assessment, but I\u2019m sure someone else can answer more specifically about computer science. Obviously as it\u2019s in a field that generally pays well, it might be worth to pay for the masters if that makes a significance difference for your career prospects.",
