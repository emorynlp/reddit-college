Hence, there's nothing random, so probability doesn't even really make sense. An individual CI will either contain the parameter or not, so the actual probability is 0 or 1.\n\nThe 95% probability is sort of moving the randomness up one level. It's like a coin flip with 95% chance to come up heads. If you flip it once, you don't know whether it \"worked\" or not, but if you do it a lot (repeat the experiment many times), then in the long run 95% of the time it will have worked.",

You choose some parameters on the left and then hit \u201cstart sampling\u201d. It grabs a sample from the chosen distribution and calculates the sample mean and a confidence interval. Then it samples again. You can see that a confidence interval contains the actual population mean when the CI overlaps with the vertical line (the CI will also be green).",

The real argument, at least to me, is: when does the embryo/fetus become a person\u2014at conception, at birth, or at some point in between (at the point in development of viability outside the womb, at the point in development that pain is felt, at the point in development that conscious forms, etc)?

It's difficult to imagine such a thing.\n\nAnother example is when we try to discover new particles. We detect these by how they decay back into other particles. For some, this is very clearly visible on a graph, and we can say: \"ha! here's particle X with some mass M\", but for others, this is not as clear, and the most we can say is \"ha! here is a particle X, with a mass somewhere between A and B\". And this is not because we can't measure it better, it's just because its mass is not really \"well-defined\". \n\nI could go on, but officially to this day, there's no clear definition as to what constitutes being a \"particle\".",

In contrast, the polar opposite is momentum; trivially easy to understand, to the degree that every single toddler develops an understanding of how momentum works in the process of learning how to walk, but modeling it is a colossal pain in the ass unless you're the kind of person who gets *really* turned on by material derivatives.",

      "text": "I'm not an Academic historian or archeologist (though I would love to pursue it one day, just not sure it's worth it at this point), but as somebody with a pretty deep hobbyist interest in Mesoamerica...\n\n...**If you ask 5 researchers to define \"Aztec\", you'll get 6 answers.**\n\nThis is especially a problem since there's already way, way, waaaaaay too many issues with the general public being misinformed about Mesoamerican history, it doesn't help that every article and book they read (if they read any, already a stretch) will say it means something different.\n\nIf you want a long explanation of the issue, keep reading.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nTaken literally, as to what the word Aztec means in Nahuatl, it means \"Person from Aztlan\". Aztlan is the semi-mythical homeland of a group (or really, the \"Aztec\" label as used originally in 16th century indigenous sources only applied it to *some* Nahua groups) of Mesoamerican people known as the Nahua, who migrated into the Valley of Mexico (which is covered by most of the Greater Mexico City Metropolitan Area today) and other areas of the Central Mexican plateau from up north, supposedly from legendary location known as Aztlan (they likely migrated from an area in Northern Mexico known as the Bajio region, by Jalisco and Nayarit, not as far north as the American Southwest as /u/capitantercio and /u/ItsReallyM3 talk about, that's just historically where the language family Nahuatl comes from is centered in, [the spread of it from the SW into northern mexico took place much earlier](https://miro.medium.com/max/604/0*lR9GhFITX1ugTKer) )\n\nOne of these Nahua groups, the Mexica who were among the latest groups of Nahua migrants to the Valley of Mexico, settle on an island in Lake Texcoco, and found Tenochtitlan. Shortly therafter, a group of Mexica split off to found a separate Altepetl (\"Water hill\" in Nahuatl, usually translated as City-state), Tlatleloco, on a separate island(the terms \"Tenochca\" and \"Tlatelolca\" are used to distinguish the two Mexica groups). At the time, the Alteptl of Azapotzalco (which, along with many other cities on the eastern shore of the lake basin, was inhabited by another Nahua group, the Tepaneca) was the dominant power in the Valley, and Tenochtitlan fell under it's control. The Mexica of Tenochtitlan would aid Azapotzalco and help them subjugate most of the valley. Eventually, however, the Tlatoani (\"Speaker\" in Nahuatl, usually translated as King) of Azapotzalco, Tezozomoc, died. There was a resulting successon crisis as one of his two heirs assassinated the other, took power, and also assassinates the Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, Chimalpopoca, who also represented a potential hereditary threat, as he was the child of the previous Tlatoani, Huitzilihuitl and a daughter of Tezozomoc, who he had given to Huitzilihuitl as a reward for Tenochtitlan's military aid.\n\nThis sours the relationship between Azapotzalco and Tenochtitlan. Eventually, war breaks out, and Tenochtitlan, along with the Acolhua (another Nahua subgroup) Altpetl of Texcoco, and the Tepaneca Altepetl of Tlacopan, join forces and defeat Azapotzalco, and subsequently agree to retain their alliance for future military conquests, with Texcoco and especially Tenochtitlan in the more dominant roles. This triple alliance, and the other cities and towns they controlled (which included both other Nahua Alteptl, as well as cities and towns belonging to other Mesoamerican cultures/civilizations, such as the Maya, Mixtec, Zapotec, Otomi, Totonac, Huastec, etc) is what people are talking about when they say the \"Aztec Empire\". However, when most people are talking about the \"Aztecs\" as a society or a culture, they are typically talking about the Mexica of Tenochtitlan (Tenochtitlan eventually conquered and absorbed Tlatelolco, unifying the Mexica again, though Tlatelolco still had some unique administrative quirks separate from Tenochtitlan proper) in particular, or are using Tenochtitlan as an example of the Nahua in general.\n\nIn summary, \"Aztec\", as people use it, can mean any of the following depending on the context:\n\n- The Nahua civilization/culture as a whole\n- The specific Nahua subgroups labeled as \"Aztec\" in Indigenous sources/who claim to come from Aztlan\n- The Mexica Nahua subgroup\n- Specifically the Mexica from Tenochtitlan, the Tenochca\n- The Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan\n- That alliance, as well as any subservient cities and towns, IE, The \"Aztec Empire\" (though once again not all of it's subjects were Nahuan, many were Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Huastec, Totonac, etc; and not all Nahuan states were in that empire, such as the Kingdom of Tlaxcala)\n\n\nFor more information, I recommend [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gk6fp/did_the_mayans_look_down_on_native_americas_who/calfjrh/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/31fj3a/whats_the_real_reason_tenochtitl%C3%A1n_mexico_city/cq13d0x/?st=jlrlyw7i&sh=8a3c5a2a), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2mp6jh/repost_in_the_old_days_it_seems_like_dissident/?st=jlrm0wls&sh=d6bac157) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1996ka/tuesday_trivia_great_and_not_so_great_comebacks/c8mfrsp/) post by 400-rabbits, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3atv2y/has_there_ever_been_archaeological_written/?st=jlrlw67v&sh=492dd5d3) post by Mictlantecuhtli. Additionally,  there is a very detailed and well sourced post on /r/Mesoamerica [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mesoamerica/comments/63n1az/the_triple_alliance_never_existed_meet_the/dfz0mr0/) detailing recent research that calls into question some of the information,\n\n(Also, if you *really* wanna stretch it, \"Aztec\" could also perhaps encompass the Toltec, an earlier civilization described in various Nahua annals (from both Mexica and non Mexica sources) as being their cultural predecessors, and the creators of high culture and civilization, who ruled from around 900 to 1100AD. In these accounts, they are described as if they were Nahuan (ergo, they being arguably \"Aztec\"), but these accounts are clearly pseudo-legendary (as noted below civilization goes back *much* further then 900AD in the area, and the accounts include gods and magic) and the Toltec probably didn't exist as described even putting aside the clearly mythical elements, and many researchers reject the idea they existed at all, more or less; and the Nahuans that describe them clearly also viewed them as their own thing even if as if they belonged to a broader Nahua background)\n\nAlso it should be noted here that stuff like large scale architecture, urban cities, formal governments, etc (so \"civilization\") is a lot more widespread in this region and goes beyond just the \"Aztec\" label here/the Nahuas, let alone the Mexica. The first sites which had monumental architecture,  rulers, class systems, writing, etc in Mesoamerica (the broader cradle of civilization/culture region in question here, covering roughly the bottom half of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize according to one potential definition) around 2500 years before the Nahuas migrated into it. \n\nA common misconception I see people make is that the \"Aztec\" were a lone complex civilization or empire surrounded by a bunch of tribes, when in reality the other cultures/civilizations in Mesoamerica like the Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Huastec, Totonac, etc that they conquered and that surrounded (since many states weren't conquered by them: The Nahuan kingdom of Tlaxcala, and the Zapotec kingdom of Tututpec for example resisted invasions, while the Purepecha Empire to the west legitmately rivaled the Aztec Empire, to name a few) were mostly urbanized city-states and kingdoms as well, or at least mid sized towns. Reading the third summarized timeline comment below would help give context here. \n\nAnyways, if anybody is interested in learning more about Mesoamerican history, I have a set of 3 comments here where I explain....\n\n1. In the first comment, I notes how Mesoamerican and Andean socities [way more complex then people realize, in some ways matching or exceeding the accomplishments of civilizations from the Iron age and Classical Anitquity, be it in city sizes, goverment and political complexity, the arts and intellecualism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/c7gu1l/i_want_people_to_dump_interesting_information/esh1756/), etc\n\n2. The second comment explains how there's also more records and sources of information than many people are aware of for Mesoamerican cultures, [with certain civilizations having hundreds of documents and records on them; as well as the comment containing a variety of resources and suggested lists for further reading, information, and visual references](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/c7gu1l/i_want_people_to_dump_interesting_information/esh3m71/); and\n\n3.  The third comment contains a [summary of Mesoamerican history from 1400BC, with the region's first complex site; to 1519 and the arrival of the spanish, as to stress to people just how many different civilizations and states existed and how much history actually occurred in that region, beyond just the Aztec and Maya](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/c7gu1l/i_want_people_to_dump_interesting_information/esh3s50/)\n\nI also have more resources and such I can share upon request via PM",

A big part of my meetings with the PIs was trying to define what is splashing. Is it when any tiny amount of liquid is ejected  from the bulk? Or is it when the liquid forms a crown around the bulk while spraying lots of smaller droplets everywhere? That was two years ago and I still don't know the answer to that ( we defined two thresholds). It's a mess in the literature, as even more phenomenons are described by the term Splash. I guess its just used as an all encompassing term for similar phenomenons that aren't quite defined yet",

The most generic definition is that \u201cIt\u2019s the study of any written text\u201d, but honestly, there seems to be a \u201ccannon\u201d niche that is focused on, and less focus on marginal Topics.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019de love it more if there is more organized and organic structure to the whole literary studies and criticism field, to make it seem more...natural, and not as so much over the place as it seems right now...at least, in my view. If anyone knows about some structure of Literature studies, please tell me.",
