  "title:": "Every time I publish with Elsevier a small part of me dies",
  "text": "I now have three papers in various Elsevier journals. Through publication of each of these I have grown to dispise Elsevier more and more. \n\nI hate they way that they are providing less and less at each stage of the publication process. For example I wrote the paper, my colleagues peer-reviewed it, and then now I even have to do the type setting myself. It makes me question what exactly Elsevier are providing besides a shell to conduct peer review and a hosting platform afterwards?\n\nAlthough there are many issues generally with the publication process, it is the authors doing type setting that actually bugs me the most. For those of you that have not used the Elsevier type setting online tool, this is an interactive document editor where you generate your own proofs. All content is editable and therefore undermining the peer review process. For example, at this stage for key points could be changed or countless self citations added. After this you hit submit and it's done. Now they will claim that this process has some editorial oversight but in my experience it does not. It's a joke. \n\nAlso I hate the way they refer to us as customers. Working with a publisher should be a collaborative process. I am planning to avoid Elsevier journals in the future when I have a say in where a paper goes.",

That would incentivize you to do as many reviews as possible, which means you\u2019re just trying to crank them out which could jeopardize scientific integrity.  \n\nUniversities would also not be happy because, while professors should be working on this outside of their university time as \u201cservice,\u201d they\u2019d work on them during normal hours and essentially have two jobs at once. It could also present a unique conflict of interest for professors as well as government employees or industry employees who are reviewers. \n\nWhat if (and this is just a spitball) they were \u201cpaid\u201d with credits towards publishing in that journal? It would incentivize reviewing for that journal as well as publishing in it. \n\nEdit: By credits I mean credits towards publishing fees. Some others (below) have suggested expedited publishing wish is an interesting thought, but I\u2019d have to see what that looks like first.",

For instance, sitting on department or college committee is part of service. Hence, the university is ostensibly paying you to do peer review.\n\nI agree though that there could be some issues with the mechanics of paying reviewers, particularly for government employees.\n\n> What if (and this is just a spitball) they were \u201cpaid\u201d with credits towards publishing in that journal? It would incentivize reviewing for that journal as long as publishing in it.\n\nYour last line is an interesting idea. Credits toward publication or open access fees? I like the concept. Maybe have the AE give a rating of some sort to the review so that low-effort reviews earn less credit, or particularly high-effort reviews earn a bit more credit.",

You do 8 reviews for Elsevier in a year, and so do the 1,000 other faculty and researchers at your large institution. As a whole, the faculty review labor saved the university $200,000, or a quarter of their Elsevier journal fees.

(The list breaks things down because it's meant to be comprehensive and overkill, especially for newbies entering the industry). Again, I have no dog in the fight with Elsevier, and I'm still amazed that the U California System just walked away, and I applaud that sort of behavior by libraries.\n\nMost journals publishers do not use TurnItIn, but they do use other *commercial* products that provide a similar service. Peer reviewers aren't paid (and *that* isn't solely an issue with publishing, but rather the devolving state of academia all together), but they are wrangled and managed and have to feel confident that their time is being respected and that the journal they're reviewing for is reputable. \n\nEditors, of course, do the scholarly heavy lifting, but publishers provide infrastructure to help them do that job more efficiently. This is especially important being an editor is position of service. In a competitive environment, publishers do all they can to lure journals in with services for the editorial team. This includes submission management systems and copyeditors. Editors never have to worry about making their journal discoverable or durable. Copyright, DOI, metadata, archiving, deals with databases and librarires, specifics of financial arrangements with sponsoring academic societies--these are time consuming activities. \n\nThe scholarly journal ecosystem is much larger than individual students and their advisors. When journals choose a publisher, part of the service they're looking for revolves around \"does this publisher's strategy align with this journal's goals? What's this publisher's relationship with libraries? Does the publisher offer libraries attractive and cost effective packages of journals? Are they working primarily with R1s and can we get this publication into SLACs too? Does this publisher make content available for free in developing countries? Marketing is important because librarians can only track usage of journals they already subscribe to. Study after study shows that students and researchers alike will simply (1) abandon pursuit of a journal or article their library doesn't provide access to or (2) pirate it. Having a publisher market your journal is especially important in new and emerging fields or during a launch of a new journal. With limited funds (and universities choosing to squeeze library budgets), librarians have to make difficult choices about what their institutions' researchers and students have access to, and publishers can help them make those decisions. I can't stress enough how important librarians are in the journals business. I recommend looking at the work done by [Ithaka S+R](https://sr.ithaka.org/) for more insight on the complex relationships among researchers' thoughts and behaviors (often they don't align!), librarian choices, and publisher business models.\n\nAnd then, finally, there's the end-user. Developing technologies for interactive publications, transitioning from one platform to another while avoiding degradation, hosting, etc. are all expensive and require trained expertise.\n\nThere's certainly other models for journal publication. Some universities already host their own journals. If that's something you haven't seen before, it's might be worth exploring why and getting an editor's perspective. I suggest much of it has to do with some of the things I mentioned above. In whatever case, running a journal is both time and money-consuming, and that time and money *has* to come from somewhere.\n\nIf you're in the sciences, I think you'll start to see a real change in how scholarly publishing works once Plan S is implemented, and you may be happy with some of the outcomes. The goal is simple (making content OA), but it'll force some major changes within the STEM publishing process.",

This includes submission management systems and copyeditors.\n\nSubmission management systems, in my experience, and really pretty limited. Yes, they are important for journals with large numbers of submission, but they aren't complex, don't offer a ton of features, and could easily just be licensed (in fact I'm sure they are since so many are nearly identical). I agree about copyeditors; that is something of value that they offer. But the main point of this post is actually Elsevier cheaping out on that aspect and making it an automated system. If that trend continues, then it's one of the few valuable things done by publishers gone. \n\n> Copyright, DOI, metadata, archiving, deals with databases and librarires, specifics of financial arrangements with sponsoring academic societies--these are time consuming activities.\n\nThere is an administrative aspect that is valuable. Some of this is the financial aspect, which honestly need to go away. We are paying money so that money can be dealt with. That's not of value to anyone but the publisher. The other aspects, DOI, Copyright, archiving, are all there and need some administration to deal with it. But they also just aren't that complicated. It could be done with minimal, but not zero admittedly, admin. arXiv does hosting and archiving wonderfully. DOI and copyright is paperwork, but again, it's just not that complicated. \n\nYour 4th paragraph, as I said was something I had not thought through, and given how things must now work, I can see it is important. But it's all to solve an issue that should not be. They should be open access. All those problems vanish for open access articles managed by public funds. Open access would reduce the total spending on publishing because it would get rid of so much crap. \n\n>And then, finally, there's the end-user. Developing technologies for interactive publications, transitioning from one platform to another while avoiding degradation, hosting, etc. are all expensive and require trained expertise.\n\nI don't want publishers involved with \"Developing technologies for interactive publications\". When a pdf is not enough, then let the researchers make their own methods. They are good at it. \n\n>transitioning from one platform to another while avoiding degradation, hosting\n\nMinimal hosting is not hard. Transition platforms can be a pain, but with what I really want out of hosting, which is really very little (literally just an organized format of hosted pdfs), I don't think this is something that will happen that often. \n\n>There's certainly other models for journal publication. Some universities already host their own journals.\n\nIndeed they do. Most don't though, I would assume because they aren't funded.  \n\n>In whatever case, running a journal is both time and money-consuming, and that time and money has to come from somewhere.\n\nIt certainly does take some time and some money. But half of the things you mentioned only exist because the publishers have to make money. And most of the rest is not that hard. \n\nI don't blame all publishers (though I do blame some) because they do in fact have to make money. That's not their fault. But it's not a system that should make a lot of money. The very nature of academic research means it shouldn't directly make a lot of money. It benefits all of society which will in turn make more money, but that does not go directly to the academic process. \n\n>If you're in the sciences, I think you'll start to see a real change in how scholarly publishing works once Plan S is implemented, and you may be happy with some of the outcomes. The goal is simple (making content OA), but it'll force some major changes within the STEM publishing process.\n\nI hope this happens, but I am worried that the US will be worse off since we have no such movement. I try to publish with better publishers, more open access, etc. But there's only so much I can do.",

And since there aren't a ton of incentives to be a good reviewer a lot of academics will put minimal effort in their reviews-that's one of the reason why there are so many reviewers who don't even read the paper or pass it off to a barely qualified student for example. Then people wonder why there is a reproducibility crisis. Meanwhile, journals are rolling in money. I remember reading that Elsiver's profit margin last year was something close to 40%",
