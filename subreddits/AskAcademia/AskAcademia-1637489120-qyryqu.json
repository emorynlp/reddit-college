  "title:": "Dealing/not having to deal with my PhD student\u2019s parents",
  "text": "Edit: I learned a lot about how to interact with my phd student\u2019s parents. I thank everyone for their guidance, I am deeply grateful. I deleted the original post as there is a slim chance people involved might see and feel hurt. It served it purpose in educating a new mentor and can die in peace :)\n\nEdit 2: Some commenters suggested I should keep the original post for context, so everyone can benefit. Here is what happened, minus the details that can identify parties involved:\n\nI brought up the question whether it is ok for a PI to meet their PhD students\u2019 parents after an unpleasant interaction with my first student\u2019s parents. I also asked advice on how to avoid such situations in the future. I failed to diffuse the situation, which won\u2019t happen again now that I know better. When I posted here, I was projecting my frustration onto the student too, as he didn\u2019t do anything about it either, but thinking calmly I feel he was not at fault. People telling me I should fire him might have contributed to that. I felt that was unfair, I knew I messed up too by agreeing to meet the parents, so I ran here to ask for advice :)",

      "text": "> What bugs me the most is the student never interfered and saved us all by saying we should leave and talk about the project at some point. On hindsight, I didn\u2019t either but I am so inexperienced I guess I put my efforts towards keeping it together.\n\nI think you should keep in mind that your student is also inexperienced. He is your first student but you are also his first Ph.D. advisor. Try to cut him some slack. It sucks his parents are clueless and awkward but you learned a lesson from this. I would continue as planned and just decline any more social visits with the parents. Also, I would question seeking any future advice from people who suggested you fire the student. That is an absurd reaction and I can't believe another professor suggested it.",

I can feel a bit taken aback by his lack of reaction but at the same time, I could have resolved the situation before it happened had I had more experience, so I agree he shouldn\u2019t pay for it. I think they suggest it so freely because we didn\u2019t start working yet and he did not move yet etc. but still\u2026 I want to be fair, but I want to be fair to everyone involved including me. I will learn from this and your comments and hope to handle things better in the future.",

I am not sure why I feel a bit worried about the student\u2019s take on this, but at the moment I believe I am still a bit hurt by this interaction, and maybe I am projecting a bit. I know I would not sit quietly while my mom droned on like that, so probably I perceived his lack of action just as meaningful.

Nothing good would come from rubbing it in, if he himself hasn't done anything wrong.\n\n(But still refuse to have any communications with his parents from now on.)",

      "text": "Wondering if maybe there are some different cultural expectations at play here? Students from some places have their parents much more engaged in their life for much longer which is often viewed as coddling or babying by some other cultures. For example, at admitted students day for my masters program, parents accompanying their adult child were only from certain cultures. This was the norm for them but  as a professor I'd be very cautious of someone at that age that needed that help. That being said, one of my best friends had her parents come along and she's an absolute powerhouse working with the WHO, World Bank, etc. Just make very clear boundaries and don't try to judge the student for not interfering/intersecting when their parents kept trying to run the show. Just don't meet them again (I mean, there is no reason to) and you'll be fine.",

I am from the same country, but my parents never interfered with my education and professional life even though they are not formally educated (I am first gen) and they are well informed about my life and keep in touch. So it is not the norm, but I think they may be overprotective.",

There's not as many options for changing jobs/teams. Don't be too hard on yourself. Lesson learned and it sounds like you have a good heart (which I think can be hard to find in academia sometimes)",

Ph.D. student - advisor relationships are important and lifelong, and as the first student he may as well determine a lot of your career trajectory. I would suggest choosing your first students wisely. \n\nLastly, you should not have attended such a meeting. Upon observing many new and young PIs, please set boundaries and be fully strict about it. \"Sorry I cannot attend\" would be a good answer. Academic advisors should be inaccessible to the parents. It should be hard for them to track you down. Hope I could help.",

But my supervision approach is more like a mentor so it requires knowing the student as a person without involving in personal life. Plus, I come from a culture (Colombia) where coffee is a (personal or professional) relationship builder.  \nThinks may go wrong sometimes, and we need to learn from those mistakes :)",

Though you seem to share the same home country, it also seems that there is a cultural difference in professionalism. Being direct and stern about this boundary with this student is important in shaping their career as they build one in the country you are based in, though it is fully the student\u2019s responsibility to make sure they are professional in their communications and actions. \n\nYou hold all the power as the asst. professor, utilize that as they should most certainly not be treating you like a grad student obligated to helping their private life.",
