Trying to be competitive in academia when simple shit doesn't get done is really hard, and it can tank your career. When I started here, it took **5 months** for the finance team to send through a simple order I made for a piece of equipment.  But it got done in under 2 minutes when I eventually asked my PI to step in. I know OP might not be in quite the same situation, but I think in academia you have to be willing to complain a lot if it's to get your work done faster, because it isn't the sort of place to be forgiving. The competition against institutes with tons of cash and who have huge teams of people to get stuff done is very real, and your career depends on keep up with them.",

If you are in the UK, you probably also have the supply chain disruptions.\n3. Lockdown means that the IT department is only now able to go through the thousands computer campus wide, used for teaching, and do any in-person work needed. This means that even if the PC was delivered, they have a backlog.\n4. IT departments are typically understaffed and overworked\n\nYou may keep sending them reminders or elevate it, but IMO that is not worth it. It won\u2019t speed things and will only get people crossed. You stating that they are \u201cdragging their heels\u201d, to be frankly honest, makes you sound like immature and entitled for wanting your toy(s). Especially considering the larger context.\n\nSimply ask them for a loaner, if available, and ask them if they have an ETA. My honest advice is to always have a good relationship with the IT department as you never know when you will need a favour from them.",
