  "title:": "Is is possible to move from government research into universities?",
  "text": "I've recently started as a statistician at a government research centre in the UK and have the opportunity to complete a PhD in statistics as part of my job. This appeals to me because I could complete a PhD while pulling in a full-time salary, and not have to worry about finding a research position afterwards. However, I'm worried about if this would restrict me if I wanted to move over to a university position in a few years time. Specifically my main concerns are:\n\n* Lack of opportunities to gain teaching experience\n* There are few statisticians within the department, which would make it harder to gain contacts for collaborations, and limit my available support\n* My research would be constrained within the remit of the research centre, which might prevent me from doing more \"low-down\" statistics that I find interesting - my project would primarily focus on applications of existing methods to novel problems rather than developing new techniques. I'm not sure if universities would frown on this.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Would getting a PhD from a university be a better long-term strategy or would I be able to overcome these shortcomings on my own? I have a good MMath degree and am confident I could get into a good university PhD program if I were to apply.",

      "text": "A PhD is a PhD. You will gain a massive amount of knowledge with numerous valuable skills that can be applied in a variety of fields. Being that you can be paid and not have to worry about the costs of funding the PhD, you're in a great situation. As for your concerns:\n\n\\- You can absolutely gain teaching experience during/after your PhD. While not ideal for getting a job right when you're done, its something you can absolutely work with. Its not difficult to teach/learn to teach. I have my own PhD and have maybe taught 2-3 semesters of a single class.......you work with the opportunities you have and make the best of it. Turning down an opportunity for a PhD because of teaching opportunities isnt a large enough reason. \n\n\\- Fewer statisticians means high opportunities? Have you talked with those statisticians to get their input about the work situation? \n\n\\- Research following a PhD will never be constrained. I know numerous PhDs who's dissertation was on one subject, and they are working in a completely different topic of interest. PhD is all about learning skills and methods of research in a given field, not necessarily the field itself (for the majority of PhDs). You can craft your career however you want it when you get that degree.",

          "text": "This is all spot on, but I especially wanted to pile onto point #3. It's a really common misconception that you're going to be expected to follow whatever thread your dissertation was building after you've graduated, and for sure, some people do that. But the idea is 100% that the PhD is about training you to be an independent researcher. I did a PhD in Computer Science focused on search and optimization. If I wanted to be a biologist now, all I need to do is start publishing biology papers. I don't actually know much about biology, but that's my problem, not anyone else's. I could start up a collaboration with some biologists, apply my skills to their domain, coauthor some papers, and if I did that long enough, I'd learn a whole lot and at some point I'd be a researcher with a track record of publishing in biology journals, and that's the effective definition of biology researcher.\n\nMy PhD advisor in my CS program had a PhD in Anthropology. At some point he realized that the kind of quantitative models he wanted to build weren't really valued in anthropology, but the techniques were an important part of computer science. So he became a computer scientist.",

Have you talked with those statisticians to get their input about the work situation?\n\nI've spoken to a few colleagues - there's no shortage of work coming in that I could jump on. My concern was more that I've heard academia is very dependant on having a good network and it might be harder to build a network of statisticians in a much smaller department outside of a university",

      "text": "I agree with the other posts so far.  The one thing that no one has mentioned yet, though, is the work culture. Where I'm from, university PhDs (who tend to work 60-80 hrs/week) are held to a very different standard than gov't scientist PhDs (who tend to put in 40.001 hours per week). If you got too comfortable with the cushy gov't job, you might not want to do the university work afterwards, and your CV might reflect a slower pace of accomplishments (potentially within a narrower range - and with less independence). However, in my mind that's a great problem to have, because you can either just enjoy the lifestyle (and not leave) or (potentially, pending gov't approvals) if you're a hustler you can even double up, doing 10-20 hrs/wk of university work on top of a gov't job.\n\nTLDR; If you want to avoid getting stuck in gov't work, you may need to do extra work on the side to publish, teach, and pursue your own scientific interests. But to me this is still preferable to the classic university treadmill.",

      "text": "The real benefit of coming up through the public sector whilst doing your phd is that you get to know the back office mechanics of how public admin systems work. You will find that governments and public institutes procure research services from research various kinds of research professionals, and those are a less spoken about but often quite valuable source of consulting and research income. Once you complete your PhD, you will also understand those back office mechanics, and that will give you a big advantage if you'd like to perhaps for example start a research consultancy and service the public sector.",

      "text": "I'm in a very similar position. I'm a government researcher doing a full time PhD in Public Policy. There are a lot of advantages: cash flow, access to data, and keeping your finger on the pulse of the decisions practitioners are making. My only concern is where you mention pulling-in a full time salary. That's biting off a lot of work. I'm scheduled to work two days/week in my government research role this year and I expect to put in 50+ hours/week.\n\nFor your specific questions:\n\nPhDs typically can get TA opportunities and when they get teaching experience, opportunities to lead their own courses. I am scheduled to spend ten hours/week as a TA this year.\n\nIt's rare for a researcher to collaborate strictly within their own field, unless their work is highly specialized.\n\nUniversities would greatly appreciate your data access. Shaping the project is usually a matter for negotiation between the student and their supervisor(s). You could tell a faculty member what you're interested in and I'm sure they could advise as to ways you could expand it.\n\nGood luck!",
