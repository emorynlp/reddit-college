  "text": "Hi guys. Need some \u201cwhat would you do\u201d advice.\n\n\nBackground info - I\u2019m 31, single parent of a 5 year old. I\u2019ve worked in Early Childhood Education since I was 17. With COVID last year, our school started cutting back hours and I lost my job. In my area, early education teachers make $12/hour if we\u2019re lucky. \n\n\nContinuing my education has ALWAYS been something I\u2019ve wanted to do, but put off for one reason or another. I genuinely love school and learning. So when I couldn\u2019t find another job paying me the money I needed to make, I decided to finish my Bachelors. If everything goes according to plan, I\u2019ll be graduating a semester earlier than I was supposed to, and will finish in December of 2022 with my Bachelors in Integrated Studies with concentrations in Education and English, and a minor in Psychology.\n\n\nMy plan is to get my teaching license (in TN in the US you can have a bachelors in literally anything, take the Praxis test, and get your teaching license), find a job teaching in elementary school, and immediately go for my Master\u2019s in Curriculum and Instruction. I\u2019d like to finish that, and then go for my PhD as well.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s my question - those of you who have your PhD. Has it been worth it? I don\u2019t just mean financially, but obviously that too. I just want to make sure I\u2019m not getting as high as I can educationally, and then never moving beyond teaching elementary school. What jobs do you have? Do you regret the time, effort, and money you\u2019ve spent?",

      "text": "My supervisor once said to me \u201ca PhD is an apprenticeship in being an academic\u201d. Maybe because he thought that way, it think that way too, but I think it\u2019s a great way to look at the PhD degree. It\u2019s not like other degrees where you do some lectures, pass an exam and walk out with a certificate. It\u2019s about training you in the art of research and equipping you to become an academic.\n\nIf I were you, I would ask yourself, do you see yourself following a pathway to become an academic? If not, then a PhD is probably not the right path. If so, I would suggest looking into exactly what that entails in your field. For what it\u2019s worth, I would be careful when asking academics this question, because they necessarily suffer from a form of survivor bias. \n\nMy partner and I have different experiences. My partner really wanted to an academic and did a PhD with a world renowned professor in the social sciences. Finding jobs (academic or not) afterwards was near impossible and every day s/he regrets doing the PhD: over qualified, under experienced. \n\nI did mine in STEM with a lesser known professor. I enjoyed it and thought it was a great experience, I loved doing research and writing publications. I had a pathway to an academic future if I wanted it, but the experience really put me off academia as an industry: the pay was atrocious and the petty politics of academia irritated me too much.\n\nThe upside is my partner and I met doing our PhDs and we\u2019re really happy together. So it wasn\u2019t all bad! :-)",

Part of what convinced me to do my PhD was seeing it as preferred or even required on many jobs I was looking at. But I'm in Computer Science so there is a very tight link between academia and industry.",

Larger places like DeepMind have a clearer division of labour so there the \"requires PhD\" basically means that your job would be very similar to academia (although being an academic in industry is very different to \"real academia\" according to people I've spoken to).",

      "text": "I'd definitely start with the master's, try it out for a bit, and then go back if you're finding you haven't found your niche yet.  It really depends on what you want to be able to do.  \n\nIn ECE (if that's where you want to stay) with a master's, there are lots of different opportunities other than teaching and these are likely to explode in the future with coaching and professional development becoming a big part of the push to expand access to high-quality ECE.  You wouldn't be stuck as a classroom teacher forever at all, but there are similar pay challenges in the higher roles, though not as extreme.  \n\nFor context, I'm an ECE researcher.  I got a bachelor's in a related field and worked in human services for a while. I realized I wanted to be able to do more, so I went back for a master's.  I worked for a while, again in a tangentially-related field, and realized I still couldn't quite do what I wanted to do, so I went back for a PhD.  I definitely now have the skills to do what I want, but my work experiences hugely shaped my research interests and questions and led directly to my current work.",

          "text": "Thanks for the response! \n\nI\u2019ll probably say in ECE. Even with teaching, the highest I would want to go is probably 3rd grade, and since ECE is birth-8 years, that fits. Ideally I\u2019d like to get into more of the coaching and professional development side of things. As you mentioned, there needs to be more access to higher quality ECE. ECE is a field where you truly have to LOVE what you do, because if not it will affect the children you\u2019re educating. With my experience in this field I have sat through MANY coaching and professional development seminars/classes/trainings, and I\u2019ve learned the different between ones that you\u2019re zoning out at and taking just to get the piece of paper at the end, and ones that are actually inspiring you to take it back to the classroom. I\u2019ve also been in a classroom enough to know the difference between a teacher who is engaged with their students and ones who are just there for a paycheck, and seen the difference in how the students learn. \n\n\nBasically I want to be Rita Pierson (RIP) when I grow up.",
