  "text": "Long story short, COVID really did a number on my mental health and made me realize that I\u2019ve been forcing myself to continue down my career for everyone else (family/PI pressure, guilt of using funding) and not for myself.\n\nI decided that I need to leave my fellowship and change careers entirely, but I\u2019m not sure what the correct etiquette is. I wasn\u2019t really given a formal contract either, so I\u2019m wondering if breaking this decision to my mentors during our next scheduled meeting and giving a two week notice would be appropriate? \n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

      "text": "I would give way more notice than two weeks. 1-2 months is better. The most professional way to handle this would be to tell your PI in person and tell them you would be willing to train people. It\u2019s not easy to replace someone on short notice so the more you can do to ease the transition the better things will be with your PI.\n\nAlso, not to pry but do you have a job lined up? A career to switch into? It\u2019s fine if that\u2019s your choice but another option is time off from lab to see if that\u2019s what you want to do, and that way you don\u2019t burn a bridge in the process.",

This person is miserable and has no desire to continue in academia. It's cruel to tell them that the 'right' and normal thing to do is continue to be miserable for another 2 months in order to minimize the impact on the position that's making them miserable. \n\nPostdoc positions by design are temporary. I've seen plenty of postdocs give 2 weeks notice before heading to corporate jobs (corporate jobs generally won't wait much longer that after making an offer). The labs they left were fine.",

I\u2019ve already completed my required year 1 project so figured it was a clean time for me to leave.\n\nI don\u2019t have anything officially lined up, but I\u2019m making a switch into an acting/entertainment career (while picking up part-time survival jobs in the process). I have enough saved to get me through half a year while I look for jobs though because I\u2019ve been fairly frugal since college.",

Way too many people nowadays get stuck in these never ending cycles of \u201cwell I\u2019ve been doing it for x amount of years I can\u2019t stop now\u201d and it\u2019s sad cus they\u2019re not happy.  Not really much insight here but just saying good choice, to chase what you want and be who you are cus the world we live in makes that really hard sometimes",

Do it face to face, agree a notice period in which you can wrap stuff up (this doesn't mean finish all your projects, but leave them in an ordered state so someone else can pick them up). As you don't have another post to go to you can afford to be a little generous with the notice period, then put it all in writing in your formal resignation letter (email).\n\nETA 2 weeks in the US is fairly standard so that's not an unreasonable suggestion. You might want to consider being open to staying up to a month of they want you too. Once you've done the deed, you'll probably feel so much better about everything and money is money.",
