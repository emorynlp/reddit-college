  "title:": "Ph.D did not prepare me for post-doc, very behind, need reading resources to get me up to speed",
  "text": "Ok so the short version of it is that during my Ph.D I had a very bad mentor. This is not subjective, she was such a bad mentor that she was fired for never coming to work, never obtained a grant, and really I could count on two hands the number of times we sat down and I really learned something.  Because I was determined to get my Phd, I did everything on my own. The university did give me another mentor, but my mentor didn't have a research lab, didn't have expertise in the techniques I used, but had a good understanding of my overall topic. I guess it was the best they could do.  \n\nSo a few weeks back I started a post-doc.  I've only had a few days where I actually went in to the lab to work.   This is very new for me, it's a big lab with lots of people and despite being a post doc, I feel very inadequate when it comes to working in a lab.  In my Ph.D I used one very difficult and specific technique, and most of my skills are in the realm of surgery. So anything outside of surgery, I just cannot do, yet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs time goes on, I will learn. What I'm trying to do is save the social embarrassment because I don't know the names of things or how techniques work and these are pretty standard techniques for the field, but I just have no experience.  And everyone is assuming that I do because I'm a post-doc.  Everyone in the lab is talking about grants and publishing and these are all probably topics that most people become familiar with during their ph.D.  \n\nI know this is very vague, but if it helps I'm in the field of neuroscience. Basically what I'm asking for are resources for working in a lab, or what to do during your post-doc.  Imagine that after your 1st year in a phd program, your advisor left they just gave your phd and then you started a post doc without any experience.   Thats what it feels like. It feels like the only thing I can do, is perform surgery and read the literature and understand it in great depth and write about it. I do have those skills, but everything else, including the hands on stuff in the lab, I feel underprepared. \n\nAlso the other thing is that everyone in the lab wants to become a professor at one point, and I don't even think I am interested in that.",

I will offer some general advice, but I could probably be more specific with some more information about the kinds of methods you are using.\n\n*At the Bench* by Kathy Barker is a book that I recommend for all PhD students. It might be a little remedial for you, but it is still possibly valuable. There is a companion book *Statistics at the Bench* that is also very good.\n\nIf you are doing any molecular biology work, I recommend *Molecular Cloning* by Green and Sambrook as a comprehensive technical reference and protocol set. If you are doing an electrophysiology, I recommend *Patch Clamping* by Areles Molleman.\n\nAnother possible resource is the *Journal of Visualized Experiments*, which publishes video protocols on a wide range of experiments. If you are at an R1 institution, your library probably has a subscription to this.",

You were hired for a reason - possibly your expertise in that very difficult technique. What's valuable to your labmates (and your boss) is to take that, and add a positive framing.\n\n\"Hi, I'm FurnaceUBER the new postdoc. My PhD really focused on microsurgery, but I'm really eager to broaden my skills in this postdoc  - could I shadow you and ask a bunch of questions while you run that Western?\"\n\nLiterally no-one can fault you for that approach. The opposite approach, where you're ashamed of being a permanent learner (we all are permanent learners) is what will catch you out, because someone will set you a task that you've no clue how to do, you'll hamfist it, and get shouted at for not accurately delineating your competencies. Honesty is 100% the best policy here.\n\nFor what little it counts, if you're able to read widely, engage, and write, you're in a better position than most people who got treated like a technique monkey, and when you get a sense of the main lab techniques and costings, you'll be well placed to contribute to grant-writing.",

      "text": "You're exactly where you should be - you're looking at the situation backwards.\n\nThe point of the post-doc is to carve out a niche and develop yourself as an independent scientist.  One of my former mentors would always ask \"What's going to make you famous\".  While I always hated that phrase, the idea behind it is correct - what is it that you're going to be known for.  It's not good enough to be good, you need to have an area or skill set that when people think of or need that area or skill, they turn to you.  If everyone in the post-doc lab uses the same techniques that you're an expert in, then there's no opportunity for you - either to learn or excel.  So you're an expert in surgery, make that your thing in the lab so that when people need that skill they turn to you. In my post-doc we had one person who specialized in the gut - no one else in the lab worked on it.  He must have been put on a good 50% of the papers in the lab just by doing gut isolations and acting as a resource.  Someone else was an expert in the toxoplasmosis model and they got put on several papers as people needed someone to run a quick Th1 disease model.  Another was an outstanding bioinformatician and she was put on just about every paper for simple analyses (for her) that took her little time.  If you're doing the same thing as everyone else in the lab, you're in the wrong lab.\n\nMost Ph.D. advisors don't train their students to write grants.  Many Ph.D. advisors wrote their students' papers, and often a student's only exposure to writing was their thesis.  You're probably not as far behind as you think and in another year you'll be the person that a new post-doc is measuring themselves up to.\n\nYou also have another skill that many new post-docs don't - the ability to work independently.  In large, highly competitive labs post-docs act as small independent labs.  I have seen many post-docs who were extremely hand-held in their doctoral training that they were not able to function independently in the larger, competitive labs.\n\nYou're not expected to know everything.  Know your area, know it well.  Be familiar enough with other areas to know when you need to venture into them, and then form collaborations with your peers (inside the lab or out).  Learn when to speak up, you need to be visible, and when to keep your mouth shut.\n\nWhen I as a student, I once asked a HHMI investigator why she didn't ask many questions at our Work in Progress seminars.  She said that she didn't know the first thing about most of the topics being presented.  That surprised me and was a defining moment for me.  I just came from study section - the reason we had 38 people on the panel was because people aren't deeply familiar with all the areas of science in the applications.  For example, during discussion you'll often hear people ask why model X was used as they weren't familiar with the model, and someone would reply that the model is the standard model in that field and was being used for reasons A, B, an C.  Students and new post-docs have this idea that PIs and others in the lab are experts in everything.  The reality is that the PI has been working *in that space* for many years, but take them out of that space and they're just as lost as you.  As a post-doc, develop *your* space - what's going to make you famous.  You have three years to prep for your next interview.",
