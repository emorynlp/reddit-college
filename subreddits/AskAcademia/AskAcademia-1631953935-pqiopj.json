There's usually a number of ads for senior researchers in various parts of the Civil Service, and, though they aren't advertised as frequently, also within think tanks and NGOs/third sector organisations. Institute of Public Policy Research would be the obvious one, but there are plenty more places looking for people with SPSS/quant skills, and often also for qualitative researchers too.",

I know Wellcome, CRUK and BHF all have people. \n\nYou could also be looking at think tanks and consultancies. Obviously think tanks come in a variety of flavours and reputabilities but places like the PHG Foundation and Technopolis are quite good, and there's a load in London.",

Many are advertised in the Guardian, and you can occasionally find them also on jobs.ac.uk  Otherwise, have a look at thirdsector.co.uk - there's usually the most ads on their job boards overall. Some UK jobs are also on devex.com but generally that's better for overseas postings.\n\nGood luck in your new career!",
