  "text": "I am writing a **cover letter** for a Ph.D. application. I generally end up with a written full page but it is quite tiring to the eye. So I was considering adding some diagrams like the Venn diagram because \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019 \ud83d\ude02. Do you think it is absurd or quite okay?\n\nI asked someone doing his Ph.D. and he said that the scientists are conservative in general so he did not recommend any diagram.",

      "text": "1 page seems a little short, at least for my field.\n\nAlso, while I haven\u2019t seen it before, as long as you can justify doing it then why not add an image or diagram? That said, the whole 'picture worth a 1,000 words' addage is not always applicable to researchers, who might get confused by a random object interrupting the text. Images and diagrams cost a lot of space because you have the frame the object in your narrative, then place the object, then interpret the object. And it has to be a reasonable addition that is best communicated that way or readers might get cranky.",
