  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm currently a course instructor for different university classes, applying for professorships. I've taught some courses on assignment writing and wanted to share some advice for students that may help with meeting deadlines and writing clearly and concisely.\n\n- try to get your first draft done a week before the assignment is due. This will give you time to go back and revisit your work, send it off to another set of eyes for help, and make you feel more relaxed because you're not rushing to get last minute edits done. \n\n- revise your assignment at least three times with different purposes: (1) to make sure the content works and is clear; (2) to check for punctuation, grammar mistakes, spacing errors, headings, headers, page numbers, and missing or additional references; and (3) to check transitions and make sure your ideas and paragraphs flow into one another and finish off any other edits you find. I would then sleep on it and give it a once-over with a fresh set of eyes before you hit submit. \n\n- ask the professor questions. Don't be shy to reach out and ask questions for clarification. The good profs don't want to see you stressed or anxious because something is unclear. We are all human and sometimes what we are saying may not be as clear as it could be. There's no harm in reaching out to other students on discussion forums or to professors through email to ask for help so you know exactly what is expected. If you are struggling to understand assignment expectations, odds are others are too, and that doesn't set anyone up for success. \n\n- try to be formal and respectful in your communications in class. It sets you up for better communication with the professor when you start emails with \"hi professor\" compared to \"hey (first name of prof)\". \n\n- know your weaknesses and listen to feedback. Everyone has their strengths. If you're struggling with transitions, then that's what you should focus your efforts on improving throughout the course. Take the free writing help centre time to work on transitions. Or references. Or whatever you feel stressed doing. Our stressors with writing are not something to avoid. In fact, it's the opposite. Don't let your anxiety get in the way of strengthening your writing. Get all the help you can, including asking the professor for their thoughts if you are having issues. \n\n- of you have the option, write about something that interests you as much as possible. It will motivate you to write, you will probably dive deeper with reading various materials, and your arguments will sound stronger. \n\n- make sure to avoid informal writing (story-like words, or words that you would say to friends, \"but\" compared to \"however\", \"on the flip side\" compared to \"conversely\"). \n\nJust a few tips, but I hope they help!",

I have a problem following the exact mind course in my works. For example, i was writing the thesis on the Roman heritage in the works of Einchardt, and I mentioned some problems that drew me into digressions, which took the space for my work. Is there any tip on that subject?",

Then each paragraph or section will be about these points, with each topic in the first sentence to set each paragraph up. Make sure you avoid redundancy. We have a knack for saying things twice in different ways. Comb over your work for redundant statements and vagueness.",
