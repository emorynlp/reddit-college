  "title:": "Is it Inappropriate to Attend Thesis Defenses as an Undergraduate?",
  "text": "Psychology major, here. I'm not sure it changes things, but I'm in the United States.\n\nA few weeks ago I asked to attend a Thesis Defense zoom that I found on our event calendar. It's relevant to my career choice so I sent an email asking if it was open to the public and if I could attend. The graduate defending her thesis seemed happy for my interest and stated it was open, and sent me the zoom link.\n\nOn the day of the defense, I joined like normal and soon found out I was the ONLY undergraduate there. There were a total of four attendees, and the other three were faculty in the Psychology department. I really felt out of place, but stayed to listen regardless. It was an interesting study! There were a few things lost on me since I'm early into my major (the majority of it had to due with data readings), and thankfully, no one asked why I was there.\n\nHowever, I have to wonder, even though I could attend, was it inappropriate for me too? Are undergrads not supposed to attend Thesis Defenses? Or am I thinking too much?\n\n(I'm not sure if this is better suited for r/College , but I thought Academics may know this more than other undergraduates. If I'm wrong though please let me know!)\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for your kind and reassuring words! It's so interesting to see different experiences, too! I definitely feel more confident now to attend more in the future.  I greatly appreciate all of the feedback <3  Hopefully next time there will be more people, haha",

      "text": "not inappropriate at all, at least not in my experience. But you're discovering a common truth about thesis defenses: nobody goes to them, haha. Its one of the most difficult things to digest as a PhD student that what you've just spent years of your life absolutely pouring yourself into, is probably not going to draw in more than a handful of audience members. This goes for academic conferences, too: i've spent months preparing for a conference talk that maybe 7 people ended up actually attending, lol. Just kind of a fact of the job \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nI attended one of my good friends' defenses the other day--she's not my friend from school and i have no real familiarity with her STEM-related field (i'm in English), but because shes in a pretty flashy, well-funded area of STEM i expected a healthy attendance. I was the only person there outside of her dissertation committee, even though like you've said it was a completely open invitation to anyone affiliated with this person/school.",

              "text": "haha, exactly! when i first entered grad school i had terrible performance anxiety and actually found the practice of getting to do these talks in front of just a handful of folks (most of whom i actually knew personally, lol) extremely useful when it came time to, later in my career and in different scenarios, speak in front of hundreds! I think a lot of the \"audience\" of academia just happens remotely--people buying our books or clicking our articles perhaps even decades after they were originally published; and we don't get such a healthy in-person audience hardly ever. But that is a-okay with my public speaking-adverse self !",

              "text": ">How fascinating. I would have thought many more people would join out of interest! (Or learning opportunities, perhaps). But maybe they aren't as fun for others as I thought.\n\nThe people assessing the defense are generally experts in the field. In my program, we hand-pick expert examiners from around the world to judge us, so it's not like the talk is going to be pitched at a general level. At the absolute lowest, it's pitched at a Masters level for the field but not the subfield. At its highest, it'll be pitched for people with PhDs in the topic.\n\nSo not really a learning opportunity for a general audience. Current graduate/postgraduate students and other faculty might get a bit out of it but will generally get lost in the weeds at some point and zone out. I'd expect undergraduates to get lost immediately after the introduction. But this is for theoretical physics/astrophysics, so there may be a higher barrier. Plus, ours are generally closed-door.\n\n> Maybe some prefer it that way, though.. At least the anxious ones.\n\nDefinitely true! A defense can last 3+ hours with heavy grilling. It's generally not a hugely pleasant experience and a lot of people don't want family and friends (or randos) attending. You wouldn't want your mum watching over your shoulder as you took an exam. So always a good idea to ask if it isn't clearly marked as public.",

Sure, there is a closed session with just your committee where they make you squirm but people should attend for the open portion where you present your slides at least! Even when I was in music it was expected that you attend everyone in the studio performances and let me tell you some of them were boring AF but if you missed it you would get a chewing out by the professor in charge for being disrespectful. I sincerely hope that we are missing something in this story because if not, this makes for a pretty toxic and unsupportive work environment that I would have been miserable to train in.",

I am no longer in academia for the very reasons you\u2019ve outlined here. but i was in the traditional humanities, an area of academia that is just a few small steps away from being completely, unrescuably dead. even at the biggest, most attended conferences or dissertations in my area of the humanities it\u2019s depressingly evident how unfunded, toxic, and competitive\u2014rather than supportive\u2014everything has gotten. People usually attend things like that just to say they did or to appear active in the field, not because theyre bad people but just because truly nobody has the bandwidth/time/energy to be genuinely contributive in the way it sounds like is happening in your area. i\u2019m glad to hear there\u2019s areas of academia that are not so awful, but by the time i left i was basically catatonically depressed because of how actually lonely all the meant-to-be social aspects of academia are in my area",

All the hard work is done, here\u2019s a chance for you to publicly share the work. You shouldn\u2019t be presenting anything your committee hasn\u2019t already seen/discussed with you, so it should be straight forward, and all the questions are likely questions you have heard before from your committee. As an attendee, your role is to be supportive and quiet so they can get through the process without being derailed.\nNote: this is different from your proposal defense in which you go under the microscope, and generally are closed to the public.",

Not even members of her lab, parents or friends? If this is the case, that is a damn shame because your thesis defense is a crowning moment of achievement in your career. It is a moment to be celebrated and for the trainee to show off all their expertise hard work and accomplishments. When I was in grad school, my department (also Psych) made it a point to establish an expectation of professionalism in showing up to each others\u2019 talks. The ONLY reasonable excuse was that you were running an experiment that could not be re-arranged, that you were in class (either taking or teaching), you were sick, or were out of town (ie attending a conference). So I am surprised and disappointed that this wasn\u2019t the case for this trainee. The only thing I can think of is that what you participated in was not in fact a defense but rather an administrative milestone (like a prospectus) or a mentoring committee meeting?

She thought it would be a great idea; however, since she is new at this Uni, still suggested emailing the graduate just in case. Who, in turn, confirmed (with her advisor?) just to make sure I could attend! But perhaps getting a second opinion would also have been handy.",

How well attended defenses are does depend a lot on the culture of the department - in some, it's very common for most of the department (faculty and grad students) to show up to be supportive, even if they're not workIng in a related area, although they might only be there for the initial presentation, not the grilling. In others, it's just the committee. Zoom defenses are a different beast (I have definitely left those playing in the background while I work when I would not have spent 3 hours in a room listening to the same defense).\n\nIt's true they tend to be very technical and often hard to follow even if you do work in a related area, but I feel like it's worth attending at least a few to get an idea of what they're like and how people approach handling questions.",
