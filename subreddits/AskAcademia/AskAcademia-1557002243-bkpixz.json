  "title:": "Why publish a 'new method' paper if you're not going to share the method?",
  "text": "A bit of a rant, plus a genuine question.  I work in a life sciences subfield where I deal quite a bit with image processing for data collection (high-throughput phenotyping).  It's a quickly-growing area of interest, and papers are regularly published about new ways to count/assess/quantify characteristics from images.  Obviously, these methods involve some sort of code - MATLAB, Python, etc. - but so few authors cite any sort of Github repo or any other method of sharing.  Frustratingly, none of the authors I've ever reached out to have responded to my requests for code.  This has happened a few times now, and more often than not I'm forced to re-write some program based on the sparse description in the paper (not a small feat for someone with a non-CS background). \n\nIt just seems counterintuitive to me that a 'new method' paper wouldn't actually share the new method.  Isn't that the point, accelerating the field of study and whatnot?  There's some new journals that are moving in the right direction - not allowing submissions without proof of data and code in a repository, for example - and those who are committed to open-source programs, which is great.  But, seriously: why the allowance of people to keep their 'new method' secret?",

      "text": "This used to be the case in astronomy but is a lot less so these days. It seems to be from somewhat of a culture shift, and one that probably hasn't hit the life sciences in the same way just yet. Ideally, the new method would be something to share. But I suspect that for many people, it's a way to do something that then they can publish and then they can cite with their own work. You'd think that gaining outside citations would be a plus but I figure that a lot of people would rather try to squeeze what they can themselves out of the method.\n\nThe analogy I can think of now in astronomy is the sharing of observational data. It's gotten a lot better now but people like to sit on their data and squeeze what they can out of it. Of course, if you share your data (perhaps after some proprietary period so you can get first crack out of your science), then you can gain citations and help the broader field. But that's not always been the case and there are still plenty of sub-fields where people feel it's better to keep their own data, talk about the amazing stuff that one can do with them, and then just keep publishing results from them themselves.",

          "text": "Observers data share largely because telescopes are enabling it and requiring it.  Codes and simulation data mostly don't get shared because it's a ton of work to get codes to the point where sharing is worthwhile, which is occasionally (but not usually) a good use of time.  So there's a huge selection bias where public codes often get a huge return on going public, but they were selected as codes people were looking for.\n\nIndeed, I have (at least) one methods paper where I didn't release the code, but certainly did release the method.  I just didn't have the time to take the code from where I could make it work to where someone I don't know with only a README file could make it work correctly ~50% of the time.  It remains on my 'to-do' list, but until it's likely at least a couple people would want to use it, it's hard to prioritise it.\n\nAnd of course I wouldn't mind sharing sim data, but nobody gives away dozens of Tb of space for that, either.  If you're funded to host some giant sim for everyone, it can be workable, but that's not generically done.",

I agree that it's a lot of work to write well documented code and takes a lot of time. However, just make the repository open source on GitHub or similar on day one and keep that in mind as you are writing the code. Bad code code has a tendency to produce bad results and closed source software cannot be inspected or reviewed by others.

They go over the algorithm, how the program works, etc...they just don't provide the code.  The problem they solved was that counting spores takes a long time by hand - not really an 'interesting result', per ce, just a more efficient way to accomplish a laborious task.  They're not going to publish work based on this method alone, but they'll definitely save a lot of time in their lab.   \n\nIn a lot of what I read (specific to this rapidly-expanding plant science subfield), authors are always eager to mention that their method is time-saving and widely applicable to other researchers.

Probably the most infuriating ones as of late have shown detailed screenshots, plots and graphs, and generated designs, from a not just closed-source, but 100% proprietary code that is only used internally to their organization. From what I can tell, it's basically an advertisement for one of the capabilities of their company.\n\nThe other side to this, is that I am often frustrated to see code in a paper, where a mathematical explanation would be of more general use. I have read many papers and books which give code listings (or downloads) in ancient versions of Fortran or worse, Basic, which may require significant work to implement in a more recent language. Others use Matlab, which is not freely available, especially outside the academic community.\n\nWhen we consider the longevity of the paper, it's a fine line to walk. It may be quite difficult to express a complex algorithm, especially from a program that implements other libraries, in mathematical or algorithm notation. On the other hand, can you expect your reader 25 years from now to have a compatible version of Python/Matlab/etc, along with all the same libraries and dependencies needed? \n\nMaking something open-source can also raise some hackles within a department. The PI wants to walk a fine line between publishing results, and making all the tools for producing those results (and future research possibilities) public. I think this is somewhat generational, with younger PIs perhaps seeing open-sourcing work as a publication or contribution in its own right. Plus, they may be more savvy to the many possible types of license.",

      "text": ">  Isn't that the point, accelerating the field of study and whatnot?  \n\nThis really is why I got into academia in the first place (I'm in CS). I quickly became disillusioned with it, though, since so few papers show code. Luckily, the papers from the top people in my field do post code and cite their repo, or someone else creates an excellent repo and shares it. It truly is a problem, and it's good that some journals and conferences like KDD ask for implementation details. I always try including either a GitHub link or the code for the most crucial parts of my papers.",

I don't have funds to hire someone with a degree in IT to take care of my codes to make them shareable. My codes are most likely command line scripts that have not been written down, that I'll be forced to re-implement by the time the review comes around.",

      "text": "Hopefully i can shed some light on this since i work and do research in ML... chances are the method isnt new at all. Most likely theyre applying a well known algorithm to something that hasnt been well tested in the past. Unless the paper youre reading is from MIT, Stanford, CMU, or a couple other big name schools or the tech giants i can almost guarantee you they didnt do anything novel. Just look at papers they cite and use the algorithms in there and not their own implementation.\n\nEDIT: Another thing to note is that if it is a well known algo then it becomes normal for the algo not to be explained. The writer expects the reader to have a degree of competency in ML and that explaining the algo to people who already know it is unnecessary. Since you mentioned image processing, its entirely possible that they didnt thoroughly explain the CNN they used since CNNs have been around for several years now.",
