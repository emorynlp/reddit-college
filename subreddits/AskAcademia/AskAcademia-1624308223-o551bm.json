  "text": "I am a STEM student about to go into his final year of undergrad. I have been reading scientific papers and conducting research since my first semester and while I have gotten *better* at reading papers, it still sucks SO much to do so. I do not know what it is. Every time I start reading a paper I get like a page in and my mind goes 'wow this is boring and it sucks' and I stop. I will all the time hear post-docs and my PI talk about how cool a paper was and I cannot fathom how they think so. To be perfectly clear, I think my research is amazing and I love learning. Lectures are my favorite thing but something about scientific papers just turns me off so hard. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone have tips on how to make papers more palatable?",

Not sure if your field does this too, but in Computer Science, many of the conference proceedings are online, so you can just watch the presentation instead, if you really don't want to read a paper.  \n\n\nFor me, enjoying reading research papers definitely took a while. The style of writing is usually dry and it takes some getting used to. And secondly, early on, I didn't understand a lot of what was written and that turned me off too. Once these issues were solved, things got better.",

I have tried a number of times to liven up my papers a bit as I loathe the way many are written (if I see another \"moreover\" I will slit my wrists), but often, as per journal style guides, one is left with little wiggle room.\n\nI find talking about papers and debate to be the way in which I most successfully engage. I also enjoy finding papers that closely relate to my own narrow field rather than going too broad. Of course, reading around is a necessity at times, but the more applicable, the more happy I am to delve in. I am also someone who reads primarily for cool methods and find methods papers to be the most interesting of all as they may allow me to play with something new in the lab! \ud83d\ude05",

                  "text": "> On the one hand you are right that a bit more creative and eloquent language would make papers more enjoyable to read.\n\nI think the problem is we have to do the opposite: use [simple English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia) plus a consistent jargon. \"Eloquent and creative language\" would lead to a situation where you are simultaneously deciphering difficult concepts, often very abstract stuff, and also a complex text. If the text is as simple as possible, most of the time you will only have to deal with the actual complexity of the actual science in the paper.\n\nWhen I read older papers, esp. pre 70s, it's just too much work trying to parse sentences without forgetting the scientific concepts being talked about in there, and trying to get what the author intended to say. The reason a paper is boring is that we want to get to the science, but there's something preventing us from just getting it, not a lack of language with literary sophistication.\n\nAs a benefit, papers with simpler language are easier to digest for people working in L2 (and given how English has become the lingua franca of the internet and of science, most people are working in a second language), people with language related disabilities that otherwise do not have any impediment to their scientific capabilities, people just starting out with science (i.e. students, early career researchers), and peer reviewers/editors.\n\nI kinda wish there was an interdisciplinary \"English for Science\" style guide that could both be a goalpost for students/scientists who learn of English and a guide for authors of scientific written text.",

If whether or not to read is a decision I have to make, that's the point where I decide if I read the whole thing or leave it at that, whether because the paper is bs or because it's not relevat to whatever I'm doing.\n\nWhen reading study design and methods, plus the statistics if relevant, avoid getting caught on details. Look for red flags instead, like multiple testing, weird ways of playing with data etc. If nothing seems off, or unless you're particularly intersted in the methodology, don't bother analysing stats in depth.\n\nFind a glossary for your discipline. E.g. in linguistics we have the Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics, Matthews 2003. Make sure you devise some way to quickly consult it. For key terms copy and paste their definitions in your reading notes so you don't have to consult the dictionary every time you encounter the term.\n\nWhen reading long, badly written sentences, it's useful to use different colours to highlight smaller, comprehensible parts of it so that you don't have to go back to where it starts and parse it 10 times to be able to read.\n\nUse something like a pomodoro timer to take breaks regularly. Drink a decent amount of water to stay hydrated, a dehydrated brain is like car that ran out of coolant liquid. I have a water bottle on my desk at all times, even when I'm having coffee as I read.\n\nFinally, as you're starting, papers are dense and hard, but as you learn more and more about your field and as core terminology becomes second nature, and as you learn more about methods, you'll feel more comfortable and reading will become way easier.\n\nHope that helps!",

One of the final exams in my bachelor's was being given a random paper and critically assessing it and I found it torturous. I remember doing a journal club in my first year of PhD where I presented a paper and again, found it a real slog just to get through the thing, just like you describe.\n\nI think the switch flipped at some point when I started to become really familiar with the common research methods of my field and the way experiments are designed within it. At some point, as that kind of information moves from stuff you have to be consciously aware of to a kind of background knowledge in your brain, assessing papers becomes a breeze. You can very quickly pick up what they wanted to do, what they did to address it and their general results with a quick skim. Once that becomes second nature, the whole process of critically digesting a paper becomes a hell of a lot quicker, and once you start to get a real feel for how people are doing and reporting their research it can even become enjoyable.\n\nI think getting to that stage is partly down to experience - for me, it was hugely important to be surrounded by people doing research, observing them and the way the process worked. At some point, what I was seeing in the lab clicked with what I was reading in papers (and trying to implement in my work!) \n\nBut equally you can train yourself to get to know the truly important bits of papers. Try to pay close attention to the way experiments are designed and carried out - how the question is identified, what methods have been selected, and what information those methods can give. Take some papers in your area of research and try to practice breaking the papers down into these basic facts as quickly as possible - what was their research question? what methods did they use? what information did this give? and does their conclusion really match the information their methods were able to provide? Write a one sentence answer to these questions for a paper a day, or something like that. The first one will be a chore and take time.  But once you get used to identifying these crucial bits of information, stripping away everything else, you'll eventually be able to digest and critically assess a paper relatively quickly. And as soon as that part of it becomes less of a chore, you might even start to enjoy it!",

They don\u2019t need to understand the intricacies and technical methodology reported as required for peer review, but they should understand the introductory overviews and summations, and most importantly should walk away with an understanding of why it matters.\n\nThese are the types of papers I like reading.",

      "text": "Not every research paper is enjoyable to read, and it depends a lot on the authors and their style of writing.\n\nI read tons of papers but not necessarily linearly. I am more able to appreciate a research paper if it is related to my research or some topics that I follow - it's about the rationale and concept of their studies, how original or mind blowing are their research questions, how clever or careful is their research design, and the methods and techniques they employed or invented to tackle the specific conditions, and sometimes how their interpretations of data making sense of not only their results but the whole phenomenon in a field of research. Perhaps we can see that the advancement of a topic in a field of research as a novel, and papers as their chapters, e.g. a few pioneers found the field with their papers about some discovery, some follow-up papers related to the clarification and explanation of some observations, some review papers talking about the core controversy in the field and the different schools of thought, and some revisits of these topics to shed some new light on the unanswered questions with new state of the art technology or discovery in other fields. These are like open-ended novels, from joint efforts of writers with different styles and in different writing proficiency. \n\nI rarely finish a novel as soon as there is anything illogical or mixed up with previous chapters that made my understanding of the story difficult, just look at how good a job D&D have done to end the Game of Thrones... But following exciting research topics are like reading great chronicles, and they are always some \"good read\" - the key is not in the writing but to follow their research.",

Read the abstract, then the first and last paragraphs of the discussion, then the sections you're interested in (i.e. you might be reading it \"for the methods\" if you're designing an experiment or \"for the results\" if you're reading a brand new paper).\n\nSince you're in STEM, allow me to direct you to the wonderful world of review articles! A well-written review is like a guide for what's important to get out of primary research papers. They're kind of like a halfway point between the research paper, where the authors are describing new findings, and textbooks/lectures which use only the best-supported work but might not be up-to-date. They tend to be more didactically written and will orient you to the terms and techniques so later you can look at a methods section or figures and have an idea of what the authors are trying to say. I was fortunate to join my lab shortly after my PI had written a great review of work in our field for the last 20 years, and it was a fantastic starting point for finding papers and getting the useful information out of them.",
