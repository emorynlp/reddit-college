  "text": "As the title says, I know an afghan MSc who I helped online with getting some software running a couple of year ago with his thesis.\n\nHe wrote me again recently telling me he's looking to flee Afghanistan, and he's looking for a PhD student position somewhere. I haven't found any in my country (regular application process is way too slow, and has other issues). Are you aware of any program that funds students from \"problematic countries\" applying for PhD positions, including the resettlment process?\n\n(His topic is medical physics, if relevant)",
