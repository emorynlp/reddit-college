          "text": "I recently had a stomach parasite that was reeking all sorts of havoc on my system.  If I ate the wrong foods it was like my whole body got out of whack and everything went horribly wrong.  I'd look really sickly, big black bags under my eyes, pallid puffy face, splotchy skin, sagging face, etc.  I looked absolutely terrible.\n\nIt was amazing how people started treating me.  Even people I knew, but especially strangers.  They avoided eye-contact.  They'd ignore my contributions in group conversations.  If we ended up alone together at social functions, they would try and get out of having conversations with me.  No matter what good cheer I tried to bring to our interaction, it would land like a thud.  People avoided me, ignored me, and in some cases were clearly repulsed by me.\n\nIt was all so blatantly obvious to me, but I don't think they even knew they were doing it.It was completely unconscious.  Something in the way I look triggered an aversive reaction in them...which makes sense I guess, it's probably a good reaction to have in the past, to avoid sickly people.\n\nWhen I started looking better, those same people would react totally different to me, suddenly really interested in how I was, asking why we haven't caught up for so long, attentive during conversations, etc.  Strangers would smile at my jokes again, be responsive to conversation, etc.  They were just two completely different worlds.\n\nIt was a profound experience for me.  Not a particularly fun one, but an interesting one.  It made me realise how it's not just good-looking people who get special treatment, but that many unattractive people also get it, in the opposite direction.  If you grew up with that as your life 24/7 I can totally see how people might get socially withdrawn and bitter.  People treated me like an outcast, and eventually I felt like one, and I withdrew socially.\n\nI was lucky enough to have some really close friends who I had known for a long time, who never treated me any differently.  It was a real eye-opener.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to contribute, because we always hear about the halo effect and whatnot, but there's very much a flipside to it, too.",

Just like everybody, I am guilty of treating and judging people differently based on their gender, personality, appearance, etc. But at least I try to acknowledge and discuss it, and minimize the impact it has on the decisions I make. Most others seem to pretend they are 100% bias-free, everyone else is the problem, and it is a personal attack on them if you suggest systematic changes to avoid bias from affecting hiring practices etc.",

I never had kids, but I think of the problem a little bit the way I imagine parents think about parenting: in my reflective interludes, I strategize about ways to step back from decisions and interactions and balance them better than I would on autopilot, but I also don't let the imperfection of my efforts paralyze me.

The following all occurred while I was an UG at a public state university.\n\nI had a youngish male prof who had a clear bias toward those who appeared to be younger, thinner and fitness minded, prettier females. He made comments about his pre-marital dating life and his avoiding particular physical characteristics.  He frequently mentioned his fitness routine in class too, which on its own would be meaningless but when taken together is telling. I felt that his facial expressions, when speaking to particular students, also spoke his bias. I never mentioned it to anyone and chalked it up to personal insecurity until a mature student asked me if I had the same impression.\n\nI had an older prof. who made comments about the appearance of a girl in one of my classes. He had been rambling a bit and then he told her (and the class) that she would have an easier time finding a job after graduation because she was so pretty. On one hand that may be his bias, on the other, it may be an observation. Hard to say. Still uncomfortable.\n\nI had another youngish male prof who said older (non-trad) female students should not pursue higher degrees and that it was ok that HE did because HE needed to provide for his family. He framed it in a statement about pushing his wife to leave her established and beloved career in favor of his newly emerging career in academia. The whole male breadwinner routine was rather surprising in this otherwise seemingly socially aware prof.\n\nI feel like these things are hard to prove and that complaining just creates unwelcomed turmoil for the student - so I just kept my mouth shut.",

The papers still need to go through the same peer review process as any other.\n\nAnd, what about all of the findings that make no sense without considering evolutionary theory?  Things like facial symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, the scent of MHC genes, sociosexuality, etc.  These things are inexplicable outside of an evolutionary lense.\n\nAnd, the assumptions?  There is more evidence for evolutionary theory than nearly any other theory in all of science.\n\nIf I were you, I'd read some more about it.\n\nOr, you can just downvote me.",

There are some pretty ridiculous claims that get thrown about with way too much confidence, like [this](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12512-women-may-be-hardwired-to-prefer-pink/) cracker that women have an innate preference for the color pink because, you know, picking berries and all that stuff.  It's a perfect example of researchers going looking for a particular kind of explanation and working backwards from the data to it.  Again, check out Gray's paper, I'd be interested to see what you think.  I think it offers a pretty solid critique of some of what are supposed to be the more robust claims of the field: cheater detection, etc.\n\nIt's also a bit disingenuous of you to collate Evolutionary Psychology with Evolutionary Theory as a whole.  I don't know if you're aware of this, but Evolutionary Psychology doesn't have a good reputation with a lot of evolutionary biologists, precisely because its claims often aren't supported with the kind of rigorous empirical evidence that a claim in evolutionary biology usually requires.  We can trace much of evolutionary biology through the fossil record.  When it comes to human brains and behaviour, that record is not there.  Brains decay and most of human evolution was not recorded.  There's scant evidence of how our ancestors thought, behaved, and lived.  And a lot of the conclusions drawn in EP claim to have, or rely on, insights precisely in to that.\n\nI don't have a problem with applying evolutionary theory to cognition.  It's what I do.  But you don't need to adopt some of the assumptions that the EP folk hold to do it.  The massive modularity/brain as a computer metaphor that EP pushes in particular isn't required to do evolutionary psychology, as in little E and little P.  And widening out the conceptual repertoire to include things like developmental systems theory, cultural evolution, niche construction, etc, is, in my opinion, going to give us a broader and more useful toolset to understand the complexity of human brains, which are the most plastic and malleable organ in existence.  They're areas that I feel EP ignores and downplays a lot of the time.",

Evolutionary psychologists don't like just so stories any more than any other scientists do.\n\nEvolutionary psychology has a great reputation with most evolutionary biologists.  Sure, there may be some that are critical, but it's not the majority by any means.  Just a moment's reflection will lead you to the conclusion that we *have* to have an evolved psychology.  If you raised a human an a chimpanzee in an environment with language, one species will develop language and the other will not.  That's because we have an evolved language acquisition device.  If there was no evolved psychology then all living organisms would have the same psychology.  They obviously don't.\n\nAnd, I think that you're cherry picking your criticisms of evolutionary psychology.  Have you read \"How the Mind Works\"?  Or \"The Selfish Gene\"?

Or \"The Evolution of Desire?\" Each of those books be backed up with huge amounts of empirical literature that dwarf the just-so stories that you've bringing up.\n\nI've read the first two, but not the last.  Have you read \"How Emotions Are Made\", \"Cognitive Gadgets\" and \"The Extended Synthesis\"?  All of those are also backed up by huge amounts of empirical literature, and written by prominent scientists in their field.  And they offer approaches and accounts that are very different from the books you listed, and in some cases heavily critical of them.\n\nThe 'selfish-gene' metaphor isn't a paradigm in evolutionary biology.  It's not a view ubiquitously held by evolutionary biologists.  And Pinker's computational approach to understanding the mind certainly isn't a paradigm in the brain sciences, although there's certainly plenty who do buy in to it.  They're popular books which push particular frameworks, but there are competing frameworks, and they are just as well - arguably better - supported by the empirical work.\n\nMy point isn't that they're right and your books are wrong, it's that it's all about how the existing empirical research is interpreted and synthesised as to which approach you favour.  That's why you can have such different frameworks being pushed by equally respectable scientists.  The jury is still very much out. \n\n>Just a moment's reflection will lead you to the conclusion that we have to have an evolved psychology.\n\nNo one (that I know of) questions that we have an evolved psychology.  You won't find many people arguing that the visual system isn't an adaptation, for example, or that fight or flight mechanisms are learned, not innate.  The problems start when we move to more complex, phylogenetically recent, behaviours/traits/capacities.  Because plasticity is also an adaptation.  We have evolved to be highly malleable, to adapt rapidly to changing conditions, to imitate, emulate, and accommodate our environments in ways that shape our capacities, preferences, etc.  Much of what looks like evolved mechanisms might turn out to be acquired, and evolved mechanisms themselves, it appears, are recyclable and rewirable in ways that can elicit novel capacities (see Dehaene on the visual word-form area and reading, for example).  I mean, check out Michael Anderson's work on neural recycling...rather than an anomaly or exception to the rule, it looks like it's turning out to be a fundamental organising principle of brains.  That means that much of who we are, how we think and behave, etcetera, is going to be shaped by our environments, experiences, and culture - not just locked down at some point in our ancestor's past, with some minor variation within a norm of reaction based on cultural inputs to cognitive algorithms.\n\nI mean, I'm a pluralist.  I think it's probably the case that some of our cognitive architecture is likely a product of genetics, but much of it is going to be fundamentally shaped by the worlds we're born in to, within our lifetimes (I also think developmental systems theory is a far better way to think about development, rather than a gene --> protein --> trait story, but that's probably a different discussion).  My issue with EP is mostly that it pushes one particular view of what brains are and what they do, and as an overarching paradigm for understanding cognition, I find that story unconvincing.  Particularly when it comes to complex behaviours.  It's too easy to work backwards to the conclusion by reaching back in to an imagined past, and there are plenty of examples within EP of exactly that happening.\n  \nAs a *part* of the story...well, I'm much more likely to get on board with that.",
