  "title:": "Leaving postdoc after three months? Help!",
  "text": "(Info: I am a current postdoc in neuro, USA) I applied for this postdoc in February of 2020, had a phone interview in March 2020, and then a Zoom interview + job talk in October 2020. I was offered the job within an hour of my interview. The big space between phone and Zoom interviews was due to hoping that we could meet at a conference and chat in person, which of course wasn't feasible.\n\nThe plan was for to defend and walk in Spring 2021 then move to begin the postdoc in early summer. I attended lab meetings, talked with current grad students, asked about the PI's reputation, was active and direct with communication between October and graduation. There were no red flags. When I arrived a few months ago, things were not as I was led to believe. Despite emphasizing my desire for a lab with a collaborative culture and being assured that the new lab would be a good fit, there was basically no culture at all. The techniques I thought were established in the lab weren't really functional. I think a lot of this is due to COVID and the fact that a few grad students that were part of my interview and integral to lab function have graduated and moved on. Additionally, the PI is not a great communicator or manager of people and it has created a bit of a toxic environment that has made it hard to integrate into the lab. \n\nSoon after I arrived, I was pushed to put in a fellowship application. It was on short time, so I worked long hours to get the application in before the deadline. My ultimate goal was to have a lab at a research-intensive institution so I thought the opportunity was worth the work. The PI was really helpful on this, and as I was working hard in my office, I didn't realize how bad things were. Once I came up for air and started worked on getting some data, I noticed the lab is largely non-functional and how completely disorganized the entire operation is. Suggestions on improve community in the lab and lab practices have been been brushed off. \n\nBetween this and the increasing anxiety I have about actually getting a PI position somewhere and how poorly academics have been treated during the pandemic, I am rapidly losing enthusiasm for benchwork. I'm miserable and broke because I spent all my money to move myself out here and there are no other postdoc positions in the vicinity I could take. Plus, my advisor is somewhat of a name and I think it would be hard to get a position elsewhere. At this point, I feel trapped, depressed, and lost. After talking to colleagues and friends who are either postdocs or have recently gotten faculty jobs, they agree that this isn't new postdoc transition issues or the post-PhD blues, this is a bad fit for me. I don't see the point in trying again elsewhere (not that I could afford to) and I'm looking at industry jobs and exploring my options with informational interviews. My question here is - how the hell do I communicate this to my advisor? We just put a proposal in, I have already been brushed off to many times, I don't want to burn this bridge...I'm scared. Anyone with a similar experience, I'd love to hear how you navigated this experience.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear about this situation. I'm a STEM PI, and have had a couple of PhD students leave for various personal reasons and misfits w/ the uni. Coming up I knew people dealing with similar problems around misaligned expectations and poor communicating PIs. Covid also makes things a lot worse because collaborations within the lab are really crucial, and people aren't able to get that.\n\n1st: Do give the PI this feedback. If not verbally, write a letter. Having a bad fit, especially during the pandemic, is not the end of the world, and we know these unfortunate things happen. What's worse (for everyone) is you persisting and being unhappy and unproductive, when being productive seems to really be what you want to be doing. \n\n2nd: The submitted proposal is also not a commitment. If anything, it's a professional product you generated which (hopefully) you can point to with pride. (Submitting the darn thing is typically the only thing to celebrate considering the acceptance rates....) \n\nLast: You got the job without this PI's rec, so you can get another one without their rec also. If you're worried they won't endorse you because you 'only' submitted a proposal, then don't ask for their rec, and be transparent with interviewers. (Transparent here doesn't mean flaming the lab for being disorganized--as that could provoke backlash--it just means being honest about the misfit with potential employers; your tale of carefully vetting the lab will show you're thoghtful and professionally responsible.)\n\nUnfortunately, idk if this is good advice for your situation. But hopefully it's useful. Best to you.",

              "text": "It's good advice  in addition, I think making this all about not burning a bridge is not a great way to manage this. How your PI responds is to a large extent beyond your control. Instead, focus on what would look like a good outcome for you, with the outcome(s) being things you can control eg getting another postdoc, moving to a city you like, working in an established lab with several postdocs etc. Also think about what actions you can take to minimise the damage to the project and your PI and help with any transition.\n\nBe polite, respectful and transparent (up to a point) with your PI and if they can't reciprocate that that's on them. You cannot reason someone out of unreasonableness. \n\nLastly, I usually hate corporate mantra bollocks but I saw something the other day about how we settle for unhealthy peace because we're scared of healthy conflict. It's a bit twee but I liked how it turns around the message that all conflict is bad and how we end up in very unsatisfactory situations just to avoid speaking up.",

I would not follow any advice of people telling you to just leave or to tell your PI to his face that you want to leave. This is easy to say when it is not your ass on the line. If you are certain that you want to leave, first find someplace else to go before cutting the branch you are standing on. \n\nI will say that Covid really did mess up basically all cohorts and lab cultures. This is not your or your PIs fault really. This is something I feel like you could bring up to your PI since you could do so without blaming him. Say that the lab culture is not there because covid destroyed it. Tell him that you are very unhappy and depressed moving there to have no connections built and discuss how you could work together to build it. Depending on how s/he responds, you could use this as a springboard into the other ways you're dissatisfied.",

Depending on the history and culture of the group, they may simply ignore anyone who makes complaints but isn't willing to put their own time into fixing problems.\n\nAs far as the prof/group are concerned, you're still an unknown entitity without an established reputation for good judgement.  You're asking them to disrupt their group and do extra work in order to solve a problem they're not convinced exists.  If you want to see changes in lab procedures, ask for permission to make them, and take complete responsibility for creating and managing a solution . If techniques you want aren't yet established, be the person who establishes them.  Likewise, if you want to improve community in the lab, start doing it.  Organise social events, arrange a tea/coffee morning, or invite people to do things.  \n\nI get that you may be past this point for this job, and that's fair enough.

I wanted to share my experience of being in gradschool, in which when I arrived the entire management was in shambles and nobody cared about the students at all. We truly suffered in the hands of the staff which liked to delay our documents for no reason.\n\nWhat I did was in every opportunity that I had to voice out my opinion/suggestions on management, I went. I kid you not, I cried at one of the board meetings/audit while talking about how miserable the experience was for the students. Many students did not want to attend the meetings because we were all under scholarship and they were afraid that it would jeopardize their scholarship. I was among the few that showed up and I encouraged my friends to speak up against the previous management.\n\nIt was a long journey but after 2 years, the management was reorganized, there was a new head of department and things started turning much more organized. The students today cannot remotely understand the kind of struggles the previous students had to go through when I first came. Some didn't even graduate because of the issues we went through.\n\nToday, things are so much better and I still actively participate in board meetings and many of the gradschool initiatives because the management continuously needs feedback from the student. I will continue to participate until whenever I can because I know that change needs time, effort and a lot of commitment from both student and the management.\n\nIf you really think the place you are working in is worth to stay, commit to making a change.",

In most places I've seen, it would be so unacceptable and the PIs would be so offended because you attempt to change their system without getting asked for it. If we had managers or PIs with that vision and flexibility we wouldn't have these problems anyway.",

          "text": "This. I was only a PhD student but had a somewhat similar experience in my lab - it took me some time to realize that I have to actively shape and create the lab environment I'd like to work since there was no guidance or management from the PI at all. It is the hard way, for sure, but taking over more responsibility might also prepare you for a future role as PI, if that is what you'd like to do.",

          "text": "I think you have some valid concerns. I didn't want to make my post any more of a novel than it already was, so I didn't get into more of the details as perhaps I should have. I think there are a few things here to respond to.\n\n1) The suggestions I made were to have graduate students present their research in lab meetings to get me up to speed about what's going on in the lab, and to divide up tasks in the lab (e.g. making solutions, cleaning, etc) because it's largely unclear who is meant to do these things. I offered to make the list and help divide up tasks (offering to do many of the administrative tasks), and to help organize presentations. The PI admitted people not coming in to lab was an issue and that the lab culture was suffering, but didn't like these suggestions and insisted they couldn't tell anyone what to do. I have organized a happy hour and invited people to do things, and people are happy to show up and hang out, but it has done little to improve lab morale. Any changes I attempt to make won't stick if the PI doesn't get behind it, as they are the leader of the lab.\n\n2) My concern regarding the lack of established tasks was that I was told they were established, and feel misled. A lot of labwork is troubleshooting, I am fine with that I enjoy problem solving, but I was basically told I would be able to show up and get to work. That is definitely not the case. I'm certain this stems from poor communication, but that is certainly not a thing I can fix. I'm a self starter and enthusiastic about science, I established numerous techniques in my previous lab as a graduate student. But in that instance, the PI had my back.",
