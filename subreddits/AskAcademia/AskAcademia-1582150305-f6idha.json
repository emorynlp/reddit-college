  "title:": "I want to quit my PhD but I don't know how to tell my PI",
  "text": "TL/DR: mental health is suffering and I don't know how to tell my new PI that I want to leave the program.\n\nI am a first year grad student studying microbiology. I moved across the country for what I thought was my dream program. In a lot of ways it is, everyone is very nice & I've made a few solid friends & I am co-mentored by two PIs who are both very patient, kind and understanding. However, I hate it here. I have absolutely no interest in what I'm doing for my research or what I'm learning in classes. I miss my friends and my family and my boyfriend who are all thousands of miles away. I thought I wanted to do research forever, but I am 6 months in and already exhausted by the day to day work as well as the entire atmosphere around me. I spend my time day dreaming about doing literally anything else. I've developed a panic disorder and I have severe panic attacks multiple times a day, almost every day. The idea of doing this for 5-7 more years feels like staring down the barrel of a gun. I've ended up making multiple calls to my campus crisis center. I honestly don't know how no one has noticed that I spend every day on the verge of a breakdown. My therapist is recommending I take a medical leave of absence, but I know if I did I would never come back. I have basically decided that I need to get out, but I don't know how. \n\nI am fully funded for the next \\~18 months on a grant, after which I would apply for fellowships & such. I feel awful because by an unfortunate coincidence, I would be the fourth person to leave this specific project (all bc of personal circumstances, not the PI or the project itself). I also know that I was chosen for this position over other graduate students, meaning that by leaving I am wasting a year of my PIs' funding and leaving them with no one to work on this project, when they could have chosen a student that may have stayed the whole time. \n\nAs I said before, I am being co-mentored and they are both great people. I don't know how to even start this conversation. One of my PIs is also a very new faculty member and I have read that having a PhD student quit can negatively impact chances at grants & tenure. I really don't want to negatively impact my PIs' and I don't want to be the one who ends up sinking this project by leaving. I've barely even started on it. \n\nI am thinking about asking to change my degree objective to a masters so that I don't leave with nothing & maybe I could help wrap this project up while I am around. I don't know how well that conversation will go, or if its even possible since I only started in the fall of 2019 and am not very far along, technically still in my fourth rotation. \n\nIs there any advice on how I can start this conversation with my advisers without burning bridges? Is there a typical way people approach this gently & gracefully?",

It\u2019s normal to go through different stages of loving your new home to absolutely hating it before leveling out and adjusting.

If nothing else I hope it\u2019s comforting that it\u2019s normal to struggle when you move away from familiarity and your loved ones and give you a tool to think about if your experience falls into this temporary adjustment or if it\u2019s truly a serious mental health issue.

      "text": "A couple things:\n\n1. First and foremost, don't sacrifice your mental health towards the degree. Don't \"bite the bullet,\" don't \"power through.\" Yes, the first year of every single PhD program is brutal for everyone, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. As someone who never experienced severe anxiety before my own graduate program, I can say it absolutely produces that effect, even in people without a predisposition to it. But that kind of \"we're all fucked\" boot camp logic can actually **stop** people from seeking mental health counseling when they need it (after all, everyone in your cohort is stressed) and at the worst, it keeps people from making the right decisions for them. Don't hesitate to reach out to resources (sounds like you are, and that's awesome). And don't hesitate to leave if you realize that the grueling realities of graduate school aren't compatible with you being healthy or happy. \n\n2. What do you *want* to do? I stuck with my program because despite how fucking awful & hard & anxiety-inducing it was, I absolutely loved the project I was working on, and I loved the field I was in. Without those cornerstones - the steady knowledge that I loved this field, and I loved what I was doing - I never, ever would have continued through the shit. So I guess the best question might be: what kind of a project would be so cool, so fascinating to you, that it would be worth the difficulty of studying it for half a decade in painstaking detail? It's okay to not know yet (hell, I didn't find my dream project until year 3). But try to parse out a few different things... is it *this project* you hate? Is it *this field* you hate? Is it *academic work in general* you hate? \n\n(FWIW, saying yes to any or all of these is 100% okay and has zero bearing on your intelligence or ambition... but it's better to figure out which of these are the problem, early on in your program. I have friends who didn't figure out they hated academic research in general until their 3rd year. So good on you for identifying a major problem in your first year, and for considering possible routes if you decide to leave, like a Masters).",

              "text": "I agree with taking time off. I took two medical leaves during my PhD program. The first was during my 2nd semester due to a concussion. The second was a shorter leave of like 8 weeks for mental health reasons after my 4th year. I went back after my 2nd leave and finished within the year - even ahead of everyone else in my cohort despite my leaves. It was an awful time getting through the program. I\u2019m still on the market and some days I\u2019m not sure getting a PhD was worth it, but other days the skills I learned (really just about how to do pure research and think critically) have come in very handy just in every day life. Also - I met some of my now very best friends in my program. \n\nWith all that being said, when I was in my 20s - work, research, and school were my life. Now, I prioritize relationships and relaxing more. I\u2019m not even seeking tenure-track jobs because of this shift. So, it\u2019s ok if you need some time off or if your life goals/priorities have changed (if you leave tho, I\u2019d definitely do the leave of absence - just in case). But above all else - prioritize yourself and your health (physical and mental). Be selfish with this decision. Do not, I repeat, do NOT take anyone else\u2019s feelings or circumstances into consideration. PhD programs are toxic/difficult for all sorts of reasons. You need to do what\u2019s best for you. The rest will work itself out. Big hugs!",

What\u2019s most important is that you like what you\u2019re doing, and it seems like at least in undergrad you did like this. \n\nWhen I started my post doc, I also moved countries, alone, away from friends and family and I really struggled, ending up crying on my way to work everyday and contemplating suicide. What helped me was reaching out to the medical services available at the campus and actively working to improve my mental health. I bargained with myself that if, after 6 months of antidepressants, weekly therapy, focusing on my mental health and taking it a little easier on myself and in the lab, I was still in the same mental place that it would mean the situation was bad and not just my mental state, and if so, then I could leave knowing that it was the right decision. In the end, 2 years later I\u2019m still here and while I have my ups and downs I\u2019m glad I gave myself that chance to heal. But that is my story, your ending may involve moving back home to be happy. \n\nOne question to ask, have you put in any thought about what you\u2019d do if you leave your PhD? Back up plan?",

In such a conversation it would be appropriate to express your concerns about inconveniencing them/hindering their careers.\n\nIf they don't treat you well when you speak of your mental health, then that's good information to inform your decision on whether or not to leave.\n\nI recommend the leave of absence. You can always withdraw completely at the end of the leave if you're sure you don't want to go back. If you don't want to burn bridges, then the leave is a better choice. Even if you're sure that you don't want to go back, why not take the leave of absence, and thus keep the option open should you change your mind?  You might think differently at the end of six months. I took a year off from my PhD with no intention of returning, but at the end of the year, I went back.\n\nSwitching to a master's doesn't take you out of the situation that is giving you such difficulty, so I question that as an option.",

I'm not saying this will happen to you, but it's significant that it took time for this to happen. There seems less risk to going on academic (or medical) leave and more benefits, so I'd seriously consider that option.\n\nAs an aside, I also have panic disorder. It was as bad as yours 3 years ago, I was having attacks multiple times a day. I still have the disorder and am still in therapy, but I'm doing so much better than I was (thanks to time, self-help books, and a good therapist). I have a panic attack maybe once a month now and sometimes go months without one. When I do have attacks I can manage them and handle them and they are less intense. I just thought I'd say that because it would be comforting for me to have heard a few years ago.",

If they react negatively, that's exactly why you need to leave.\n\nYour PIs aren't incapable of being bad mentors, despite what you might believe inside. And as for burning bridges, one of the things I've had to learn is that trying to get everyone to like you is a recipe of letting a lot of harmful relationships fester in your life. Some bridges need to be burned, and the above is a good example of a test. Your PIs job is to be a mentor, not a slave-driver.",

Tired of not even having time to take the dog for a walk.  \n\nJust went back and had to make a few apologies but I am finding that I enjoy it again.  And I jabber found a way to better balance life and writing again.  Take some time off.  Get in a better place mentally.  You will be much happier.",

      "text": "I'm reading your description as implying that the program accepts undergrads into a PhD with a bonus masters degree?  \n\nI might feel a little burned if someone left after 6 months and I went out on a limb for them in some way, that's natural, but the nature of academic work is turnover and, if it was the 4th person hired for the position, it would be ridiculous not to anticipate that this could happen again.  That's how it goes.  For most people the university is just where they are for a few years in their career or their lives while they figure stuff out and they'll be somewhere else eventually.  Your PIs know this.  \n\nPoint being, if you're not interested in the research and you don't want to do this work in the future, that's not a choice, that's clarity.  You're saving everyone time in the long run, yourself included, by getting out of it now.  Now use that clarity to speak to your PIs about it.",

      "text": "I actually just went through a very similar situation and would be happy to chat more if you want to message me. Was just too burnt and and needed a break from the program to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nI would recommend talking to your PI or the graduate advisor to see what your options are for taking leaves or extended vacation. If you are overly exhausted and frustrated, start the conversation by saying that. They are your advisors and should want to help you through this. Things for you to consider might be how long of a break you think you might need and whether or not you want to get a masters before leaving just to have it in hand. If you think you just need a short break before doing your masters, maybe see if you can take extended vacation time, then get the masters,  then go on a leave of absence so that you can really rest up and re-evaluate your priorities while leaving the door open for you to come back if you so choose.\n\nThings that you may normally enjoy can feel like chores and cause anxiety when you're overstressed and burnt out. That's totally normal and you are valid to feel that way. The project can get put on hold; you are more important by far.",

These things take time.\n\nIf you can't/won't take some time off it's fine, just be honest and do what's best for you. There's no need to beat around the bush.  Write down what you want to say, review it, review it again and then go and talk to your PI.\n\nHowever if you can take a leave do so, that will ease the pressure and give you time to get better. If you feel the same way afterwards you can still quit.",
