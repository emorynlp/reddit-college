  "title:": "I think I've just failed my PhD",
  "text": "This is kind of my open letter to academia...\n\nMy PhD was tough. It started really well, full UK scholarship, amazing project, and enthusiasm to do amazing research and follow the dream career. \n\nThen something happened. Can't pinpoint where or when, but my mental health deteriorated rapidly. I started to be afraid of going to the lab, and everything crumbled from there.\n\nTwo intermissions to try to sort my health, a referral at the first Viva and major corrections on my second and I have just submitted corrections..\n\nI tried so hard to juggle the corrections with work, and I really doubt it was enough. \n\nI'm away from academia now, and even though I'm starting again I'm doing well in my new career. Still disappointed in myself though.\n\nOn the other hand, I've now done the final mic-drop on the (very personal) hell that became academia.\n\nTo those who managed to survive, you are in a wonderful industry where you get to be creative and use your unique view on the world to enhance the knowledge of the human population. I wish you all the best of success and all of the grants and papers your hearts desire.\n\nI'm not bitter of any of you, just a bit disappointed in myself. But hey that's life. Thanks academia, I've learned lots not only about my subject matter, but also about myself.",

You took control of your mental health, and frankly, that's so much more important than a degree. I need you to understand how utterly brave and strong that choice was. There are many of us didn't make that choice. I remember having a nervous breakdown 6 months before I defended, like on the brink of committing myself to a psych ward. If it hadn't been for a bit of luck and a kind committee member, I wouldn't have finished either. \n\nThe other thing I need you to understand is that Academia isn't the great answer. You can save the world without ever taking another foot on a campus. I wish you the best of all the world in your new career. And I don't know you at all, but I'm very proud of you.",

I feel so much more comfortable in my new role, which I've had for throughout the whole viva process. \n\nYou are absolutely correct that academia isn't the great answer. I still respect those who have managed it well and are being amazing scientists, but I'm not of that specific breed. \n\nThank you, I didn't mean for this to turn into a 'praise me' post, it was more of a rant because my feelings are incredibly mixed at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*no mental health issue is similar, unless you look in an extremely broad sense..",

Having worked in industry and academia, I know first-hand that neither one is \"better,\" they are just different career paths, with different advantages and disadvantages.  I know brilliant, successful people that never tried to earn a Ph.D., that tried and chose not to finish, that finished and chose to go into industry, and that finished and stayed in academia.  Leaving academia and going into something that works for you is absolutely not a failure, it is a success.  I'm not disappointed in you--nor in any of my students who chose a different path than I did (in fact, I have counseled some of them not to follow my path)--and you absolutely need not be disappointed in yourself.  If you are happy with where you are now, that's all that matters.",

My siblings and parent are all incredible successful in their lives, and it's amazing to see that if you work at it, regardless of intellectual ability, you can succeed.\n\nMy journey has been tough, and submitting a sub-par piece of work on the deadline is what's getting to me I think - even though preparing for my future is what blocked me from completing it fully. \n\nPositives are that I have some really valuable transferable skills, even without the formal qualification. I'm working towards developing this where I am at the moment and given (bar the last few weeks of stress leading up to the deadline) my mental state, I'm in such a better place.",

I mean, rather, I don't find any delight in your misfortune, but I love the relative neutrality and clearheadedness with which you've assessed your situation.\n\nYou had a tough path, but the fact that you made it to the end anyhow is a testament to the fact (yes, fact) that whatever actual path you end up taking from here, you've got what you need to see it through.\n\nMost who leave academia take years not to hold a grudge, if they're bitter. If they're prone to perfectionism or self-guilt, they take even longer to stop holding a grudge against themselves.\n\nYou, though? You're holding gratitude, subject expertise, and self-knowledge, which far outweigh the touch of wistfulness you're feeling at the moment. And you'll bring yourself where-ever you go, so the investment of your efforts won't go to waste whatever the case.\n\nRe: corrections: good luck! Usually committees want their students to succeed, so at least you have that working for you, which is nice :)",

So I take a deep breath and try to pace myself and go after my goals, some of which are academic, and some of which are occupational. But the important thing is to never feel bad about taking care of myself. Because that is more important, and comes prior to any other success anyway. So don\u2019t ever feel bad about leaving a life project if you need to address something more important with yourself.",
