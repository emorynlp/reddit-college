  "title:": "Strategies to Improve History Majors Recruitment (xposted to r/College)",
  "text": "For context: I've recently joined the History department faculty at a public university in the United States and have been tasked with creating a \"recruiting video\" to help attract students to the major. It wasn't an arbitrary request as I have some background in digital media production as well. I've done some reading and watched some YouTube lectures on some of the messages that appeal (which all fall somewhere on the spectrum of passion-skills-money) so I'm not completely clueless on how to tackle the project.\n\nFor Faculty and Administrators: Could you provide specific (or anecdotal) strategies that you've seen work? The collective experience in the subreddit may help enhance the video's production quality and content. Ultimately, I want to channel all of this input into a short, visually engaging message that might help convince students who are still on the fence to choose History as their field of study.\n\nFor Students: What messaging appeals directly to you? What factors contributed most heavily towards your decision to choose History as your major? How did you or your peers overcome the \"stigma\" associated with History (and the Humanities) as a degree that doesn't pay well?\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "I double majored in history and molecular biology at a large public university in the US. History was really my second major, and I don't think I would have ever considered majoring in history alone. I chose to add history because I loved my history classes and enjoyed researching and writing, but I always figured I would get a job based primarily off my science background. I ended up working in biomedical research and am now a med student. While I would argue my history major has helped me perform in these roles, I don't know that it really helped me get them in the first place.\n\nIn my experience, a huge chunk of the other history majors I talked to in my classes planned to go on to some other type of graduate or professional school after (usually law, but also MPA/MPP/international policy) or else peace corps/americorps/foreign service/military to make themselves employable. At the end of the day, we only need so many history professors.\n\nI  think the number one priority for recruiting students would be emphasizing the types of careers available to history majors. I would especially emphasize what recent outcomes look like for history majors from your institution. Obviously these can vary wildly; a history major coming out of Harvard could probably get a job on Wall Street or in a big consulting firm, whereas a history major coming out of no-name state and even some well-respected public universities and liberal arts schools may struggle to find employment requiring a college degree. \n\nI would say my generation of students and the generation behind me is increasingly aware that a college degree is no longer a guarantee of higher income potential. I know that those with college degrees still make higher lifetime net earning on average, but gone are the days where any degree that taught you general critical thinking/writing/research skills was a ticket to a well-paying job. I have a good number of friends who majored in history or other humanities at my school and elsewhere who now work in retail or the service industry. That is your real issue, and something that goes deeper than what can be solved in a recruitment video. Even if I love history and love the major, why should I choose it when the employment prospects in computer science or economics or even general business tend to be much better?",

              "text": "Agreed, but it's a big ask for most students unless you can really sell tangible ways it will benefit people's career options. Honestly my history major would not have been worth the extra work just from a practical standpoint, but I did it because I loved it and because I believe in being well-rounded academically, plus I already had some AP credits. Maybe adding a minor would be more feasible in general and still a selling point.",

      "text": "I know this isn't quite your task, but something that has worked well for us is building up relationships with advisors in other departments that would make sense for a double major, or for one of their majors to pick up a minor in our department. The way the college core requirements interact with our major/minor requirements is a little complicated (in general they can use one of our classes to count for both a gen ed requirement and a m/m requirement, with the exception that no 100-level class can count for the m/m). Our chair does some search in our student management system every semester to find students who have taken >3 classes in our department but aren't majors/minors. When he reaches out to them, most of them don't realize that they could get a minor with only a few extra classes, and some have actually been told by their advisors that this is impossible because they don't understand that we accept classes for the m/m that are also being used for the core.",
