  "title:": "Just got tenure. Want to let my gender fluidity come out in professional environments. What do you think?",
  "text": "I'd like to let my gender fluidity be present at work, but I am  hesitant. I'm not in gender studies or similar, and it will be a surprise for most. \n\nDo I send an email to the faculty? Do I explain \"gender\" to students the first day of class even though it has nothing to do with the class? I'd definitely keep my clothes professional but I'm a 35 y.o. dude, and while teaching or presenting in a conference as my authentic self sounds exhilarating, I know it's an image I can't take back--especially if it's one of those 300-student survey. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone has any related experiences or feedback. Would you care if a male professor in your department suddenly would show up here and there in feminine clothing? Hesitant to see him/her representing the department?",

But, it depends on your community. We have a pretty supportive community. The people you\u2019re sending it to partly determine whether it is appropriate to do so.",

Another is keeping your discussions focused on work. If someone does something that violates those duties, you can usually bring it up with a third party.\n\nRequesting certain pronouns is perfectly reasonable. Dressing in clothing that makes you feel comfortable is totally reasonable. Even contacting colleagues to inform them of a transition is reasonable.\n\nNot doing those things is also reasonable. I belong to a minority, heavily persecuted religion. Have I ever brought it up in a faculty meeting? No, because it isn't relevant.\n\nLikewise it's up to gender minorities to decide for themselves how to handle whether to inform colleagues. No one is \"negated\" by chosing to keep it personal.",

Perhaps it is a better place than where I live, a bastion of pure equality, free of all judgment.\n\nI live in the United States, though. This country - from the deep red states to the bright blue ones - has a LONG history of not being super kind and peaceable to minorities, and that extends to the workplace.  There are still 27 states in the union that do not have *any* protections at all for LGBTQ people in the workplace. That's more than half of the states in the United States. Someone in Georgia or Texas or Louisiana can *legally fire* a person for dressing in a way that doesn't cohere with their outward gender presentation. That's legal, and it's still happening - [there's a case going to the Supreme Court](https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/8/21251746/aimee-stephens-trans-supreme-court-health) and it will be *the first* Supreme Court case on trans rights. In 2020.\n\nThe above post feels like it's negating minorities because the writer of the comment literally said \"I hate it when people in my department do this kind of stuff\" - with \"kind of stuff\" in this case referring to someone sharing their information about their gender identity with their colleagues. They then followed it with \"like, no one cares about your sexuality, gender identity, etc.\" as if that was not a demonstrably false statement (both by social science standards and by just-watch-reality standards). It reeks of the \"colorblind\"-esque narrative that many people have been fed - why do you have to talk about your minority status? If you just stay quiet and don't talk about it, no one will care...or notice!\n\nThat's not progressive. Progressive is when someone *can* talk about something that is as important to them as their gender fluidity and the people around them are supportive - not when we all just look the other way and don't say anything about it at all.\n\nOf course we all have a professional duty to treat others with respect. But we have reams and reams of history showing that people don't always act perfectly and don't always treat each other with respect - and some of us (like gender fluid folks) are less likely to be treated with respect than others simply because of their gender identity and expression.\n\nI've worked both inside and outside of academia, and people in all the workplaces I've worked in have talked about a lot of other things besides work - what they did over the weekend, the cool movie they watched together with their spouse, the new cross-stitch hobby they've picked up or a variety of other things.",

                          "text": "No, your original comment really is naive, and this one only doubles down on the naivety.\n\nI've been in several different academic settings, and I think there's this myth that academics are elevated or progressive people who are \"above\" all this identity stuff and only care about your merit. But that's not true, and it's *never* been true. There are reasons why it's so difficult to diversify the faculty and administration of universities, and it's not just \"pipeline problems!\"\n\nPeople have written about the challenges of trans academics, and there is lots of writing from minority academics in general about some of the challenges and difficulties they often face *from their own peers* in the academy. There is also quite a bit of social science on it, showing that discrimination in academic contexts is still very much a thing that happens. Academia is not magical; it doesn't exist in a vacuum outside of the rest of the world.\n\nI've seen several people say that sending an email like this is \"inappropriate\" and \"unprofessional\", but I strongly disagree. In both the academic and non-academic environments in which I've worked, people have used departmental email to send all kinds of mundane, non-work-related things - organizing a baby shower for a colleague, announcing someone's impending wedding, birthday celebrations for people. I don't see why this is any different from that, especially if OP thinks it'll cut down on the amount of awkward first conversations he'll have with his teammates. It depends on the norms of your department.\n\nYour analogies/comparisons are all pretty terrible. Having a mental illness or being Mexican and looking white are not comparable to the ways which people express gender. For one thing, in most states in the U.S. you can't legally get fired for being Mexican or having a mental illness - but you can get fired for being a man dressed as a woman at work. For another, neither of those would be things that are advantageous to disclose, whereas disclosing one's gender fluidity might. Just because they're all personal attributes of a person does not mean they are comparable.\n\nI am also not sure how clearly you read the original post, because you said \"unless OP plans to change how they present (I.e., look or dress) having that knowledge will also not impact OP professionally or socially in the work environment whatsoever\" but the OP says in his post that he's wondering what people will think of a male professor occasionally dresses in a feminine style.",

We would love to live in an ideal world where it doesn't matter, and it *shouldn't* matter. But it does matter, and people do care: there's a *mountain* of social science evidence that shows both interpersonal and systemic biases against people with non-gender-conforming identities and expressions. We don't live in a post-gender society anymore than we live in a post-racial one. People are still getting fired for being transgender or choosing to express their gender identity in non-conforming ways. Pretending not to notice this kind of thing does not help.",

Some students find it boring or annoying but for others it makes them less anxious about emailing me or helps them learn how to communicate more professionally. OP could just add a sentence or two about preferred pronouns to that kind of discussion. Frankly, that's good preparation for entering the workforce, too - you don't know who you future coworkers will be and it's always good to know the proper etiquette (indeed, familiarity with the proper etiquette is what makes it not a big deal when gender stuff comes up at work, because you know what's going on and how to deal with it).",

I especially think it is awesome in OP\u2019s case, where they are setting an example of an openly non-binary professor in academia. \n\nAlso, at the end of the day, what does it hurt to take a minute to bring this up at the beginning of the semester?",

If your situation is unexpected and it's going to come up it's probably best to head it off.\n\nI know it's not the same at all, but as an example that follows this principle, I have a professor who HATES being called Dr. or Professor.

So you might work on ways to let your students know what pronouns / forms of address you prefer (maybe put them discreetly in your email sig, if you're at the kind of university where that wouldn't be too unusual).\n\nYou might get some students gossiping about you, because students love to gossip about their profs, but that's about it.\n\nSpeaking as a former instructor, students are anxious little bunnies and the more you model 'this is not a big deal' and clue them in on things they might be worrying about like forms of address, the less stress will result on all sides.\n\nIf you're planning to change your presentation massively and worry about stress it might cause you, or think you could use professional support, you could maybe arrange a chat with HR or a staff support service in advance in the unlikely event you run into harassment.",

After discussing with some of the people I worked with in the department, the timeline was basically first taking to the head of the department/their supervisors, then a program faculty/staff wide communication was made (first at a program meeting and then an email to catch the others). The transition was initially timed during summer, so basically the next year it became all the new students ever knew, and announcements were made by the person to returning students. My school has moved to a lot of inclusivity measures so almost every first day of class we covered everyone\u2019s preferred pronouns and such. I think the hardest part is making sure you have colleagues and supervisors who are supportive. Students acclimate fairly well, and without incident. This obviously isn\u2019t exactly the same as your situation, but is an over all example of that level of change\n\nEdited to add: I don\u2019t think you need a mass email to tell people anything unless you need them to identify you differently via pronouns etc.",

You can add an email signature saying your preferred pronouns. Those are all reasonably professional. Other professors involved in that group may be a good source of advice for you. \n\nI'd leave it at that. \n\nAs for clothing choice, you can probably move the line a little bit. Don't wear a dress with makeup on your first go, or at all (some female professors won't even do that!). But maybe you can adapt some slightly more feminine (\"professional\" feminine) clothes, maybe a nice/simple/solid color cardigan, dress pants from the women's section, a small delicate necklace, maybe an earring here or there. Find a balance that suits you, but avoid being ostentatious.

How have your coworkers reacted to similar situations? How focused is your institution on diversity and inclusion initiatives? Are there communities on campus you could reach out to? \n\nI'm a grad student in STEM and we have trans and gender fluid students and staff. The community has been mostly supportive as far as I've seen, or at least just treating them like everyone else. However, just be aware that all people are definitely judged on their clothing. Even though academia here is pretty casual, I notice that female students who wear yoga pants every day are not taken quite as seriously and I have never, ever seen my female professors wear anything less than business casual, whereas male students often walk around in basketball shorts and male professors can wear jeans and a T-shirt. \n\nThere are definitely double standards and the female side is judged more harshly. It's much less of a deal for a woman to wear androgynous/masculine business attire than for a man to wear a dress. That said, floral or feminine work shirts are super in and that would be easy to pull off.",

      "text": "Congratulations on getting tenure.  \n\nI have some pretty up close and personal experience with a similar situation.  Your gender is an important part of who you are and you should be comfortable being who you are.  That said, I would not recommend mass-emailing people, nor would I recommend spending time \"explaining gender\" during your introduction in class.  How you go about sharing this information and the opportunity you give people to respond (or not) and \\*your\\* response to their response (or non-response) all matter. This isn't about making other people feel comfortable, it's about maintaining the norms of the professional environment which you have earned a position in...you are expected to uphold those norms.\n\nFor me, the litmus test is to take out all the gender-specifics of the situation and ask if the email or introduction still makes sense and it would still be okay to send it (e.g. to your students).  \n\n* For example, a first-day-of-class intro: \"Hi, my name is \\[name\\] and my pronouns are \\[pronouns\\], I identify as \\[gender\\]. I have a PhD in Cookie Ecology and Economics from Univ of X and my research focuses on Z.\" Depending on the university, course, dept, you may also have a brief personal bio: \"My wife/husband/partner/boyfriend/girlfriend and I have 17 dogs.\"  Totally cool in my book, but maybe don't get any more dogs.\n* Pronouns in your email signature? Pretty common, I encourage it.\n* Relevant poster on your office door (e.g. for a campus support group)? Do it.\n* Pronoun \\[e.g. They/them\\] badge on your bag strap or lapel pin? Rock on.\n* Wearing professional attire (of a type commonly associated with either/neither gender)? Totally cool!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do I explain \"gender\" to students the first day of class even though it has nothing to do with the class?\n\nPlease don't. Because as you pointed out, it has nothing to do with class.  Lots of things are important, and should be discussed in society, and there's value in discussing them, but an unrelated class is not the time nor the place.  Would you spend time discussing safe sex, consent, emotional labor inequality, the ongoing legacy of Jim Crow laws, etc?  You probably wouldn't...because they're not relevant to class.  These topics are **important**. Your students **should** know about them. You could spend an entire semester on any one and not scratch the surface, and suddenly realize you didn't cover your curriculum. Your role is not to explain them to students and prompt discussion (unless of course, you're teaching about them...), and the importance alone of a topic is not sufficient to take time, unprompted, away from the course material that students are *paying you* to teach.\n\n*Introducing* yourself is great, and feel free to include your gender fluidity.  *Explaining* gender fluidity would be unprofessional in my opinion.",

      "text": "My University has made it totally unremarkable to include pronouns in an email signature. Pretty much everyone has their pronouns with their contact info, and it gets much of the info you want out. It sets up a healthy norm of \"this is what is respectful for me,\" and does so without conflict.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to address your gender identity, maybe include it on your personal page of your website. Gender and sexual minorities are often underappreciated or underrepresented in academia, so taking time to put \"hey, this is who I am\" on your page would be awesome, especially with links to definitions or resources. You can also say, \"hey, if you have questions, talk to me - I'm here to chat as long as you respect that this is who I am.\"\n\nAs for personal dress, just wear what is professional and affirming for you. To play off of stereotypes, it doesn't matter if you wear a dress one day and a suit the next, as long as you're dressing in a professional manner, you'll be fine. Folx will probably ask questions if you jump back and forth between gender-presentation extremes (not judging), but that gives you the chance to answer their queries in person. It's more professional to answer questions that individuals have  rather than just address it en masse. It makes it a conversation instead of, \"look at me!\"\n\nGood luck and best wishes!

Damn, that's impressive. \n\n>Would you care if a male professor in your department suddenly would show up here and there in feminine clothing? \n\nNo, I would think it was cool. I can imagine one or two students and faculty making some comments, but that would probably get shut down easily enough. This does depend on where you live, though. If it's a really conservative area, it might be less safe.\n\nI don't think you need to send a mass email or explain gender to your students. Just be clear about how you want to be addressed. It's getting more common these days for people to put their pronouns at the end of their emails. You could put it in your syllabus or just mention it briefly on the first day of classes. Even if you're using he/him pronouns, it still might be helpful to state that, since people might be unsure if you're expressing a more fluid gender.\n\n**One really important thing to consider is building a feminine or gender-fluid wardrobe that is** ***professional attire*****.** Even dressing as a cis woman in the professional sphere is a whole skill full of catch-22s. Just read up on what's appropriate for teachers to wear. A lot of people who weren't raised to dress femme never learned a lot of \"rules\" which are probably garbage rules anyway but still you should be aware of them and break them by choice.\n\nMy s.o. is a gender-fluid grad student. They wear nail polish and some prettier clothes (including women's-section heeled shoes) to lab sometimes and no one has said anything about it. They also wore a skirt to my (academia) work BBQ and no one said anything, even though they made a stink that I'm vegetarian. Then again, no one seems to care how grad students dress, anyway. But you have tenure so. My s.o.'s advisor wears socks and sandals every day (in a lab so open-toed shoes are a violation!) and a suit coat over a t-shirt and jeans (when he teaches). Then again, women are always held to a higher standard for clothing, and genderfluid people probably more so.\n\nIt sounds like this is important to you, so it's probably worth it to dress in a way that makes you feel like yourself.",

I acknowledge that I use they/he pronouns, and invite any questions to be emailed to me or touch base with me after class. I\u2019ve never had an issue (and I\u2019m at a large southern university) and have had students kind of just take my clothes/pronouns/etc in stride.",

      "text": "My university has quite a few gender fluid professors and other academic staff across many areas (GWSS, STEM, Library, etc).  I've never seen them directly address their fluidity other than letting everyone know their preferred pronouns.  It's pretty common that almost EVERY professor has their pronoun listed in their email signature too.  I've also never heard of students having issues with them.  My advice would be just do your thing and you might have to answer some questions here and there.",
