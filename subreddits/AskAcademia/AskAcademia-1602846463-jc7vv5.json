  "title:": "PhD students, how much of your time is spent on administrative tasks?",
  "text": "It's mentally exhausting. I keep track of my time, and I can see that over the past year and a half, 26% of my time was spent between meetings, preparing for meetings, filling out university and committee forms, and reading and writing emails. Is this normal? This is not including the time I spend preparing for classes and teaching either, so there are some weeks where I feel like I haven't actually worked on anything.\n\n\nThat's not to say that meetings are not productive - they're often necessary. I've just realized how long it takes to prepare for them, and of course that's something I need to work on. \n\n\nI'm just curious if people have more or less administrative stuff to do and whether it also feels like an added mental drain or whether it feels like something that is more integrated with your research as a whole.",

      "text": "Maybe this is just me, but I would not consider preparing for meetings and email correspondence with advisors to be administrative. Preparing for meetings allows you to  think about all your updates and distill them, communicate them clearly and solicit feedback. Advisors, committee members and even collaborators are busy people, if you do not invest sufficient time in communicating well with them, you fail to use them properly. This is very valuable skill, learned over time.\n\nThe rest of the stuff you describe (barring teaching) generally does not occupy much of my time, maybe \\~5% at most? It's true that when we teach, it can feel unproductive, but I encourage you to consider a different perspective: when I do research I'm often stuck and real progress comes sporadically, so teaching can actually make me feel productive: I've actually helped someone learn!",

          "text": "Emails and meeting preparation certainly can be administrative if they have become excessive to the point of inefficiency.  The question isn't whether these things could possibly be beneficial to the student, but whether they've become gratuitous.  If the advisor demands a polished presentation each week and carefully thought out emails, I could see why that could be considered a waste of time.\n\nWhen I was a graduate student my advisor spent some time abroad.  Whereas previously communication between us could be done in person in 20 minutes with some back and forth, I now had to write email updates on my progress that somehow anticipated that back-and-forth ahead of time.  The problem was that my advisor would harshly criticize the contents of these emails unless they were exactly right.  So everyone in my research group (postdocs and graduate students) would each spend a full day writing and responding to update emails to our advisor.  And this would happen once a week.  This was obviously a waste of time and definitely felt like an administrative task.  At some point you have to put your foot down and say this is obviously inefficient.",

But when I started mentoring junior students, I realized they were under-utilizing the time I allocated to help them by not distilling their updates and thinking about where they needed my input - this means we spend some of the meeting time figuring this out, so there is less time to actually help them.",

Minute per minute though, definitely over a quarter of my time lately has been spent on what you count as administrative items. Maybe up to half the time, if you include all the work I do to coordinate the resources I need to collect and analyze data. I actually enjoy the admin tasks more than the research haha, at least admin tasks don't come back underpowered and insignificant :(",
