  "title:": "Letter of Recommendation from Disgraced Professor",
  "text": "A friend of mine had a relatively famous professor write them a strong, glowing letter of recommendation. The professor was later fired, quite publicly, for allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nWith little time until their application deadline, they can't get another letter. Is it OK to submit a letter from such a person? \n\nWe're currently brainstorming what to do.\n\nEdit: thank you, everyone, for the guidance. The student is reaching out to a postdoc/visiting scientist from the fired PI's lab and a collaborator in the department (even though she didn't work too closely under them, the extenuating circumstances might lead to a letter).",

Or perhaps if the student is someone who the professor _has_ sexually harassed, but is choosing to keep quiet in exchange for a glowing letter? \n\nIn another example given by a user comparing it to Feynman's sexism or Einstein's choice of sexual partner, I would contend that it is entirely different - there is no _conflict of interest_ between what these people would say as recommendations of character or academic merit. On the other hand, if for example these public allegations were of the professor abusing his/her position, then there is such a conflict.\n\nWithout any details about this case, the best we can really do is recommend the OP /u/ff5a5f to go by their best judgement - see if there are any faculty willing to write letters instead, and if they think this is a good idea or not (somehow, I think this second part is equally as important - again, since all we know is that this is some area of STEM, it may very well be a field which doesn't care about these problems, or it may be a field which considers this incredibly not-so-good).",

As soon as Substitute Prof says yes, send that packet to them, don\u2019t waste any time.",
