  "text": "what departments should i contact or inquire with? im curious about \"delta 8\" thc that allegedly is derived from hemp. anyway, im also  thinking about a career change, possibly working somewhere that would allow me to study while managing a shift of biotech scientists and and technicians.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis could be totally unrealistic, i guess, but state schools are public institutions and im sure there are labs that arent being used with a GC or maybe even an nmr somewhere they might even be happy to let me use? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nproblem is i have no idea who to even contact. i dont even know the names of the departments i should contact the chairs of.  i havent been in school for a decade, and never did any research in school so im unfamiliar with the structure and culture. i just did labs on totally teaching dedicated equipment at a school without any research, i went private after graduation, and only spent a few years as a chemist. i loathe being exposed to hazardous stuff, yeah wasn't about to handle acids and reagents for like 20$ an hour, even rarely... reactions that produce chrlorine, fuck so many things about being a lab tech or chemist. pressurized vats... but im kind of rusty, too.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: need access to lab equipment for my own curiosity. an nmr is what i am hoping to use. id settle for a mass spec / gc.  who do i need to speak with? should i mention im thinking about pursing a graduate degree or taking some ala carte graduate level courses?",

      "text": "I'm very confused about what you're asking. Are you saying you think universities have NMR machines just laying about they're not using that you could just use to look at psychoactive compounds?\n\nI think the short answer is that I really doubt any university would allow a member of the public to use extremely valuable machines, unsupervised and not as part of an established program of research headed up by a PI. Furthermore, even in states where cannabis is legal, I would imagine the use of THC in research would be regulated. Not being an employee, would probably be a significant barrier to compliance with any regulation. \n\nIf you want to do some research in the chemistry of THC I suggest looking up chemistry departments in your local universities and approach a professor doing the kind of research you're interested in to see if they're taking volunteers. I honestly don't like your chances as I imagine any one doing research on THC will be extremely careful about who they take on. Likewise if you approach an NMR specialist with the suggestion of working on THC. A random member of the public, not in higher education who doesn't have a reason to be doing research on THC other than \"curiosity\" is likely to ring alarm bells.",

      "text": "If you're serious about this, as in you know you want to go to grad school for it, I'd recommend getting into some sort of post bac program. Your chemistry skills are likely pretty rusty at best. You could also try to find a job as a research assistant in someone's lab to build up your skills. You should also know that, supposing you do get into a grad program, you're going to be exposed to many toxic chemicals every day and you'll be making less than you would as a QC lab tech. Graduate stipends are typically in the $20k to $30k range of you even get one. A lot of people have to teach through grad school and they can sometimes make in the $15-$20k range.\n\nAs far as access to analytical equipment, that's not going to happen. No department anywhere is going to let you just use their NMR since they easily cost $1 million for machines that give really good resolution. Benchtop NMRs, which have lower resolution cost $25k-$150k. Mass spectrometers, which you're weirdly quick to dismiss, cost a minimum of $100,000 for a single quad. There is no way any university is going to just let some random dude use their equipment. They probably can't afford to replace it if you break it and it's unlikely you could afford it either.\n\nThere are some contract labs that do analytical chemistry specifically for the canabis industry. Your best bet is to contact one of them. But, it's likely that it's going to cost way more than you're anticipating, especially since you're just satiating your curiosity.\n\nMy real advice? Check the literature. It's likely that your curiosity has already struck someone else who has a serious chemistry background and published a paper on it.",

You can reach out to a professor who is doing research on this substance to ask them if they're looking for volunteers and pitch your research project, but that's a long shot too.",
