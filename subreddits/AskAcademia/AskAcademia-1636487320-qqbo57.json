  "text": "I am currently doing a PhD in what could equally count as physics or applied mathematics (depending on who you ask) and I was wondering as to how competitive it is exactly in academia post-PhD.\n\nI've heard a whole manner of people saying academia is insanely competitive, which does make me doubt I'll make it to a post-doc position/full-time career in academia. \n\nThank you",

      "text": "I'm not a physics person, but the challenge with applied math (or in my case stats) is always who you belong to. Are you going to be a physicist in a math department? A mathematician in a physics department? What will be your tenure home? If you're reasonably productive, it shouldn't be that hard to get a postdoc. But for a lot of applied people, they have an extra hurdle to TT positions to demonstrate that they are domain \"enough\" to have their courses make (ie have enough students to offer). So, for example, I teach a biostats class every semester, and I have two other classes that are my bread and butter. Biostats is required in the curriculum; it always fills. One is very much an applied stats, one is a biology class with some stats in it. They don't always fill, but they always make, so my department is happy.\n\nMy advice would be to think very clearly about what type of department you see yourself in. Not necessarily to choose right now, but to think about how you might contribute to a math department. How would you contribute to a physics department? And be able to articulate that clearly for search committees/postdoc PIs. When you can clearly explain what you want, it's easier for people to see how you fit in their vision of a department.",

          "text": "Similarly, think about what courses you want to end up teaching. There's a good chance that any academic position OP gets will involve teaching a lot of intro courses. Do you want to teach Calc I, or PreCalculus, nearly every semester? Would you rather teach an algebra-based physics course every semester?",

          "text": "Thanks for your reply. I'm only a first year student so I suppose I have some time before I decide exactly what niche I fit into. To be fair stats is also a big part of my work (nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, mathematical modelling of nonequilibrium systems etc).\n\nSo in terms of achieving a post-doc position (again assuming I manage to release a few papers throughout the PhD, attend conferences, teach etc), it's not just something that only the best PhD students can achieve? I expected that post-doc positions were only realistically an option for the best students who manage to achieve a lot throughout their doctorate \n\nCheers",

When I was a postdoc, I was appointed via biology fields and that's one in which you can be pretty mediocre and land a postdoc. I can't think of anyone in my cohort of applied biostats people who wanted a postdoc and didn't get one.",

      "text": "Most people I know who wanted a PhD position after undergrad got one, and most people I know who wanted a postdoc position still after that got one. After that is where it gets really tough. Each prof by the end of their career has probably trained at least 20 phd students depending on the size and structure of the lab, and a lot of them would quite like a professorship themselves, so every university professor position is oversubscribed at least ten to one. Every position is getting at least tens of good quality applications from good applicants who could fill the role.\n\nAt that point, it's not only about being good, willing to make sacrifices in your personal life and reasonably strategic in your professional choices, but luck - being in the right field with the right amount of experience and right network when a position opens up. There will be lots of good candidates left over who never find a position.\n\nAny professional moves you make post phd need to be quite strategic, considering not only aligning yourself to make good applications to TT positions, but also making sure you keep exit routes into industry positions open by making sure you have current skills in popular tools in coding etc.",

      "text": "Not sure about physics, but from what I've heard it's more competitive than applied math. Applied math is a good bit less competitive than many other fields, but can still be tough. Note that many universities have applied math depts separate from their math depts. If you're comfortable ending up at a lower ranked, teaching focused university, then your odds are pretty decent in math/applied math. \n\nAll of the above is in reference to TT faculty positions. Postdocs are not at all hard to come by in applied math.",

Just look at any university where you\u2019re thinking of applying and see how many real (i.e. not adjunct teaching) jobs they have openings for and how many students they push out. The ratio will most probably be on the order of 1 job per hundred graduates at best. The other 99 just wasted good 5-10 years of their lives for nothing.",
