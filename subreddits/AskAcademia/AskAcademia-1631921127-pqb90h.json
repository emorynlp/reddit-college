  "text": "Hello r/askacademia. I (undergraduate student) have been working as a teaching assistant for around a year, and my contract wasn't extended for this term. Now I am wondering if there would be any ethical concerns if I were to privately tutor some students in the course that I used to teach for money, as long as I didn't violate any academic integrity policies (I won't share the past exam or assignment materials, etc). What do you think? Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "No, should be a non-issue. As far as I know, the only ethical concerns are if (a) you are tutoring a student in a class you are TAing or grading for or (b) giving the student access to things like answers to homework or exams. Neither of which apply here. If you wanted to be extra cautious, you could contact the current instructor and just ask. I\u2019m sure they would give you the go-ahead.",
