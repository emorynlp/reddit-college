  "title:": "Publication in MDPI: Cells",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am finishing my Master's course in a few months and my advisor offered to publish our work in Cells (MDPI, IF:6.6). Apparently, he received an invitation to publish and by looking at the impact factor it seems to be a good chance to communicate our work to the wider scientific community. However, both of us are very suspicious of this journal to be predatory. I published one review article in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology and a few research articles as a co-author during my Master's degree. So if I accept publishing in this journal it will be my first research article as a first author. We thought it is good for my CV, but if the reputation of the journal is not good, I wonder will it actually be a bad idea to publish there. According to the posts made previously here and many articles on the internet this journal is somewhere in the gray zone, some articles being good and some not. From most of the comments it is hard to conclude whether it is worth publishing there.\n\nI wonder if anyone has any experience publishing in MDPI: Cells. It will be highly appreciated if you can share your thoughts and advice!",

As an employer, I don't like to see them on CVs because it shows a lack of professional maturity or awareness of the field.",
