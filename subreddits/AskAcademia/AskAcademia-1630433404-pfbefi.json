  "text": "I've been in academia for most of my working life. I did my bachelors, took a year off to volunteer in field ecology studies, went back for my masters in evolution, and then took a few years off to work as a bioinformatics help, and then went back for my phD. I feel like all along, I kind of knew academia wasn't for me? But not just academia, doing research wasn't really for me. I didn't have the burning drive or the vision, I didn't want to know the answer so badly, and my mental health throughout the whole time hasn't been great. But honestly  it's been so long, I kind of don't know how to feel about not doing research. It's basically what I've been training for my entire life. I know mentally that people do other jobs, and I'd never look down on people doing other jobs, but doing other jobs just feels like a step down. It feels like I'm not trying hard enough when I'm not doing research, and it's literally what every single person I know around me is doing (ok, not everyone, but everyone at work is). I feel like kind of a failure for not wanting to be a scientist, something that I genuninely wanted to do when I first started graduate school about a decade ago. But I think I tried, hard, to be that. I've been thinking about applying for FAS positions, and I think I could be good at it. I think I'm interested in the commercial and sales aspects of biotech, and I'm still interested in science in general, just not necessarily in the actual day to day making it work kind of way. I know it's not bad per se, but I feel so bad, like I've failed all my mentors throughout grad school who wouldn't want this path for me. I also worry that people would look down on me? Like again, I think it's in my head, but even though I could possibly attempt to rebrand myself as a data scientist or something, I feel like I just don't have the drive, and for some reason that really gets at my identity as a smart problem solver. did anyone else face a crisis in identity as they contemplate leaving academia? How did you resolve it? It's like a big scary chasm outside of academia and I feel like I'll possibly be very bad at it, but it's also exciting and I could also be really good right?",

I get my work done, I rather enjoy some parts of it, but am relatively unhappy. Much of it, I think, is my lab. There have been some personnel shifts in the last few years and now the lab (get ready for my ageism) is full of gen Z-ers who never take their headphones off. \n\n*in my day* (to be read crustily), the lab was a place for banter and silliness and joking around. It was great. Maybe our experiments would fail, but at least we could all laugh about it together, and then troubleshoot as well. \n\nThese days I may as well be the only person in the lab, even when there are 5-6 people there. If I try to start a conversation, the recipient has to take 10s to take off their headphones, which often also means de-gloving, and it just ends up not being worth it. I get it, I suppose, who wants to have banter with the 40yo dad when you're some 25yo schmuk? \n\nBut man, it makes work life depressing. \n\nSo I work from home most days, because I'm the main coder. Some days thats nice, others depressing. \n\nI think a change of pace would be a good thing for me. A very good thing. \n\nBUT BUT BUT.  I have such flexibility in my job right now. Many days I am taking off early to cart kids around; I can take time to just learn; etc. What other job has that sort of flexibility? Not corporate industry. So what to do? I keep my head down, do my work, and try to shake off the work depression when I \"go home\" at 430 or 5.",

Especially if you're not completely entry-level. In the private sector, the workload is usually pretty high, but there are fewer and fewer expectations now about office hours, how you manage your work-life balance, etc. In government, nobody does any fucking work. \n\nI see a lot of K-PhD people who have been sold a total bill of goods about \"job flexibility\" by boomer-generation parents and professors who are coming from 1950s job market priors. And they very much love their job flexibility while they're sprinting to the lab at 9 PM on a Saturday to check on their mold samples. What kind of bullshit Stockholm Syndrome is that??",

I work in the tech industry, where most of the companies and jobs have this kind of flexibility, and most of my friends in white-collar professional jobs have some degree of this level of flexibility.

I love research, always did, but I don\u2019t think academia allows (some of) us to do the research we truly care about because of time, politics, indexes, making tenure, etc and I\u2019ve felt miserable. In my first job, I was unhappy about pretty much everything. Politics, the new provost who denied everyone tenure, the bean counting metrics, and academics sitting around and only discussing things like citation counts and impact factors rather than anything of actual substance. Everyone looked down on everyone else and everyone was miserable. So I changed my job/field to a professional school field and believed things will get better. Turns out my new school has even more rigid dynamics. Bean counting to the max, nobody getting tenure, and even worse, nobody talks to anyone else except for the handful of full professors with power who tell you you are crap in your face. At least I had other assistant professors to occasionally grab a beer with in my first job\u2026here it\u2019s pure apathy\u2026(which I guess is still better than some other nightmare departments). We just had a face-to-face meeting first time in more than a year last week and nobody even bothered to ask how each other is doing. I mean, I seriously don\u2019t think I want to be surrounded by people like this for another 30 years. We sacrifice so much to be academics but don\u2019t even get the basic respect as human beings.

While I personally am super happy with my current life (assoc. prof), I can honestly say that I missed about a decade of life that all my friends enjoyed. That 10 years took a serious toll, and I am behind on all the normal life stuff, i.e. I only just had a kid and all my friends' youngest kids are like 7-10 years old.

Raises are meager, living standard is declining, and I will not be in the least bit surprised if tenure doesnt last my whole career.",

It was meant to be a joke but I think it has def some truth to it. \nMaybe start hanging out with people outside of academia, that might help you realize how priorities and professional identities vary. And your experience in academia is part of you but cannot be your whole identity.\nAlso forget about failing your mentors, there are not enough tenure track jobs for even 10% of PhDs. What are people suppose to do? If any mentor looks down on you, it means they are either pretentious or has no idea about current reality.",

I\u2019m at a startup which has its own learning curve and there have been hard times for sure and I still think it\u2019s better for me. It\u2019s faster paced, results focused and there are opportunities beyond the bench in operations, project management and more that will use the skills and knowledge you already have. I personally am interested in moving away from science altogether because I\u2019ve always been equally split between art and science. Since financially I can\u2019t do anything drastic, a company pays more and has more opportunities while I figure out what\u2019s next. There\u2019s much less of the martyr complex that\u2019s expected in academia, at least in my experience so you hav time and energy to pursue other things besides work.

You are quite prejudiced about other jobs and you see them as lesser than academia. I don't say this to be mean but because I think you're unhappy with the current situation but aren't going to be able to constructively move on before you make peace with the move. \n\nIf you can afford to I suggest getting some professional coaching. You can work through what kind of job might appeal to you and start setting yourself some goals about what success in a new career might look like (pay, vacation, linked to academia, linked to STEM, city you like etc). If you can't afford it, I suggest you try a decide what a good job would look like and work towards it. You need to switch out of the mindset that anything outside academia is a step down. \n\nSomething you might want to look at in terms of careers is tech transfer. It's a common sideways step for scientists and it's a job that combines a need for good scientific expertise with intellectual property and commercialisation strategies. It ultimately can pay quite well, while also being a job you can get into with relatively little experience and gives you a bunch of career opportunities. FWIW I think once you find a job you enjoy you'll wonder what the hell you were ever thinking.",

The next was guilt about not seeing my dissertation research through (fieldwork was done, but lots of lab processing left). Luckily my PI was very clear that figuring out how to get the leftover work done was HIS job, not mine. You don't owe anyone anything, except maaaybe a \"thanks for all the fish.\" Just think of all the cheap/free labor you've provided universities over the years \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude2c\n\nFor what it's worth, every professor I told said something along the lines of \"good for you\" and a number of them said they'd known people who were too scared to quit and spent some miserable couple of years trying to finish their PhD, or even got TT jobs, only to quit later. \n\nThere are PLENTY of careers out there that need smart problem solvers, and you don't have to have it all figured out tomorrow. Chances are if you've stuck it out this long, you've got some major skills that will help you anywhere- including resume-type skills (helllooo project management!), but also just plain effective working skills, like initiative and independent learning.\n\nAlso strong recommendation to find a therapist if you haven't already. The thing about guilt is it only works if you let it in.",

At the moment (with an arts degree), I am trying to get into the arts residency circuit itself, like doing residencies the whole year round. It also takes a lot of effort but at least I feel I am doing it for myself rather than some PI with the permanent contract. I have done residencies before but never saw it as a full-time job.

It is ok to treat this job as a job. \nMy story is the same:\nI accepted to do the PhD because I saw the opportunity to have a 3 years contract without worrying about to find a job. The PhD in STEM was brutal, with no training, no support, and a ridiculous amount of work. I was exhausted, I am exhausted. I gave to myself the opportunity to try a one-year postdoc. The story did not change: no training, no support, and a lot of mistakes. I failed it for them (PIs) because I was not interested in publishing papers or my priority was to enjoy my life during the weekend. I also consider my research very poor ( don't really like reading papers), and honestly, I am not so interested in discovering something special. I saw PI with retracted papers still applying for a professorship, and I worked with a well-known PI who just tried to submit a paper only based on western blot ( which I consider a very unreliable technique) on an IF: 30 journal because he put his editors \" friends\" on it as corresponding authors. I don't believe that academia produces good science. I enjoy doing experiments, and I am very good at working with animals, but not for the sake of science, probably because I like to \" play with things\". I was changing job at the end of the one year postdoc when my PI offered me a very well paid other 2 years postdoc. It was a matter of luck because he got a huge grant. Honestly, I just looked at the money. I started to avoid this toxic and workaholic environment. Once they asked me to work for free in a gap month between the two contracts for the \"sake of the project\", I told them that I was happy to delegate to someone else because I had personal things to do in that month. They were very disappointed, but it is a job for me. I need to take care of my mental health ( totally fucked up during the PhD).\nIn my big picture I will move to industry. \nDon't feel guilty.",
