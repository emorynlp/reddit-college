  "title:": "Thinking of Leaving PhD Program",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am thinking of leaving a PhD program in the social sciences that I just recently started. Having a career in academia has been my main goal for the past several years and it has become a big part of my identity. However, I have been thinking a lot about what academia practically has to offer. The reality of it is that my program is 5 years long. That means I'll still be making 20k when I'm in my thirties. After 5 years of working extremely hard for what is essentially minimum wage, I will have a shot at the academic job market. As you know, these jobs are absolutely not guaranteed, even if you work really hard to become a stand out candidate. And if, by some stroke of luck, I end up finding a TT job, I know that it will likely be in some random place in the US and I will not have the liberty of choosing where I live.\n\nThe program I am in is not super prestigious. The classes are fine, and I know that, if I worked really hard, I could stand out here. I am really starting to think all of this work might not be worth the sacrifice, but it is also difficult for me to leave, because it would feel like giving up on my dream of the past several years--a dream that I have spent tons of unpaid hours working towards through conferences, papers, etc. as an independent researcher before starting the program.\n\nAnyway, I was offered a spot in a fully-funded coding bootcamp and in order to start, I would have to quit the PhD pretty much right now. A career in tech seems so much better for my future: 1. jobs are MUCH easier to come by, 2. entry-level software jobs would be at least around 3x my current PhD \"salary,\" with the opportunity for even more salary growth as I become more senior, 3. I would probably be able to live wherever I wanted, since there are tech jobs everywhere and many of them are remote.\n\nWhat do you all think? I'm really leaning towards leaving the program and starting this bootcamp, but I'm having trouble going through with it because it feels like giving up on my dream. Thanks!",

I think it\u2019s good to have dreams, but at the end of the day academia it\u2019s just another industry and another job with its own pluses and minuses. And to be honest, the market is bad now and it\u2019s only going to get worse by the time you graduate in five years as universities and colleges continue to cut tenure track positions.\n\nYou seem young enough to be able to cultivate other kinds of dreams even if you leave academia. Whatever you decide to do, good luck.",

You could call it a sabbatical, or you could say that you need to do this in order to pursue your research goals. Programming is a fantastic skill to have, and it's incredibly more powerful when you can combine it with other interests/skills like your interest in social sciences. As a coder, having an area of expertise outside of writing software will make you incredibly valuable to the right people in either industry or academia. If I had a student who wanted to take time off to learn programming and then come back and use their new skills to do research, I'd welcome them with open arms.",

      "text": "A lot of PhD students seem to have an extremely romanticized idea about the life of the average professor. Now after working for a few years in a position that helps bridge community members to faculty and students to do community based research together I see things quite differently. I see a lot of unhappiness in my friends who have faculty positions and it\u2019s not just the adjunct people. Even many of those who have managed to get tenure are frazzled, overworked and not living a healthy, balanced life. If I were you I would move towards industry now because outside the university people don\u2019t really understand or value the PhD in the same way. Many will view you as overeducated and lacking \u201creal world\u201d experience by the time you finish your degree \u2026 which even if it\u2019s from a prestigious university realistically gives you lower odds in scoring a decent job at a university than you\u2019d have in getting into the NFL as a college athlete. And, do not view the time already spent in your program as wasted. You will have learned so much already that someday you will see the applicability of. Right now you\u2019re just in a rut and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. You got this. Follow what your gut is telling you.",

      "text": "Do the bootcamp.\n\nFirst, don't fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy. Yes, you put a lot of work into getting into a PhD program...but those costs are spent regardless of what you choose to do next. You can't get that time and energy back, and that's totally OK! What's important is what's ahead of you - what do *you* want to do next? What makes the most sense to you?\n\nI did finish the PhD and moved into tech after my PhD. I did my PhD in a save-the-world social sciences field, and I was a little uncertain about whether I'd be content working in tech. Long story short, I really love my job and haven't looked back for a single second. As you mentioned, there is a different kind of security in this field (particularly in software development roles): I'm pretty confident that at any point if I want to move on I can do whatever I want next, I live in a city I really like, and I make a lot of money (and that's really nice). You can get those benefits but without the opportunity cost of spending 5 more years in academia - 5 years you could be contributing to your 401(K), investing and saving, earning experience, and networking with people.\n\nLastly, I want to add that those fully-funded bootcamps are legit. There are mixed feelings about the paid ones within the industry - they really have mixed results, and many are cash cows. But fully-funded ones are usually funded in large part by tech companies who see it as an investment in their pipeline. Since they (or at least someone) has money on the line here, the alumni tend to get hired quickly - by those companies and other ones.\n\nAlso, a social scientist with coding skills can go a long way in the industry! UX engineer and design jobs are pretty common, and even if you go into a traditional SWE role, just understanding how humans actually work will give you a leg up on some of the other SWEs lol. I love them but (and actually, because) they have the rosiest of glasses on.",
