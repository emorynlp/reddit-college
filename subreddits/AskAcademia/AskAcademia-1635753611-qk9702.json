          "text": "> I think I\u2019d like to get back to school.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt is important to have a good answer to this question, and unless you are particularly well-off in life the answer almost always should be some form of \"to get into X career\". Grad school is not something one should do to take refuge from the \"real world\" while indulging in the unadulterated joy of learning, despite common public perception. It should be treated as career preparation and training; in that sense it is not unlike undergrad even though the education you receive is very different.\n\nGenerally if your goal is to get a Master's, particularly in this day and age a professional Master's or MBA, it is probably a viable option worth pursuing, as the investment is relatively little (usually 2-3 years at most) and the payoff in terms of career progression and financial gains are usually worthwhile or at worst about break-even.\n\nIf your goal is to get a PhD, however, you need to consider quite carefully. The progression is much longer (usually 4-6 years, but particularly in CS and similar fields it can be even longer) which means you are from a financial perspective \"wasting\" many years of prime time to earn money that can be invested towards the long-term future. This is not generally made up for by increased salary prospects compared to a Master's degree - you can certainly get paid well, but it is not often worth the 4-6+ years of being paid poorly (and *God forbid* you pay your own way through a PhD program!!). This means you really need to go in with a clear sense of what career you want to pursue and a commitment or clear sense that you won't be happy pursuing anything else. Note that while becoming a tenure-track faculty is perhaps the most common career goal, it is not a path with a high likelihood of success for the average PhD student as the academic job market has an overabundance of supply and not nearly enough demand (with demand being further deflated by administrators cutting tenure track jobs in favor of hiring cheap adjuncts - but this is a topic for another thread).\n\nIn your case, you're likely in a good spot because you have already made a good amount of money in the past few years and hopefully have managed it well, so the financial hit is partially mitigated. If you want to pursue a Master's and you have clear career aspirations it is likely to be worth it. However, while you're probably better off than many who pursue a PhD I would really only advise this if your heart is truly set on something very specific which requires that degree.",

      "text": "**Gap Year Before Grad School?**\n\nI'm in my last year of college and have been strongly considering taking a gap year since May aka 2nd semester of my 3rd year. I genuinely think I have everything I could need for being a good candidate for an MA program; research experience, I've done my time in field school, internships, and other on-campus jobs related to education. I also have a decent GPA (3.9) at the moment. \n\n  \nWith all of that being said, I am so seriously burnt out. I have an anxiety disorder that I've realized is exacerbated by school. During COVID when classes were online, I realized that I have felt insanely stressed out and have had weekly panic attacks since by 1st year of college. I am constantly worried about deadlines, doing well, etc. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be an overachiever out of fear. Don't get me wrong though, I have a genuine passion for anthropology. I have known I wanted to be an anthropologist since I was 16; I plan to go into archaeology and pursue a career in CRM. Its this passion that makes me think taking a year off would be fine; I know I'll come back to it because I love it, but right now I am not in a great mental space. I have been so out of touch with my personality and social life since I started college; I have great grades but not many strong friendships. COVID was devastating to me as a person who lived and breathed academia/being on campus 24/7, but it also made me realize how much I longed to have time for myself. The idea of relocating for grad school after I've spent the last year reconnecting with myself and building a support system doesn't feel right on a personal level. Sure I have the academic background, but how am I supposed to sustain that when I'm in an anxiety/depression spiral in a city I don't know? \n\n  \nThat turned into a very different rant/post than I intended it to be. But basically, I'm burnt out, extremely anxious, and want to take a break before grad school. If you have / know someone who did, what was that experience like? I know chances of getting an entry-level job related to anthro with just a BA are low, so I'm also curious about what kind of job(s) you/friend worked during your time off? Do you have any regrets?",

Professors aren't counselors, we're not trained to help you with your health (mental or physical.)

If you want some kind of alternative assessment, you need to go through the accommodations office. But if you're emailing to say \"I have anxiety so I'm not going to talk very much and I'm worried about class participation because of it,\" there isn't much your professor can really do. They can't say \"don't worry about it, you can just have that 10-15%\" because that would be unfair to your classmates. They can advise you to speak up more, but that might not be helpful to you.

We could pick from a list of questions what we wanted to write about for each. Around the midterm, I remember talking to some friends about the papers. Turns out, some of us were planning to answer the same questions. One of them had shared a good detail/information for answering one of the questions. When I went finally wrote my midterm papers, I thought about what my friend said and included it into one of my midterm papers. I wrote my finals papers on my own without talking to anyone this time (i think out of fear I apprehended my own academic integrity). The moment still bothers me and makes me feel like I shouldn't have earned my degree because of it. I'm wondering if this was considered cheating/plagiarism?",

So I've taken about 8 years of school at a community College (I've just taken one or two classes for a few semesters) and am finally looking into transferring to a state college. My question is, in regards to the academic status of \"freshman\" or \"sophomore\" etc, what do I put after the second year? I don't think I would put \"junior\" since it was still lower division classes, but then do I just keep putting \"sophomore\" for the rest also? TYIA",
