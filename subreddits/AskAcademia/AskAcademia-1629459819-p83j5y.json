  "title:": "What\u2019s the craziest shit that happened to you in academia? (Horror tales only)",
  "text": "Hi Reddit, I'm producing an episode on toxicity in academia for a podcast, and I've been making a compilation of the horror stories people have told me they've been through. There are the \"standard\" bully supervisor cases but also things like 100-hour working weeks, women feeling they have to give up motherhood to be successful academics, PIs blocking their post-docs from applying for their own grants and really sabotaging their careers, a case of someone stealing a colleague's work and them accusing THEM of plagiarism, people faking their results because they desperately need to publish to secure grants... Please tell me yours. But I thought I would start by sharing mine (sorry it got long):\n\nI got admitted into a super prestigious uni for my MPhil, of course I was over the moon. I had been doing research before somewhere else and had such a great time there, I loved being in the lab. Well, things were very different in my new place. You would've thought you were walking into a funeral when you walked through those lab doors. No one talked much, no one laughed, no one seemed happy. As a new student I didn't know where to find anything, and the lab technician had quit before I joined, so I went to ask things to the postdoc who was extremely rude and unpleasant from day 1. Me and the other new students felt awful when we had to ask her anything, but we needed some initial guidance to do our work that we weren't getting at all. Another student told me I shouldn't ask questions, \"that's how things were\" \\[red flag\\].\n\nWith the supervisor things were fine at the beginning because I just never saw him. I went home for Christmas and when I came back he started weekly meetings saying he was \"extremely worried\" I took that break. He then kept asking if I was sure I had \"what it takes\", constantly questioning my potential. I was lucky my experiments were working at the point and I knew I had pretty good results already despite what he said, otherwise I would have probably given up. He a few times suggested I should probably apply to get a less important sort of degree -what people get when they don't have enough for an MPhil-, or look for funds to change it to a PhD. Actually the MPhil student that started the year before was persuaded by him to change to a PhD because he said she wouldn't have enough to get an MPhil within that timeframe, so that poor woman got stuck 3 more years with the bastard. I was NOT going to fall into that trap, but there was just no way we wouldn't get impostor syndrome around that man.\n\nHe told me because I was an MPhil student I didn't have the \"luxury of time\" PhD students had, so I should be the first one in the lab and the last one to leave, and that he would work all weekend as well if he were me. I was thinking errr, surely it's proportionate, or does he want me to get a PhD within my fucking 12 months?! Anyway, I ignored his request because I had a life. My mentor who's a super accomplished researcher told me he would only be in lab from 9 to 5 and always got loads done, so I knew it was about the quality of time, not the quantity. There were experiments that did require me to be in lab for 12 hours, and I often had to go in on Sundays to get my samples ready to go on the Monday, but I find extremely important to have quality time out of the department. In fact the other events, talks and seminars I had access to within the uni were super valuable, and the network I built in my college was what kept me sane. \n\nEvery two to three months we were required to give a presentation in our lab meetings. To add some context, everyone was terrified when it was their turn. There was zero encouragement to the people presenting, no smiles, no nods, no claps at the end of the presentations (I had never seen that before). At my friend's lab her supervisor got champagne so everyone cheered the person who presented at the end! Well, not there. When I presented in the journal club the presentation wasn't what he expected, my nerves were high, I was probably rushing through so I was done within 40 minutes instead of the 60 minutes I was supposed to take. He was SHOUTING at me in the end. I can't remember what he said, I was in shock, but I had the feeling he was expecting me to cry and would go on and on verbally abusing me until he got what he wanted. But I didn't cry, I just stared at him super blas\u00e9, because it just felt so surreal what this guy was doing. I did feel embarrassed though cos everyone could probably hear everything outside his office.\n\nIt was soon my turn to present again, this time my own work. I prepared super well, the presentation was good, some of my colleagues told me afterwards I had done a pretty good job. My supervisor then comes and says I didn't seem very \"enthusiastic\" about my work, and no positive comments, never. And of course how did he expect anyone to sound enthusiastic in such a toxic environment. The anxiety we all felt before having to give these presentations because we were so scared of his reaction was unbelievable. 100% everyone left that lab mentally scarred. \n\nThere was a particular experiment that was quite tricky to get to work. I tried and failed several times and this man kept telling me it was such a simple thing, implying I was just super incompetent not to get it to work, so of course I was also feeling super on the edge about this. But I finally managed to make it to work, on and on, I mastered it. Fast-forward I was in a presentation of a PhD student who had just submitted her thesis, so she had been there for 4 years and she mentioned she NEVER got that method to work. So I started noticing it wasn't as straightforward as he implied. Then a couple of other students in my lab also got stuck with the experiment. What the supervisor made me feel awful about for weeks wasn't that easy and no one else there was getting it to work. He hadn't done bench work for 2 decades, these methods were quite new, and he himself never actually got any of it to work, but he was bullying his students over it. \n\nA second-year PhD student was the only one trying to speak out about it. She told her advisor about all the bullying -advisors are other professors in the department randomly allocated to each student so they have a person to go to who's not their supervisors-. The advisor went straight to our supervisor and told him everything she had said, so the supervisor only made her life there even more difficult (she eventually quit)!!! By the way, our supervisor was the head of the department, we just didn't know where to go, who to complain to. Every Friday we had our weekly meetings, I was constantly dreading it, Fridays became my nightmare. One of those Fridays the abuse was quite unbelievable again, so the following week I tried to record our meeting but then he just acted normal!\n\nIt got to a point in August I just couldn't get myself to walk into the lab again, though I had planned to run some final experiments. I just didn't have the strength anymore to see him, so I never went back. I never spoke to him again, I didn't respond to his e-mails. I worked on my dissertation, applied to my degree without his consent, got my viva, I passed. I got my MPhil. \n\nIt sounds like a happy ending but it wasn't. I don't think the degree was worth it, I would've been better off in a less prestigious institution that didn't have that toxic environment. It took me months, probably over a year to build back my confidence and recover my mental health, and trust me, confidence is just as important as competence. I completely ruled out a PhD, and I would never ask for his reference anyway which I thought was essential for me to get admitted into one. This has completely put me off academia. \n\nThe supervisor is still there, bullying people. He was supposed to retire the year after I left, but I found out he had recruited new PhD students, so I guess he wasn't planning on retiring at least in the next 4 years. Sometimes I google him hoping to see an obituary. So far, no luck.",

      "text": "My first MSc advisor treated us like human garbage, and would only call one (01) student by his name, instead of perjorative nicknames (the PhD who supervised me was called a cockroach by this advisor), because this single student came from the same uni as this shit advisor did his undergrad\n\nOh, he also tried to slap me in the face after I told him I was quitting because I did not want to work with him (I was funded, so I was ready to return all cash)\n\nFirst time on lab I broke an expensive glassware and cried in desperation because I was scared that he was going to find out. Nobody wanted or cared to help me, just told me to stop being a pussy and get it done.\n\nThis happened in the span of three (03) months. And this was from a young researcher, hired 2 years before all of this. He was around 33 or 34 if memory serves right\n\nAt least I had my revenge as I wrote a 6-page document telling every single thing that happened (including e-mails, voice recording and a video), and I went full head-on straight to our dean's office and every single \"social movement\" I could find (I'm a gay man from a poor area, dark skinned - do you see where this is going? Yes, exactly that). Every single person in our institute, from undergrad to all professors, heard about what happened. Next year he almost did the same with another student (coincidentally, another gay guy with dark skin), and I helped him do the \"revenge\". He spent 3 years without a single new grad student and not a single professor wants to work with him now.",

      "text": "IDK if it rates with the rawest horror stories on here, but my MA program was a real shitshow. Some really good people, lifelong friends, a few dedicated professors. But it was also a smaller, lower tier state school and a terminal masters. Very much designed to crank through teachers looking to get their continuing education pay bump. Some of the students and some of the profs reflected that in certain ways.\n\nThe first story: We had a student who was a bit.... eccentric. One day in a seminar we were discussing the relative merits of various kinds of sources and evidence. I suggested that some types might have inherent biases or inaccuracies that needed to be examined (and perhaps I was an MA student and didnt put it as delicately). The student tried to engage me in a headed debate. When I failed to become as impassioned as they were, they called me a \"fucking flatlander,\" in class! I dont know what that means, the university was located in a place that was flatter than where I come from, and I think they were a local. So that was confusing. \n\nThe second: On another occasion in a different class, another student had to give a rather long (30min?) presentation on an assigned subject. The presenter was clearly nervous to start, very uncomfortable with the idea of speaking in front of a class of \\~20 + the prof. About halfway through his presentation the prof abruptly excused herself and left for the bathroom. As soon as the door closed the eccentric student turned to the presenter and said \"So you think this is good, huh?\" and nothing else. No explanation, no suggestions, no encouragement, not even another kick. You could just watch the look on the presenters face change. By the time the prof returned, very quickly too, he was on the verge of breakdown. Couldn't even finish his presentation. Never before or since have I seen so few words, issued without further comment or explanation, so totally shattered another person. \n\nThe third: At the some university we had a prof who had went to an Ivy and was now teaching at a low-to-mid tier state school. They treated us as if our school was coddling us and we needed a taste of the harsh reality of academia. More to the point they seemed to think it was their job to weed out those unsuitable for a doctoral program. This prof was famous for making the majority of their students cry at least once during a semester, and in one semester while I was there allegedly made the entire class cry. I wasnt in the class so it I cant recount the details accurately, BUT the following semester I had a 1-on-1 seminar with them. During one meeting we stopped halfway and they told me \"I really dont think you belong in academia, perhaps you should explore alternate careers moving forward.\" And then ended the meeting early. To be entirely honest that was the one and only time anyone has really ever said that to me. This person was not my advisor and this was the only actual academic interaction wed ever had. Ive always been a little bitter about it. At the time I was just glad to have escaped a more serious lashing. But in hindsight I really think it was an inappropriate thing to say, and their constant need to tear down their students was very toxic. Still got my degree, now I'm writing my dissertation (or I would be, if I werent posting here....) so jokes on them I guess.",

Everything is so old that no one seems confident enough to change it, as though their shitty practices were listed buildings instead of crap pedagogy.\n\nI mean, we didn\u2019t even have the capacity to record lectures before COVID. My \u201cshitty\u201d, \u201clow-tier\u201d rural university in Australia had better student support and more modern teaching facilities with a tiny fraction of the funding. Plus we weren\u2019t expected to teach classes *physically inside our own homes* in Australia. \n\nEverything about the Oxbridge system makes abuse easier. Little-to-no oversight of anyone or anything, a bunch of weird and inappropriate traditions that can never be questioned, and the blending of personal and academic life to the point where you\u2019re having breakfast with your supervisor.",

I was only a lowly undergrad but the culture was similar. 20% of the students and professors were perfectly fine, if a little low key competitive. 60% were on a scale from mostly okay, but very passive aggressive to full-bore public school boy Bullingdon member. The last 20% were, well, you get the gist. The profs were a little better than the students I found, but broadly similar percentages. Most were just self-centred, and transparently more interested in their research than teaching, but a few were properly foul.\n\nOxbridge culture annoys me so much.

      "text": "I\u2019m in first year PhD, started during the pandemic, my first supervisor sadly passed away from a freak heart attack earlier this year (that\u2019s actually the real tragedy, I applied because of him). New supervisor changed my topic, gives ruthless feedback but provides no training. Belittles and talks over the other co-supervisors. I have done 20 drafts of chapter 1 and am not allowed to proceed and discuss the research questions (EVEN these) after 11 months. When I asked for training / workshops to improve, supervisor told me this is just part of the journey. Finally met their other supervisees in a group sharing, and noticed the same issue: supervisees that needed extra skills didn\u2019t make any progress, they\u2019re just left to drown without a template so some were worse than a GCSE-level presentation (not regarding language, but really couldn\u2019t present an argument). The ones who are already skilled excelled, which I think means the supervisor feels justified in their one-size-fits-all approach. I\u2019m quite pragmatic, I\u2019m giving it 1 more month and explicitly said lll get training elsewhere - and then suddenly the superviser said the struggle is normal (no RQs after a YEAR?!) and then said they had WRITTEN MY INTRODUCTION FOR ME because mine was so wrong. I have no problem saying I have skills gaps, but this was a total shock to me especially as other supervisors are very complementary of my learning, and I won a presentation on my work at a conference without the supervisors support. When I said the pandemic has been a struggle on the mental health, asked to discuss how we can all work together better, they refused to discuss in this meetings and said they\u2019re task-focused so the work wouldn\u2019t get done if they focused on emotion.\n\nHmm\u2026 writing this out makes me realise how unhappy I am.

              "text": "Doing the devil's advocate here. I think that you and your advisor are just on different emotional planes. My advisor never had scheduled regular meetings. When you need help, you write to him and you schedule an hour. If you don't write to him, it is by default assumed that you are working and doing just fine, and no one will check on yoy. Of course no additional training beyond math were provided, and I honestly think it wasn't his job anyways. But for me it was ok, because we had pretty compatible personalities and I could understand how he functions.\n\nFrom what you have told, it seems that you just have non-matching personalities. From your stories it does not seem that your advisor is abusive, just a bit negligent and not good with words, but not a crazy sadic as it sometimes happens. You should simply understand what you can get from that person and what you simply can't, and try to make the best of it.\n\nThe introduction story I think is a good example. In my experience, students write quite badly in the beginning, because they do not understand fully the context and what their readers know and don't know, and how to sell properly the result. But it comes with time. She just decided that it would be easier and quicker to write one page herself than do several revisions and meetings. You should not take it as an insult. Yes, you don't get a full insight on how to do it (which is bad), but you are very likely to have increased the chances of people actually reading and citing your paper (which is good). At the end you can not achieve an ideal situation with this person, but you both get an improved output.\n\nIt is good that you try to talk it out, because I feel that it is mostly a dogs and cats situation. Once you understand each other better and where are the limits, it will get smoother. On other had if you need additional soft skill training you could ask your HR, communication and research support offices. They often organise useful trainings and workshops, which in my experience, students ignore (because they are so busy, and work so hard and don't have extra 4-8 hours in a semester \ud83e\udd37). You can also organise a lot of things yourself, like journal clubs or starting a science blog.",

I also run training myself on coaching/mentoring relationships, leadership and management approaches, culture setting and team dynamics, MBTI and other personality type models in my teacher training work, with the purpose of improving self and teams. I tried to ask for these kind of open conversations, in a variety of ways. I emailed offering to change my approaches and asked for feedback how I could  work better with them/how they like to work. When I was really struggling, I emailed asking for help and was specific about requests eg I haven\u2019t met anyone on campus due to 17 months of lockdown in Malaysia, can I join an online working group?. The supervisor said no to the offers for conversations on this topic, only replies to emails where they mark drafts. The co-supervisor has now tried to arrange a meeting without me with this supervisor based on my request to discuss how to move things forward. Like you say, I think it\u2019s just a poor fit, and I\u2019m happy to give it one last go or just part ways. Learnt lots.\n\nAnyway. I reiterate I\u2019m genuinely glad you raised this because I have reached out to some of the other supervisees who appear to do well with this person. They are two, both in their third years, very experienced researchers who I hypothesise do not require as much support as I (but I can\u2019t be sure). I asked for advice and generally the response is work focus, good practitioner but not a teacher so best to get training elsewhere. \n\nFinally: Genuinely interesting to know that a supervisor writing my work isn\u2019t unusual? That\u2019s helpful, will have a think about this some more. I wasn\u2019t insulted that they may be pointing out I don\u2019t have the skills (I don\u2019t!) - I was more worried from an ethical point of view of taking work that\u2019s not mine.",

It was only during the phone interview when the PI heard that I didn't have an accent beyond my drawl. It's even dumber because he was also German Texan. He has an unofficial policy about students with English as a second language.\n\nFirst day I was in the lab, the PI yelled at a PhD student for getting a decimal point wrong in an experiment. He only stopped when she cried. The proteins we were using weren't even that rare-- we had dozens of vials and only used microliters at a time. He did the same to a student from another lab who I was helping train on an instrument.\n\nI was told that if I didn't stop going home every other weekend, I wouldn't graduate on time. I was already working between 36-50 hours a week in the lab, depending on my teaching schedule, plus weekends if an experiment demanded. He said this to me on a Monday, after I had spent the weekend doing an experiment. I left the following week.\n\nI was asked to do an experiment I had never done before using an instrument I was unfamiliar with. When I said I didn't know how but was willing to learn, he said he didn't have time to show me. When he couldn't get the experiment to work, he threw a crystal cuvette full of biological samples at the bench so hard it shattered, and shards covered in bacteria-laden broth went everywhere, including on me.",

              "text": "Yes, I did leave, but it was still a precarious situation. I knew pretty early on the University would choose his side over mine, as he's been doing this for decades and has had people leave before. His reduced teaching load wasn't because he was a good researcher (though he actually was), it was because he couldn't interact with the undergraduates in a constructive way, and rumor had it, had actually had an affair with a student at one point leading to his divorce.\n\nFirst, I went to the graduate advisors just to see if it were possible to leave, given my commitments and schedule. They referred me to the Chair, who was a great guy who was good at his job, and didn't want to see me just leave the research program. He had me schedule appointments to speak with other PIs, on the basis that I was actually a productive researcher with pedigree and publication history. The other research groups were honestly great, just not in my wheelhouse. I ended up doing something more industrial-focused under the Chair as non-thesis. It let me overlap my studies with business, getting me a shot at an MBA in two semesters. That situation turned out way better than it could have.\n\nI was technically still enrolled in the graduate research internship so had to finish out the hours. That part was actually fine-- the last month of the internship I was to draft a summary of my research in the lab and submit my notebook, as well as suggest a direction for the lab to take through a review style paper and experimental protocol. My abusive PI actually loved it, and I believe attempted it after I left, though I don't know to how much success.  18 months later he got his magnum opus published in Microbiology, and I've always had a sneaking suspicion it was with my samples, data, and images since I had (likely) obtained crystal-quality protein, at least the purest the lab had seen, at the time of my exit, and he had my notebook. Nothing I could've done there though.",

      "text": "I've got some [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/5epdqw/pi_horror_stories/dae691z/) but to add to that --\n\n----\n\nFriend's PhD advisor was of the opinion that if you needed more than 4 hours of sleep each night, you weren't cut out for a career in science. He demanded long hours from everyone, including the undergrads. Many many problems with him, but we'll focus on his abuse of undergrads: \n\n1.) He constantly complained to the undergrad research coordinator that the undergrads' courses were getting in the way of doing research. He spent many hours each quarter arguing with the coordinator about what undergrad priorities should be and complaining about how insufficient the program was at preparing the students for a career in science. The coordinator was steadfast in the stance that their courses came first. \n\n2.) One of the undergrads lined up a summer research opportunity at a prestige east coast lab. He started drilling into her his \"if you need more than 4 hours of sleep\" philosophy and emphasized how important it was for her to make a good impression in the lab. She left for her summer internship. 2 weeks later she was found unconscious in the lab and rushed to the hospital where she was basically treated for exhaustion. She literally worked herself to a point of collapse. After treatment, she was sent home from the program. Upon return to her university, she wanted to re-enter the lab and continue doing research, but the PI told her that she was clearly unfit for science and to not come back. \n\nKarma bit him in the ass though. He had a progressive congenital condition and ended up on an organ transplant list. His doctors urged him to get rest and cut back at work for medical reasons. But he claimed that \"MDs don't know anything\" and \"they're trying to sabotage my work\". He returned from a conference, checked into the hospital to get a blood transfusion, and within 24 hours was septic with multiple organ failure and he died a few days later. We always say he worked himself to death. \n\n---\n\nI also have a story of a nightmare PhD student that I'll try and summarize: \n\nGenerally, she refused to do work during weekdays and on the few weekends we had to meet to train her in a technique she was intolerably rude and upset. We weren't sure she was a good fit for our group or the work we were doing based on many things. But anyway, what kicked things off was...\n\nOur PI personally witnessed her being mean and condescending to others in the lab. And when our PI came into the lab to schedule a meeting with her to discuss productivity and the actions she personally witnessed, we informed her that the student was on vacation for a week. (FYI, the vacation wasn't an issue, it was the lack of communication/notice.) When the PI sent her an email regarding her absence and the actions the PI witnessed, the student responded by blowing up my phone (and my coworkers' phones) accusing us of throwing her under the bus and utterly humiliating her when she couldn't defend herself and thus ruining her vacation.\n\nUpon her return there was a \"last chance\" project given to her - complete a small amount of work in a 3 month period. I had to supervise her for this. I told her literally any day or time in that period would work. She set a day and time and our PI sent out weekly reminders. Then one week before she sent an angry and accusatory email to me to the tune of \"WTF is this project that I'm hearing of for the first time? Why am I being asked to do YOUR work?\" I replied citing previous emails and looped in our PI, who responded with more or less \"do it or you're out\". \n\nWhat happened next was kind of hilarious in hindsight. We met up to do the work, I helped her, she was polite and professional, and at the end of the day I sent my PI an email about her skills and behavior. I didn't really like her after everything, but to be fair to her and her future prospects, I had honest praise and spoke well of her.\n\n*However,* later that night the nightmare student sent our PI an email boiling down to \"I'm not doing X tomorrow, find someone else to do it\" at about 10pm on a Saturday. From my PI I heard that she said \"If you don't do it, you're out\" and the student replied with something completely out of line that lowkey implied our PI wasn't doing her job. Which resulted in her getting kicked out of the lab. \n\nSome months later she sued the university and the lawyers asked us to write statements and turn over anything related to our decision to boot her from the lab. I had literally pages of emails and phone texts and my statement was 5 pages long. Later we heard it had been dropped. And after that we heard that the lawsuit alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nOh, and said student also made waves in the department by sending an email to the department listserv attempting to call out one of the profs for a poorly designed course and badly written exam. The prof's response was utterly savage.",

However, she quickly became disappointed with the postdoc - poor work quality and she was bullying others in the lab and making others miserable. \n\nPI didn't like any of that and after a few months of trying to make things work, gave her the required notice that she would not be renewing the postdoc's contract at the end of her first year. The postdoc broke down begging and pleading for a short term extension. After a lot of tears and some negotiations, they had a \"handshake deal\": PI would renew the contract but the postdoc would resign at a certain date a few months down the line. \n\nExcept the postdoc had no intention of leaving. When asked for her resignation letter she filed complaints with HR and the newly formed postdoc union. She prevailed and got to stick around for the entirety of that second year and made everyone else absolutely miserable. \n\nMy former PI says that the lesson learned is to not make handshake deals and not hire friends.",

      "text": "I was accepted with a full ride for PhD in Literature, with a known emphasis on British Victorian. What was also known, though not disclosed to me until I was already there for 2 months, was that the only Vict. faculty member was retiring that semester and wouldn't be replaced. I would have to change my area. \n\nSo I did. I changed it to WWI. I chose my committee based on who was available and had some clue what I was talking about tho none was an expert. My director was also Chair of the Department at the time. He was old school, like myself more concerned with the historiographical and socioeconomic/cultural side of things, the other two were theorists: but they all approved of working together, my topic, my proposal, etc. \n\nI was funded for 2 years of writing and was awarded another on merit, so it was a total of 5 years, 3 for writing, and I was on track. My Director didn't believe in sending out drafts as we went; he waited until I had a full version ready for what's called \"Pre Defense.\" The committee members, 3 from dept, 1 outside, 1 arbitrator, get a draft and have 10 days to read and prepare before a private meeting where they decide, without the student present, whether it is ready for final draft and oral defense, last step to graduate; or revisions. It's supposed to be a simple yes or no vote, usually a formality: a Director doesn't call for the pre-defense unless they know their student's draft is almost perfect. \n\nNow, a couple things to note here. \n1) My director, who's also Chair remember, got another student to direct who was a year behind me but who finished before I ever would. That's because said student was a disciple of gospel of Hemingway, same as Director, and these two good ol boys spent hours in each other's company. Ideas flowed freely. Books and favors exchanged. Committee hand selected from other universities who were buddies in the Hemingway circle. I was lucky to get a 45 minute meeting every other month and would have to ask twice for comments on drafts.\n2) Professor X on my committee started off very supportive and excited about my work. I know this because she came to a talk I gave on an early few chapters and not only asked questions but came to my defense when a premise was questioned. Also, she was given a particular chapter to read early so that she would have a sample to write a rec letter about and it was positive. However, about a year into my project, she started her own WW1 project.\n\nTo resume my story: my Director didn't send out drafts, he alone worked through draft after draft until he thought it was finished; then distributed to committee and called for pre-defense vote. I was led to believe that by the end of the day, I would have a date for my oral defense and graduate in 3 months. Instead, the committee voted NO. It was sent back for major revisions. Apparently, the loudest and meanest critic was Professor X and the chapter she hated the most was the one that a)she had previously championed and b)she was now going to need. But beyond that, according to my Director who was too emotional to be diplomatic, he told me things she said in the MTG that were downright denigrating. She also put anyone who might be on the fence squarely in the negative column: when asked to vote first, she passed, saying that she thought it was terrible but if everyone else was ok with it, she wouldn't stand in their way. She claimed that it made NO argument: it was a two hundred some page manuscript with hundreds of sources, 3 years worth of work, the first page of which states \"the argument is...\"\n\nBut I digress. If it was only her, it wouldn't have mattered, it's a 5 person vote. But her and the others just weren't happy at the lack of theory. Revisions were requested. It's not ideal, it's not the end of the world. I'll just take their notes and---I WASN'T GIVEN ANY WRITTEN FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER. My Director was supposed to have requested or collected revision suggestions etc and did not. He took a couple one word notes that he relayed in our meeting. He had a crumpled up piece of paper with 3 scribbled pencil bullet points from the historian. Nothing more. He sent me around to see the other two committee members, one on one. Each thought I had notes from Director. I did not. Male theorist said keep truckin' and add theory, theory, theory. X spent the 20 min she said she could spare telling me that my work was pointless and derivative, that maybe if I spent another few years on revisions I might salvage it but some people aren't cut out for this. \n\nSo I took some time off. Then I ended up writing 60 pages of revisions (with zero guidance) and sent them off to my Director for feedback. One month passed. Two. Three. Email again. Nope. FINALLY I get an email apologizing for having never read the revisions. Also, so sorry, but going through a personal crisis and can't direct dissertations anymore. I resign as your Director. I have no idea what the protocol is for this. You probably have to start over again. By the way, still Chair of the Department. \n\nSo yeah. Due to issues with other committee members being away, issues with other, and his resignation, I was told that if I still wanted to finish, I had to start again with new time period, topic, committee, director, dissertation, all of it. By now, I had been at uni for 7 years, on the clock for 6. But I did what they said! Now it was Shakespeare at Chautauqua. I got thru Chapter 1 before I decided my mental health couldn't take it. I walked away. Before I did, I went to the dean's office and told them everything. Changes were formalized around dissertation revisions so no one else goes through what I did. \n\nI have 200 grand in debt; the inability to pursue my career full-time in the way I wanted to; and SO MUCH anger, grief, resentment, rage. I have no idea what to do with myself. My book, my original dissertation, is good. I know it. It was the committee that was bad. A better director would have recognized that early and done things differently. I can't figure out how to let this go.",

I was a vocal, active, grad student that presented in US and Canada, was starting to publish articles, won fellowships, served on committees. Then I vanished. People talk. What happened to me was an open secret yet nobody could do or say anything because the two bad actors were tenured and one was Chair. It makes everything so awkward and fraught, creating \"sides\" that might be for or against me. So I don't even feel that I can get rec letters to pursue academic work at a community college where only MA is required; or apply elsewhere in future without starting from scratch... though at the moment, having anything to do with it sounds unthinkable.\n\nBut- I earned that degree, dammit!",

      "text": "I worked for a Ph.D. student all four years of my undergrad.   Her dissertation was a massive amount of work and I learned a lot from her and participating.   About a year and a half later, I was in grad school looking through the new issue of the top journal in our field.  There was a paper by her major professor, with him as sole author.   It was the great majority of her dissertation.   Down in the accomplishments, he thanked the grad student and me equally for helping on his project.  That was his only mention of her.   \n\nI reached out to her.  She\u2019d seen it and was completely broken.  She\u2019d agreed with him that the dissertation would be split into two pubs, with him as the lead author on one as he was fighting for tenure.   I though that was dodging enough, let alone his claiming essentially all his work as her own.   I asked if she had contacted the University or Department.  She\u2019d talked to a couple people but said she wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t pursue it because he\u2019d ruin her if she did.   She tried to publish the remaining part of the dissertation but it was rejected because it was \u201ctoo similar to his work\u201d.\n\nThis was in the early to mid 1980\u2019s.  \n\nI stayed angry at her for a long time for not pursuing something against him.  He was denied tenure, but jumped to an equally prestigious institution and got tenure there.  \n\nA few years later, I ended up understanding why she didn\u2019t pursue anything against him.  I had my own more minor issue with a senior researcher and did pursue it.  He was reprimanded, but from that point forward did everything he could to hurt or impede me.  I changed jobs to get away from him.  Until he retired, though, whenever he reviewed a paper and some of my work was cited he\u2019d insist the author remove the reference to my work saying I\u2019d been discredited as a scientist.  Editors used to reach out to me to ask WTF was wrong with him.",

It brought long-term unemployment, trashed confidence, complete social isolation etc. Gosh I wish I discovered reddit then, stopped killing myself over the research, partied hard and left with fun memories rather than the creepy emptiness of the university library at 9 am on Saturday. \n\nOn the other note, and maybe it could be a topic for a podcast, I keep wondering why isn't there a website like Ratemyprofessor but for graduate students? So that people who were forced to leave programs because of the abuse, people who graduated despite the abuse, people who witnessed others' advisors abuse their mentees, so all this information be put there like the reviews on ratemyprofessor? Because people choosing an MA/ PhD program are absolutely in the dark about these things. The only option is to contact current students but then they need to put their feedback in writing and understandably won't write anything negative about their advisor or the lab especially if they want to stay in academia.  Maybe there are such sites I just have never heard of them?",

Towards the end before he was ultimately pushed out of the lab, the manager also excluded me from research projects and literally gave me the silent treatment for months.  Like, my advisor still expected me to work with him and saw it as a \"communication problem\" on my end but the lab manager literally refused to speak to me for more than a month.  If i wasn't so close to graduating I would be looking for a new lab even though he's gone.",

No one has been willing to help me with anything, I wasn't allowed to ask questions when I started - or I asked and people purposely fed me wrong answers or ignored me - even for things as simple as finding equipment. As a recent pain: I gave a group presentation and no one asked questions, though for most people usually there are \\~10 questions and my topic is very relevant to a bunch of what other people work on. \n\nChapter 2 of my story (a co-advisor) is pretty lame.

And that if we didn't, we should look around (such as googling, reading how others have discussed the theories we were reading, etc). But they themself were not a source of support if we had questions. Already problematic but no1 said anything so we all went to class either acting like we knew what we read or we only spoke about the bits we did understand. \n\nAnd then when it was my turn to lead discussion for the class, I made my questions based on his declaration that we all must come to class all seasoned by our readings with some higher knowledge. I have really bad anxiety so leading discussion already made me nervous. But my discussion turned into a clown show because I realized partway through that my classmates did not understand the reading and my anxiety-riddled self was not able to accomodate quickly enough. I managed to keep the discussion going (and thankfully my classmates really tried their best to stay with me). But then the professor called me out right before class ended to tell me I did poorly as a discussion leader because I did not prepare for the class to not understand the reading. Mind you they opened class with the announcement that we had to come to class understanding the readings. Like, yes, I admit I did not prepare for their lack of understanding. But it isn't because I failed to do so; I chose not to do it because you framed the class to be one where you can't even ask for clarifications in class (I did one time and was ridiculed; everyone elarned from my mistake). Moreover, you couly only discuss the readings in relation to what it can prove. But if you questioned it or tried to expand it by discussing out where it is limited, the orofessor automatically shuts you down. This professor made my anxiety so bad I was throwing up every single time before and after class and a lot fo times, it would be so bad that I wouldn't be able to attend my next classes because of how ill I felt. I was eventually taken out from the class and finished it independently with some supervision from another professor but it was an absolute shitshow. The trauma from that was so bad my depression and anxiety peaked and I became suicidal for some time. I'm passed that now but sometimes it comes crawling back and it terrifies me to think about how easily academic culture and those that make up its infrastructures can destroy others. (Note: we read many difficult theories for the class but the one I happened to lead for was the most difficult for the class to digest, according to them)",

I had to get a special approval to get a supervisor from a different hospital and spent the year commuting two hours each direction because of that prick. \n\nIt worked out for the best though because I found a phenomenal PI with whom I am still in touch and ended up writing a great paper.",

Asked me to repeat all the experiments in one week (60-70 h of work, lack of sleeping and panic attacks ). Not able to replicate them, I thought he accused me of misconduct or data fabrication. \nInstead of accepting the new data and changing the manuscript he pushed me until the limit.\nEnded up with a mental burnout",

      "text": "Sounds like Oxbridge? Sorry that happened to you.\n\nI know someone who had a similar kind of situation, but was pursuing a DPhil. Problem is, the equipment was ancient and riddled with issues. So the experiment never worked, and they couldn't get funding for new equipment. They ended up spending 2 years longer than normal and the supervisor still wouldn't give them the degree - wouldn't even let them masters out. They lost their funding and became homeless, living in the lab 24/7 and asking friends to help with stuff like laundry. Because of the college system, they were formally enrolled in the university program but behind payment of fees for the college, so their keycard stopped working. So then they were not only homeless and living in the lab, but if they ever dared exit the lab they would get locked out. I'm sure I don't know the full story, but it sounded horrifying that it had gotten to that point.",

Honestly, I'm just glad they are a) alive, b) housed, c) seemingly doing well in everything else that makes up normal life. Research has a tendency to be all-consuming, but there's a lot else to life out there.",

      "text": "I'm a woman in STEM and I haven't mentioned this in any of my posts due to fears of being recognized but the more I think about it, the more I can't shake the feeling that my advisor punished me for being a woman, and because I'd disagree with him on things and his \"nice guy\" attitude and opinions when we'd \"hang out\" with other people in the research group but I also think he took revenge on his female best friend who rejected him like 5-8 years ago but on me, because she was long gone having a brilliant career in a first world country and I was there and he had the power to fuck me over and be mean to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really loved his company and I even had a small crush on him early on before knowing about his opinions I disagreed with, what never went away until after he fucked me over  was my admiration for him, I don't even know if my crush was real or just deep admiration and a sense of \"we're similar\" (which did go away because I would never do what he did to me to anybody even if they deserved it). ofc I never did anything about the small crush because that would've been unprofessional... and because of the crush I was specially devastated when he dropped me without any previous warning. I'm also pretty sure he had a crush on me as well, he made a few comments that suggested this, like telling me our astrological signs were compatible and asking me if I had a boyfriend and inquiring about my future relationship plans (whether or not I planned on getting married, etc), he also constantly brought up my male best friend and said I had him in the friend zone and was like \"poor him\" etc etc then he'd tell me stories about how the same thing happened to him and this is where I tried explaining how I didn't think my best friend was in love with me because he liked another girl from a different program, but he kept insisting and made everything so awkward between me and my best friend because he was sort of obsessed with it and would ALWAYS bring it up. This is part of the reason why I feel he took his \"revenge\" on the girl who rejected him all those years ago on me instead: he never missed a chance to bring it up, like it was constantly on his mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe also seems to have had a bunch of dramatic \"falling outs\" with all of his female students, (3 and counting) he's super nice to us at first and then starts sneakily devaluing us and being mean to us but not very overtly, until he finally explodes and we leave or he drops us. Idk if he's had these problems with any of the male students, but when I was still in the research group he'd devalue my work with mean comments while applauding a male student for doing next to nothing (the one other male student was great, but the one he was comparing me to 100% didn't, he quite literally did nothing and was useless af, I did that guy's part of projects so many times because he was so useless).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advisor expected me to write a PhD level thesis while being in Undergrad with no previous experience, he gave me contradictory advice all the time, made me write entire chapters until they were \"perfect\" and then would have me delete them months later, he also made awful comments via e-mail and subtly devalued me and my work in front of other students, sadly I took it with stride because I thought I was above starting \"drama\" and that I would somehow manage to write a proper thesis without any help or proper guidance. Idk how much of this bs was premeditated and how much was just him being shitty at his job, but a lot of this FEELS like it was done on purpose to make me lose the most amount of time possible and blame me for failing to meet unreasonable expectations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in denial about all of this, even though it was always on my mind as a \"could it be?\" but the more I hear from what happened to other women the longer I can't ignore it. Idk what to do about it, or if I even can do anything about it. I'm so angry because I've lost about 3 years of my life because of him and I would be in a much better place had I never met him. He almost ruined my life. It took me about 10 months to finally \"get over\" the trauma from my Undergrad advisor. I actually made this account to rant and seek support and I think that helped, I might still be stuck had I not done that. I'm actually not 100% over it, I still get mad anxiety \"attacks\" when faced with the potential of similar problems and I can't function as well as I used to, I'm trying to go to therapy for it but I'm still in the very first stages",
