  "text": "So I am writing my master thesis right now and it\u2019s been the worst couple of months in my life :)\nI developed so much anxiety around it that I literally can\u2019t start. I already missed 2 deadline with my supervisor because of it, which makes my anxiety even worse. Every time i manage to take my computer and open the document to write something nothing comes out. Can anybody help me? How do I get over it? Any tips? I only have 3 weeks left and I am so scared that I\u2019ll fuck it up even tho I already wrote about 70%.  The rest just doesn\u2019t seem to come to me. I am already stressed and depressed so pls don\u2019t judge",

      "text": "Try using an outline (if you aren't already).\n\nThe \"magic\" of an outline is that it separates the thinking from the writing to a large degree. Developing an outline lets you think through all of the logic, arguments, etc. you must write without worrying about actually writing them. Then, when you write from the outline all you have to think about is making sentences that aren't terrible. As a bonus, an outline also keeps track of your thoughts for you so you don't have to remember anything.",

The hard deadline is Dec 2022.       \n\nI was researching how to improve processor performance based on a few popular papers, however, the processor performance decreased and I am sure I am at fault, not the theory behind. I am pretty sure that I made a nasty mistake somewhere when integrating it into a processor...      \n\nAnyways, life is life. Get over it. You miss all shots you dont take. Write something, hand it in, maybe it works, maybe it is rejected. You will never know.",

      "text": "First, rather than opening up the document, work out what it is you need to write.\n\nWhat is the missing 30%?\n\nOutline what different sections that missing 30% should have.\n\nOpen a blank document and try to flesh out what one of those sections should ahve in it. What would the first paragraph need to cover? What the next logical train of thought for the next paragraph? Do this and get your thoughts in order. Think about where any particularly important references might ned to go.\n\nOnce you know what the section is going to look like, and what each paragraph needs to do, then start fleshing them out with actual writing.\n\nAnd the most important thing is to accept that \"good writing\" is a fiction we tell ourselves. What matters is good editing.  Getting any old shit on the page is what matters. Then you can refine it.",

I couldn\u2019t get anything done in the last 2 weeks because I was in a bad place mentally. I finally was able to get up today and work for a few hours, but I feel anxious because I lost so much time. My tip is to take baby steps and start by sorting your thoughts again, summarize what you already have and think about where you want to go from there. And then start with bullet points of everything that needs to be addressed instead of whole sentences, that\u2018s easier and helps with creating a logical structure. Good luck, we can do this!",

Actually, I\u2019ve pushed my deadline back several times which of course makes me feel like a failure in some ways. The last chapter I was working on took double the time I meant it to, purely because of that burn out and paralyzation you\u2019re describing. It\u2019s tough to get over. What worked for me was just forcing something out and sending it to my supervisor, even though I knew it was incomplete. He was able to give me feedback and it felt like I had passed the first \u201cdeadline\u201d hurdle \u2014 sending in the first draft. \nAlso, check to see what your institution\u2019s options are regarding extensions. In my experience, thesis deadlines can be very flexible. \nAlso also, try to remember that this year you had the added pressure of COVID. I don\u2019t know where you are or what your reality was like \u2014 but restrictions really made burnout much more prevalent for a lot of people i know.",
