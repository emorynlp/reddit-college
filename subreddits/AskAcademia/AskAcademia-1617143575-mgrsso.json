  "title:": "Is it a career killer to attend the same school as undergrad for a PhD?",
  "text": "I've been in my current physics research group at an R1 state school for a year. The problem we're working on is a long-term problem that I find inspiring and important. I've also received really strong mentorship here. I got into another school where they'd like me to work on the same problem, if I choose to go there. They said they'd like to collaborate even if I don't go there. I'm not married to the idea of an academic career, but I would consider it if I felt I was competitive. Logistically, staying at my current school would be easier, and I have momentum. Would staying at my current institution be a bad decision? Or is the important thing that I work with other groups of people and broaden my horizons?",

I think there are benefits for going elsewhere, but I don't think it'll hurt you if you don't. Go where you think you can be most successful. \n\nIt's funny because I do still hear all the time don't stay in place from PhD to postdoc to faculty position, but man, departments of full of hiring their own!",

My PhD advisor did his undergrad, PhD, a short postdoc, assistant professor and is now an associate professor all at the same university! (an R1 in the northeast US).  I think it\u2019s generally preferable to have moved to a new lab at some point as committees will view this as an ability to work independently rather than just piggy backing off your PI the whole time, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always necessarily a bad idea to stay at the same school",

              "text": "Having moved from one institution to another between PhD and post doc, I will say there is a TON to be gained from working in a new environment, especially if it is a different line of work. I don't know if the gain is quite the same for you as an individual between post doc and faculty, but the gain is definitely there for the department when hiring external. You bring a new line of expertise to a department. Otherwise if you stay in house you will always be considered a mini PI of your post doc mentor (unless you take a huge leap away in research direction which most do not). So you don't really have much new to offer.\n\nFor undergrad to PhD, I don't think it matters much at all. It's too different a training to compare. Just take the offer that will bring the most success.",

If you invent a cure for cancer, I don't care if you have worked in different institutions or not. (How mobile were Darwin, Einstein and Wittgenstein? Did it matter?)  Your versatility, narrowness, broadness etc. is pretty much exclusively shown in your published research, in my opinion. This goes for content as well as for co-authors, though. If someone has only published together with one or two others over the years, I may worry a bit about that person's potential as an individual researcher.\n\nWhen it comes to teaching and admin, I tend to see \"mobility\" as a strong plus in itself. When I review applicants for tenure, solid volumes of experiences from different institutions matter - but basically mostly if all things are equal regarding teaching/admin quality.

In my experience, there are few plus sides I've found to changing universities:\n\n* more connections with researchers at the new university\n   * while you mentioned they would still want to collaborate, you likely wouldn't get to know other people in their department\n* opportunity to pick up new skills\n   * while the project sounds as though it would be the same, research groups within the same discipline do things differently\n   * important because you never know what skills you'll need in your career\n* more \"life\" experience\n   * experiencing a new city is great, you might find a new hobby or extracurricular",

But here's my experience/take on this: I had really, really great mentorship at my undergrad institution and I wanted to stay, but after three years in his lab, my advisor said \"Its time for you to go and see how they do it elsewhere, that's how you become a better scientist\". I didn't believe him at first, but I'm now at a different institution doing my PhD. I'm in my first year here and have learned so much. We're doing the same type of research here, but in different ways. Even the way we use the same instruments is radically different. The other members of my lab are from other places too and so I get to learn about how they did things differently elsewhere as well. I've also gotten the chance to learn how to work with new people as opposed to my previous advisor and his close group -- and this has also opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. \n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, it has broadened my horizons and made me think about my entire field in a different way.",

In any case, it is fairly common to stay for a PhD, especially if you are at a school with a strong program aligned with your interests. Do keep in touch with the \"another school\" for a paper or two, and consider that they might be a good target for postdoc opportunity later.",
