  "text": "Hi all, \nI\u2019m a staffer at a community college whose developing a combination of our administrators association and the classified employees commission. Our leadership felt it was too divisive to have 2 different groups and thought the history of the classified employees commission was just staffers bitching ( though I don\u2019t entirely agree). \n\nI\u2019ve been set by hr as a founding member possible chair of this council land I wanted to reach out to you all in academia to see what you would like to see in an organization like this. Perhaps you have a great example of one on your campus, if so please send a link or list your school as I would love to get examples. \nWe are sending out a survey to our staff members to see what they would like out of our council so if you have any thoughts on good survey questions please send them my way \n\nTIA",
