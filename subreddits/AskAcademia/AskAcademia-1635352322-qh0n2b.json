Just put it in a seperate section after your publications under \"manuscripts in preparation\" or similar. But only include those where there's actually a reasonably mature manuscript / already submitted as you may be asked about them. I'm STEM in UK for reference",

This is sometimes done by junior scholars, but looks odd for senior scholars, at least in many fields. One downside, in addition to those mentioned by other posters, is that if your paper is not accepted than readers of your CV will know which journals rejected you. As practices are field dependent, why not talk with your advisor?",
