  "text": "Hello all, i recently completed a BSc in Psychology with a 2:2. My end goal is to become a doctor of counselling psychology, so I need to do a masters as I didn\u2019t get a 2:1. Should I do a MSc Psychology or something else? I keep finding conflicting information.",

      "text": "This is not meant to be disparaging or mean, just honest. I think you should very carefully consider if you'll be capable of completing a master's, let alone a doctorate. Frankly a 2.2 is a fail as far as any future employer is concerned (and many master programs will require minimum 2.1). Even if you can get a master's, I think you will struggle to get on a PhD as that 2.2 will be a big risk most supervisors won't look past, unless you're self funded. Not everyone is inclined towards academia and you may better serve yourself putting your efforts elsewhere.",

          "text": "Thanks for this advice :) I know I am capable, the only reason I got a 2:2 was because I had a lot of things happen in my personal life that greatly affected my study and know I can do much better. Do you think it would still be worth it or not?",

              "text": "It's hard to say, it depends if what you say is true (only you can know that). It's easy to say oh I'll do better next time it was just because of this and that. Not saying it's not true, but you need to be honest with yourself. Masters normally cost alot of money as it's hard to get loans on them. If you excelled at the masters and got distinction (or equivalent in psychology, I'm biochem so not sure) I could see a potential future employer / supervisor looking past it as you've shown considerable growth. I think it would require doing very well in your masters and getting a really good reference from your supervisor. So if you honestly think you can do it and go all in effort wise, then it may be worth it. But only you can know that and will have to decide for yourself.\n\nI believe you can do conversion courses into counselling etc. so there may be other options open that don't require more degrees. I guess you have to ask yourself if you just want to pursue a doctorate for the bravado or you genuinely need it to pursue your career. Best of luck either way!",

              "text": "I think saying any employer will view a 2:2 as a fail is very harsh and not true. Whether you can get on to a master's is another question. I think if you can write a compelling application that outlines both your plans and also the reasons for the low grades and what your changing to make sure it doesn't happen with your masters as well, there is a possibility. A 2:2 isn't a fail, it's just not a good grade. \n\nIs there someone from your UG course (lecturer) who can provide a reference or give you some help? \n\nAt the end of the day, you can't do a master's if you don't apply. I'm not suggesting you can breeze onto any course of your choosing, but I also think some careful thought and research could yield results.\n\nIn addition, while some PhD programs may refuse to look at you, it's well recognised that getting a master's to make up for a poor UG degree is a route to PhD.",

There are sometimes PGDiploma or similarly names courses which have the same taught elements as an MSc and are easier to get onto, these can then be changed internally into the MSc after getting good grades in the classes.\n\nFrom a personal point of view I am now doing a PhD despite only getting a 2:2 at undergrad. Albeit for full info I did take a sidestep into another social science for my MSc which I obviously excelled in/enjoyed much more.\n\nGood luck.",
