  "text": "[The Professor Is In](https://theprofessorisin.com/2017/12/01/a-crowdsourced-survey-of-sexual-harassment-in-the-academy/) has crowdsourced a survey collecting reports of sexual harassment and assault experiences in academia [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqWdpDxVRc-i8OiiClJPluIpjMlM41aUlU2E0rrQ4br_rQmA/viewform#responses). You can read through the 2,000+ responses at [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S9KShDLvU7C-KkgEevYTHXr3F6InTenrBsS9yk-8C5M/edit#gid=1530077352) google spreadsheet. I personally recognize a tenured individual reported on that survey who is STILL harassing graduate students, despite a mandatory leave of absence following a sexual harassment case.\n\nIf you have your own story to share, add it there, or feel free to discuss related issues here.",

      "text": "I think some of the criticisms of this project miss the point. Yes, it's true that the survey methodology is not as rigorous as would be required to satisfy the standards of academic social science, nor does it subject the reports to journalistic or legal standards of verification. However, it was never intended to comply with those standards, because the point is not to enable scientifically-valid specific inferences or to prove the case against a specific target for a particular incident or set of incidents. The purposes of the survey are (1) to enable victims to collectively speak out about their experiences while protected from retribution by anonymity, and (2) to make a prima facie case that this is a ubiquitous problem which merits further, more sustained inquiry and action.\n\nIf you want better data so that you can make better inferences about the problem of sexual harassment in the academy, well...then go conduct that research! A few of the social science disciplines have already started to do this, actually. Some political science researchers are currently working on a big ongoing project aimed at comprehensively and rigorously studying - as well as developing policy responses to - inequality, discrimination, and harassment within the discipline. There have been a few publications in anthropology regarding the climate in fieldwork settings specifically (see the comments on Kelsky's blog post linked in the OP for cites). There's a whole saga of controversy in philosophy departments concerning diversity and harassment issues (particularly with regard to Brian Leiter's blog, Linda Alcoff's climate survey, and the ranking of graduate programs).Some individual departments in various fields have also brought in external experts to conduct climate evaluations. We have a long way to go, clearly, but there are some early models in some fields that have begun systematic efforts to identify and resolve these problems.\n\nSo yeah...if you don't like the survey as either a study or a solution, then treat it as a pilot, and as a provocation to pursue further research and systematic institutional/cultural reform.",

It isn\u2019t as if there will be few first hand accounts. ",

If no one reports bring harassed in English 101 did that mean no one was harassed? No. Because you didn't target them.  You didn't target anyone.",
