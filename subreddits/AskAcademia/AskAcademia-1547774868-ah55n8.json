Sorry to piggyback on your reply, I just love that even in the 4th/3rd centuries BCE people were asking this same question.",

                      "text": "Hey, thanks for the exact passage reference! You're right that he wasn't mentioned in this one - I conflated that because of the several other passages throughout the text where Confucius praises him to the high heavens. This one, for instance (5.9) comes really close: \"The master said to Zi Gong: 'Taking you and Hui together, who excels (more)?' Zi Gong replied: 'As for me, how would I dare look toward Hui? Hui hears one part and takes the knowledge of ten. I hear one part and take the knowledge of two.' The Master said: 'You are not such as him! You and I together are not such as him!'\n\n6.3 is another passage where we see why Yan Hui is such a great student: \"The Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied, 'There was Yan Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger. He did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died. Now there is not such another. I have not yet heard of any one who loves to learn as he did.'\" \n\n&#x200B;",

If you ever say you are doing something because someone said so or its \"black magic\" you are not a great student. Not even a good one.\n\n(2) Shoot for the highest quality and care in your work. Goes with (1) - you have to understand what aspects of your methods are important, and what are the failure modes, and account for them.\n\n(3) Don't think that long hours in the lab make you somehow amazing. Efficient use of time is much more important. The absolute best students are those who can do (1) and (2) and still go home at 5pm.",

This is a poor summation of what makes a good grad student because work ethic, like say, confidence, is a symptom of an ecosystem of other practices.  It is NOT a thing that is achieved on its own.\n\nWork ethic (alternative productivity) only exists with certain individuals not because you've told them to work harder, but because they have a self-driven purpose that compels them to work independent of requests to do so.  Frequently personal motivations come into play, as well as background history of reasons for doing extra work, that won't (in the near term) be existentially challenged (which tends to happen with people in quarter-life, or mid-life crises).\n\nBut having a self-driven purpose does not come with someone with self-confidence problems, where they would question whether they have a purpose, and thus, whether there was a point to doing extra work.  Obligation, fear of punishment, only go so far.\n\nEssentially, I question if your posing of the key trait of a grad student as \"work ethic\" is tautological: you've answered what makes a good grad student by saying that they must be good.",

I highly recommend role-playing games because A. academics into rpgs are easy to find and tend to be interesting people, and B. there is nothing on earth that better prepares you for teaching that running an rpg as a Dungeon Master--literally the same skillset--prepping materials, facilitating a group discussion, leading the group to a planned or foregone conclusion while keeping them convinced that they got there off their own accord and creativity, etc. but without having to deal with the sink or swim intensity of learning to teach by actually teaching. \n\nA plan B, if academia turns out horrible--this could mean another advisor, department, university or another career path. All such changes are doable, even if challenging. People can and do make such changes.\n\nMaking certain to set aside time to remind yourself why you enjoy whatever it is you do--don't study literature and stop reading fiction for fun. I started to **hate** art at some point during my dissertation, but the hate wore off whenever I got myself to walk around a museum for fun. \n\nThe realization that gradschool is a marathon, not a sprint, and that conserving your energy and resources (including money) is the only way to make it to the end--the other option is inevitable burnout. \n\nFinally, if your advisor sucks-if they make you uncomfortable, make impossible demands, act cruelly or irrationally or arbitrarily etc.-trust yourself and get a new advisor--there are plenty of good, supporting, caring advisors out there and plenty of horrible people who exploit grad students. Don't stay with abusive advisors--they will fuck you up and leave you with no options. Find someone better, ask them if you can be their advisee, and leave the bad one for good. \n",

It is from 1979, but still relevant.\n\nTo summarize, they interviewed a bunch of grad advisors and asked them what defined the superstars.  The 5 points are:\n\n* Visibility - most often mentioned.  Physically present and often after work hours\n\n* Hard Working - next most mentioned.  Important to note profs probably said this because they saw the students working hard.\n\n* Reflection of program values - consistently mentioned.  Research is not just a requirement, but a value for the student.  They are involved in other projects besides their thesis.  They saw value in the field, not just their subspecialty. \n\n* Professor Attachment - student spends entire grad program working with one or two professors.\n\n* The \"W\" Factor - made faculty feel worthwhile and rewarded.  Easy to teach, picked things up quickly, could receive and use feedback, did not complain, grew into a colleague \n\nThings notably absent: high intelligence, excellent grades, interpersonal skills, verbal/writing ability.  However, it could be because these attributes are considered baseline.",

Take intellectual ownership of the thesis project as soon as possible. This means, among other things, making choices about the next steps in research based on what you think should rather than on what you think your advisor wants. In the end, you should become the world\u2019s expert on your thesis topic, prior to the PhD final oral exam. One essential step to this end is to read the literature regularly and thoroughly.  \n\n2. Be professional in all things. This means, among other things, showing up to all meetings on time; making all written and oral presentations clear and of high quality. Take TA responsibilities seriously. Keep a good lab book. Follow good safety practices at all times. Behave in an ethical manner (properly attribute all work in written and oral presentations, don\u2019t plagiarize, etc.). Consult with your advisor about specific expectations for vacation. hours worked, etc.  \n\n3. Be completely reliable. This means, among other things, that your advisor can trust your experimental results, can depend on to do the appropriate control experiments, and that you report exactly what happened, not the results you think your advisor wants to hear. Honesty and integrity are expected at all times.  \n\n4. Develop your critical faculties, and apply them to your own work and to the work others.  \n\n5. Be intellectually curious. This means, among other things. attending seminars outside area, reading outside your area. and asking questions at seminars.  \n\n6. Work hard. Assess your level of effort on the basis of what you have actually accomplished, not just on the time you have spent.  \n\n7. Be a cooperative, collaborative, and enthusiastic member of your research group.  \n\n\u2014Thanks to the Tolman Group (UMN) and Prof. Tim Lodge.\n",
