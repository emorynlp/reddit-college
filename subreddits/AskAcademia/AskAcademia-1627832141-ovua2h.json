  "text": "I know my question is super vague and has no definite scope or sub topics, but hear me out or help me out. \n\nI'm a student in india doing my masters currently. While the field of academics is interesting to me I primarily want to teach. In india I require a clearance or a PhD to teach at a lecturer position. However, indian universities are not that great or enriching in their literature programmes. \n\nHence I'm looking for international options that would not make me incur a lot of debt.",

      "text": "I think it depends on where you want to end up in your academic career. If you want to return to India after your PhD, I would go to the universities you aim to teach at and look at the places the faculty received their PhDs. \n\nI just looked at one university in India and it seems like there was a mix of degrees from Indian, American, British, Canadian and Australian universities. If you're interested in PhDs in the United States, I'll note that any English PhD worth attending will be fully funded, even if you are an international student.",
