It seems like a pretty good deal because longer time in the program could give you more time to publish.  \n\n\nGoogle \"4+4 PhD\" and then whatever program and university you're interested in.

                  "text": "UK shortens everything, including allowing 3 year PhDs, which is one reason I often find people trained in the UK to have a lot less experience and require more additional training in the lab than those educated in Europe. I would be loathe to hire PhD students or postdocs from the UK myself unless they have a few years experience beyond their qualifications. Within Europe we always found the best students and postdocs were Dutch, German, Belgian or fellow Scandinavians as well as some excellent and highly motivated students and postdocs from the Mediterranean countries too. \n\nWe did not tend to get UK graduates in Sweden, though, so this was not often an issue. I have noted from the Karolinska website now that the Swedish higher education association and council for higher education allows PhD candidates with 240 ECTS as long as 60 of those credits are at an advanced (post bachelor) level. This is lower than the requirements I had when I started on my PhD 10 years ago so perhaps times are changing. Spain still requires 300 ECTS, so requires 3 year bachelors + 2 year masters for entry for example so your \"typical\" 1 year MSc in the UK would be insufficient. I got my MSc in New Zealand and that was 2 years thankfully.\n\nhttps://eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/eurydice/content/third-cycle-phd-programmes-79_en",

                      "text": "First, the UK is in Europe. You are talking like it's not. Second, I know loads of countries within Europe, not just the UK, that allow a 3 year PhD. In the UK, it takes 3-4 years but you can't go further than 4. I know a few spanish and italian people who also graduated before the 4 year mark. I even met American PhD students who did it before the 4 year mark. Loads of countries let you go further than 4 years. Having that \"extra\" time doesn't make it better. If you are quick enough to do it in 3 years, that doesn't make it easier. We had a PhD student at my institute (USA) who finished at 3 years because he was a workhorse. That doesn't make USA PhD quicker, it makes the student quicker.\n\nWith masters, as someone who has taught MSc in the USA and done it in the UK (also did postdocs in other countries), the workload is the same in the UK compared to most of the rest of Europe (that I know of, I don't know all the countries because I guess no one does). My workload per term (semester) was a lot more than they do in the USA for example.\n\nAlso, on that link, it states:\n\n>Candidates must hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree, or equivalent, and a Master\u2019s degree, or equivalent, provided they have completed at least 300 ECTS credits in the two types of programmes as a whole.\n\nthen the [study.eu](https://study.eu) website states:\n\n>Luckily, conversion between UK credit points and ECTS credit points is simple: 2 UK credits are equivalent to 1 ECTS credit.\n\nA bachalors degree in the UK is 360 points, or 180 ECTS. \n\n[findamasters.com](https://findamasters.com) says this:\n\n>Most people study a Masters as a postgraduate student, having already finished an undergraduate degree. How many credits is a Masters? A UK Masters degree is worth 180 credits. Elsewhere in Europe a Masters is worth 120 ECTS credits.\n\nSo, according to them, a masters in the UK is worth more ECTS credits than elsewhere in Europe. That 180 ECTS masters from the UK would bring the bachalors + masters to 360 ECTS.",

                          "text": "Firstly, few Brits have published much (normally a paper) from their PhDs in STEM subjects so yeah the extra time matters. Most Swedish PhDs are longer and they tend to publish more as publication is a requirement for graduation - when I came through it was 4 papers and 2 should be first author. I find that the extra time gives students far more time to actually publish meaningful data rather than the \"you can graduate without publishing\" in the UK. A thesis alone PhD is worthless in STEM in my opinion.\n\nA British masters is 180 credits, this I agree with, but that is not 180 ECTS.\n\nhttps://www.uea.ac.uk/study/study-abroad-and-exchange/erasmus-programme/ects#:~:text=A%20UK%20undergraduate%20degree%20equates,equates%20to%2090%20ECTS%20credits.\n\nSo you see, a British masters is 90 ECTS, thus 180 + 90 = 270. Sorry, no luck for getting a PhD place in Spain. You forgot to use your own conversion of credits to ECTS for the British masters.\n\nI now work in the UK, and I have to say, the quality of young British scientists is far lower than I taught and supervised on the continent simply because they have had more time in a research lab and have had more time to grow as a scientist on the whole across European institutions. It is quite ridiculous in the UK - there are group leaders younger than I am with fewer publications simply because of \"post PhD time\" because they ploughed through their entire education in 6 years. Utter insanity.\n\nAnd yes, the UK is geographically in Europe, but certainly pretends not to be thanks to petty nationalism and bigotry.",
