  "title:": "Will a Second Class Honours grade look bad at any point?",
  "text": "Apologies if this isn't actually an appropriate sub, I think it is bc i'm looking for the perspective of people well into thier academic journey. Not sure if Honours is a universal thing but from what I gather it's the equivalent of a masters in some places maybe? It's just a year at the end of your bachelor where you do research and write a thesis. And I'm in Australia but general thoughts are appreciated.\n\nCurrently a Masters student (in a different field) but I did my honours in 2019/2020 and finished half a percent off a first class (i.e. 84.5%). I absolutely drove myself into the ground on this project but it was fairly cursed and became messy at the end. My GPA is somehwere over 6 (out of 7) and I received the oh so esteemed boiler-plate-email Vice Chancellor commendation twice, so this was a huge blow to me.\n\nI followed up the option of getting a late penalty removed that would bump my grade up, under medical grounds, but bc it was unclear who to contact and they all took their sweet time communicating with each other and me it wasn't until recently this year I got a solid \"no, too late\" (no thanks to their slothful email response pace mind you). \n\nThere may be some other options i can pursue under various policies etc, but I don't want to rustle feathers or waste my time if it's not really that important. I've had bad luck getting anywhere with similar assessment/class issues in the past, even on behalf of a whole class. Universities are about as transperent and flexible as granite.\n\nSo - *is* it that important? Will having a second class look bad for potential PhD posittions if I go that pathway? I'm also assuming I can't really \"hide\" it, not from a PhD app at least. I intend to get nothing less than a first class for my masters thesis, if only bc of this failure, so would that redeem my academic value if otherwise lost?",

      "text": "Honestly I cannot answer your question. Without things like the country you did your masters in and the country you want to do a PhD in, it will be hard to even take an educated guess at how much a given factor matters. \n\nI can however give advice about how you talk about these events. Your post here is approximately 0% personal responsibility and 100% blaming administrators and office workers for being slow. The blunt reality check you need is that even if you had a medical issue it was your responsibility to notify the proper people in a timely manner. And to follow up in a timely manner. And to advocate for yourself in a timely and respectful manner. \n\nI don\u2019t know whose fault is what here, and I am not here to judge you. I don\u2019t doubt you were dealt non-ideal cards. I do know the language you used here to describe the situation you are currently in does not leave a good impression.",

          "text": "Sorry, I meant to put that in when explaining the deal with honours. It's Australia. I definitely agree, my logic was that it was unlikely a cold and thus lateness would change my actual grade category but... it did. Bad logic. It took two months to get that overall grade, then three months to get a grade breakdown to see where everything was coming from etc, then months of being flipped between people and waiting for replies and solid answers. There were many, very polite follow up emails. So I agree with I should've been more proactive and safe guarded myself, and apologise for being a bit flippant and disgruntled here (it's a casual anonymous forum after all), but this is a \"created the reason they're now using against me\" situation so I absolutely don't apologize for blaming them. For the amount of money & research labour I gave them to get almost nothing in return that whole year, they can and should do better (and they weren't all just adminstrative staff either). Obviously I'd be a little more gentle and understanding irl. \n\nBut honestly that's what my original question kinda was; what will taking it on the chin and doing better next time actually cost me in real world opportunities? Just a general question really, I know my position and why I'm here and I'm gonna find out sooner or later regardless.",

      "text": "So you can still look for PhD positions (some unis will accept people with second class honours grades) but you are going to have a problem: it is very difficult to get a PhD scholarship in Australia if you have a second class honours grade. It is theoretically possible but incredibly rare, and from what I hear it is getting harder even year (Federal Liberal governments tend to cap the number of total PhD places they will pay a scholarship for, which increases the competition). And you don't want to do a PhD in Australia without that scholarship.\n\nBut, if you are already in a Masters program it should not matter, Universities will be more interested your Masters marks then anything else.",

          "text": "Thank you, this is very helpful. Pretty much what I feared. Good to hear postgrad overrides undergrad tho, my whole academic journey has been one of getting better over time rather than starting and staying good so I've always been concerned I wouldn't hold up to others. Not even sure I wanna go down that path yet, but it's nice to have some insight, thanks.",

              "text": "Look, different countries, universities, departments, and supervisors have different opinions and policies around grades and PhD admissions.  If you want to do a PhD and you can't in your own country, then look for a position in another country.  (Even if you *can* do a PhD in your own country, you should still keep your options open and apply elsewhere too so you can find the best fit!)\n\nApplications are different everywhere.  Some places will care about all your grades from undergrad and masters.  Some will only really care about the masters.  Some might place more weight on certain subjects, or on upper-level or recent courses.  Yet others care far more about your CV than your grades.  In the latter case, things like good research experience (masters thesis topic and quality, publications, references), good PhD plans, and excellent communication/presentation skills will more than compensate for a non-stellar GPA.  When I applied for my PhD in the Netherlands they didn't even ask for a transcript until after I'd already been offered & accepted the position.",
