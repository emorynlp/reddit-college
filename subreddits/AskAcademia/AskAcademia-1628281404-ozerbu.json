  "title:": "Graduated from Masters but my supervisor still wants me to help",
  "text": "So I've obtained my masters degree in electrical engineering in June. Around the start of January my supervisor asked me to assist another student who was struggling with their project. She later dropped out and I've been assigned to work on it. Even though I've graduated my supervisor still expects me to work on it until its published. (even though it'll take several more months of obtaining data) I also got a full time job after graduating and have already published two papers with her.  \n\nWhat should I do? I have a neutral relationship with my supervisor and a good stable job, I was thinking of just ghosting her. However, I wouldn't mind helping out if she paid me fairly, would that be inappropriate to ask?",

      "text": "You can ask to be paid but before you do you should check out your current employer's policies on outside activities. Rather than ghosting I'd probably politely wrote back and say you're really happy your PI thought of you for this but unfortunately you're too busy with the current work and can't take this on right now. Pretending she was asking a favour (as opposed to expecting it) and a cheery air of obliviousness is quite an effective way to handle these things.",

      "text": "The reason why your PI wants you to stay, is because she might be receiving funding from some source, and she has a deadline to take care of. That's her side of the story. Now, as for you, you should go and talk to her, and explain her that you have a job already, and suggest some of the options to her.\n\n1. You can work on ur job full time , and the project part time, with some compensation\n2. You can work on the project full time, and get a stipend, and convert that work into a PhD\n3. Help her recruit someone else for her project, like another master's student, or a PhD student or a visiting student.\n\nGhosting someone is a bad idea. You'd never wanna be ghosted, so it's better to not do it yourself.",
