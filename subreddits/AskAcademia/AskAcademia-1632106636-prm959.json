  "text": "I recently got my Bachelor\u2019s degree, and my thesis was published, but I didn\u2019t have an ID. Now I\u2019m working on a new possible publication, during my Master\u2019s degree. Should I get an ORCID id? Or is it weird to have one before I finish my Master\u2019s/apply for doctorate? Also, do you have to pay for it?",
