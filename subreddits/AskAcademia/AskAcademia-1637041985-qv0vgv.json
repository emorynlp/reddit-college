      "text": "The two biggest sources of the increase in my mind are:\n\n1. [States chip in less money](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-higher-education-funding-cuts-have-pushed-costs-to-students) (for public universities) so students pick up those costs.\n2. Increased [non-instructional costs](https://thecollegepost.com/breaking-down-administrative-bloat/) including administrators and student services.  I'm at a large university and even in the \\~13 years since I did my undergrad, I've seen a huge increase in the types and quality of services available to students.  Many of these things are good!  For example, all students can access free mental health services.  But needing to hire dozens of counselors and build a clinic to provide high quality mental health services for thousands of students isn't free.  There are also far more regulatory and reporting requirements mandating numerous full time employees.  Each full time employee is going to add a few dollars to every student\u2019s bill.\n\nNote that it's \\*not\\* professors getting paid ungodly salaries.  A huge number of faculty are adjuncts (barely paid a living wage and have no job security), while even the top paid faculty make less than they could on the outside.\n\nIncreased costs have been tolerated because of readily available student loan funding. Of course, whether students should take these loans is a different question...",

              "text": "Totally fair to say this I think. My school I went to probably had too many administrative staff, who were paid to much when instructors were definitely not paid enough. It was also a school that went from 95% state funded to 25% over a decade (I went to a presentation on this once from the deans office out of curiosity). However we could see what a lot of those offices did and it did benefit (free tutoring, creating networking events to connect minority students to industry mentors, industry based scholarships and paid internships). I also think this worked out because they did a good job of hiring diverse people for the job. Was it worth the cost or charging more tuition i don\u2019t know. I think some of the administration bloat is there but that most of the staff bloat was in the administration you don\u2019t interact with as a student. So finance, sports(this one especially), admissions, deans offices. Probably depends on the school though.",

After the 08 financial crisis, they made these loans widely available so that school never had to get funding from the state when those budgets got cut. Since the schools could get money elsewhere, states had no incentive to return that funding and/or increase taxes to build back that budget. I mean schools basically got easy funding, could raise tuition by huge amounts as the state funding controls on tuition hikes etc were lifted. \n\nSchools then could only make their funding by increasing tuition and increasing enrollment which they have been doing every year since. You can also see this by where they have redirected their investments with lots of schools redoing dorms, building fancy gyms, etc. New investments whose goals is to impress prospective students.",

                          "text": "99% of people who answer this will be incorrect because they don\u2019t look at what caused the beginning of the tuition explosion. \n\nThe federal government decided to take part in student loans. The year after this, college tuition jumped enormously and continues to jump because each year the government gives out more. These are loans that can basically be made to anyone for unreasonable amounts of money ($100,000+). The federal government practically has unlimited money for our purposes here. The federal government will just keep giving them out and does not care about whether or not they can feasibly be paid back. So the federal government is basically giving away billions in free money that can only be spent at colleges. \n\nSo obviously colleges raise their prices. After all, why not? Colleges are businesses first and foremost and there\u2019s billions in free college bucks floating around. Before this, only companies like banks gave out loans for tuition. But they wouldn\u2019t loan to just anyone. These are companies that don\u2019t have unlimited money and care about profit so they need to get paid back (which the federal government doesn\u2019t care about) and so they\u2019ll only loan out money for college in certain circumstances where the person can feasibly pay it back. So fewer people will have the funds necessary to go to college. Once the federal government gets involved (which doesn\u2019t care about making loans that can be paid back), everyone (including people who previously couldn\u2019t afford college) can easily get tens and tens of thousands of college dollars in their pocket at the federal government\u2019s expense. \n\nIf there is a currency that can only be spent at one place and there is an unfathomable amount of that currency circulating around with nary a care for whose pocket it ends up in, that one place will increase its prices to snag as much of that currency as it can. Like imagine if everything at Walmart needed to be bought with WallyBucks. A single sock could be like 100 WallyBucks because Walmart wants to soak up every drop of WallyBucks. There\u2019s no competition for Walmart because it is the only business privy to WallyBucks (so they might they as well raise their prices) just like there\u2019s no competition for universities and colleges because they\u2019re the only ones privy to federal student loans (so they might as well raise their prices). If Walmart did do something like this, we\u2019d all just go to Target or Kmart. But there\u2019s no substitute for college. So we have to use the federal student loans. \n\nBecause virtually anyone can get $100,000 in student loans, unqualified and uncaring people are getting loans for unreasonable amounts of money which they don\u2019t have a system to pay back. \n\nThe federal government started giving out student loans. That allowed more people to go to college than ever before. That also meant that the overwhelming vast majority of the people going to college who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to without the federal student loans will be in horrific debt. Before, only certain people could go to college (people who were rich or people who had good plans to pay their loans back). That meant that student debt wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nSo to recap: the federal government gives out student loans to basically everyone for no reason at all. More people get to go to college. But now everyone wants to go to college and they get in deep debt. Now the economy is sagging because everyone is broke and in debt. If the federal government got out of student loans, college tuition everywhere would plummet because the colleges would have very few customers.",

Federal government started offering guaranteed loans in 65, so universities realized they could get paid almost whatever they want and let the students worry about paying it back later in life.\n\nThere's also been significant growth in administration, sometimes justified as increased compliance (possibly to do with rules for federal loans), but functionally increasing the number of staff salaries on payroll. Since staff don't generally bring in grants this is a cost. \n\nMany schools have increased spending on sports programs even though for the majority of schools these programs lose significant amounts of money. Only a subset of division 1 football programs made money and the median loss was about 16 million/year, which is subsidized by tuition. \n\nThe availability of federal grants has declined as well, so schools that were subsidizing their activities with indirects from research grants, lost income there. \n\nOver the last ten years there have been declines in enrollment as well, and especially (I think) enrollment by international students who are generally charged greater tuition. \n\nMany universities also underwent big phases of construction to try and attract students. These eyesores/buildings cost a lot, and cost a lot to maintain.",

Federal support, both direct aid and subsidies to lenders, has created perverse incentives; students can afford more, so colleges can charge more.\n\nAbout colleges charging more, an underappreciated upward pressure on costs is how it's more expensive to run a school, independent of gripes about administrative bloat. Buildings cost more to build and maintain. The school's portion of employee health insurance has exploded. Expectations that college should be its own universe of housing, professional-level sports, entertainment, health care, etc. has pushed up revenue needs. And for better or worse, those expectations paired with regulations and good faith policies needed to avoid lawsuits are big drivers of what colleges can or need to charge.",

There is also less need for this, since those campus areas are usually located in or near a large city. The tuition fees are just set by the government, so university administrations can't boost their funding by charging more. Lawsuits and health care costs are also less of an issue for obvious reasons.",

              "text": "The somewhat over-simplified answer is that American perception of education has shifted away from being a public good, and more to being a business. Students are seen as customers, and people say, \"Well the customer should pay for what they want.\" There's a lot of smearing of education, for example to say that professors use teacher unions and the tenure system to do no work and collect huge salaries with no possibility of getting fired. A lot of people think that I (an English faculty) have a palatial office, with a fireplace where I sip wine and smoke a cigar while paging through Shakespeare. Which is pretty damn hilariously untrue, but nobody wants to hear it.\n\nThere's kind of an anti-intellectualism in America that's been brewing for a while. A lot of people who find out that I work as a college professor assume that I know nothing about what I do. They in fact think that knowing nothing about how to do things \"in the real world\" is exactly how you get a job as a professor. People tell me all the time, \"Those who can't do... teach!\"\n\nWhen that's the dominant narrative, it's pretty easy to see how people would generally be just fine with cutting back government funding for education.",

Colleges run like businesses here, and the product they sell is expensive out-of-state tuition. It gets funded through private loans, leading to an average debt of $30-40k after graduation. This has become accepted somehow.\n\n> As of 2018, a total of 44.2 Million borrowers now owe a total of over $1.5 Trillion in student debt. In addition to more borrowers, and the total amount owed having more than doubled (up 250%) from $600 Billion to $1.5 Trillion in 10 years, according to Forbes Magazine,[4] the rate of delinquency greater than 90 days, or default, has doubled to over 11% nationwide, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt#United_States\n\nIn my opinion, our higher ed system has pitched us the traditionalist American ethos of \"you can do it if only you try hard\" to sell \"college consumers\" a dream of success with extortionately high-interest rates. We do it with other products too after all!\n\nedits: I added some extra sentences and fleshed out the post to match the question better.",

Right now only 42% of Americans attend university and universities are pretty filled up. Maybe, we could make a little more room but definitely not double. That means that more than 50% of people have to pay for the minority of the population to get educated. The infrastructure is not there to support mass education. How would university handle an influx of applications in a fair way? Would this drive up competition? How would that affect already disadvantaged populations? The problem would, in a sense be amplified without passing some seriously questionable policies.\n\nPeople want universities to be free because they want other people to pay for their own decisions. Paying from taxes is not much different from taking out loans, it just affects everyone instead of yourself. People should be accountable for their own decisions, period. \n\nThat being said. The cost of college is too darn high here in America. Some intervention is in order, but changing to a tax based system is likely not it, unless people can selectively sign up for a lifetime of taxes in exchange for education and not tax everyone in mass, but that isn't much different from student loans. The difference is loans can always be paid off faster, benefitting those who make more while taxes would offer lower payment for those less successful. But don't tax everyone. We just need to fix the root problem that drives cost up. And this wouldn't even be a topic of conversation.",

So our school made 76 mill this year, and hired several six-figure administrators but my colleagues and I had to strike not to lose compensation and ended up with a 1% cost of living \u201craise\u201d which is actually not a raise at all but a pay cut in this economy. My adjunct colleagues, who are in a more precarious financial position, got less. Then the admins tried to turn the students against us by painting us as greedy piglets and latently blaming us for their tuition hike. This kind of thing is happening all over and politicians in power are happy to paint professors as elitist and greedy because then they can keep hiking tuition and blaming the profs.

Did they build a normal library?  Nope.  Every part of it was turned up to an 11.  They also recently built a brand new recreation center.  Did they build an average recreation center?  Nope.  They built one of the nicest ones in all of the country.  Then they built a lot of new dorms.  Did they build typical dorms?  Nope.  They built what essentially look like luxury dorms.  Add in all of the costs of maintaining these places and staffing them and whatever else is required and you can start to imagine why the prices rise quickly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they didn't build these, though, the students would go somewhere else where these are already built.  After all, wouldn't you want to live in a luxury dorm while studying at a luxury library and working out (maybe?) at a luxury gym if your parents or future you is paying for it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the students demanded low cost amenities for low cost education then they'd get that.  But they don't.  So they get high prices with luxury amenities.  I think that makes sense, but they should be more honest about what they are demanding when they look at the costs.  If you complain about it while reluctantly writing the checks, then the checks are still being written and nothing will change.",

Increase in administrative positions (by over 60% which is over 10 times the growth of faculty, who actually create courses and teach students - the supposed central aim of higher ed)\n4. Huge growth in executive and presidential salaries (many of which are close to or over $1 million)\n\nI would say less state and federal funding and student loans contribute, but maybe less so than assumed.

      "text": "Do you mean net price or sticker price? Those are two very different things.\n\nSticker price has risen because it allows the college to engage in price discrimination. Essentially, this allows them to charge students with rich or wealthy parents extraordinary amounts while also giving them leeway to offer merit and financial aid packages to other students. This way, they can charge the maximum amount of money they feel they can get from any given family on an individual basis. In effect, wealthier students are subsidizing poorer students via this setup.\n\n\nNet price is a different story. The net price that a student pays takes into account all grants, merit scholarships, and financial aid a student receives. While it varies from college to college, the average net price a student pays scales linearly with their income when viewed at the national level. \n\nFrom a tuition-only standpoint, the average net tuition that is paid has increased much more on par with inflation than the sticker price. However, the average  net price still outpaces with inflation. This is because *housing costs* have greatly outpaced inflation due to various reasons. That is to say, a large reason why college is becoming more expensive on-net is because renting apartments, living in dormitories, and so on has become far more expensive.",

I have one kid in college and one going soon (and \\~25 years as a faculty member, board member, etc.) so pay pretty careful attention to budgets and financial disclosures/tax filings. There are quite a few private schools with $50K tuition and $75K comprehensive price tags that are discounting 50-60% now, so the average student is paying about half the sticker price and of course revenue is nowhere near enrollment x tuition.\n\nSome schools are running multi-year structural deficits despite having $75K price tags.",

You can look to the creation of the program as the start of a crazy rise in costs. Since students would no longer need to pay for school up front and the government would offer them high interest loans to pay back later, supply didn't work with demand any longer. Students could attend college without the money to do so, and colleges found that raising tuition rates had no effect on the demand to go to college since everyone could take out loans to do it. This meant that schools could dream up whatever they want to spend money on, and then they'd just raise tuition and nobody would blink about paying it because of the loan program. \n\nIf one school heard that students chose a rival school because the rival school spent millions of dollars on a cool dining hall, well then that school would spend millions on a cooler dining hall and just raise tuition. An arms race began where schools could and would spend more and more money on amenities that had nothing to do with education because the federal loan program meant that students would still pay the tuition, no matter how crazy it got.\n\nI could go on and on as I have a master's in Higher Education Administration and worked in the world for years so I have a lot of info. But the short answer is that the federal student loan program made the cost of tuition less of a concern and thus made college's have no fear about raising tuition as high as they want and that created an arms race for pointless and expensive campus additions that sell the lifestyle of a school.",

A university professor cannot lecture more students than they could forty years ago, a physician cannot see more patients than they could forty years ago, a classical symphony cannot be performed by a smaller number of musicians than forty years ago. In order for wages to increase in these productivity-stagnant fields relative to the wages in fields where productivity has continually improved, the cost of the product (for instance, a college education) has to increase by a greater factor relative to the cost of consumer goods. \n  \nAnother way to think about it is that if inflation were the only factor, all consumer goods would have increased in price by a similar factor to tuition, but because some consumer goods have become cheaper to produce, their real cost has lowered enough to partially counterbalance the effects of inflation.",

          "text": ">A university professor cannot lecture more students than they could forty years ago\n\nNo, but workloads have dramatically increased for faculty over that period-- in many cases --just the same. We aren't necessarily teaching more students, but we are doing a hell of a lot more service work, more advising, more mentoring, and have taken on more of the general day-to-day work of the institution while still teaching the same classes. Hell, even when I was a student in the 80s faculty relied on staff-- secretaries --to take their phone calls, do their typing and copying, order their course materials, plan their travel, and in some cases even handle personal tasks for them. That's long gone; on my campus one \"coordinator\" now serves multiple departments and mostly does actual administrative work. \n\nSame with mentoring and other student-facing tasks. When I was a student we were expected to navigate college on our own, and if we had a question we'd stand in line during the 90 minutes of office hours available each week. Now, on my campus at least, faculty are meeting with students 10-15 hours a week, dealing with mental health crises, mentoring them into jobs/grad school, digging into the minutia of advising (\"which of these courses in Brazil will count for my Spanish minor? None? You mean they don't speak Spanish there?\"), and the like.\n\nCommittees now do far more of the labor on campus than before as well. And of course there are more committees than ever. Even over the course of my career (just under 25 years now) we've tracked the hours spent in teaching/research/service a few times and *none* of them ever go down-- what's happened instead is that most faculty are working more hours. But for (at best) flat compensation. So not more efficient from a labor input standpoint, but certainly more efficient from a *cost* standpoint as tasks have been shifted onto faculty or as new needs arise those too are added to the faculty plate.",

      "text": "I've asked myself the same question allot lol. I'll  start off with my exp with school tuition.  I've had the pleasure to go to a few different colleges because my job moved me around allot (Army). In my travels the cost of my tuition could drastically be different because of allot of factors. When I went to Palm beach college in Boca Raton , Florida my tuition was $1200 per semester, I later transferred to BMCC in NYC and my tuition  almost tripled.  Now you could say that NYC just happen to be a very expensive in general, but I would counter that with saying that Boca Raton a very rich and expensive city.  When I lived outside of Nashville the cost was about $1000 per semester. I then attend Embry riddle university, which I admit is a private University but I must have been paying at least $4500 semester (don't remember the exact number).  Also want to say that while Embry riddle is a good school, it was defiantly not worth 4 times the tuition, especially when I am not getting 4 times the education.\n\nGuaranteed Student loans by the government is a huge problem.  The school knows that no matter what they charge the student wanting to attend is going to pay up that cost especially if its not goin to come out of their pocket (at least not initially).  So if the University knows your goin to pay what ever price they want, why would they be incentivized to lower their cost? I am not saying that their being opportunities for students to get loans from the government vs a private institution is not a good thing, but their is a huge problem of ppl defaulting on those loans and not understanding the consequences of owing that much money.  \n\nIt doesn't have to be expensive.  University vs Community college. This is also a real big problem.  Most ppl could go to a community college and for the first 2 years and then transfer to another university and graduate with the same exact diploma with a fraction of the cost. By fraction I mean like $13,000 and double that if they go to the community college for all 4 years. The problem is that allot of ppl don't want to go to a community college because they want to have \"the full college exp\" which most times means parties lol.\n\nThese colleges are bloated with administrative staff that would be better spent on hiring more professors and getting the part time ones full time gigs.  Most of the stuff like signing up for classes you could do on your own and all online with out the need for all that administration.  You have deans, presidents, chancellors their assistant, their assistants assistant and so on.\n\nFood for thought:\n\n\\*Why is college 4 years long?  I have some buddies in other countries and they get done in 3 years, effectively saving them a whole years worth of tuition.\n\n\\*We could save some money by changing the 2 years of prerequisite, which I find a waste of time and which could be more effectively be used to focus on our major\n\n\\*The one that really gets me to is \"out of state tuition\".  Its fuckin ridiculous that someone would even agree to pay sometimes triple the average tuition  \n\nThe role of extraarticular activates and their cost on campus.  Think about the controversy  actress that paid for her daughter to go to UCLA.  These sports programs are corrupt, by not paying their athletes the cost of the \"special dorms\" these athletes get. Which the universities Also make a shit ton from.\n\n\\*\\*I see allot of ppl hating on how this country doesn't have free tuition, but remember that allot of ppl come to the USA because we do have some pretty good colleges and choose that over what would have been a free education in their country.",

Each department needs it's own high salaried Dean, assistant dean, associate dean, provost, assistant provosts, and office of staff. Many of these departments could be consolidated to reduce burden and overlap but it makes the university look good.\n\nI will, however, defend the institutions need to expand it's infrastructure. New buildings means more research, more education, more students, and can attract better everything in time. It's necessary and a net benefit to the world. \n\nAs far as time to graduate. Universities really need to bug off with diversity and gen ed requirements. Being forced to take 2.5 years of classes that don't help with your major is a huge problem. 4 semesters of foreign language in America? Why is that mandated? Four courses on diversity and inclusion? 4 humanities courses when you major in STEM? Seriously classes like Harry Potter or Fly Fishing? These should be electives, not requirements. Such a waste of time and money. There were some of these requirements when I was in undergrad around 05 but nowhere near the nonsense today. How about actually improving the curriculum to develop job related skills instead of simply providing a theoretical background.\n\nAnd I do not agree with free education. I don't want to pay for someone else to attend college on my dime, especially if not everyone can go to college because it's too competitive, and especially if half of these people aren't educating themselves in a way that gives back to the world. But, the cost of school simply is too darn high. For me undergrad was ~1k for community and 5k for uni per semester. Now those same schools are 3k and 8k per semester each and that was about a decade ago. Pair that with the cost of living hikes.... I know the average debt is 50k but that includes people with parental support and those who work. The actual cost is over 100k, that's stupid.",

When a business (& contemporary universities/colleges **are** businesses first & foremost - not something I'm happy about with but an indisputable fact) knows its customers (or victims in the case of higher \"ed\") can pay *n* dollars + subsidy, they raise their prices accordingly with the idea that the consumer will only directly feel the same *n* dollars leave their pocket. This trend arguably began with the GI Bill & the continuing militarization of American society/economy, but today has become reinforced socially [superstructure] by the contradictory American myths that \"college is necessary for a better life\" but also \"college is the best years of your life.\"\n\nAs universities gained more capital, they began to push propaganda harder on children - supported by parents for whom simply \"getting a degree\" was an automatic gateway to the middle class. Neoliberal capitalism (de-industrialization) proved this a lie, but the post-war generation unfortunately developed a higher cost tolerance for college/uni b/c of its presumption as an automatic status good. It cannot be ignored either that universities began increasingly marketing themselves as \"experiences\" rather than educational. This is a major avenue of exploitation for colleges/universities; many (including my state-school alma mater) are as, if not more, invested in the housing, food service, parking, etc. industries as they are in education. There's a reason that as the price increases, universities/colleges increasing justify this by becoming horrific neo-companytowns where everything from security/police to healthcare & dining fall under their purview. From explicit \"party-schools\" to clubs, sports, & facilities the colleges/universities fully embraced the headlong death-charge of unrelenting capitalism; forward - bigger - more. Pick where you want to start but the cycle generally looks like this\n\nMore facilties/etc = charge more money = more loans = more capital to admin = more facilities/etc = [repeat until it explored in a shower of debtors & golden parachutes]",

      "text": "I think the reason American college tuition has exploded in cost is because of the way we decided to fund it. Rather than just having the state chip in, we made our young people buy debt, and had the state underwrite that debt. This was done ostensibly to ensure access, but the effect was to shower money on college campuses. Then to compete among themselves colleges start spending more and more on facilities, programs at cetera. So prices move up in aggregate. Crucially the cost of the debt (interest rate) that these students were buying was kept artificially low by the government backing. This sounds nice that we\u2019re trying to limit the interest that college students pay, but in effect keeping the interest rates low has the effect of driving up prices, which all but negated the social benefit of keeping rates low. This is similar to how the government backing of mortgage debt (through Fannie Mae and QE) has widely driven up housing prices. \n\nAt the end of the day, using debt to fund social spending is idiotic. Regardless if you try to control interest rates or whatever, you\u2019re going to have the same dysfunctional outcome - extreme price inflation. Human capital is like infrastructure to a country. Investing in peoples\u2019 education pays dividends to the country\u2019s GDP decades later. Using government backed debt to accomplish that simply doesn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s generally speaking the biggest single policy failure we have from the 1960s onwards. \n\nWe pay for K-12 with taxes because it\u2019s an investment in the public good, why does that stop with college or graduate school?  It makes no sense to me.",

      "text": "The US governmnet started offering student loan services for people to be able to access colleges at affordable prices. Private entities decided they'd like to compete with the government in loan service distribution. This artificially drove up the cost of universities as, basically its just taking free money at whatever price they want per head because college is essential for gaining access to upwardly mobile opportunities and as long as student loans are a thing the high cost goes on the student and not on the institution. Over the last 40 years then, it created a phenomenon in which colleges and universities can charge upwards of $30k-70k per student per year, and expect for most of that cost to be covered in loans (free money). And every few years or so, the tuition costs rise, and rather than seeing that money spill over into paying professors wages where they can afford to pay back their own student loans or anything useful, the higher ups pocket most of the surplus, and remodel buildings that don't need it, and plaster the walls with TVs that aren't needed.",

      "text": "99% of people who answer this will be incorrect because they don\u2019t look at what caused the beginning of the tuition explosion. \n\nThe federal government decided to take part in student loans. The year after this, college tuition jumped enormously and continues to jump because each year the government gives out more. These are loans that can basically be made to anyone for unreasonable amounts of money ($100,000+). The federal government practically has unlimited money for our purposes here. The federal government will just keep giving them out and does not care about whether or not they can feasibly be paid back. So the federal government is basically giving away billions in free money that can only be spent at colleges. \n\nSo obviously colleges raise their prices. After all, why not? Colleges are businesses first and foremost and there\u2019s billions in free college bucks floating around. Before this, only companies like banks gave out loans for tuition. But they wouldn\u2019t loan to just anyone. These are companies that don\u2019t have unlimited money and care about profit so they need to get paid back (which the federal government doesn\u2019t care about) and so they\u2019ll only loan out money for college in certain circumstances where the person can feasibly pay it back. So fewer people will have the funds necessary to go to college. Once the federal government gets involved (which doesn\u2019t care about making loans that can be paid back), everyone (including people who previously couldn\u2019t afford college) can easily get tens and tens of thousands of college dollars in their pocket at the federal government\u2019s expense. \n\nIf there is a currency that can only be spent at one place and there is an unfathomable amount of that currency circulating around with nary a care for whose pocket it ends up in, that one place will increase its prices to snag as much of that currency as it can. Like imagine if everything at Walmart needed to be bought with WallyBucks. A single sock could be like 100 WallyBucks because Walmart wants to soak up every drop of WallyBucks. There\u2019s no competition for Walmart because it is the only business privy to WallyBucks (so they might they as well raise their prices) just like there\u2019s no competition for universities and colleges because they\u2019re the only ones privy to federal student loans (so they might as well raise their prices). If Walmart did do something like this, we\u2019d all just go to Target or Kmart. But there\u2019s no substitute for college. So we have to use the federal student loans. \n\nBecause virtually anyone can get $100,000 in student loans, unqualified and uncaring people are getting loans for unreasonable amounts of money which they don\u2019t have a system to pay back. \n\nThe federal government started giving out student loans. That allowed more people to go to college than ever before. That also meant that the overwhelming vast majority of the people going to college who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to without the federal student loans will be in horrific debt. Before, only certain people could go to college (people who were rich or people who had good plans to pay their loans back). That meant that student debt wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nSo to recap: the federal government gives out student loans to basically everyone for no reason at all. More people get to go to college. But now everyone wants to go to college and they get in deep debt. Now the economy is sagging because everyone is broke and in debt. If the federal government got out of student loans, college tuition everywhere would plummet because the colleges would have very few customers.",
