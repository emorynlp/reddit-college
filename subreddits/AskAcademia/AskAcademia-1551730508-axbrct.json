  "text": "I am visiting the campus of a PhD program that has offered me admission. Since their offer, I have Skyped for an interview, corresponded via email with various faculty members in my field of interest, with current graduate students, and with the GPD. So my basic questions about funding, research, resources etc have already been answered. This Open House is a two day event where I will be interacting with potential advisors and peers for most of the day each day. I was wondering what kind of events take place, what kind of questions I should be asking during one on one conversations with faculty as well as during panel sessions. Please help! Thank you!!!",

How often do they meet with their students? What's their average turnaround time for comments on a chapter draft? Do they usually initiate contact with their students, or is it expected that you will be the main driver of the relationship? How many students have they graduated, and where are they now? Do they co-author with their students? Do they bring students with them to conferences? What's their position on mental health issues in grad school/academia?",

You say you've already covered research questions, but get to really know the interests of the people around you. There's no way you can know everything about every research experience they have ever had, so there will always be room for the conversation to grow naturally in whatever direction is a common interest between you. Find out more specifics about their projects and techniques. Ask questions that show you're engaged in the conversation and interested in what they are saying. I find this is a great way to interact with people who are judging whether or not they will enjoy working with you for years to come. They want to know you have the potential to bring new insights and ideas into the department.\n\nI'll add the caveat that you don't want to come off as aggressive or know-it-all. If you are familiar with a topic, that's great. If you're not, it's an opportunity to learn something. Don't pretend you know their research if you don't. To me, a graduate program is all about learning how to ask appropriate questions, to make sense of difficult concepts. It's not about pretending how much you know. It's about using a common base of knowledge to expand into new areas you haven't thought much about before. That's what you want to convey to the faculty - that you're interested and engaged in the material and can offer the ability to think critically about topics.",
