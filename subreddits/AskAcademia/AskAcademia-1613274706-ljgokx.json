  "title:": "How to read long tedious research articles?",
  "text": "Sorry, allow me to reword that, I just didn\u2019t know how to condense what I\u2019m saying into a few words. It\u2019s not the article itself I find boring, and most of the time the topic is fascinating, and the way it\u2019s written could be engaging and relevant, but I find the act of reading itself hard. The second I see a long wall of text, part of my brain shuts down, and add on the bigger fancy terms and academic lingo and I find myself reading the same lines over and over again a hundred times, with nothing going in my head. So basically, the reason I find it boring is essentially this: I\u2019m not learning anything, and that frustrates me.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss because for my classes I need to read a lot, and I thoroughly enjoy thinking about and discussing the material, but I literally lose all ability to think the second I see a large wall of text.\n\nI would love to continue with the fields I\u2019m studying, and apart from some imposter syndrome I feel I could do well, but reading (which is obviously a HUGE part of academic studies) seems to be something I just cannot do. It makes me really sad because nothing thrills me more than learning something new. So my questions are these: is it possible that academia is just not for me despite my love for learning, or am I just approaching it wrong? And secondly, how can I improve my reading skills?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: you guys. Thank you so much for all your tips. Feel free to add any more info, but I just want to say - you guys have all been so supportive and all your answers are so useful! I'm going to try using tips from here next time I have to read, but thank you all so much! I genuinely feel like I can do better now, I already tried most of your advices and it worked.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "I\u2019m recently diagnosed with ADHD and struggle with this (and maybe you should have a look at adult ADHD as well..?). My methods for my MA classes have been to take elaborate, but efficient and precise notes that make me summarize and \u2018focus\u2019 the content. I don\u2019t necessarily look at it again, but just doing it keeps me focused and makes me learn the content. Problem is that takes a long time, so I made a study group of 4-5 people where we all take notes of one or two articles per week and share with each other. That way I get the focused notes from the others to at least get an idea of the other articles, which is also useful when scrolling through the articles, and I also at least have one that I properly read and learn. The other students are very happy with it as well, and it holds us accountable. \n\nAlso - I\u2019m taking a linguistics class where there\u2019s a lot of fancy word and concepts I\u2019m unfamiliar with. When reading, I make sure to look up the linguistical terms that I don\u2019t understand, and make a good word list. That\u2019s also nice to share with my fellow students who probably struggle with the same. \n\nGood luck!",

ADHD is definitely a spectrum/continuum though, so you could be higher than most on that spectrum, while still lower than those who are diagnosed. Symptoms can also be reduced as we get older.\n\nToo bad that it\u2019s expensive! Is there not even any free help at the university? You might still learn a lot from reading about it though and look for ADHD-specific study strategies. For me it was (and is) incredibly helpful to learn about ADHD and how to deal with it, also before I was diagnosed. Also, medication is just a small part of the treatment, and all those other ways to reduce my symptoms is something I largely need to figure out myself. I get ideas and tips of what have worked for others through Reddit, YouTube, and online articles, and then I try it out and see if it works for me. \n\nGood luck either way!",

This helps the student build a social network within the field, and that's really, really useful when they're building their CV and hunting for jobs.\n\nBasically there's a whole plan behind not getting hung up on who's doing what at an early stage.

I definitely want to understand the take-always (ie the abstract and conclusion) to see if what they\u2019re doing is applicable to what I need. \n\nOP wanted to break up the monotonous wall of text and I gave them my method - bouncing around. The boring bits are more palatable once you know the context of the story. \n\nYour comment that this is a half-assed approach is insulting and I assume you\u2019re pretty junior to be saying so.

I also do for words I don't know (I'm in humanities, so this happens more often than I'd like).

I had to read A LOT of papers to finish my thesis ( I think I ended around 130) plus several  technical documents, books and handbooks.\n\nYou can't just power through because by doing so,  you'll only get burn out. I recommend you to read the paper \" how to read a paper\" (can't link since I'm on phone).\n\nYou need a timer. The method consist of three phases and  goes as following:\n\n1. Set timer at 5 minutes. If it has a table of contents, that's the first thing you should read. Then read the abstract and recognize all the figures and ecuations in this pass. Then read conclusion. At this stage you should discern if the document is useful or not for your research. If useful, continue to step 2.\n\n2. Set timer at 20 minutes. Do a deeper reading and look for useful things for your research. Highlight the relevant things. If time runs out, you can take a small break (5 minutes in timer), put your thoughts in order and set another timer in 20 minutes. Repeat as many times as necessary until you finish the document, but try to take less than 1 hour in this step.\n\n3. Ok, now you have read the document 2 times and you have deemed that it's still relevant to your work and you could use it. This is were the hard work starts. You need a notebook to take notes, you look for things that you can quote and most importantly, verify all equations and try to replicate the results obtained in your work.this step should take 5 hours at most.\n\nYou have to start thinking that you will not get everything in the first read, you'll need several passes to make it not overwhelming. Even if you complete step 3, and you're not satisfied with the results obtained, you should continue to look into other documents. That's why it's important to set a timer and not spend a lot of time reviewing a paper.\n\nI wish you the best of lucks and feel free to ask me anything.",

But most of all, they offer you more data to move your knowledge or research forward.  If you're not seeing the blue of reading those articles then you may just need to take an extended break for a while and allow your brain to rest, then come to those long articles refreshed.",

Some articles are really dense and hard to read. There are, however, strategies that can help. Start with the abstract. If that doesn't give you everything you need, go on to read the intro and conclusion. Only read the rest when you're really interested or want to know the nitty gritty. The lit review, methods, and results can be pretty technical...especially the methods.",

Once an article is in the program, I can search for what I need, organize it into folders, add tags, highlight the thesis and info/quotes I think I might use later.\n\nI also take handwritten notes. I use the Cornell method, and I like using the Moleskin Pro Notebooks since they already have the pages divided for this type of note taking plus page numbers and a contents list so I can keep my topics organized in sections. I love these notebooks and I find it motivates me to read more than a regular notebook. If I\u2019m struggling, I try to just read enough of the article to fill one page of notes (basically outline the main points and pull some other references).\n\nI teach reading and writing. Reading is a learned skill and unfortunately, most schools don\u2019t really teach people how to read research papers. You won\u2019t need to read every word all the time. I HATED research before, but now that I know how to read it, I quite enjoy it. Maybe consider watching some videos on reading and note taking methods to find what works for you. Im also a fan of annotated bibliographies.\n\nAlso, we all struggle with imposter syndrome at some point. For me, my perfectionism and imposter syndrome keep my procrastinating until the last minute. Therapy has helped me figure out what was \u201creally\u201d going on many times I was struggling with academic work.\n\nGood luck\u2014you can do it!",

      "text": "If you're in a field where reading long, tedious articles is the norm, then you'll just have to learn to do it. It is a skill. You can improve it. Nobody was born knowing how to read such things. \n\nWe live in a world in which there are many things competing for our attention, and one of the forms this takes is \"bite-sized,\" instant information that is instantly stimulating but ultimately lacking depth. It is the difference between an article on CNN's website, and an article in the New York Times, and an article in the New Yorker, and an article in the New York Review of Books, to just give a spectrum of length and depth. My (mostly STEM) students initially struggle to do much more than the New York Times level of reading \u2014\u00a0they find New Yorker articles to be almost unbearably long, and I would never dream of giving them something like the NYRB. But those who stick with majors that require long, careful reading can, by the time they are upperclassmen, read very complex and long works. \n\nYou can train your brain to do better at this. You will get better and better over time. I've seen it in students, I've seen it in myself. \n\nI understand the \"wall of text\" aspect. There are probably little things you can do to improve it. For one, don't try to read everything in one go. You don't need to. Break it up into sensible sections, and take short breaks if you need them. Second, if you are reading it in a forum where you can change the width of the text, make the margins wider so the text column is smaller. This makes it much easier to keep track of where you are in the text as you make your way through it. Taking notes as you go can help you keep on the thread and make it feel less aimless. And lastly, of course, make your reading into a routine where you eliminate the other distractions in your life. You cannot expect a long article to compete with corporations that have monetized your attention-span.\n\nDon't despair. Everyone starts off with these difficulties. Everyone struggles with this as a student. Your brain is a pliant thing. If you bathe it in something (a style of writing, a new language, a new way of thinking, a new musical instrument) it will gradually \u2014 painfully, but gradually \u2014 adapt to it. Have confidence in yourself and your brain; don't take \"no\" for an answer from it.",

Now  read the article 2 times by avoiding the technical jargons,by this method we will able to know the pulse of the story(article),now note down the technical  jargons (treat them separately for better understanding,use highlighters), most of the research topics lie on a common protocol of technicalities,in future while reading  similar articles it will help us to follow a common protocol (understanding jargons),visualise a story,from start to the end,try to read them in a reverse manner also.(Above mentioned strategy can be used for a person who is trying to access the research articles for the first time)",

Like reading Einstein\u2019s first relativity paper was not easy for anyone, even those versed in his discipline, because it was unorthodox. But this is part of how academics have traditionally disseminated their ideas. And of course that gate keeping is marred by hierarchies of privilege and oppression. But, now we have YouTube and everyone and anyone Can share their ideas and opinions in a variety of ways without concern for what has traditionally been characterized as rigorous research. So in a world where everyone can be an author of ideas, it seems important to distinguish academic scholarship through certain criteria, like: identifying and building on a lineage of ideas, using evidence to support and refute arguments, aligning theory and methods, reporting on implementation so that it could be replicated by others, reporting on findings in detail, etc. That said, text IS a barrier to comprehending the ideas so I fully support using assistive tech (eg have text read out loud) and strategies like chunking prioritized information. But like, skipping reading the methods entirely because it\u2019s hard, boring, or we don\u2019t understand it well enough yet is really problematic ultimately bc it perpetuates the citation of findings that come from methodologically flawed research.",

If you could have mild dyslexia (see: \nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/dyslexia-in-adults#treatment), maybe you need a really good checkup and a talk with an occupational therapist. \n\n- If you used to read long things for fun but don\u2019t anymore: Could it be that your eyes need attention? If so, try to get the best possible eye checkup you can get, including an eye muscle check. Maybe, technically, you have great vision, but your eyes don\u2019t work together very well. Or, you simply have untreated myopia or presbyopia. \n\n- Are you trying to save the Earth by reading complicated papers on the computer? If so, stop doing that. Most computer screens are terrible. If you know from the abstract and the conclusion that you want to read a whole dense article, print it out. Printing on both sides of the page is great.
