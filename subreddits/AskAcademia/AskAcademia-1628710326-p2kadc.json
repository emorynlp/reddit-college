They will include the equivalent of MA level classes and you can always leave with an MA. Advantage is: they are usually funded, while terminal MA programs usually are not.",

I can speak for the UK.\nUCL is very good as will be the Courtauld, you would some of the largest galleries in the world to explore. Cambridge is good too with ready access to London and elsewhere. There's some very good people at York as well. Have a look through some of the staff profiles and see what interests you.",
