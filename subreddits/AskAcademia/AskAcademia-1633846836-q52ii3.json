I got similar emails a few times where they were asking if this paper published by such and such is me, which totally isn't. The authors of the paper didn't even have the same name as me, probably just a 75% match or something, and somehow they insist on asking why is it not me and stuff.\n\nI got some notifications on the site saying that my name was mentioned a few times somewhere, but required me to go premium to view where it was mentioned. Now that I think about it, it's probably their mismatched naming issues too; decided to totally ignore them after the few times of this happening. Sorry, just had to rant somehow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have never used this site, or atleast knowingly - maybe I searched peer reviews and something came up but I don\u2019t remember..\n\nProbably you signed up for Mendeley or something Elsevier-related to view papers, which is why you got \"signed up\" on the site I guess.",
