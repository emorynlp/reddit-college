Looking back on it now, though, it's one of the many ways we were asked (I'm tenured now) to do unpaid labor out of \"love\" for our job and students, and I wish the students we gladly write letters for were aware of the contingent nature of adjunct labor.",

      "text": "Your letter will still be valuable, but if you think she should also ask for other people's letters then that is fine. You can have a conversation with her about your own doubts and still write the letter. These are not mutually exclusive activities.
