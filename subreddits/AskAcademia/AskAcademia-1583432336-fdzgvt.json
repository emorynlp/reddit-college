  "title:": "How do academics become multi-disciplinary, like Chomsky?",
  "text": "So, what I mean by the title is this: take someone like Noam Chomsky. His PhD and a lot of his work is in linguistics, he made huge strides in that field and some of his ideas about how language works has influenced programming languages in computer science. Somewhat independently from this, he is also considered a major player in the world of anarcho-syndicalist philosophy.\n\nAs another example, though on a much smaller scale, there is a professor at my university with a PhD in math who teaches graph theory and cryptography, but once a year teaches a class on the Hebrew language.\n\nHow does one go about taking part in these two separate fields and actually be taken seriously? If someone starts publishing in another field, will people kinda look at them and be like WTF, the way Jordan Peterson is with his poor attempt at philosophy, while still being respected in his original field of psychology?\n\nThis is just something that is really interesting to me and I was wondering how it works.\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I believe essentially the question boils down to: How do you effectively become an academic participating in two fields?",

      "text": "I think this can sometimes happen accidentally and has a lot to do with your specialization. I'm a history PhD, but ended up writing my dissertation on gender history, so I've ended up reading a lot of gender theory, sociology, and anthropology.\n\nAlso remember that disciplinary boundaries are fairly artificial. At least in the social sciences and humanities, we're often pulling from similar intellectual genealogy, so you see a lot of crossover - especially from academics who are more advanced in their career. As far as getting published in multiple fields, seems like it has a lot to do with being established as a scholar and ensuring that you've done your due diligence getting up-to-speed on theory.",

When he showed his doctor (at the University, as well), the doctor suggested that they write it up for publication in an ophthalmology conference, and when they did the paper was accepted.

People who do real linguistic research where they collect empirical language data in real human societies do not usually have time for a side career in political critique. As much as I tend to agree with Chomsky's political stance, his scientific views don't look to stand the test of time, to tell the truth, and are deeply problematic if you care about language diversity.",

These are words that come straight out of his mouth.\n\nSecond, he's not really about introspection (he specifically says that you can not introspect anymore about your brain than you could about your liver), but about rationalism. He came at linguistics when it was an entirely data based field that was largely about collecting a bunch of data and then seeing what you could find in it, which isn't scientific (pure empiricism is bad, a lot of people struggle with this idea given the hold of big data and the likes). What he pushed for instead was a hypothesis driven approach, where you are starting with a hypothesis that is guiding you towards what specific kind of data you want to analyse to test it. All he did was bring the scientific method to linguistics, and it's here to stay.\n\nLastly, the whole drive behind his linguistics work is the idea that Language is a biological property, like vision, so in that sense, testing the adequacy of a sentence in your head is a perfectly valid way to explore data and test hypothesis. These are not intuitions we are dealing with, they are checks of adequacy with our inbuilt language systems. And adequacy checks are still used hugely.\n\nAnd even if you don't follow chomskian language philosophy, his robust formalisation of phrase structure grammars \n and language hierarchies are still widely used in many fields.\n\nIf you want to talk about Chomsky, you really need to read his \"syntactic structures\". It's not very long, and it lays out all his motivations and base ideas. He's too controversial a figure to get a good understanding of based on word of mouth alone.",

Your opinion is yours to have, but you didn't really address anything I said.\n\n> It's not a hypothesis if you can't test it, and it never was.\n\nIn linguistics, a grammar can be a hypothesis. You can test that hypothesis by seeing if it predicts sentences that fail an adequacy check, or if it fails to predict sentences that pass an adequacy check. The former is the preferable check for hypothesis testing because a theory that predicts things that do not occur is far worse than a theory that doesn't predict things that do occur.\n\nThe requirements of a hypothesis be that it objectively predicts something, and that that something is objectively falsifiable. Chomsky's generative grammar fills this role.\n\nQuick question: if you are a professional linguist, why  did you highlight the fact that Chomsky only speaks English as if it was some detrimental factor to being a linguist?

I'm sure you are just fine that nearly all of the world's languages are endangered, but we have \"linguistics experts\" making up sentences in their offices getting the salaires that people working with minority language communities could be paid. But I'm not ok with it. There are not enough resources to subsidize pseudoscience while language are being killed off. Since the speakers are not rich and largely live in their third world, who cares? Just stick to your own privileged, ethnocentric life, and everything will be fine. Personally I'm pretty frustrated about it, so if you keep talking to me, you'll just hear more of it. I do what I can to change the situation of language endangerment by day, and vent a bit to asses on the internet at night. Go away.",

If the liberal arts can be life-enhancing, why is there such scorn for academics who actually try to follow through and deliver useful wisdom for ordinary people?",

You should see the letter he wrote to his father, saying something along the lines of having discovered something no-one else has running though the entirety of human history. Delusions of Grandeur come to mind.  But to be fair, he wrote that when he was younger, maybe he's grown since then.",

I just know that he\u2019s never released any academic philosophy papers or attempted to introduce himself as a philosopher. He has used the nebulous term \u201cintellectual\u201d so who knows with him. In fairness, maps of meaning might be intended as philosophical work as well, but it\u2019s also reasonable that a Neojungian psychoanalytic would attempt a project such as that. I just don\u2019t think he has formally claimed to be breaking into the field of philosophy or released any philosophy papers, so I want to be careful before we label him as \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d and mock his philosophy career. His Wikipedia page also says nothing about being a philosopher.\n\nDoes he wish he was a philosopher? Probably. But I don\u2019t think he is. It\u2019s a grey area at the very least and depends on how you view jungian psychology.",

You might be a historical linguist, a typologist, you might be a sociolinguist, and so Linguistics might also overlap with politics, history, etc... So for example if you work on language policies you've got to know the laws and the politics. My formation as a linguist included (other than Linguistics itself) the history of a particular language (and so you get to know the history of a country), anthropology, pedagogy, literature, philosophy, some mathematics and computer science. Also note that 'Linguistics itself' also includes cognitive science. So in a sense even though I write about morphosyntax I am also interested about those topics.",

I looked over my transcripts once and I have graduate coursework in over a dozen different disciplines (largely humanities and social science). I worked with interdisciplinary scholars as a graduate student and have taught courses in multiple fields over the last 25 years because my specialization is inherently interdisciplinary: I'm an environmental historian.  I have published in humanities, social science, and even STEM journals (though that last was on pedagogy) and often work with interdisciplinary teams or with other interdisciplinary scholars with different backgrounds (like biogeographers, anthropologists, and political ecologists). Some of us also embrace the label of \"public intellectual,\" so writing for general/lay audiences as interpreters of more technical material, on public policy, and the like.",

      "text": "At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, there's really no such thing as academic fields, they're tools for differentiating qualifications and that's basically it. They're vague general ideas that we can kinda loosely place in boxes, but in the modern day at least the lines are becoming so blurred between them and webbed together that I'm beginning to question if their existence is more problematic than it is useful.\n\nI started with Mathematics and Physics but was initially somewhat interested in the philosophy behind the sciences and how we rationally justified using the systems and philosophical thought we did, but that rarely gets discussed, rather just assumed. When trying to understand the universe, I failed my degree due to mental health issues and questioned: how can I understand the world without understanding the biological and psychological lens through which I'm looking at it, or the foundations for the tools I'm using to understand it like logic, linguistics, etc. Understanding why we've developed such psychological tools can be deepened through studying artificial intelligence and evolutionary psychology, etc. The latter of which is itself somewhat explained by game theory and principles found in machine learning, etc. Psychology is obviously tied into neuroscience, which is itself somewhat tied into computer science, biology and information theory, etc. Psychology amongst many other things seems to feed into criminology, philosophy, economics, education, politics, languages, religion, ethics, etc. Honestly it all just goes on and on and on in an enormous graph that makes you question the utility of the nodes in the first place. \n\nI guess the point I'm making is that defined fields of study are stupid, question everything. Unceasing skepticism takes you to unimaginably interesting places, to constrain it is to castrate it.",
