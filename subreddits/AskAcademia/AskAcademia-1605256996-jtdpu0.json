Both Shannon and Gibbs   are studying  large networks (or ensembles) which grow  exponentially with each node, so you take the log to get a linear measure on the phase space.  The difference is that for Gibbs the phase space is *atomic configurations within a volume*, while for Shannon it is *word configurations within a sentence*.  Shannon's big insight was to use this to measure fidelity over a noisy channel, which is important, but Gibb's big insight was the Gibb's paradox, which predated quantum mechanics and anticipated indistinguishable particles.  Gibbs didn't know quantum, so his arguments were sort of the first evidence that quantum exists.  Most alternative theories to quantum are ruled out by the Gibb's paradox, but you'll never hear a Bhomian admit it because they are incapable of conceding defeat.",

Excellence is accomplished through the doing of actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully, habitualized, compounded together, added up over time. While these actions are \"qualitatively different\" from those of performers at over levels, these differences are neither unmanageable nor, taken one step at a time, terribly difficult. Mary T. Meagher came to practice on time; some writers always work for three hours each morning, before beginning anything else; a business person may go ahead and make that tough phone call; a job applicant writes one more letter; a runner decides, against the odds, to enter the race; a county commissioner submits a petition to run for Congress; a teenager asks for a date; an actor attends one more audition. Every time a decision comes up, the qualitatively \"correct\" choice will be made. The action, in itself, is nothing special; the care and consistency with which it is made is.\n\nAn open link: https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf",

The science is very good, but the part that always stood out to be about this paper is how well written it is. They took a dauntingly complex topic and made it so easy to understand by matching an intuitive color coding scheme the 'five' chromatin regions based on gene expression (black: low or off, blue/green: mild, red/yellow: high). That has always stuck with me. It's been years since I've read that paper and I still recall the color scheme, which is a testament to their ability to communicate their results brilliantly.",
