  "text": "I have a 2yo and am about to be divorced. I have been contemplating a career change to academia and/or wildlife sciences and wildlife management. I believe that in order to do this I would need a graduate degree of some sort. Is getting a Masters or PhD with a small, daycare-age child feasible?\n\nMy soon-to-be-ex-husband is saying if I want to get my advanced degree I will have to give him full custody of my daughter because financially and time-wise its not possible. Advice? Comments? Anyone who has successfully done this and can advise one way or the other? Concerns and solutions?",

      "text": "So I\u2019ve recently started taking care of my mom who has dementia, on a postdoc stipend. I think in many ways it\u2019s like taking care of a toddler as a single parent. There\u2019s no one to help around the house at all, no one to shuttle between or schedule endless doctors appointments, no one to provide support in any capacity, just endless need. It is exceedingly difficult to spend the amount t of time I need to spend doing science with these responsibilities.\n\nSomeone posted here sometime ago about Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying that having a family forced her to be more deliberate about her working hours. I think if you feel mentally strong and like you have a stable support system you should be able to manage. \n\nWithout a support system I can tell you it is exceedingly difficult to meet the demands of the job while being a kind, patient, caring human at home.",

There's not really an environment where you, a legal adult, have to give another legal adult your child outside of a court order. In which case you should probably speak to a lawyer.\n\nThe nice thing about grad school is that you have a lot of control over your schedule and where you physically are (although, again, field dependent - if you're an experimentalist or a field scientist, your experiment rules your life and you have to be in the field/in the lab). But, it doesn't pay much (in case of master's, not at all), it's a fair amount of work (def 40 hours+) that requires high concentration and thus is less than ideal to be done while watching a child, not all institutions are fully supportive (and some will pull stunts like take away grad students' health insurance a month before matriculation...), and the life after a PhD is precarious in most fields geographically and income wise. \n\nfwiw not in wildlife science but a few of my college buddies went on to work for national parks and they have just BAs, often in bio but just as often in random stuff like American Studies.",

Universities, research-based as they are, will have some sort of low cost daycare program in order to give students in their departments some training. Im sure there's a willing body of developmental psych grads or social work students who do their own research in daycare settings in exchange for the practical experience they can get via childcare. Similar to the requirement for clinical students to work with community clients In a practicum. My programs, at least, have all been like this! It's definitely worth looking in to.",

The most important thing: after you finish your PhD, if you want an academic career, the clock starts ticking. The period after the terminal degree (PhD) is counted. Many opportunities will be open only for people with X years since the PhD. Women who take a long leave AFTER their PhD regret it. Take it during. No one cares if the PhD took you 3 years or 8 years to finish. It does matter, greatly, how many years pass AFTER the PhD, for many opportunities.",

Some countries give out special financial help to parents studying and universities nowadays mostly all have a parent-student association were you can reach out to them and see what kind of support you can get. Note that some have very elaborated policies and resources, look into it!\n\n\\-What field are you planning to study in? Some will require more on-campus work with crazy hours (if you need to be in the lab for example) and other will have more flexibility\n\n\\-Let's be honest, do you have family/ friends support to help balance the time management issues you'll encounter? I know we hear \"it takes a village\" but yep as a student it's even more accurate\n\nMoney wise:\n\n\\-Do you plan on working part-time at your current job (many do this when they come back to grad school after kids)? Or you can do a part-time Master? Par-time is not a good idea for a phd though.\n\n\\-Will you receive financial support when divorced? You most likely will and even more if you split custody with the father, so take it into account too since most countries have mandatory obligations in the laws, you wouldn't be penniless either...\n\n\\-Are scholarships available in the field you are going into? Would you be garanteed funding? Would you be limited to work in the university or can you work outside too?\n\n\\-Do you have financial resources that you can use during this period? Are you open to getting a loan?\n\nIn the end know it's possible and many many women do it (and some single men too!). i'm not saying it's easy and you'll need a good organization, discipline and willpower but it's not ridiculous or impossible at all.",

I did both - in that, I got a professional Masters, worked for a few years in that field, and now am doing a PhD in a connected field. I don't have a child but am married and a bit older in terms of the other students in the PhD. \n\nI think a Master's (you can pick a 1 or 2 year program) with some sort of scholarship , may work for you. There ARE funded Master's programs. In my experience, they are geared to lead you to interesting jobs in your field of choice, as they typically have career councillors and stuff like that to help you. With a PhD, you are really going to be focusing on academic research, and it can take up to 7 years to finish, meanwhile there is a lot of stress about jobs. I wrote this elsewhere, but I am considering jobs that are less prestigious and well-paying than ones that I got out of my Master's. YMMV, but with a child and being career-focused, an interesting MA or MSc from a decent school will get you far.",

Most grad students in this field do at least some fieldwork which can take them away from home for at least several months a year. Will that be possible for you?  I'm in this field (wildlife biology / ecology / evolution) do at least 4 months of fieldwork a year and because of that I can't even own a dog, let alone have a child. Of course, if you're doing something policy related or something with no fieldwork, that won't be an issue. Also think about what kind of job you want to get out of it. If you want to work for the government or consulting or something like that, probably only a masters is needed, not a PhD.",

      "text": "Hey, I\u2019ve worked in wildlife research. First, no, of course you don\u2019t need to give your ex full custody if you go to grad school. That\u2019s an absurd statement. Grad school is actually fairly flexible in terms of scheduling, although it is a lot of work. The amount of flexibility you\u2019re ultimately afforded really depends on your advisor, and you should absolutely seek out one who is supportive. Having a good advisor makes all the difference in the world, kid or not. I do know many people who have had children while in grad school. They tend to manage their time extremely closely. \n\nI would also consider looking into non-thesis programs. There are some out there that are designed for working professionals, and I have friends who have done them and gotten great jobs. The downsides are that they won\u2019t include funding (and it\u2019s not cheap) and you\u2019ll be missing out on field experience. The upside is that you won\u2019t be investing the extra time in a thesis or fieldwork. If you go this route, only consider well-regarded programs at reputable universities. \n\nAnother thing you could consider if you have the funds would be a GIS certificate. That probably won\u2019t be enough to land you a wildlife job by itself, but it makes you more competitive down the line if you decide to pursue an advanced degree. The downside again is that they\u2019re not funded. Also, sometimes you can get this certificate as part of a graduate degree. \n\nI will say, I\u2019ve loved the wildlife work I\u2019ve done, but it\u2019s challenging. And some of the challenges shouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a competitive field, and lots of people see low or unpaid internships as necessary. I hate that, I think it\u2019s horribly exclusionary, but keep in mind that you\u2019ll be in an applicant pool with undergrads who may have had the privilege of spending several summers doing field research. \n\nAs far as the work itself goes, there are often active field seasons. Some labs do their fieldwork locally, but sometimes it\u2019s remote. If you plan to do fieldwork, you\u2019ll obviously have extra logistics to plan around. It\u2019s possible to do, but you will need a support system. And again, a good advisor can work with you on this. \n\nIn wildlife research, as is often the case in academia, lots of folks move around. Jobs can be tight and people move to them. That gets harder to do once you have a family. I just want to mention it because I know you\u2019ll be thinking longer term with this. However, you can always look for local, state, and federal jobs. Lots of people don\u2019t stay in academia. \n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know!",

When he was a little bigger I\u2019d take him to the coffee shop on the weekend to get a little work done (with activities for him etc).  It was also important that I had very supportive advisors who understood the balance and were kid friendly. I also lucked out and had awesome grad cohorts that didn\u2019t mind my kid tagging along to things so I didn\u2019t feel isolated without social support.\n\nI did, however, have to take out extra student loans to help cover daycare (luckily that was a coverable expense BUT unlucky I\u2019m now in a TON of debt). I think the financial part was more difficult (daycare is stupid expensive in some places), but between the awful loans, crappy stipend, and extra teaching etc, I made it all work.\n\nYou can make it work if that\u2019s what you want to do. Be sure that whoever you are going to work with is actually supportive (talk to current and former graduate students if possible).\n\nIf you need to do field work, that\u2019s a whole different story.

I had another friend finish a PharmD as a single mother of 4 children, though the oldest was a teen so that helped.  So is it possible, yes.  The question really becomes is it possible for you. \n\nJust a little side note, I noticed some people talking about field work at going on long trips.  This really depends on the program and the research group.  We have a wildlife biology program at my school and I know two of the faculty pretty well.  One does take month long trips out of country.  The other studies more local wildlife and they take their boats out in the morning and come back in the afternoon like a regular job.  So you would probably want to consider that when picking a program. \n\nAlso, finding a research group lead by a professor that is family friendly is important.  But overall, there is a great deal of flexibility in all academics.  There are groups out there that prioritize getting your work done over face-time in the lab, where you can say my kid is sick so I'm going to work on this data analysis at home today, or I need to leave at 2 today for a doctor visit.  It is hard to know this going into applications, but during interviews, you should start to get a sense and then you should get an opportunity to talk to the other grad students and that is where you really learn about the research group culture.",

Do what feels right for custody of your child for the long run. You can complete a PhD just like a normal job, only maybe with some homework after kiddo goes to bed. Toddlers go to bed early (or they should, anyway) so there is no reason you can't work during the day while kiddo is at daycare and then do any additional studying necessary at night.

I did most of my work in the evenings when baby was sleeping.\n\nI am currently working full time, completing a PhD, and have two elementary age kids at home doing schooling due to COVID. You can make this work. Don't let your ex destroy your prospects or take away your kid, that's bullshit.",

However, if you need loans or anything, that usually isn\u2019t possible. I think it all really depends on your current situation. Are you working now? Will you have support? How will you pay for living, food, childcare, and school?",
