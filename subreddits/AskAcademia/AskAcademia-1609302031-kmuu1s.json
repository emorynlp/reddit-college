  "title:": "Can an educated patient with a rare disease present and publish self researched interventions?",
  "text": "I am not a scientist or healthcare professional. I do have a very rare genetic disease with no therapy or cure. I am university educated ( arts degrees) and self researched and applied lifestyle interventions that were unexpectedly successful. As I track all data regarding my interventions, my medical team and I, as first author, published an article this Spring.\n\nAs I am acting outside the standard of care for someone with my disease, albeit with proven success, my medical team has now backed away from further research collaboration for ethical and liability reasons. As an informed patient, I am not bound by the same ethical or professional constraints of my medical team. Over the past year, I have progressed the interventions, still outside the standard of care, and I would now like to independently present the results as an N=1 study at a Conference in June. \n\nI am uncertain as to the appropriateness of this effort but feel very strongly that the research would be immensely valuable to other patients suffering with the same disease. Currently, there is no cure or therapy for this progressive and debilitating disease and my research might offer some hope for others. \n\nAny academic advice on strategies for navigating through the publication process would be very much appreciated.",

While I am confident in the quality of the data, it is at best an N=1 observational study and I draw no conclusions on generalizability. It is more of a proof of concept for safety and tolerability in an effort to prompt further research efforts and to attract funding. \n\nIt is a provocative study that challenges the current Consensus Statement on clinical practice for this disease. I have no academic ally in place and my clinic has distanced itself from further collaboration. I am outside my comfort zone but the data stands and has value and should be brought forward I think. \n\nI will do my best. Thanks for the guidance.",

There's also a convention to not really include \"case studies\" in the same category as a \"study\" understood in the epidemiological clinical sense. Just because \"clinical\" study types are sort of kept apart. For example i had a discussion  recently about a friends use of \"cross-sectional\" which has one meaning clinically and if said alone is often thought to refer to that case specifically. \n\nHowever, other preclinical/more heterogenous research can sometimes be published even from a single *animal* (especially if it is scoping research where you go: somethign weird happened in my mouse, look at these daily bloodgasses over 2 monnths), if you try to \"flatten\" the data in a different way - so there is absolutely nothing weird about it. \n\n On the other hand with the provisory statements you give in your initial post, it's obviously fine altogether, and very valuable information. \n\nAs a curious med student (although currently paused from clinical medicine to do research) would you mind linking your article?",

Obviously in the paper this was easy to avoid with the inclusion of your medical team as co-authors.  Now that they aren't included, you will need to very carefully prepare your written and verbal material to navigate this situation.  \n\nWhen your write your abstract, make sure you heavily reference your own published work along with the rest of the literature in the field.  Use phrases like \"As we have demonstrated in our paper...\" more than would be typical in a conference abstract.  It might even be worth contacting the chair of the conference or session to explain the unusual authorship situation so they don't think you're omitting your previous co-authors because of some spat or unethical behaviour, but I don't know whehter this is likely to work out.\n\nIt's hard to tell from your post, of course, how much you yourself have mastered the language used by medical professionals amongst themselves, and whether you're familiar with the format and style of conference papers and presentations in this field.  Usually a grad student (for example) would get feedback and revisions from their supervisors on their first few talks before they do them, and they would of course have been also attending talks in the mean time.  You could consider asking one of your doctors if they would look over your material with you to ensure you are hitting the right target, if you feel this would be appropriate given your relationship.",

I\u2019m a historian and geographer, so I\u2019m not sure exactly how to approach it, or if those are really the ideal venues, but that\u2019s probably close to the track I\u2019d take. \n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike I said, I\u2019d approach it very carefully. I might write it up in a way which: \n\n\na) reviews the available lit (including your previous article), \n\n\nb) speaks to the experience of the condition and the experience of treatment within current standards of care in your particular context, \n\n\nc)  highlights the need for an expansion of the available treatments in specific ways which address the tensions you pointed out in the previous section,\n\n\nd) speaks very tentatively to the potential benefits of your experimental treatments and your experiences with them in terms of a case report, and,\n\n\ne) emphasizes the importance of examining these and other potential treatments, acknowledges the ethical hurdles, and maybe suggests commonly accepted solutions to those or similar ethical hurdles to demonstrate a way forward for this research within the context of a more traditional clinical review process.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFair warning, even if you are incredibly careful in the construction and presentation of the paper, independent scholars get a tough reception at even the most welcoming venues, and the medical set isn\u2019t usually known for being exactly that. \n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nEdit: /u/polyphonal makes a fantastic point about disciplinary genre conventions and their (perhaps unfortunately frequent) use as shibboleths.

I study a relatively common disease that is heavily researched and well-funded although it is not lethal. My boss has a massive amount of lab space and lavish funding. Meanwhile, my best friend will probably die in a few years of a rare disease, and nobody knows anything about it because there just isn't any incentive for folks to research it unless they are personally affected. It took 20 years simply to get a diagnosis. \n\nI really hate when research scientists scorn the desperate efforts of abandoned people to add to the meager stockpile of understanding how to treat them. Are they supposed to just sit and calmly watch their whole family die painfully, because there isn't sufficient financial return on the investment into researching ways to help them?",

You seem to be under the impression that intelligent people with an interest in the subject can only gain expertise in an area through a formal credentialing process, which is simply not the case. \n\nAs an example: I have a friend whose dissertation research was done studying caribou. The local farmers and hunters had long reported that the domesticated reindeer interbred with the native caribou, which was consistently dismissed by the credentialed administrators of the Forest Service. My friend found clear genetic evidence of hybridization with reindeer in the caribou. Biomedical research is not immune to parallel issues, and it is generally worth listening to people who have decades of experience observing or living with whatever it is that you are hoping to study.\n\nYou remind me of the folks in my old department when I was a professor. I quit for many reasons, one of them being that I didn't like everyone's absurd insistence on gatekeeping, generally to their own detriment. If academic scientists were more willing to admit that other people can know a thing, perhaps more progress could be made (especially for those of us in underrepresented populations, who suffer from being excluded from research studies and then not receiving appropriate treatments because nobody wants to do an RCT on a group that makes up about 1% of the population).",

People are vastly different for a variety of reasons\u2014it\u2019s almost impossible to draw conclusions from an intervention preformed on a single individual. It is, however, possible to see that an intervention is worth studying on bigger playing field from one individual. Rare disease or not, a true clinical research effort among multiple physicians at multiple hospital centers could gather together a group of you for a research intervention. That\u2019s something the scientific community would put more stock in. So write a case report with yourself as the patient. Publish it. Suggest in your discussion that your modus operandi be tested in a larger patient group.",

That means you do the intervention (the A) you are using (e.g. exercise, a supplement) for a period of time, then stop, then start again, then stop. The periods of you not using the intervention (the B) acts as the control condition, and you compare your results of A to B to see if there is a significant difference or clinical significance, so it is essentially like a real experiment! They are very underused and more research needs to use them. You'd be a great example to use them. About the logistics of publishing as a  person not involved in a university, I am not so sure, but I am sure it is doable. Most things are doable if you put your mind to it!! Good luck.",

So you need to make sure to read all of the submission instructions for the conference.  Additionally, I would find the abstract book from the prior year and read other case reports so you can get a feel for the language use. \n\nI'm an abstract reviewer for this conference.  It used to be a blind review and I discovered I approved a high school student (who had a co-author from the local medical school).  But I would have never known this since it was written well.  The reviews for my conference are not blind now.  I don't know exactly how I would respond, but I would probably read an abstract from someone unaffiliated more closely. \n\nBut technically, there is nothing that says you have to be a PhD or MD to present research.  In my conference, undergrads, grad students, and people in industry with a variety of degrees all give presentations.  The science should speak for itself.  That being said, usually the biggest hurdle is that non-scientists sound like non-scientists.  The hands on part of science is like an apprenticeship where your mentor shapes you to take on the culture of science.  You write things or give talks and they give you feedback to shape your language.  You are also surrounded by other scientists that have been enculturated as well.  This is why many scientists have trouble talking to the public (press, TED-type talks, pop-science books, etc.), because it is a very different language.  This makes it very difficult for citizen scientists to break into publishing their work because the very nature of their language makes them appear to not know what they are doing. \n\nI do not say this to discourage you, but instead help you understand the uphill battle you face.  The fact that you have already collaborated on a published paper is a really big deal and maybe you have learned enough from that experience to strike out on your own.",
