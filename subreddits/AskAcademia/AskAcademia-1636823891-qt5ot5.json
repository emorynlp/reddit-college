  "title:": "How seriously should I take \"apply by [date] for full consideration\" in TT faculty job posting?",
  "text": "I was not planning to apply for faculty jobs this cycle, but in a general job search I found a posting for an assistant professor position in my subfield that looks very exciting. However, the posting says \"To ensure full consideration, applications must be received by \\[date that passed two weeks ago\\].\" That said, the application portal is still open, so I could technically still apply.\n\nFor any other job, I'd just throw in a resume and cover letter, but putting together an application package for a faculty position from scratch seems like a significant time commitment for something that may never be read by the selection committee. I reached out to the \"search contact\" email address in the job posting asking if they were still considering new applications but did not receive a response.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into whether the \"full consideration\" date should be treated as a hard deadline, or if it's worth spending a few days writing all the required essays?\n\nMore context: The posting is in a subfield of the physical sciences, and I have a relevant PhD followed by postdoc experience at an industry research lab where I'm now a research staff member (there is precedent for people to move from my company into TT faculty roles).",

      "text": "If you're interested in this career path, you may as well put together a package even if this specific job doesn't work out. You're never going to get an Assistant Professor job that doesn't request a research statement, teaching statement, academic format CV, and other accessory documents. Professor-level hiring is about what *you're* going to do with the position and why you're well prepared to be successful, so your base materials need less tailoring than for industry roles where the hiring manager needs someone who fits the job duties in that specific way.\n\nIf you're not sufficiently interested in this path to put together your materials for this and future applications, that's also fine. \n\nThe \"full consideration\" is something to take seriously, as the search committee (comprised of busy professors) will usually have some timeline that they've aligned on for reviewing all the applications as a set rather than reviewing them each as they come in. Being late by a little means you're dealing with the HR triaging which could be flexible. Being late by a lot means the application set has been circulated to the committee and your application would need to be recognized as meriting special consideration separate from the cohort rankings already underway or completed. Maybe you're that great a candidate, and you're still in, or none of the on time candidates excite them. Maybe the faculty are satisfied with other candidates and just go ahead with those received and distributed by day X. \n\nJobs will often stay posted until an offer is made. So, open role doesn't mean much beyond that. But, faculty hiring is competitive on both sides and having a great applicant doesn't mean the institution will successfully hire them. It's not over until it's over, basically. But don't wait for the institution to confirm they're still accepting candidates and then start preparing.  That's just adding time.",

      "text": "I chaired a department at a public teaching institution. We never used the \"receive full consideration\" wording because of HR's fears. When our application deadline hit, it closed the pool. Not surprisingly we'd still get applications. I'd put those in a separate place and if the search wasn't successful (rare but it happened), we'd re-open the search and I'd send emails to the late folks telling them that we've reopened and that their first application hadn't received consideration because it was received after the deadline. I'd give them the opportunity to reapply by sending a new cover letter with a date change that I'd stick in their package and put in the new pool. So, it can't hurt to send it in late. But, I also agree with the suggestion that you have a package ready to go that would require tweaking in your application letter. Quite frankly you could have a couple of different application letters prepared for differently-focused positions that would simply require adding the name of the institution. If you do that, please be very sure to use the correct name in the body of the letter. You'd be surprised at how many applications I got that had some other institutions name in letters. Not surprisingly it wasn't a good thing for an application package!",

Not every institution is on top of removing a posting as soon as it becomes obsolete.\n\nTypically, TT positions receive enough applications to fill out the pool of candidates who get a phone interview. If that group turns out to be really underwhelming (ie, doesn't turn up anyone, or just one, applicant they like enough to invite for an on-campus interview) I could imagine them going back to the applicant tracking system and requesting any past-deadline applications. Once they've made a selection for on-campus interviews I would be surprised if they did that. If no one pans out then it'll likely be a failed search.\n\nBut yes, you can ask. Find out who chairs the hiring committee and write \"Dear Dr A, I am writing about (position). I just entered the job market for (TT jobs).  (Position) is an exciting opportunity. But I realize the earliest I could submit a full application is (date). Could you give me a sense whether a submission is likely to receive consideration if submitted at that date? Thank you. Sincerely. ) Asking through the applicant tracking system will go to a junior HR rep who can't give you any information that's not in the posting. \n\nI agree with previous comments on putting together a package in any event.",
