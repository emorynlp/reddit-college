  "title:": "Interview Outfit: Petite Female Postdoc Position",
  "text": "(posted to r/PetiteFashionAdvice but cross-pointing not allowed)\n\nI have an interview in academia (biomedical sciences field) for a postdoc position and I'm not sure what to wear. My current lab is fairly casual (professors wear jeans and sneakers day-to-day) but the new department could go either way (casual vs. professional). I'm fairly confident in my outfit choice but the shoes and bag are stressing me out. Help/advise is greatly appreciated!!\n\n* **Interview agenda.** Facilities tour, present my research to the department, meeting multiple professors and trainees.\n* **Outfit.** I'll wear a black knee-length sheath dress. I'll also bring a grey or camel colored blazer if it gets cold inside, but the interview is in southern US so still pretty hot this time of year.\n   * I'm bringing backup outfits of midi skirt and blouse, dress pants and blouse, or pencil knee-length skirt and blouse.\n   * None of my options are heavily patterned (mini polka dots or tuxedo pin stripes at most). Mainly dark neutral colors!\n* **Shoes.** I am 4'11\" with a young face so I feel like heels are an absolute must. I just bought a mid-height block heel (2.75\"). (I will bring flat shoes in a bag just in case). Would heels be looked down upon given the amount of walking around we will likely do?\n* **Bag.** I am not a purse gal. I do own a designer professional tote but I never use it. If I bring this, is it \"too feminine\" or \"too bulky\" ? Should I opt for something more androgynous like a minimalist backpack (I don't own one but I probably can borrow from a friend).\n\nTLDR: are heels ok for a job interview in academia (especially considering i'm so short)? And are tote bags acceptable to carry my things (back up shoes, laptop for presentation, snacks, etc)?",

      "text": "I don't know your field, but my usual advice is to wear closed toe shoes and pants that don't leave skin exposed.  The shoes shouldn't be breathable.  The fabric depends on field (like no fleece if there is a radiochem department).  In other words, if you are getting a facilities tour, then make sure your outfit is likely to fit their safety requirements.  The last thing you want is an awkward pause while they go look for an extra pair of sweatpants for you to borrow.",

      "text": "If you're doing a facilities tour in a biomedical sciences field, you definitely shouldn't wear anything that will prevent you from going into labs - and that includes your planned outfit, unfortunately.  You don't want them seeing your outfit and thinking, \"Has this person never worked in a lab before??\"\n\nAs others have said, whatever shoes you wear, make sure you can walk & stand in them for hours.\n\nFrom my experience, both backpacks and tote bags are quite normal, so just bring whatever you're more comfortable with.  I assume you'll have a laptop, charger, copies of your CV and papers, etc, so you'll have plenty to carry and it's entirely justifiable to need something comfortable.",

So make sure if u are wearing heels, they are comfortable and you can walk. For bags, carry something reasonably sized, you don't want to accidently hit something.",

Nobody will look down on you for wearing heels, but you might hate yourself. I'd recommend flat, comfortable shoes.\n\nThe bag really doesn't matter - you could use a tote, messenger back, professional looking backpack, hell even an old beat-up Jansport (I mean...avoid this if you can, but I don't really think anyone cares in academia). Just use whatever you normally use to haul your stuff around campus.\n\nSeriously, few people will care about these things, and honestly you'd probably draw more eyebrows for the heels than for comfortable flats.",
