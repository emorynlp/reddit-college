  "text": "Do you think one's ability to conduct research deteriorates with age? Or is it just because we have more responsibilities as we age(like having a family)?\n\nPeople say it's harder to learn new things as we age. But doing research requires learning many new things. So wouldn't it be harder to do research as we age?",

      "text": "I believe some studies have shown that scientists become less productive later in their career - and some that show they become more productive, so you pay your money and take your pick.\n\nPersonally I am much, much more productive.  I have a solid track record that helps me get funding, and a lab that has been established for many years, giving us great resources in things like antibody banks, constructs of many types and well established techniques.\n\nI suppose I could dial it back and coast for a few years, but I worked pretty hard to get here, so I am going to drive it for a few more years.\n\nAs for the \"learning\" issue, it is kind of offset by a very broad background knowledge - the result of doing decades of research - and so it may not always be such a hurdle to keep up.",

      "text": "I definitely think personal responsibilities play a role to some extent. With small children at home, it\u2019s *much* more difficult for me to get work done than it was before I had kids. COVID only exacerbated this. Of course, that may be non-monotonic, as many of those responsibilities will go away eventually. \n\nBut there\u2019s also the issue of professional responsibilities. As a grad student or a postdoc, your goal is to complete research and get a job. You are meant to devote all, or nearly all, of your professional time to that endeavor. When you get that first job, you need to get tenure. Generally, your department realizes this and gives you the latitude to get research done. As you move up, you\u2019re saddled with more and more administrative and other responsibilities. These eat into the time that would otherwise be spent on research. So for most of us there\u2019s just less time available to be productive as we advance in our careers (and therefore in age).",

Whereas I once thought the world was basically void and that anything I did would be original, I've started to see a lot more of the low-hanging fruits already picked. The other thing is that as I age, I lose tough with (and don't have time to learn) the latest software tools and techniques. \n\nThe good news is that our greater knowledge and management experience likely mean that we that it takes less incremental effort to achieve the same output as we age.",

I used to do material synthesis & characterization, device design & fabrication, device characterization, and writing all by myself. You can imagine that it meant that my regular shift was 10-11 hours all the time and overtime frequently on top of that.\nI cannot do that anymore as I have kids and I have a ton of errands and responsibilities. But the few times my wife was away with kids, visiting family, I could do long shifts no problem, even without lunch breaks and all. Yeah, my body was may be a bit achier the next morning compared to when I was 30 (I am 37 now). But I could see myself being able to work at that pace after a short adaptation period.",

      "text": "I personally think academia and music have a lot in common. To become a rock/pop superstar you have to be the absolute best, super creative and very focussed. Ditto academics. I think what happens to both groups is that after they've had success and played to sold out arenas (metaphorically) they can't keep up that creative pace, partly because they don't want to and partly because over time they've gone from being the hot young thing disrupting the status quo to being the status quo. It's hard to disrupt when there's no one in front of you to disrupt. In addition, once you hit the top all these other opportunities open up. For musicians it's producing, acting, writing, or even advocacy etc. For academics it's translation, senior administration, government, also advocacy. They don't need to be always chasing the next paper and grant and they have other interests that they can now indulge. So why not do what's interesting?\n\nI would say I don't think that necessarily makes tops academics less productive. They generally have the protocol down pat and the good ones build a team underneath them who are keen and hungry and supports them with their experience. I simply don't believe the majority of senior academics are scientifically as productive alone as they were earlier in their careers. They are productive in other ways though, usually prolifically so.",
