  "text": "I\u2019m tenured at an R1 school in the US (STEM). I\u2019m generally happy, but I have a job opportunity at a good Canadian university (not the absolute top tier in my field, but solid) that I\u2019m strongly considering. I would like to hear experiences about the transition between systems, pluses and minuses. I hear a mix of things from my colleagues. Some say that it\u2019s not really much different, others tell me that moving out of the US system would be intellectually isolating, a catastrophe, etc, etc. Looking for some objectivity.\n\nI\u2019m primarily interested in hearing from faculty, but would appreciate all perspectives.",

One perk I found as an early career scientist was the the smaller research community made it easier to break into the orbits of the big names. I knew the people at the top of the field who happened to be in Canada (they were top of the field internationally) and I don't think that same personal connection would've happened with the much larger research community in the states. \n\nIf you do anything medical/health, I've found the Canadian system of healthcare makes it much easier than the US, but that might vary by area. \n\nI like on a social level that students don't go broke to attend a Canadian university. \n\nCanadians seem to have better work life balance.\n\nDownside- most big meetings are still outside Canada, and the Canadian dollar can suck. Same for publishing costs. \n\nJust one thing to think about too- the US will continue to tax you forever as long as you are a citizen. This was incredibly annoying, even though as a postdoc I was under the amount I owed to the US.",

There aren't huge NFS R01s in Canada. Many of the major grants are collaborative, so you'll need to have good networks with collegues in other provinces in order to check boxes for regional distribution. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the nature of your research and your ability to fit your own work into broader schemes. \n\nBut no reason to say that you'll be cut off from your international connections. At least in the Before Times there weren't any barriers to conferences besides the usual budget constraints.",

Since I'm not there yet, I don't have a good perspective on any of this, so take it with a grain of salt. But the reason we decided to take the leap was that we were told by many we talked to that Canadian universities tend to be much more collaborative than in the US. When we interviewed, they said if they hired us, it's because they think we're capable of getting tenure, and they're committed to helping us get to tenure as part of their team. With the grants being collaborative, it's not nearly as cutthroat as US R1s often are. Since you're tenured, that might not matter the same way to you, but I think there's still a whole lot to be said for the team mentality. Looks like our move will be a little later than planned with the state of the world, but we can't wait to get there to start working with our new group.",

So certainly this isn't a catastrophic change for everyone.\n\nI don't think there are many things that are universally one way in the USA and universally a different way in Canada. The only things that spring to mind are pretty obvious - e.g. main grant sources (NSF to NSERC, ONR to (nothing), etc.); physical distance to other universities; etc. You should definitely pay attention to this, especially if you need a lot of money for your research - that can be harder to scrape together here (no personal experience on this one).  \n\n\nOther changes are pretty institution-specific. Near the top, Canadian universities don't have as much money - this means lower salary, less funding for seminars and travel, etc. But this comparison doesn't hold for all Canadian universities and all American ones; you should just ask.\n\nQualitatively, the big changes seem to be (i) NSF and NSERC fund in very different ways, and (ii) Canadian universities are physically more isolated, so you will need to figure out a way to interact with people.",

So if you're not in the GTA (and to a much lesser extent Vancouver and Montreal, perhaps Halifax) then there's probably only going to be one major research university in your city. \n\nJust something to think about. If you're in the GTA you won't notice a difference, but outside you might. It really depends on how much you value close collaboration of a certain type I suppose. The social culture in Canadian universities tends to be a little more laid back, and in my experience more pints due to the overwhelming British influence.",
