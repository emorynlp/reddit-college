  "text": "I feel like everything that could be going wrong is going wrong right now. I can't eat or sleep. I feel very weak. It's taking a toll on my body and getting through my coursework has been so intense. This is only semester 1 and there's been a death in the family that hit me pretty hard and a whole host of other intense occurrences. I don't really know anyone I can talk to either.  And it's just a lot to handle while doing coursework. There's a lot of pain and grief. I am not sure how much longer I can keep putting my foot forward sometimes. Though I do know I am not alone, I understand that the entire world is reeling at the moment. It's just. Fuck.\n\nedit: thanks for the support everyone - it honestly helps a bit just to write it out and put it to language to others who understand the intensity of what a PhD program entails and how that can really make emotional disturbance all the more disturbing - its looking like i will have to find a therapist, but that in itself is very intimidating - but thank you.",

During my PhD studies, I lost 2 family members, a childhood pet, went through a nasty breakup, funding expired, and my first dissertation project failed.....I can definitely relate. Its hard and I am sorry for everything you're dealing with. I was lucky that my mentor knew that life/family came first and made sure to help with laying out reasonable expectations and timelines. Talk with them, and they should guide you and help you through things.",

      "text": "If it is only your first semester so you may not even have an advisor yet, right? I'd talk to someone who can get stuff done, a program director or department chair or something, and talk through your options. Perhaps since you are so early on you could defer your acceptance/start date to the beginning of the next academic year. This would give you time to cope and get your personal life to a more manageable state.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear you are having a hard time right now. I can relate. I took a leave of absence for 6 months in a similar scenario, and later on in my PhD I took another 6 months, both times due to mental health problems I was having as a result of difficult personal circumstances. The process of taking leave was easy, no one asked too many questions, it didn't affect the PhD process or my career negatively, and I was able to access free mental health support through my university while I was on leave. Your wellbeing should always come first (despite what you may hear from some academics...). Good luck, I hope you can access support in the forms you need. Reaching out to friends in academia who understand the pressures also really helped me. Sometimes non-academics just don't get how overwhelming it can be.",

      "text": "Some months before I started my master's degree my father had died. I didn't allow myself to feel the whole spectrum of grief because I thought that it would make me lose my \"momentum\". When I finished my degree I literally collapsed. I was burned out and couldn't do anything for a year. On hindsight, I think I should have talked to a therapist back then and that's the advice I'm going to give you. Find a therapist (that you can tolerate) and put therapy sessions on your weekly routine. It's a matter of self preservation. Hope everything works out for you. Good luck. Stay sane, become resilient!",

The only way I could fund support for my dad was through my PhD program. I literally just worked through all of the pain -- both physical and emotional. The one thing I wish I would have taken up sooner rather than later was talking with a therapist regularly. Pushing through that really forced me to be creative and innovative in ways I wouldn't have been otherwise. I don't recommend, but if you want something bad enough, you'll find a way to get it.",

Feels horrible, especially for the first few days, but it creates mental space, and it should put a stop to the current physical feedback loop (not eating or sleeping) before you collapse. \n\nMake no mistake: continue that way, and you eventually will. \n\nI\u2019d also look for on-campus resources for counseling. They\u2019re frequently cheap or even free. \n\nAgreeing as well with speaking to your mentor.",

I gained far more experience than I\u2019d prefer in working through absolute hell*, and I\u2019m always glad to share. \n\nThink a bit about why you\u2019re calling out tangibility: it speaks to what works for you. Look into grounding, which may be applicable: when you\u2019re getting overwhelmed, work your way through each physical sense. Name 5 things you can immediately see, 5 things you can immediately hear, etc.. It helps defuse bad bouts. \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be intimidated by looking for a therapist. Remember that you\u2019re the one selecting them, not the other way around. If you need to try a few, that isn\u2019t a problem with them, or you. It\u2019s not a problem at all. \n\n*: managing enormous grants while grappling with a supposedly-terminal diagnosis, getting some bones cut with no subsequent pain drugs, peer reviewing journal drafts and teaching all along the way\u2026",

      "text": "That does sound really tough, so sorry to hear it! As someone else already commented, realize it's \"just\" work/study and prioritize your well-being. You won't make it to the end if you burn out right at the beginning. I had to learn that a little bit later than you, but not much. ;-) Do all the stuff everyone always says... get enough sleep, get fresh air, eat healthy stuff, move a bit, start meditating, regularly do something that completely takes your mind off your worries. It really helps a lot in coping with all the challenges life throws at us. Maybe try reading the Daily Stoic; that's something else that helps me a lot. But also give yourself slack: this is really tough right now, and it's perfectly legit to be tired. Probably most importantly, find people to talk to! A colleague that has always been friendly, a friend, family, a counselor, a therapist - that's exactly what these people are there for, to help you in tough situations! Asking for help is the best you can do and nothing to be ashamed of. Sharing your experience helps take the sting out of things. Finally, take this warm virtual hug!",
