Had to remove someone from my committee after they harassed me during my qualifying exam, while all the other professors sat by and watched. Some even emailed me afterwards to say I was going a good job and not to let what happened in the qual get me down. Chill nice easy going professors are who you want to surround yourself with. It is a long process and you don\u2019t want an egomaniac to be in your circle. They will also go to great lengths to protect their image. I know a guy that got assaulted in his lab and the PI did nothing and warned everyone not to tell anyone or they would be fired. Some sketch shit goes on behind the scenes in academia. It can be a wonderful experience if you surround yourself with good hardworking nice people.",

          "text": "What\u2019s also interesting is that a lot of these unaddressed mental health issues came back to haunt me in my 30s. I was able to distract myself from how depressed I was by always having something new to chase (new paper, new class, getting tenure, etc). Post-tenure is when my depression really started to take over. There was little in my life to distract me from it and I sort of succumbed to it. My personal life imploded due in part to this and even though I\u2019m piecing it back together again, the journey could have been healthier (and easier and more enjoyable) had I sought out therapy and psychiatry in my 20s as opposed to my late 30s.\n\nSo this is my advice. In addition to all the productivity tips you\u2019ll get along the way, take care of your mental health.",

      "text": "1.  You do not, nor should you, kill yourself for the degree.  If you burn out in grad school it will likely derail your career.\n2.  Related to 1, do not take on more than you can realistically do.  That does not mean \u201cdo working 14 hour days 7 days a week.\u201d  Everything will seem exciting and important. It\u2019s not if (a) your mental and physical health take a dive and (b) you cannot realistically complete the work without shortcuts.  Have seen published papers pulled because people bit off wayyyy more and ended up cutting a corner that hugely affected their results.\n3.  Make sure you can work with your PI.  If they are the type that will shame people for not being at the lab on the weekends, every weekend, not the PI you want.  Also, set clear boundaries with your PI.  If you have to have one day a week not answering messages or being in touch, clearly state that.  \n4.  If either of you plan to teach, seek out a mentor specifically for that. Most profs have no idea how to teach well, yet they will pat themselves on the back for it. Find someone the students like and learn from those profs. Find any workshops that will help you learn pedagogy.  And don\u2019t fall for the new and shiny.  We know people don\u2019t learn auditory/visual etc. but that concept remains in teaching.\n5.  As you go, you will realize how little you actually know.  If this doesn\u2019t happen, rethink your knowledge. I was so arrogant and could have learned so much more if I hadn\u2019t been an asshole know it all.  I was brought way low with my postdoc. Wasn\u2019t pretty but had to happen.  You want to be aware of your ignorance. If you state any facts, understand and no where they come from. If you only have a passing knowledge, talk to others that are experts.\n6.  Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to others in the field.  Most will help in any they can.",

      "text": "1) The very best advice that anyone ever gave me: don't pay for graduate education out of pocket. If you're good enough, have patience, and are willing to be flexible and move, you can find full funding to cover doctoral studies (and possibly also the MA). I repeat, do not go into debt for this. \n\n2) Thoroughly research what the job prospects actually look like for PhDs in your field and what percentage of PhD holders actually land secure and adequately paid academic jobs these days. You will probably be shocked by what you learn. Ask for placement stats from any PhD programmes you are seriously considering. They will have this. If they don't want to share information on graduate outcomes with you or try to pass off one anecdote about a 'recent' graduate who got a job 5 years ago, take this as a sign that they have placed nobody in an actual stable academic job lately. \n\n3) Google 'academic quit lit' and have a good read. Some classic pieces in this genre include Bartram's 'Why Everybody Loses When Someone Leaves Academe' and Schuman's 'Thesis Hatement'.",

Trust your work! Apply for a lot of relevant things that you might not think you're reading for - because sometimes you get them and thats great and sometimes you don't and thats also great (because you learned something presumably and also then you don't have to do a conference presentation ha). \n\nAlso take time OFF - not like a day or two here or there - take substantive time away from your work when available. I took a month off after I finished up classes. I took a month off after I finished comps. Like take real serious time away to refresh and recharge otherwise you will be miserable.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not positive on how social sciences programs are structured, but my number one piece of advice for starting grad students is pick a lab/group/project that is focused on a topic that you love. Don\u2019t settle for something that is mildly interesting for you. Grad school is tough and the only way you\u2019ll make it through without being completely burned out is if you are doing something you\u2019re passionate about. I did my PhD in Biochemistry and I have to say, if I didn\u2019t love my thesis project all of the failed experiments that I encountered in the process would have completely drained me mentally. Also important is to pick an advisor and group/lab that you \u201cclick\u201d with. You will be working long hours with these people and it\u2019s important that you get along. I\u2019ve known quite a few people who weren\u2019t successful their first attempt at grad school because they chose PIs based off of prestige rather than people they felt they could successfully learn from. Ask about the PIs management/mentor style and make sure it\u2019ll work well with your learning style.",
