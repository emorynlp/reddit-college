I'm mid way through my first year as a maths PhD student and whilst my supervisors are the kindest and most supportive people around me I still feel lost.\n\nI recently returned to the office and it made me feel worse strangely, realising that I have to play the polotics game with them and try to make an entirely new batch of friends all whilst juggling the world's most uncooperative code.\n\nThat and I just feel like I've lost my spark and motivation-- you could say that the waters have been muddied.\n\nOn Monday I'm having a quick chat about this with my supervisor. How can I professionally say I'm feeling despondent?",

Identify specific issues that you're having *that your supervisor can reasonably address* and ask about support for those issues (ideally with some ideas of your own as to how to address them).\n\n> realising that I have to play the polotics game with them \n\nWhat do you actually mean by this? I'm not saying that there isn't politics within academia, but rarely is that something that would affect someone 6 months into a maths PhD (I make the subject definition because you're not exactly competing for resources like say a bench scientist would have to, which is something a newbie student might have to worry about).\n\n> make an entirely new batch of friends\n\nDon't stress this too much. Assuming everyone is reasonably decent then you'll all be reasonably inclined to be friendly to one another (and I doubt you'll be trying to befriend the not-decent people anyway).\n\n> juggling the world's most uncooperative code.\n\nI feel you on this, but try not to mix and match your work anxiety with your workplace anxiety. That will just make things seem worse and harder to manage.\n\nI second u/phonograhy 's suggestion that you speak to a mental health counsellor. Letting your supervisor know that you're struggling is relevant if it affects your ability to do your work, but in terms of actually managing your mental health you should speak to someone qualified about that.",
