How did it affect your decision to admit/deny them?\n\nWould love to hear some of your crazy stories about not the applicants themselves, but their recommenders.",

Many students, especially international students from non-famous colleges, end up with professors who either haven't written too many letters, or don't know English well enough to write in that language. Many factors contribute to these situations.",

The letter started off the typical way, \"this student is great, such an analytical thinker, etc.\" But then there was a whole paragraph devoted to the student's attitude. The sentence that sticks out was something like, \"this student will have a laissez-faire attitude towards all deadlines, if they acknowledge them at all\". It wasn't unanimous but the student was accepted into the program \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
