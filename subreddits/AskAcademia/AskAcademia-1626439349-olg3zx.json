  "text": "I just completed my PhD in mathematics in the US, and I will be working at a teaching focused job in the US starting this Fall. \n\nI am aware of the difficulty of getting a permanent position in US academia, and I know that I am lucky to have found a job here.\n\nSince I am an Indian citizen, I would like to go back to India in the near future. However, I am unsure of the realities of academia in India. How competitive is it to find a position there? How much does the research/teaching/service components vary in your experience? Is there anyone from Indian academia here that can help me understand how things are in India?",

Are there jobs available for you to apply to in the area you want to live? It really comes down to availability for any job in any field and that will be research you\u2019ll have to do the dirty work for. And much like the US, you\u2019ll likely not be able to pick where you teach if your goal is academic since your job will be dependent on availability in your subject. So look all around at different schools and good luck!",

You could always try to get a job in an IIT kind of place, but the problem there is that you\u2019ll drown in the teaching, and get very few students to actually do your research with. Ultimately it really depends on how \u201cgood\u201d your published work is. It would really help your case if you had some grants etc to your name while you were in the US. \n\nSource: Am Indian national working as a postdoc in the US, hoping to go back to work in India eventually.",

Just apply man you\u2019ll easily get in some IISER or maybe even IISc.
