  "text": "When it comes to peer reviews, I know it can very, a friend surgeon told me there are levels to it, like level 1 or a, how would know what level is being associated with the peer review you\u2019re reading. As far as a graduate level thesis, how do they differ from like a peer review, and when people think of peer reviews, are they post PhD. Or post grad. Or can anyone write a peer review inclusive of their study and circle of other peers. Truly curious on the function and structure of the the peer review world. There\u2019s journals for almost everything.",

      "text": "Peer reviewers get invited to write a report by editors of scientific journals. For a thesis it works in a similar way, except that in this case, the thesis examiner is invited by the host institute of the candidate and not a journal editor.\n\nThe qualifications of the reviewer varies depending on the needs and reputation of the journal in question. It can be a leading expert in the field, but also a graduate student.\n\nI don't know what \"levels of peer review\" means.",

      "text": "I think your friend doesn't know anything about peer review. \n\nIn the most literal sense peer review is just a review of something by one or more of your peers. However, it most commonly refers to the review of papers for publication, grant applications and in some disciplines submissions to conferences.\n\nThere are no levels and I can't even start to think what your friend might have been referring to. Peer reviewers will provide a critique of the work, suggestions for improvement and usually a recommendation on whether to publish/fund/accept although they usually won't be making the final decision. They will have officially been asked to do this by the publisher/funder/conference organiser. There is no level. \n\nYour seniority has nothing to do with peer review. A lab technician with a high school diploma will be peer reviewed if they submit a paper to a conference in just the same way as a Nobel prize winning professor would be - that's kind of the point of peer review. \n\nAnyone can do a peer review if they have the necessary expertise but you have to be asked to do one. You can't just randomly decide to critique someone's confidential grant application. There are websites like pubpeer where you can provide comments about a paper, and in that most literal sense that's a peer review, but it's not what people take peer review to mean.\n\nLastly, it's very rare peer reviews are made public. You generally wouldn't be reading one. In the rare circumstances they are public, they'll be attached to the item they're peer reviewing. Some alternative publication platform post the peer reviews, for example, but I've never heard of a peer review of a funding application being made public. It will be shared with the applicant but making it public would be extremely problematic.",
