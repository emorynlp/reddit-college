  "text": "UK; About to start 3rd (hopefully final) year of PhD; Sciences\n\nProbably a pretty recurring topic here but I'm in desperate need of some top tips to regain academic motivation and would really appreciate some advice and input from people who have been in similar situations. \n\nThe past few weeks I have found that I just sit at my laptop for the entire workday and have almost nothing to show for it - maybe I will have sent 1 email or wrote 2 or 3 sentences. I don't know if it's down to burnout as I've only really taken one full official week off in the past 2 years of the PhD, or it's just a hangover of COVID/working from home, or I'm just being too hard on myself and can't see the bigger picture/progress over the past 2 years. \n\nI submitted my first first-author paper about a month ago and have had my second paper on the back-burner for a few months now but just can't find the motivation to finalise the last few edits and submit. The PhD has been a pretty negative experience on the whole but I just feel like I need to push through for one more year and it will all be worth it! Did anyone have a similar slump as they approached their final year?",

      "text": "I've been through this, quite a lot. Do you use to-do lists? Sometimes that can help. Instead of focusing on the abstract idea of having \"something to show\" after a day of sitting at your laptop, write down concrete tasks to achieve. Doesn't matter how small. It could be to add 1 paragraph to a method or results section. \n\nAnd start your day with something easy to tick off, even if it's trivial or not specific to your PhD studies. Sometimes starting the day by crossing something off really helps set up the right mindset. \n\nIt can also help to set a few 'must-do' tasks within a longer list. As long as those get done, you're golden.\n\nAnother thing that I like to do is scribble down ideas and workings. I have scrap paper and notebooks constantly scattered around with scrawls on them. It is tangible evidence that I did a lot of mental work, even if I didn't add to my word count at all. \n\nMost of all, be kind to yourself. A PhD is not easy. Some of us absolutely don't fit that mould of constant churning out of papers and writing. And that's OK. \n\nIf you can organise a break (a REAL break) from PhD then that might be really good too.",

          "text": "Thanks so much for replying and your helpful advice :)\n\nI do use to-do lists but think I go far too 'big' with the tasks and probably need to break them down more to feel like I've actually achieved something. I feel like I haven't read a paper properly in months and months, so maybe this is something very achievable to focus on this week to get back into the swing of things!\n\nI think I also never realised quite how self-directed a PhD would be and need a bit of urgency behind me to get things done! Thanks again, will for sure give these a go",

              "text": "I'm this way too, in that I am horrible with unstructured/ self managed time. To do lists help, and adding structure to my day in any way possible. If I'm home all day and need to run one errand, I'll run it in the middle of the day so there's a \"before\" and \"after\"--suddenly I'm more motivated to do something before I leave. Block scheduling can help, YouTube has some great videos about it. I set study dates with friends where we sit together over zoom or distanced at a park or whatever's safe and just each work on our own stuff. If I find myself getting sucked into social media and distracted, I'll move from my desk to my couch until I'm done scrolling so my desk stays mentally tied to work. I've also found that having a platform to share what I do is really motivating--mine is completely anonymous and I don't force myself to post regularly, but if I do read a paper or analyze an image or cross everything off my to do list I'll post a pic. It's a quiet way to acknowledge the work I do get done, which gives me more mental momentum. \n\nThey are all pretty cheap tricks and don't work every time, but hopefully they can help. \n\nIn other news, one week off in two years is heinous. PLEASE take a vacation!!",

I always struggle to set errands because I only think they can happen at the start of my day (which might put me out of 'work mode' for the entire day) or end of my day (when I'll be tired and want to relax). And my weekends are currently a mix of work, domestic duties, and precious relaxation. I might try your way! If it works I don't have to go months without a haircut \ud83d\ude02",

If you have a lab or group of friends in a similar research area, you can even set a virtual or face to face coffee/lunch meeting where you all give brief rundowns of recent/interesting papers too. Like a book club. I found that chatting about research can really help me feel motivated, even if I'm not talking about my own.",
