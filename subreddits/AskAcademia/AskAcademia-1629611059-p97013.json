Maybe in my case it helps that I was also raised in the setting of a small liberal arts college and then went to one, too. \n\nBut I really think the show is very, very good and I hope it gets another run of episodes. Honestly I wish Netflix had released it week to week. The water cooler (or virtual water cooler) conversations would have been amazing. As it is it\u2019ll be forgotten in a couple weeks.",

I would so much rather watch a \"realistic\" show about a graduate teaching assistant, broke MFA student of color, 6th-year PhD candidate, etc. To me this show paints such a vivid portrait of how absolutely BORING most of the corruption in academia is--and how easy it would be to dismantle it if the people at the bottom hadn't been tricked into competing for crumbs for so long.",
