  "text": "Hi everyone, I am currently travelling in a non-English speaking country while studying a postgrad via distance learning. \n\nAt home I was able to ask people to proof read for me as I often suffer from \u2018SPAG blindness\u2019. But here there\u2019s no one I can ask to give it a quick once over in person - especially as my postgrad area involves lots of quite specific uses of particular terms. \n\nI\u2019m considering paying for proof-reading before I submit essays - but I feel like paying a stranger experienced in my subject to proof is more academically unacceptable than asking a literate friend for a SPAG check? \n\nI\u2019d be grateful for any opinions on the subject. \ud83d\ude42",
