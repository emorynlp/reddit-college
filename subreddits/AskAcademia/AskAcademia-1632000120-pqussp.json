  "title:": "Are there any famous engineers or people who worked in the stem field that also excelled in other fields like English literature, philosophy, and so on?",
  "text": " The title says it all. I think Wittgenstein studied something within the stem field, but he became also a philosopher. \n\nThe reason I'm asking this question is because, today I was asked if I would study stem if it didn't have such a high demand in the job market? As in, you would not get a high pay for your job, and I said no because I am studying something so I can get a high-paying job later and don't have to worry about financial instability (assuming that I play my cards right). This is of course the sad reality that many of us have to face today, I much rather had studied sociology and philosophy if it would lead to a high-paying job, because I enjoy it and like to read about it on my spare-time. It's something that many people are interested in subconsciously, because philosophy helps with critical thinking skills, and who doesn't want that? If you are interested in English literature, you are going to have a good vocabulary probably, and also being well read. with the sociology, you will be able to analyze human social interaction from a macro and micro perspective, and seeing patterns that are not usually seen by people. \n\nI have to know the limitations of being someone who work within the stem field, and being able to do things outside of work that you enjoy. I know some will probably say that if you enjoy something and you do it well, you will become successful and make good money, but I don't think it's possible to stand out that much in e.g. philosophy and sociology, there are already plenty of people that are very successful.",

I don't know you but it is probably safe to assume that your are not Wittgenstein or Einstein. It is an illusion to think you can do a well paid but long-hours job in a field you don't like and still have the energy to pursue philosophy or sociology in any meaningful way.

It is possible to do something in the sciences for a career of course, and make studying the humanities a hobby. You can still be a great thinker even if you don't do it within academia.",
