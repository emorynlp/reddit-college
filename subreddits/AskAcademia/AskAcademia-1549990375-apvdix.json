  "title:": "Sexually harassed by postdoc supervisor and forced to quit.",
  "text": "I was forced to resign from a postdoctoral position in a major research institute in the US after being sexually harassed by my postdoc PI. It's been 4 months since I resigned, but I'm still struggling to move on from what happened.\n\nIt started a couple of months into my postdoc. He started leering and staring at me in public and moving too close to me during one-on-one meetings. At one point, I moved away from him slightly when he started getting too close, which made him really angry. After this incident, I tried to keep the door open when we have our one-on-one meetings. He decided to get back at me for doing this by criticizing my work in a loud voice. He also made everyone believe there was something going on between us. I stopped talking to him during social gatherings and generally stayed away from him. In retaliation to this, he started humiliating me in group meetings and putting down my suggestions. It affected my self-esteem so much that I stopped speaking up in meetings altogether. He brought up my lack of participation in meetings during a progress review. I made excellent progress at the beginning of my postdoc and had my first manuscript ready in a matter of months. But after the harassment started, I got so depressed that I couldn't focus on my work and my progress suffered.\n\nAfter putting up with his abuse for over a year, I reached my breaking point when he invited me to go to a conference with him. It was a small conference with several interesting talks, but it was on the other side of the country and there was hardly anyone I know attending it. So I didn't want to take the risk. I made an excuse about a prior commitment, but he didn't buy it. He got angry and started to bully and harass me even more. I was so depressed at this point that I tried to commit suicide. After several days in the ICU and a week in the hospital, I recovered, at least physically. I went back to work a week later. I didn't tell anyone what happened, but my postdoc PI made it clear that he knew. He mentioned in passing that he has access to anyone's medical record, and in another instance, made a snide comment about me trying to kill myself for my work.\n\nI handed in my resignation a couple of months after this. I wasn't in a place to apply for jobs let alone go for interviews while I was there. So I quit without having a job lined up. I also started seeing a therapist around this time and I think my mental health has somewhat improved since then. However, I'm still so traumatized by this whole experience that I can't seem to bring myself to apply for jobs. Every time I see a job I could apply to, I get paralyzed with fear that the same thing will happen. How do I move on from this and go back to work? Any advice or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nThank you all for your comments and kind words of encouragement. I really appreciate it.\n\nAbout the title IX comments, the postdoc before me left under similar circumstances. I was told by someone in the lab that she did try to make a complaint. Her contract was not extended after she did this and she had to leave. So the institute is aware of his misconduct. They just don't want to do anything about it. I did get asked questions at the exit interview, but it was conducted by someone who works for my PI. There was no way she would have done anything about it except maybe tell him what I told her. So there was no point in saying anything to her. But I just want to move on from all this. I really want to be able to go back to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nI just want to say, I really appreciate all your comments, especially the ones who shared similar stories. I'll be honest here. This is the first time I've ever posted anything on Reddit and I just can't believe how helpful you guys have been. Thank you so much!\n\nI also have happy news to share. I finally got enough courage to get back out there. I already have one offer (went for an interview yesterday), one lead from a friend and several others lined up!!! There is hope after all!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 3:\n\nI got a job at a biotech company and am doing really well. I was lucky I guess because I was only out of work for a short time, and the new job is in a city I always wanted to live in. \n\nSo for anyone out there going through what I did, all I have to say is: you can overcome it! It will take time and you may struggle with PTSD as I did, but it will eventually heal, and you will be able to go on with your life. Don't put up with abuse. Get out of such situations before it affects your mental health. Try your best to make a planned exit; that is the only thing I would have done differently. But if you can't because of the harm your current situation is doing to your mental health, you can still leave without a job lined up and land on your feet again.",

They also act on behalf on the institution many times and have no legal impetus to collect all necessary information to make a decision. At best, the guy will get fired. At worst, nothing will happen.\n\nA lawyer, on the other hand, has far more training, education, and experience in exactly these matters and is there to work on behalf of the person that he or she is representing. Lawyers also have a legal mechanism to collect *all* relevant information. IANAL but I cannot imagine a more clear-cut case where monetary damages are awarded, the guy gets fired, and the university gets shamed for not taking action sooner. At worst, the university makes the news for their incompetence. I can think of zero scenarios where Title IX helps more than a lawyer. ",

The National Science Foundation, for instance, has steep consequences for PIs and institutions who fail to prevent and punish sexual harassment. I suspect other agencies are similar.\n\nEdit because: I see you probably get funding from NIH. I'd contact them with all documentation including the HIPPA violation evidence. ",

      "text": "First off, all my condolences. That sounds like an incredibly toxic work environment. I am glad you are seeking therapy and hopefully recognizing that you are not at fault in this situation as it was a clear abuse of power. At any reasonable job or situation with an advisor/supervisor, you should not have to deal with something like this.\n\nSecond, if you can and are mentally stable enough to do so, you should make a complaint to his superiors. I know there is a good chance it won't result in him being punished, but it does potentially create a paper trail for him being terrible to the people working under him. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, please take care of yourself!\n\nThird, it seems rather odd that he can access any and all medical records for those who work for him. Granted, I'm in the humanities which have different requirements by employers than someone working in STEM, so I might be out of the loop. No matter, it is incredibly unprofessional and possibly illegal to reference or punish someone for previous/current medical issues. Your medical issues are personal and should not affect your workplace barring your inability to use equipment. We all take tumbles, contract pneumonia, get afflicted with cancer, etc. \n\nFourth, and finally, I hope therapy helps you with this issue. Your Postdoc supervisor was in the wrong and seems like a predatory asshole. When looking for another job, you probably won't find someone that is as bad. Take your time and be careful and I wish you all the best.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve had a similar experience with a supervisor, though definitely not as bad as yours, where I was being asked out, commented on and approached in a way that had nothing to do with how a supervisor should treat their student. I sat it out, secretly taped every meeting we had and got my degree, though it gave me a lot of stress. It\u2019s not just the fact that they\u2019re interested in you but more the inequality of power: he had the upper hand and could\u2019ve cost me my degree if I went against him. I had to balance a fine line between making sure that he knew I wasn\u2019t interested, and not pushing too far to make him fail my project (and me). It did leave a mark on me. \n\nI went on to pursue another degree that involved intense supervision. Like you, I kept thinking about the other supervisor and not wanting to end up in the same place. I had a number of conversations prior to us working together that gave me an idea of the type of person he was. I made sure that I was clear from the start that I had no personal interest in this person. I did not answer personal questions, and didn\u2019t ask any. I recorded our first few meetings, but asked him beforehand (he was perfectly fine with it), and made sure that I knew who the confidentiality advisor in the department was. We ended up becoming more friendly as time went on, but it was because I opened up more as I got to know him. It\u2019s ended up being a good working relationship and kind of restored my faith in supervisors. I hope you\u2019ll end up having the same experience. \n\nThings I could recommend: if possible, have a few meetings or talks in which you get to know them a bit. Make your boundaries clear. If possible, contact previous students or people he worked with and ask what it was like (my inappropriate supervisor\u2019s had student quit, rumour goes that he cheated on his wife with a student, other students he was supervising at the same time as me asked me careful questions about his conduct, wanting to see if he was overall inappropriate with me too). If you\u2019re uncomfortable at the start, check out those who offer confidential guidance in the department (even if it\u2019s for PGR and UG students), and perhaps take notes or tape meetings (you could say it\u2019s due to having a less than perfect memory, which is what I did). \n\nNot all supervisors are like the jerk that you had, they sound beyond vile. You deserve to get back out there, do great work and see that he is a minority. I hope it works out for you! ",

Her friend had quit her program a few months before finishing and refused to address the reason why (but it was dissertation season and he was her supervisor). He was apparently really inappropriate in social events (e.g. making sexual comments, getting drunk and vomiting in the department common room) and there were rumours about his divorce (which he openly discussed, bitterly, with his students including me). I personally got approached by others who had questions about him too. I think it's worth asking previous postdocs how they experienced his supervision (in your case, especially female students or colleagues). If I was approached by someone who'd asked me anything about how my 4 supervisors were, I'd be happy to report my experience with them.\n\nI noticed that someone else mentioned why one wouldn't report incidents like yours (or mine). I don't know about you, but I'd seen other students complain about their supervisor or teachers that were being swept under the rug. The department knew about that specific lecturer (not my supervisor) and his racism, sexism and inappropriate behaviour but as he was tenured said they couldn't do anything without really solid proof. After seeing this happen to someone else (who ended up becoming the black sheep in the department) I didn't report anything either, not wanting to risk my own reputation and knowing they didn't do anything. And this was a Top 20 worldwide institution with a great reputation. So don't beat yourself up for not reporting it, reporting inappropriate behaviour by someone in a powerful position isn't as easy as some would like to think it is (or has become).\n\nBut I hope the advice will be helpful to you, and that you can make a fresh start somewhere else where you feel comfortable!",

I imagine any University operations facility worth their salt would be handling complaints more seriously. Usually if you're afraid of ramifications from Department Heads, or even the Dean, they have intermediaries set in place that have no loyalty to the institution, or the students, an ombudsman. If it goes unreported, the behavior will go unchecked when the next attractive grad student comes along.

Your \"supervisor\" is a predatory, abusive ass who should be drummed out of academia on a rail. You deserve to be in a position where you are respected and treated professionally. Well done on you for getting out of that toxic environment and seeking therapy.\n\nIf you Google \"\\[your university\\] + Title IX\" you should quickly find a list of resources for reporting sexual harassment, with a list of contact information for people and departments whose job it is both to help you and to bust this creep. The university probably also has a women's center, LGBT center, or the like, where there will be some people you may feel more comfortable talking to. While it's totally up to you whether you choose to report, consider that you are very likely not the only person this creep has taken advantage of, and will probably do so again until he gets busted. Predators have patterns and there's never just one victim.\n\nAs for moving on, you're absolutely doing the right thing by getting professional counseling. Having post-traumatic stress is perfectly normal and understandable. Give yourself time to heal, if you need a job maybe consider a low-stakes position for a bit before moving back to your field. You will grow past this and become stronger in the end. ",

      "text": "I'm sorry you're having to go through this. It's awful every single time it happens.\n\nI'm a pretty burly dude, so I don't have to deal with shit in the same way. But, I do have close girl friends in academia who've gone through similar stuff. Here's what they'd say (based on my talking with them).\n\nFirst, get yourself healthy. Lots of my friends have PTSD from assaults and harassment. And they seek therapy at least once a week. If money's an issue, look around for therapists that have discounts for people below certain incomes (as I imagine you are since you lost your job). Also, while I can't recommend it unqualified, some people find group therapy or survival groups very helpful. The point is you gotta get help. This shit is acidic and will eat at you if you don't find a way to neutralize it. Unfortunately, this happens a lot. So, there are people out there who can help you through this. My friends would say not to feel so ashamed that it prevents you from reaching out to an organization or person you trust.\n\nSecond, if you feel like you're safe enough and have enough strength, do like other responders have said: find the Title IX office at the university and file a complaint (if in the US). Only if you can withstand the pain: try to find documentation in emails or even ask lab partners if they could say something (usually, though, once they start the investigation, they'll ask for names of people who might've seen something. So, if it's too painful to talk with people, don't worry too much). Try to get the medical record from your suicide attempt. Basically once a complaint opens in a Title IX office, they're going to do an investigation. And in order to bring disciplinary measures down on the faculty member, they're going to need proof or corroborating reports. Unfortunately, that ends up demanding more of you (who didn't do the crime), and many times it can end with lenient discipline (if there's not sufficiently strong evidence to actually fire the professor with tenure).\n\nLastly, be very prudent before going to social media. I know women who were counter-sued for slander and libel for going public with complaints. That doesn't mean that you can't put them on blast. You totally can. (This isn't legal advice.) But be ready for the blow back if you go that route. It might be worth seeing if your university (or a local university) has a legal clinic for sexual assault (or if something like a women's organization does). They'll know exactly how to proceed and help at little to no cost.\n\nI'm really sorry I can't be more helpful than this. And I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. Please take care of yourself and be very kind to yourself as you heal and try to find a way to move on.",

We had a lecturer who was quite smart with good research expertise in his flield. He was well respected and feared but he was a total psychopath! He was so obnoxious, rude and arrogant. The problem is, he used his position and intellectual capacities to sexually harass several female students. He smartly did so without getting his hands dirty... everyone in the department knew there was something wrong but no one dared to say something, because for one, they did not want to lose him as an important academic figure, and for two, they did not capture any tangible evidence which would convict him because he did everything smartly and stealthily ... He had bad intentions for me and my friend, we were hard working and aspiring students who looked forward to success, but above all, we were aware of his unethical misconduct which made us quite worried but we did our best to remain professional and keep our relationship with him within the academic scale. He was okay with us at first and everything started well until his first exam. He intentionally lowered our grades though we did well and humiliated us in front of our classmates. We were so shocked! He was clearly waiting for us to complain so that he asks to see us for one on one meeting and then start the dirty game. I asked my friend not to complain or say anything though she was so angry... He waited for some time close to our table and then invited us for one on one meeting in front of our colleagues which was quite unusual! We refused and then he became outrageous! He increased the level of his humiliation while everyone around was shocked! After that he heard me telling my friend not to respond to his  comments and just ignore anything he says or does which made him angrier.. our relationship hit the wall and for two years, he psychologically tortured us! Intentional sabotage, not endorsing any of our work though we worked unbelievably hard, endless humiliation in front of everyone. He caused us endless fear and anger that we had to bottle because we were afraid of saying anything to anyone. We secretly complained to some of our lecturers who we were close to. Some believed us but did not know what to do, others did not believe us, others ignored us coz they did not want any troubles in the department. So.....we were the only victims to bear the brunt.... Two years passed and I'm now doing my PhD. I just remember this incident with a heavy heart and anger. Sometimes I wish I'd done something, sometimes I just wish I could see him in person and blow the whistle on him wherever he is so that he experiences what felt before. But this experience taught me how to be cautious and strong to face a similar harassment if it comes my way. ",

I was really hoping to hear more stories like this.\n\nIt's all well and good for people to say we should complain/file title IX, but the truth is, it won't make much of a difference. It will probably ruin what's left of our careers and mental health, but it won't make a difference. Plus, at least in my case, *the institute was made aware of his misconduct*. I really like the term you used to describe people like him. They are truly 'psychopaths'. There is no winning with these people. The more you interact with them, the more harm you do to yourself. Change should happen at the institution level. When a complaint is made, they should do something about it. Until such change happens, there is no point in asking victims to re-traumatize themselves.\n\nI do believe it's important to educate others on the kind of abuse that happens in sexual harassment, and that is one of my intentions in writing my original post. No one other than myself and this man know what actually happened and I wanted that to change. If I had known what I was going through was sexual harassment when it started, I could have stopped it from derailing my career (and life?). The crazy making nature of these situations is that the abuse is hidden. At first you think you're imagining it or that you're overreacting. I just didn't know enough to recognize the abuse when it started. I hope this post will help someone in such a situation.\n\nThank you once again for taking the time to write about your experience!

Even if you are right about being harassed and abused and everyone supports you, your social image and reputation will be ruined! And that's what kept us from going public about it, especially with his power and influence. It's unfair isn't!!! I remember when things started going south with him, myself, my friend and other colleagues were standing close the lectures room discussing something. He was standing there calmly like a predictor and when my friend looked up at him unintentionally, he walked away slowly, threw a slight devilish smile and moved his head asking her stealthily to accompany him!!! My friend swallowed it and later told me about it with an utter shock!!! We couldn't believe it!!!! Same thing happened to me after that but he didn't do anything, he just had this hungry disturbing look on his face... There are many awful things he did to us coz he taught us for two years.

We over at r/MeTooSTEM are building resources to help situations with TitleIX and reporting, or even not reporting and just finding a friend to listen if reporting is too much.  It's your story, you get to decide how you want to narrate it.  Come see us if you need. Take care of you.",

But the best I can say is that an accumulation of evidence that this supervisor is a POS can have an effect, and I can imagine that this isn't the first time this supervisor has decided to treat a trainee like this.
