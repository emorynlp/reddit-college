  "title:": "Why is an European PhD considered shorter than an American PhD when an American PhD is really a Masters + PhD?",
  "text": "Most European PhD programs require a Master's degree, which takes 1-3 years, whereas an American PhD can be started after a Bachelor's degree. So even if an American PhD is typically 5 years, shouldn't it be regarded as 2+3 years, thus essentially being the same in length as a 3-year European PhD? But why do so many people perceive European programs as shorter?",

      "text": "Thats because the US still largely sticks to the traditional PhD method, while European universities have truncated their PhDs, and especially their humanities PhDs, to focus more on research and less on coursework. The US system currently is much closer to the old German imperial university system (perhaps thats why Humanities PhDs in the US are still so brutal? Damn Prussians....) where comprehensive examinations were a much bigger deal. \n\nThe biggest difference between a US PhD and a European one is that European PhDs dont have to go through as exhaustive a comps process as we do in the US. PhD coursework establishes the reading foundation required to *begin* the comps process, and then many programs extend extra course free time to complete the comps process. In my program I did two years of course work getting down the foundational concepts of my fields, then had an entire extra year to just read for comps. Covid fucked that up a bit and I ended up slipping into a third semester, so for me it was even more time. I was in my fourth year before I ever even moved to candidacy. If I'd done my degree in Europe I would have taken four extra years to end up where most Europeans *start*. \n\nWhy is it like this? Well the intellectual defense of the US process is that it makes better researchers and teachers as each PhD has a very strong grounding the field's literature. I have a very broad and deep grounding in the big questions of my fields, I have read extensively in areas which I hope to teach, and I personally feel that I can teach in many areas outside my direct field because of it. Thats better for me professionally, as it makes me more employable, it makes me a better researcher because I am not so narrowly focused that I cant draw in other literature, and it helps my students because I can develop classes that expose them to a variety of ideas. At least thats the theory. Another big part of it I think is tradition and academic hazing. This is the process that my profs went through, and so I have to do it because they had to do it. They suffered and so now I must also suffer. There is an expectation of suffering and so to avoid or mitigate is is to 'soften' the program. Combined with the bleak jobs market, I think many profs have an implicit attitude that if a PhD isn't willing to suffer a bit to get through then they might as well just not be in academia to begin with. \n\nBut things are going to change in the US. My program is very traditional, and the long length is apart of that. A friend of mine in another state did their comps in 3 years mainly because their exam process was much easier. Given how state and university budgets are going, I dont see humanities maintaining a 7+ year PhD system. My university *already* places conditions on funding based on the national average for STEM PhDs, not humanities. IMO there is going to increasingly be huge pressure on programs to truncate their programs and bring them in line with STEM PhDs. Universities are just not interested paying their students any more than that. \n\nAlso I dont know *any* PhD students currently who jumped straight from Bachelors to PhD. That to me would be pretty unusual. I have heard of students who start in the department's MA program and then graduate into the PhD program, but they still do the two year MA first. Maybe its different for a STEM degree I wouldn't know, but in humanities that seems to be the common route.",

I would not recommend it, though. I did very well in my program, but had to bust my ass to catch up. Because I was going in at 23, I simply had not had enough time to read as others in my cohort who were in their late 20s/early 30s and came in with a MA (sometimes multiple). That meant I spent the first three years of my program reading in overdrive while taking courses and teaching. Then I wrote my diss in two years and graduated at the end of year 5, when my guaranteed funding was ending. Students who came in with a MA had more time to publish (if they managed their time well) or simply completed the program at a more relaxed pace.",

Getting the MA is seen as \u2018good enough.\u2019 But obviously that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re easier. There is still a lot of reading to cover the material you need to know to do your work.

      "text": "1) European PhDs (and Masters degrees as well, from what I've seen) follow a pretty strict timetable dictated by the Universities themselves. There's no such timetable in the US; it's not *that* uncommon for a Masters to take longer than 2 years.\n\n2) American PhDs come with class requirements that European PhDs don't, thus there's a certain amount of extra time that has to be included in an American PhD to account for the coursework. This is important because;\n\n3) European PhDs seem to stick to tracks much better than American ones do, i.e. your PhD is largely limited by what your undergrad and/or masters degree(s) were in. This isn't strictly true in the US, thus a lot of US PhD programs will also include padding from remedial courses to get the PhD student up to par.\n\n4) There's no guarantee that Master's students will have all of the \"correct\" coursework for their doctorate, particularly if they didn't consider getting a doctorate until after they had finished their Masters. Thus, some of their coursework doesn't always necessarily translate over.\n\n5) Some US grad programs involve a sort of \"forced\" lab rotation, where you have to try out a couple labs before settling into the one you actually want. This model is broadly going away (as it honestly is a waste of time for most students), but it still exists, and it still adds time to completion on PhD programs that Europe doesn't seem to have.\n\nGranted, an intelligently planned US PhD program will be, broadly, the same length as a European PhD program, and it can hypothetically be shorter. But the upper bound for US PhD programs is *considerably* longer, which moves the average time-to-completion up.\n\nThus, on average, a US MS-PhD or PhD program will (broadly) be a year or two longer than an equivalent European MS-PhD track.",

Outside the US, it takes you on average 4-6 years to get not only your PhD (3-4 years on average) but also your master (1-2 years on average) while in the US, it's 5-7 years to get only a PhD (most PhD programs do not give a master along the way). Moreover, because there's no hidden requirements inside the PhD programs outside the US, very good students can truly skip the hidden/required master part and end up with a PhD 3-4 years after their bachelor.\n\nThere are some professional degrees or terminal degrees too but those work differently.",

It is significantly easier to the point of trivial to defend a thesis if the majority of the material is published. You simply have to disclose what parts of the thesis are based on previously published work. In fact it is perfectly acceptable to copy and paste everything from a published paper into your thesis (with of course rewording to make the thesis flow as a single document).",

      "text": "Traditionally UK PhDs are 1+2. Your first year is essentially a Masters and then at the end of year one - after passing a review - you are \"Transferred\" to a PhD and complete in a total of 3 years.\n\nSo it's common to get into a PhD straight after a BSc which is 3+3. However, there is an increase in 4 year undergrad degrees often called MSc.\n\nThere is no requirement for a Master's to enter a PhD. UK degrees are classified as 1st, upper second, lower second and third class. If you have a 1st or upper second class UG degree then you can do direct entry. If you have a lower second, a Master's will be required.",
