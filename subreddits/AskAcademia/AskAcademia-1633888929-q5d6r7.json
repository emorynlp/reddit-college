  "text": "I am interested in applying for a TT assistant prof job in my field, but the application requires 2 pages of \"a presentation of your research program.\" I can't figure out what this means. Is this a summary of current and future research projects? What does it mean by \"program\"?  I haven't ever seen this asked for before and wondered if anyone knows what the application is asking for.",

      "text": "My interpretation would be that they are asking for a somewhat long-term \"research statement.\" They want something that sounds like more than a single book or paper or something. Obviously you need to make it somewhat concrete, and so specific books, papers, studies, etc., are important to \"anchor\" it \u2014 but they want you to depict your research as part of as longer plan than just short-term \"deliverables.\" \n\nAs an example, my short-term \"deliverables\" are papers and books and things like that relating to specific sub-topics. But overarching all of my work is both a thematic topic (in my case, the history of nuclear weapons) and also methodological approaches (e.g., epistemological lenses taken from the history of science and science and technology studies). And in my case I'd probably also talk about how I want my work to not only engage academic historians, but also political scientists and the lay public. So that's a \"research program\" that is more than the sum of its parts.",

I had thought maybe about discussing my current and upcoming research projects and what would come of those, but also my more general research interests, areas of specialization, and discipline-specific and interdisciplinary approaches.",

A \u201cprogram of research\u201d is like an album with music 12 tracks, where the tracks are papers, presentations, etc. each track is self contained\u2014some might get more traction than others, but regardless they will all be nested within a larger whole that is coherent. \n\nAnyone applying to TT jobs should keep this in mind. Committees don\u2019t just want to know you can crank out a paper or two. They want to make sure you have a program that is coherent and self-perpetuating.",
