      "text": "Congrats!\n\nIf you will have several people working on the grant or people joining and leaving throughout the course of the grant, it is well worth the time at the beginning to plan out a file management system. \n\nMy co-pi and I spent a considerable amount of time creating a number of \u201crules\u201d for our Dropbox folder. They ranged from general folder organization, creating new folders and location, how to name all types of files, etc. the goal was to have a set of files that would take someone new very little time to get up to speed finding specific files. We also wanted to be able to access the data years later when we had forgotten a lot of the organization. \n\nIt was fa lull us. Over five years on the grant, and the entire grant folder was remarkably organized. We just started some re-analysis of data several years later and it\u2019s just as easy to sift through over 2,000 files. \n\nAdditionally, we were also fanatical about creating documents describing every single procedure, method, way to analyze, etc. they took time, but then made manuscript writing very easy. And, we are using some of the methods now and it\u2019s wonderful to have the step by step how to document. \n\nFeel free to pm me if you want more info. I\u2019ve passed on our process many times.\n\nEDIT:  wow! I will work on a document that can be freely shared. It will take me a little bit of time to revise some subject-specific info. Once I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll post a link on this sub. Enjoy your day!",

It was great to know on a monthly basis how much was still left on the grant. He used an excel sheet that he said was a very common one, and he made the effort to talk w/ finance on a biweekly basis, getting an updated list of all expenses against his grant, including personnel hours (which was done monthly). It took some time to get finance to understand what he wanted, as that was something that no other PI had ever done. A time it really came in handy was when we lost a few personnel and needed to add a vendor so specific tasks could occur on time, and he was able to immediately show that his grant had the funds, which made that process go through much faster.",
