      "text": "I know this is not what you asked but while in grad school I bought a nice moleskin day planner and a huge whiteboard for my office. \n\nI divided my whiteboard into sections. The main section was a list of tasks with corresponding due dates - the tasks were small chunks of bigger things. The bigger things I tracked in a section called \u201cto do\u201d also with corresponding dates. \n\nSo for example \n\nTask - intro section of lit review, finish by April 3\nEtc\nEtc\n\nTo do - submit lit review chapter draft  to supervisor may 15  \nEtc\nEtc\n\nIn the planner I would flag specific things that needed to be done/read, etc. \n\nI organized my day so that the first thing I would do was check my planner (review the day before, the current day, and the next day) and then review my whiteboard.\n\nIt is so so so satisfying to put a line through a completed task and then once all tasks are done erase them and start a new list. \n\nBest of luck on your diss! Organization is half the battle.",
