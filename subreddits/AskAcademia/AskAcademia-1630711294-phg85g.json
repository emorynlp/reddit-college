  "text": "Hi everyone, I am currently a Math PhD at a decent top University (rank 10-20).  I am on the job market now and I have about 6 papers in PDEs, which only 2 of them are published (one in a fairly good one, one is in a mediocre one), the rest are preprints and in submission. However I don\u2019t feel these are impactful works, as when talking at conferences or with other mathematicians they don\u2019t seem to care much. Even my advisor is not optimistic about me landing a postdoc (left alone tenure-track, we know how hard it is). I think I can land a postdoc if I apply to many many places. However at this point I seem to lose motivation quite a lot. This attitude if I bring with me into postdoc would be a disaster. So I am here, asking advice on career change as I am truly confused and have been lethargic lately. The idea of picking a fairly different topic in the postdoc seems so scary to me, as imagine having no real mentor (Professors in my department all told me in postdoc you are alone).",

Maybe charting out a plan b or c that interests you can help take some pressure off of you so you can think more clearly about this and not feel like you're settling for a bad postdoc.",

      "text": "Basically, to be highly competitive for a tenure-track position in pure mathematics at a major research university, you need publications in highly prestigious journals, like the Annals, Inventiones, JAMS, etc., working in a field that is very hot, and have glowing letters from Fields Medalists, National Academy members, ICM invited speakers, etc.\n\nAt this stage of your career, it isn't such a big deal that only two papers have been published, but nether seem to have been placed in a highly prestigious journal, and more worryingly, nobody seems to be excited about the results that you have (which presumably also includes your unpublished work).\n\nIt is however untrue that you don't have a real mentor during your postdoc. In general, postdocs at research universities, even departmental postdocs that are funded primarily with teaching appointments, require a faculty member who is interested in your research to push for the appointment, and that faculty member then becomes either your de facto or official postdoc mentor.",

Unless you're a great teacher (in which case your background might work for teaching-focused faculty jobs), you'll need a major turnaround in a postdoc to be competitive at research-focused faculty jobs. And getting that big turnaround will be hard because you might not have a strong postdoc application. The industry job market in applied math is solid, and the academia job market is not. So focus on industry?",

      "text": "Lacking motivation will probably come across in interviews. I think someone hiring a postdoc wants to gauge intangible skills that you gained during your PhD, not just the hard metrics. Whether you're able to talk convincingly about how your past research motivates future ideas is important. Have you attended other people's faculty job talks at your university? What made the standout candidates successful? Whichever path you pick, I think selling yourself is a necessary evil for both industry and academia.",

Just go take the industry money and work-life balance. Just my 2 cents (though I'm not in math)",
