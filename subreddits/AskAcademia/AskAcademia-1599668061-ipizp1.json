  "title:": "My lab director/research supervisor is leaving the university and it's kind of freaking me out",
  "text": "I learned today that the lab director, who is also my research supervisor, is taking another job and leaving the university. This is really kind of unsettling, because I've been working with him for two a half years, and he's a big proponent of my research. The co-director is taking over his duties, but I haven't had as much of a working relationship with him. Also considering that I don't think he approves of my research this worries me that he might try to drop my project. I do head a fairly major project for the lab, so hopefully the fact my research opens new avenues of funding will outweigh any distaste he has for the research. \n\nI feel vaguely panicked, like the lab director leaving might imperil the entire lab. I just started my postdoc, so I'm not sure how common it is for research labs to transition directors. I'm also sort of panicked that they might not renew my contract. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience in stuff like this and can offer some insight?",
