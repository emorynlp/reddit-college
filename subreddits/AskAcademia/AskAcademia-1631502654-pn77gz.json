  "title:": "Do those of you with a Ph.D. frown upon those with an EdD?",
  "text": "There seems to be the perception that an EdD is inferior to a Ph.D. since maybe EdD programs take less time to complete and many don't require a full dissertation, but instead some type of quasi-experimental study such as capstone or action research project.  I've even heard some dismiss it as \"not a real doctorate.\" \n\nMy experience is that many K12 educators earn EdD's as a way to either #1 earn a bump on the teacher pay scale, #2 gain knowledge or certification in educational administration if their masters are not in education, but their content area #3 increase their chances of landing an administrative position, specifically a six-figure desk job at a school district's central office. \n\nWhen I was in grad school, there were a few tenured professors with EdDs in the College of Education teaching Methods courses. And I understand that they are the exception to the rule because they had a mile-long resume of working in K12 from teacher to principal to curriculum director before landing an academic job. \n\nWhile the degree may not be the best route to take in order to become a college professor, would you say it isn't a bad degree if the person isn't tethered to chasing a career in higher ed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. An Ed.D. is doable while working full time as a K12 teacher. For many of us, including myself, it just isn't feasible to leave the career world and live off a ramen noodle grad student stipend for a career field that seems just as arduous as a theater or film student trying to catch a lucky break in Hollywood. There's a great opportunity cost with sacrificing 3 to 5 years of full-time study towards a Ph.D. And while a public school teacher is already vested in a state retirement system and has a wife and kids to support along with a mortgage to pay, it doesn't seem feasible to give that all up for a chance to pursue an academic career path. I am not saying it's impossible, but highly risky where the risk may outweigh the reward. \n2. Several states, including where I am employed offer tuition reimbursement and pay increases for advanced degrees. While some may not be a fully-funded program, considering the teacher pay increases, some teachers may be able to break even with an EdD in just a couple of years after completion or shorter. \n3. It may make a teacher candidate more marketable in other avenues of education, like the aforementioned school district positions, instructional design, textbook consultant, content editor for an [ed.tech](https://ed.tech) company. I am not saying that an EdD is absolutely necessary for one of those careers, but it may make a candidate stand out in a pool full of MA applicants. While those jobs may not carry the same prestige as being a university professor, there are still ways to earn a decent living and do something enjoyable within the field of education besides just K12 classroom teaching. \n\nAgain, what are your thoughts? Do you see the EdD as purely a vanity degree or does it have merit in society?",

An EdD doesn\u2019t do that at all, so it\u2019s completely useless for most faculty positions.",
