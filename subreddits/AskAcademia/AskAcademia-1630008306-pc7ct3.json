  "title:": "A question about turnaround time of Major Revision acceptance",
  "text": "Hello all, I have an article under review after a major revision with a journal. While the reviewers had explicitly mentioned that there were minor issues, with about four issues a piece, the editor had requested a major revision. The good news is that the comments were mainly suggestions for the lit review, offering citations to add and incorporate to strengthen the article. Per etiquette, I replied to the editors and reviewers, acknowledged the validity of their feedback, and how I incorporated these comments into the revised paper. The journal is an Elsevier publication that shows a time to acceptance of about 22 days after the first decision, by my calculations (time to final decision - time to first decision). I should point out that I am day 10 of my wait. My question: what is the fastest time that anyone has experienced for acceptance after a revision?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you",

      "text": "I am co-editor-in-chief for an international journal with Wiley.\n\nThe real answer is that it depends on luck of the draw with reviewers and editors. I have sent acceptance letters within 24 hours if I happen to get the revised version on a day that I have set aside time for editor duties or I just happen to have time. Sometimes it takes me 5 days to get to it. It can take anywhere from a day to 3 months to get reviews back. My journal asks reviewers to return their work within 3 weeks. But that gets extended because they sometimes wait to accept the invitation to review, which starts the clock. They also sometimes just miss the deadline and ask for more time. Reviewers that are asked to re-review a paper are also very hard to replace, so I give them extensions if needed. I don\u2019t know if your editor is asking any reviewers to re-review. Typically we don\u2019t do that if they recommend minor revisions, but sometimes we do anyway because they have expertise we don\u2019t and we need their opinion on specific parts of a paper. \n\nJournal and editors vary widely. Best thing to do is email the editor directly and politely ask what is going on.",

      "text": "A major revision would normally go back to the same reviewers and they would usually have as much time to review as the original submission. Still this step is usually faster because the reviewers don't have to be \"re-identified\" (assuming they agree to review; otherwise it could take longer for a myriad of reasons). But your question is just asking about the faster time for a major revision turnaround. Maybe two months for me? But I haven't published much with Elsevier journals, and it can really vary with the individual journal and their editorial board. The lower limit could be a day or two if the paper doesn't go back to reviewers, but that would be unusual for a reputable journal and would likely be viewed as a rushed editor.",
