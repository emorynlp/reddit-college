  "text": "I get to introduce my mentor during a seminar this Friday. It\u2019s an honor and my mentor is AWESOME. I\u2019ve never done these before.\n\nI don\u2019t just want to read off his CV I want to have a small personal touch speaking to his excellent mentorship.\n\nAny advice on formatting this?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone! I\u2019ve got my oral quals tomorrow so I\u2019ve been studying. Your suggestions are excellent! Turns out the seminar is extremely formal so there is a highly formatted way to do the intros.",

I could mention how my mentor, dr [insert name here] did x and y and read a dry list of other impressive achievements but I\u2019d rather focus on what dr [insert name here]\u2019s mentor ship has meant to me.... then fill the time with lots of stories that demonstrate their great mentorship and how those stories really made an impression on you or made you a better person/researcher.  Really let the audience see the greatness rather than telling them.  \n\nI think that your mentor will appreciate that a lot.  It is extremely thoughtful.  It\u2019s touching without being cloying because it\u2019s genuine and authentic.  You got this!",
