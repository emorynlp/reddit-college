  "title:": "Professors with ADHD: What made the difference for your success, versus those of your colleagues with ADHD who didn't end up making it somewhere? What advice and reassurance do you have for grad students with ADHD worried about their own future?",
  "text": "I'm  a grad student with ADHD who's in need of a little hope.  I'm  definitely not actually planning to go into academia, myself, but I see  professors as people who have been comparatively successful at taming  the beast that is academia in their own lives, and if I don't actually  have to close the door on academia I certainly would like to make sure  of that.  I'm not feeling super confident about my own ability to do so  right now; I'm medicated and have a therapist (I also have a lot of  trauma I'm working through), but I've had a terrible string of a couple  of small safety incidents in the lab that's left me rattled, I've  decided that I'm definitely not cut out for bench science though I know  I've got solid computational skills, and the energy it takes to manage  my ADHD saps my energy to do - well, my work, and live a full life.  The  pandemic is not helping by any means.  It has shot a massive hole in my  self-confidence and motivation, which I spent much of graduate school  trying to build after a pretty bad first few years and then switching to  an advisor who actually worked well with me, and there's a pretty good chance I think academia is more of a forbidding hellscape than it actually is at this point, because at this point it feels like a forbidding hellscape that I will never be smart or mentally agile enough or have enough executive functioning to contend with.\n\nI  know there are profs on here with ADHD and it always fills me with awe  that anyone with ADHD is able to manage to be a professor, because from  my position I feel I'm barely managing to keep up with even the middle  of the rest of the grad student pack, if I'm even doing that at all.\n\nThose  who've \"made it\" with ADHD, what do you think the biggest factors in  your success were, what do you see hindering the progress of students  who have ADHD who aren't successful, and what wise words of advice  and/or reassurance would you like to share?",

The 'big breakthrough' for me was learning to work with, rather than against, my own rhythms. This took decades. But, a big part of it that you might begin is a system of scheduling that charts out 'big goals,' but leaves plenty of leeway on a moment to moment level. \n\nThe timeframe might not work for you, but I've found weekly schedules within larger projects works really well. So, if I know I want to submit an article in three months, I can chart backwards from there. I know how many words I want to average a day and how many total I want written by the end of the week. So long as I'm hitting those goals, I can take a day, an hour, or a week off as I need to. \n\nPlay to your strengths and build responsibility and accountability into your systems. For me, that's let me fuck up, be myself, and go off on the tangents *I need*, while still hitting the milestones my job *requires*.",

I have my 'big' goals (article submitted to X journal by Y date) and I build my 'structure' from there (1k words a week).\n\n*Within that week,* I might find myself working and writing 750 words in one day... then skipping three days to stare at paint drying, engage in intense bouts of self-loathing, and eat ice cream with my kids ... then I wrap up with 100 words a day the next three days to end up with... 1050 words for the week. Hurrah for me, I have accomplished my goals and will open a beer! *Or whatever*.\n\nThe point isn't that you follow a pattern like mine - perhaps your timelines only work out at months or maybe you need to do daily by the hour... I can't say. *Maybe none of this works for you*. But, what I can say is that the *best* tip I have is to learn the rhythms of your own work cycles and build up a system that holds you accountable *within those rhythms*.",

If you don't know how to start thinking, then writing isn't something you need to worry about right now. When I don't know what to write, it usually signals to me that I haven't read enough, haven't spent enough time analyzing my data, or that I need to sit down with a friend and colleague and talk it out to put some of my errant thoughts into a coherent narrative. Once that's done, I pre-write. From pre-writing, I usually move pretty seamlessly (and often unconsciously) into free-writing my first draft. The rule of free-writing is no editing. Whatever comes into my head when I look at the pre-writing I did goes on the paper, whether it makes sense or is grammatically correct or feels slightly off-topic. Then I come back a few days later and revise my free-writing into a more formal draft and voila, first draft is finished and it was only a little bit painful.",

Urgent things are whatever my brain is telling me need to be done RIGHT NOW. The problem with ADHD is that basically everything in your head becomes labeled URGENT, even though it's probably not. Important things tend to be larger and need to be broken down into smaller subtasks. It often doesn't really really feel like these subtasks are URGENT since they're just small pieces of something bigger.\n\nI have found that setting up a physical [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) at my desk just above my monitors (really just sticky notes on the wall) seriously accelerated my ability to get the \"important\" stuff done. I think the reason for this is that the rhythm for my energy and the rhythm for my attention tend to be completely out of phase. Whenever I'm most fired up to work on something is precisely when I'm most likely to go off on a tangent or work on the first \"urgent\" issue I see rather than an \"important\" issue that might be at the back of my mind.\n\nThe Kanban board is the perfect way to hijack my brain's idiosyncrasies and I end up sitting down at my computer, looking at the board, and picking one of the tasks rather than coming up with what I want to do on the spot. This really helps me from going down rabbit-holes during my most productive times. Maybe it could work for you too!",

It's really impossible for me to say!\n\n> Also, in general, what tips do you have for communicating with a professor who...\n\nI don't know as I never encountered this. I was an older PhD student and while everyone who meets me *knows*, I had my systems in place and so performance was never an issue. That *and* my advisor had personal experience... Sorry, I just can't say!\n\nI *think* I'd highlight outcomes. I'd sort of point out 1. here is where I am. 2. here is how I work. 3. here is demonstrated evidence of how I'll meet what we need. 4. here are areas where I might get lost and you might help. By putting 3 ahead of 4, you don't let it become a piling on session.\n\n>What did you find some of your more general strengths were, and what strengths do you see researchers with ADHD in general having?\n\nIt made me really sad to hear that you've been brought \"low,\" by this. I get it. I truly do. But, I always try to view this as a gift of sorts. I can process information incredibly quickly, often along multiple axes at once. Not perfectly and I'll miss things, I'll make mistakes, I'll act 'rashly' and have intense emotions; that's a part of it. But, *still*, there's so much that's special about having ADHD - how you can focus, how you can leap between ideas, how you can change intellectual gears on a dime... *if* you can learn to work with how your mind works, there's so much there that you can harness.\n\nI know this sounds like some GOOP/MLM ad about essential oils and mystic self-realization, but I don't mean it like that. Your mind *works* in a certain way; instead of trying to force yourself to do so, figure out what matters, meet (exceed!) those standards with your gifts, and then fuck off and stare at a wall or spin around in circles till you fall over. You know, the good ADHD shit. :)\n\nSorry, I rarely talk about this, feel free to keep asking questions or DM me down the line. I can't promise I'll be able to answer all your questions, but I'll try.",

Those brought out the absolute worst of my ADHD, but those schedules are long gone as a professor. A schedule that keeps me bouncing around makes me much more productive.\n\nMy personal biggest ADHD issue is starting *anything*, but as I've gotten more responsibility people come to me now with tasks - hey how do I do this, what do you think of this data etc - so my day is no longer completely dictated by my own ability to reach out to someone or start every task \"from nothing\" which is how I felt as a grad student. \n\nNot everyone reacts like this, and it is certainly overwhelming, and I drop the ball all the time, but I've found adding layers to my day suits my ADHD more than competes with it.\n\nAlso, adderall.",

I usually execute most of my tasks properly, but they screw up because I forgot one step, usually - and that step makes me need to scrap the entire protocol because I messed it up, or winds up with me being yelled at (which further damages my confidence).\n\nI've never had a problem starting anything, thankfully, but once I get anything started, especially if it's at the bench, I get incredibly anxious about making sure I've done everything right, because I've eaten it real hard in the past if I've forgotten even the slightest thing.  I have some pretty significant issues about this, actually.\n\nComputational work is definitely detail-oriented, no doubt, but you're not going to blow up the lab or waste expensive chemicals/parts or break a machine if you screw up.  Worst you could do is accidentally schedule a bazillion jobs or code an infinite loop and get an angry email from the cluster admin, and then you just have to kill the job, fix it, and start it over.  I have never been yelled at or gotten nervous over my computational work (although there was the time the cluster admin sent me an email about taking up a massive amount of cluster real estate with my data, but that was easily fixed and I have a good relationship with him).\n\nOne of the best decisions I made in grad school was teaching myself to program.",

But now my position makes it much less awkward for me to just walk over to someone's office or give them a call instead of a writing an email which has saved me a lot of grief. As a grad student either of those things would have been inappropriate, and the unbalanced power dynamics made writing emails that much harder.

If you can, explain to him your method for studying, so he can understand your process.\nIf he looks interested in helping, you can even give him information about teaching adults with adhd (there's a lot of resources on internet, you can look for some that make sense to you and givit to him)\nAnd don't be apologetic about adhd, is just something that you live with, and need to learn how to manage. \n\nI found this article and I like the approach \nhttps://www.weareteachers.com/teacher-with-adult-adhd/\n\nPS: My method for studying is to have some white noise on the background (for me was movies that I already have seen in spanish, is my first language so no distraction, or YouTube videos of streets with heavy rain) and a piece of paper and a pen to take notes, mostly questions or opinions about something, related or not what I reading... Generally I need to write the other thing that I'm y thinking of, to clean my head and focus on the task that I need to do. I also 'manage' my medicine, at least aradix let me use it when I needed the most, so I manage the hour of take it according to my schedule, if I don't have classes in the morning I just take the pills in the afternoon and concentrate the effect. I don't know if this can work with your medication, ask your doctor.",

      "text": "Well, I wouldn't say I've \"made it,\" but I'm doing ok! \n\nEveryone's advice to work with your own rhythm is spot on.  \n\nI take my pomodoro method one step further and have an app that blocks certain apps on my computer while I'm working, I highly recommend that. Also, I have an email client that compiles all of my email into an app with minimal bells and whistles, and it also keeps me off our web-based email service.  \n\nI see my email at many points through the day, but I only answer three times a day.  Once in the morning, I spend ~30 minutes dealing with email.  Once around 2pm I'll respond to messages that have come in. And then once again around 7 (from home; it's unavoidable). Somedays I skip one (or even 2) of these email sessions, depending on what's in my inbox or how busy my day is. But this helps me massively, because I will go down an email rabbit hole, much in the same way I am writing you a novel now...\n\nAnd definitely find your work rhythm and productivity windows. \n\nMy work schedule is something like this: \n\nWake up and putz around my house talking to and watering my plants while I drink coffee. During this time I'm actually going through all the tings I want to do in the day in my head.  It seems like such a trivial part of the day, but on days where I can't have time to myself in the morning to think and talk to myself, I'm off.\n\nThen I start work, at home, in my PJs most of the time, but I have a dedicated work station at home. Emails always. Then some writing or lecture fixing; any work I need to get done but don't need to be on campus to do.  \n\nThen, I do need to get to campus at some point. So, I shower (sometimes exercise) get dressed and go to work. This is a good little break for me. (This also works out because the custodians who got to campus at like 2 am are now going home for the day, and are just leaving their primo parking spots). When I get to my office/lab I am ready to work again, hopefully.  I typically take a B vitamin (Floradix) here too; its totally anecdotal, but I feel like it helps me focus and to feel less tired. \n\nI try to force myself to take regular breaks for lunch, and I like to go for a walk to get coffee in the afternoons.  \n\nMy point being-- I have a weird work schedule, but it *works* for me. \n\nThe hardest part of productivity for me is that I really want to uni-task. I want to devote all of my time and attention to say, my paper revisions, but that can't really happen because there are classes to teach, and committees to snooze through. When I am struggling, I will look at my calendar and figure out if I can swing a day that I can block out to just devote to the one thing I want to really really delve into.",

      "text": "Hi! I'm not a professor but a starting grad student with ADHD so I'm not sure I'm allowed to get involved in this conversation. I don't think my ADHD is as impactful as it is in your case, so don't read this as a 'just do this, and you'll be fine' comment. This is just a little bit about my own experience, but who knows, maybe some of it is of help to you too.\n\n* Writing: I'm really bad at starting things and with finishing them on time. What helps me is to create deadlines artificially, because I do manage to do stuff when I'm under pressure and/or feel responsible towards other people.  How you can do this probably depends on the structure of your program and what you prefer, but I do this by letting my advisor know when I expect to finish chapters/writing/experiments and when I will send it to them. They don't need to do anything with this info but I've told them it helps me to feel a bit of pressure to keep my promises and they like being up to date. If it's something that doesn't involve my advisor, I buddy up with another student who has the same problem, and we give each other deadlines to send each other chapters to review. That way I feel like I would disappoint them if I don't send it without a good reason, and it makes the writing process less lonely and more productive.\n* Experiments: I have the same issue as you and I don't really have a solution. I'm scared all the time that me being chaotic will cause me to make mistakes and mess up my experiments. I talked about this with another student in my lab a while ago, and they mentioned that being scared to mess up is a sign that I care about the experiments, my work and the succes of the lab. While there is a point where worrying about this becomes very unproductive, try to remind yourself that you worry because you care and are serious about what you do, and also that it is normal to make mistakes as a grad student. \n\nFinally, it's already pretty great that you're aware of your ADHD and are taking it seriously, and it's a major accomplishment to be in grad school with ADHD. Even if you find that academia is not for you because of it, that doesn't mean that you failed as opposed to those who've 'made' it with ADHD. In any case, good luck!",

For me it is easy, I can develop project-related tunnel vision so I use that to my advantage (the downside is if I think a paper is garbage there is no tunnel vision, but no great loss there in the long run).\n\nSo, if you're thinking of a way to succeed in academia *without* a plan to manage long term self-guided projects, stop right there. That's the wrong approach. What will help you (in or out of academia) is a method that works **for you** to tackle those sorts of projects.\n\nAnd, re-emphasizing self-directed here, because some advisor relationships result in work that is not self directed. You'll have to chart the course and make the schedule for work eventually, and if you've never done that before and never considered it, it can be a lot to tackle during your first job.

So I've developed a set of coping skills that have been immensely helpful:\n\n1. I use my phone calendar religiously and link it to my work calendar. This means scheduling everything immediately when it comes up. In particular, meetings with students are made while I'm replying to their emails or talking to them directly.\n2. I write everything down and trust nothing to my memory.\n3. I use a corkboard with a tracking system for each paper letting me know where it is in among the stages of development so I can know where my effort needs to be placed over an extended period of time.\n4. I use EndNote to store my highlighted .pdf files and maintain notes about each paper I read.\n5. I store every word I write, even paragraphs that I eventually cut from a paper so that I don't have to remember if I decide to revert back to previous versions or rework some previous thought.\n6. I'm open about my \"disability\" (I recognize it is one, but it hasn't been so bad for me compared to what others deal with, thus the quotes) with my co-authors and students. I invite them to follow-up with me if something slips through the cracks. You'd think they'd resent having to monitor me, but I've found the opposite seems to happen...they recognize I'm doing my best and are willing to offer support (within reason). \n\nSomeone else here mentioned something that is really important for me: working with my personal rhythms. Writing a paper is a weird process for me - I'm scattered and appear unproductive until everything clicks, then I spit out a draft in a rapid burst of activity. This means I sometimes pull all-nighters and sleep late the next day. Other days, I read and reflect without much to show for it except jumbled internal thoughts. I've learned to be OK with that. I'll be even more OK with that as more papers get through the publication process (thankfully my teaching is quite good).",

Also, everyone has different coping mechanisms. I believe the ones who don't make it haven't found theirs.\n\nFor me, the difference that I notice is whether people end up doing the work or not. I may work one hour on, one hour off all day. It might be 12 hours one day and 4 the next. Maybe I will have one bad Wednesday and make up for it on the weekend. For me it's about getting the hours done, 40 (ish) hours of the week are for work, so as long as it gets done then it's fine.\n\nSo, my advice is find what works for you. It could be different from me, it could be different to everyone here, you just have to see what works. For me, my office desk was coding/writing only. If I got distracted, id walk away from it. Trying to associate my desk with work. My main issue is reading because I have ADD and dyslexia. I would read a paper one paragraph at a time, in different locations. You'd find me sitting on window ledges, in stairwells, in the cafeteria, on the stairs outside the front of the department... Etc. One time it was up a tree next to the university lake. I have even ventured to other departments. The psychology department was next door and I think they found it weird, but also because they were psychology, they were awesome about it. I just found it so hard to concentrate to read that moving helped a lot\n\nThis week, though I am no longer a postdoc or a PhD, I worked until 2-3am three days and did next to no work on Thursday or Friday. I made up for it Saturday and those three late nights. Also, with me, if I'm on a roll I shouldn't stop. Doesn't matter the time or anything, just keep going until that roll has stopped. I've done 20 hour days before followed by a day off because I was in the zone. With ADD, I can't let those times be wasted.\n\nSorry about the long wall of text. You'll find your coping skills! You could even talk to the disability office, they might have some things about it. (Side note: I hate that it's called the disability office. I consider dyslexia and ADD different ways of thinking, they are not disabilities. I honestly find it insulting)",

I do great research and invest a lot in my students, but I think that academia may not be a great place for people like me. \n- Being a professor is like having three different jobs: research, teaching, and administrative (\u201cservice\u201d) work\n  - Managing these three separate streams of tasks and deadlines is overwhelming\n  - Switching between streams is tough, and I lose track of important information during these transitions\n- Academics already tend to work constantly and lack work-life boundaries, which amplifies my anxiety over unfinished tasks \n- My publication record is abysmal. I have worked on the same four (good) papers for years.\n- I fail to meet deadlines for conference or grant application submissions all the time\n- Poor organization leads to poor student evaluations of teaching\n\nMy advice is to be sure that academia is really where you want to be.",

If you can get the degree, you should be able to be a professor. If you can get the degree, and you can't be a professor, that's not your fault. That's forces far beyond you that manifest themselves into your life as whatever personal criticism someone who is intentionally searching can make of you, and if it weren't ADHD, it would be something else. You can do whatever work you want on your own heart and mind for its own sake, but your ability to get a job has nothing to do with that.  Don't hate yourself. Hate capitalism.",
