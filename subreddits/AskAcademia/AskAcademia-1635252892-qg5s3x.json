  "text": "I\u2019m relatively new to the US and so don\u2019t have a great handle on how everything works here yet.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been offered a job as a TA. Thing is, I\u2019m not currently a student. I\u2019ve been offered the job at a college I am not attending, and probably will never attend. I am an established professional in my field, and the job description specifically required extensive real-world experience. I thought it could be a bit of fun, helping out at the college for a bit of extra money.\n\nI\u2019m now realizing that TA\u2019s are often students who use the role to supplement their income and/or take some money off their tuition. Which is totally cool. I think it would be kinda great if I were, say, a graduate student for those exact reasons. \n\nBut I\u2019m a professional who freelances and makes a day rate significantly higher than the barely-above-minimum-wage rate being offered.  Now, sure, I don\u2019t work *every day* but I am often booked out by the week. I\u2019m quickly getting the idea that I would need to commit to be at all the classes I\u2019m assigned, which is quickly not adding up financially.\n\nIs it uncommon for TA\u2019s to be non-students? And are there any benefits to being a TA that I haven\u2019t thought of\u2026? I don\u2019t want to be a professor, although I would happily teach a short course/class when I\u2019m not working.",

      "text": "I wouldn't say that it's uncommon, though it might depend on the field/course that you're teaching - my experience is in STEM. At my university, most of the TAs were graduate students because the departments required the students to teach in order to get a stipend (unless their PI funded them completely as a Research Assistant, or RA, but you can imagine how rare that was). If the department didn't have enough graduate students to cover all of the sections, they would then hire adjunct TAs to cover the class. Most of the time these would be post-docs from the same university, and they'd get the teaching money on top of their salary, but there were a few occasions of someone coming in from outside the university to teach. \n\nAll that to say that it's not really uncommon, but the cost to benefit ratio won't be great. Teaching those classes, even as a TA where the course plan is set by someone else, really takes a large chunk of time and effort.",

It\u2019s for a specialized conservatory-style school and they want me to oversee a bunch of technical stuff as well. Which is all cool, sounds like a bit of fun. But it just doesn\u2019t make sense from a financial standpoint and the thing that is mostly confusing to me is I\u2019m not sure how they could expect to get industry professionals to TA at effectively minimum wage.\n\nI studied in my home country and we did receive instruction from real industry professionals, but o know the University I went to was only able to achieve that by paying them a *heap* of money. I never expected it to be a heap of money, but I did expect it to be a little more than min wage.",

However, I did not expect min wage as a rate of pay, and it\u2019s completely unworkable at that rate of pay. I would be happy to take a pay cut to give back in this way, have a bit of fun and assist new industry entrants. However, to do so would be utterly unviable financially, at least if there were any semblance of a commitment involved. \n\nI\u2019d happily work for minimum wage on my days off doing this, but I can\u2019t turn down professional work for it and that\u2019s where the disconnect is from me. The expectation was set that it would be \u2018up to 25 hours per week\u2019 consisting of in class assistance and out of class assistance on students\u2019 projects. That\u2019s what was most confusing - if it were a matter of \u2018if you have any free time we\u2019d love your help,\u2019 that\u2019s one thing, but an expectation of a certain number of hours per week at a pay rate that could see me make less in a fortnight than I would make in a day is unworkable, and I guess I figured a professional conservatory-type school might have figured that out before now.\n\nTAs are not a thing where I come from, and the few conservatory-style schools that exist *do* hire industry professionals, but it\u2019s on a \u2018if you\u2019re free, come down\u2019 basis, or a \u2018we know you\u2019ll have to turn down work to do this job, so we\u2019re offering you a very competitive pay rate\u2019",

That said, it sounds like you applied for this (as opposed to being solicited)? So: what position did the job ad state?\n\nAnyway, to my mind, even if you applied rather than being invited, clearly your experience and expertise fills a gap they can't otherwise fill. In this context (you mentioned conservatory) being offered the role of TA seems insulting and--as you noted--clearly a move to justify low pay.\n\nThere can be benefits to being, say, a guest lecturer/etc. These kinds of invitations stem from a recognition of your expertise, come with the freedom to design your own course (and to be pretty loose with it, in a way that normal faculty can't be), and pay enough to be worth it. (Still not a lot, but far more than minimum wage.) So, you can get bragging rights, teaching experience if you've been curious about that, and a nice chunk of change.\n\n**This is not that.** (If you're really curious/excited, there's nothing wrong with taking a financial hit to have a new experience, if you have a stable career. At the same time, on principle, I kind of feel like you should say screw that. It's mind-boggling how academia devalues people, even when it needs their knowledge/labor.)",

          "text": ">clearly your experience and expertise fills a gap they can't otherwise fill. \n\nYes. In addition to TAing, it was mentioned that I would assist students with the needs of their projects in my professional capacity. Imagine a \u2018design for fashion\u2019 class where the school hires a professional screen printer to assist with the class, screen print students\u2019 designs as part of the learning environment of the class, and outside of class assist other students who might need screen printing done as part of other design projects. Now, I\u2019m not a screen printer and that\u2019s a very basic example but that\u2019s the gist. To my mind, that may or may not fit within the duties of a TA - certainly \u2018Teaching Assistant\u2019 seems like a pretty broad description - but *I* wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to hire a professional screen printer for minimum wage, and I\u2019m not sure why any school would, especially one that purports to be teaching students specifically about said industry and should know things like going rates, respect for professionals and should theoretically want to attract working professionals to help out at their school, rather than turn them away.\n\n>If you're really curious/excited, there's nothing wrong with taking a financial hit to have a new experience, if you have a stable career.

Committing to a class schedule would be impossible; my day rate is higher than what I would make in a fortnight working this TA job.",
