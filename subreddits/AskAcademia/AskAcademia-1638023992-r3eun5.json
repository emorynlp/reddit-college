  "title:": "Is 3 colleges too little to apply to for grad school?",
  "text": "I've just sent off my first batch of applications to grad school and have only applied to 3 places, the 3 schools that seemed the best fit for my interests and to which I felt I could make the strongest applications (although one of them is a top Ivy, so I'm not realistically expecting an offer to come of that). Anyway, I'm wondering whether I should apply to a few more colleges to ensure myself, in case bad luck or otherwise derails these applications. But I'm in two minds: realistically, I can't find that many more where there's a really good fit between the faculty and my interests and the application fees are pretty exorbitant... I'd be grateful for some advice.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not in admissions, but I\u2019d have to say the answer to this really depends on your situation and desires. There probably isn\u2019t enough info here to advise properly. For example, I applied to one program for my MS and one for my PhD. That\u2019s it. (Both worked out within my goals, geographic location, and I was pretty confident I\u2019d be accepted.) It sounds like you\u2019ve applied to schools that really fit your interest, and I think that\u2019s ideally how it should be done. But if your goal is to \u201cgo to grad school\u201d then applying to more may be appropriate, especially if you want to be funded also. There is definitely a cost (time and money) benefit balance to consider when applying and paying fees, etc. Good luck!",

      "text": "You\u2019ve gotten good responses so far, so I\u2019ll just reply anecdotally in case it helps. My first round was a bit of a spray and pray out of undergrad which got me 6 rejections and a funded MA offer. I tried again with MA in hand two years later and got another 6 rejections including the school where I got the MA (ouch, but it was fair that my specialty was poorly supported by current faculty). \n\nA year later I carefully honed my application and made sure I had selected the appropriate schools, and out of 2 applications I got a rejection and a funded PhD offer. I took the latter but found that the school atmosphere was terrible for me: rigidly formal and over-structured. I left after a little over a year. \n\nBut, after spending a few years working as an adjunct and in industry, plus getting my mental health in order (properly medicated, and with a proportional understanding of education and career), I tried one last time. \n\nI carefully applied to three perfect schools and got two funded and one unfunded PhD offers. I went to the unfunded one, believe it or not, based on prestige \u2014 and secured lucrative government-based funding. Now I\u2019m months away from submitting a PhD thesis I\u2019m truly happy with, a project I believe in and crossed the ocean to achieve. \n\nSo, in short: the number you apply to doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s all about the fit with your research and your professional goals.",

The others, I believe, have between 5-9% acceptance rates and since they're more mid-tier are unlikely to be as competitive. I'd have thought I'd be competitive for at least one of them. On paper, I should be for both, but unfortunately I have a criminal record (one stupid night of madness) dating from a few years back which I had to declare on one of the apps and which will probably sink my chances.",

You might be a sure shot even though it\u2019s a tip-tier school, or you might not stand a chance at a mediocre one. Hard to say.",

If we get a high quality applicant interested in international trade, I\u2019m gonna have a seventh or eighth student. \n\nThe only way you can really avoid that is by getting on the committee and strategically turning down people you know would be looking to work with you. In practice, this means that we have some folks who have tons of students and others who haven\u2019t advised a student in years. Probably not the most efficient system.",

Our weakness has been in quality of grad students we\u2019re able to attract. So if we want to break into, say, top 25-30, that means we need to admit the best students we can. There are obviously some attempts to maintain balance across subfields, but standouts are standouts. \n\nAs for within-cohort competition, that\u2019s definitely a potential concern. But we generally assume a high rate of attrition. So even if we admit four, one or two might wash out, and another may end up transferring to a higher-ranking program.",

Even though I was considered a highly qualified applicant and was a finalist for half of the programs I applied to, I was only accepted into 1, which was my fallback school. Ultimately I decided to not attend because it wasn't a good fit for me.\n\nInstead of going overboard, I wholeheartedly wish I had only applied to schools I knew would be an excellent fit and that I would 100% attend if offered a spot.",
