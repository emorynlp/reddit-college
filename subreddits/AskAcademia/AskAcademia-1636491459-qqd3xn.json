Everyone has perfect grades, everyone has published a paper or 10 in a decent journal, so the only way to determine if we should risk hiring you is by listening to people who took a slightly lesser risk by hiring you in the previous step of the process.\n\nThe earlier this is enforced, the higher chance that the whole process yields a functioning scientist (by whatever metrics the community judges important).",

In my experience, at my institution, they are not a major part in the decision-making process (they are all too universally positive to matter much; they do not differentiate well). Publication record is a place where even a crowded field tends to differentiate, by comparison (the number and quality of publications do influence deliberations \u2014 especially if they are lacking). The quality of a candidate's self-presentation, in both written and oral forms, also (in my experiences) is a huge differentiator. But I am sure this varies by institution and by field. Personally I do not really trust advisors to be all that honest about their advisees; they have a vested interest (even if only psychological) in seeing them placed.\n\n(Separately, you mention grades for hiring \u2014 I have never seen grades for a faculty hire. I wouldn't even think to ask.)",

And if your place is below that level, everyone has dozens of PRL (in my case) papers, etc. At any step of the h-index ladder, you have hundreds of people with exactly the same number of papers with equivalent impact applying for the one open position.
