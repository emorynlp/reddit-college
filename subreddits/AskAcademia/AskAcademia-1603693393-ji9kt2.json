  "title:": "There should be more opportunities for people who like teaching",
  "text": "For those who enjoy lecturing a lot and want to focus on teaching rather than research, there should be more job opportunities in academia. Far too often have I seen professors who hate teaching giving lectures and not putting any effort into the material or presentation, and I get it is because they have this huge pressure to spend most of their time researching.\n\nHowever, the educational aspect should be just as important as research at universities. Students need proper guidance and mentoring from people who can spend a lot of time putting good lessons together. Universities dont value teaching staff that much because their rankings are based on research output.\n\nAnd I often see an argument to justify this and it is that \"you need to keep up with the latest research in order to teach subjects properly\" but you know what? That is straight up BS. You dont need the latest research to teach calculus, or classical physics. You dont need the latest research to teach students to use numerical methods to solve problems with a computer: even old algorithms work well with modern computers. The truth is, you dont need the latest research to teach subjects to undergraduate students. The foundations are there and have always been there. Calculus doesnt suddenly change every year. Same applies to a lot of subject areas.\n\nLet more people who like teaching teach, and let those who like doing rsearch do research. Everyone wins including the students.\n\n*Edit: I am not saying as a lecturer you shouldn't keep up with latest trends in the field, because you can easily do that by reading journals/articles on a semi-frequent basis. I am just saying that you don't need to be at the cutting edge of discovery to teach undergraduate courses, so there is no need for a lecturer to have to \"publish\" articles continuously throughout the year. To give you an example, I studied both mechanical engineering and physics in my undergrad, and all the content we learned including fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and semiconductor physics was stuff that is well-established and has been around for at least 40-50 years. Adding more stuff to that isn't going to make things more effective for students because they need to understand the foundations first. It is fine to offer more \"research\" based courses but this shouldn't be the main focus of the university degree. Far too many people I know have ended up with very little knowledge and understanding of physics because some lecturers wanted to teach their very niche and specific research topics in class before even teaching them the foundations they needed to grasp the advanced concepts.\n\n** 2nd edit: Ok I realise most people here are from the US and it seems like your situation is different. I should have pointed out I am from Australia and the situation here is quite different. Most people in academia do 70% research and 30% teaching, and there are no positions that focus entirely on teaching other than \"teaching fellowships\" which are more scarce than Dean positions. So if you like teaching in Australia, it is likely you will end up in high school teaching even after you get your phD, which is what most of my colleagues have had to do.",

      "text": "STEM lecturer at an R1 here. I love to teach and am lucky to get to devote my time and effort to it. The lecturers at my institution who are the most involved and respected still care about research in a few ways. First, they try to follow advancements in our field by some combination of keeping a science Twitter, attending conferences, or regularly scanning top journals. This allows them to provide up-to-date examples and cool \"science news\" for their students. Second, they engage in pedagogical research to learn more about effective ways to teach their material. This isn't the same as scientific research, but it's using a scientific approach to learn how to improve your teaching.\n\nOur institution actively encourages us to do both of these things, but with one major caveat. They don't really provide funds for it. Right now, our lecturers start around ~$50k for a 10 month appointment. Our institution gives us each some professional development funds to use on things like conferences, but that seems to be around $1000 as a one time chunk of money. Several on-campus grants and scholarships are available for pedagogical research.\n\nThe other difficulty is that there aren't a ton of these positions. My dept has about 15 lecturers and 70 tenure track faculty. I was hired 2.5 years ago and it was their first ever national search for a lecturer; prior to that time, they were typically filled by spousal accommodations or recent graduates of our department.\n\nAt our institution, at least some of this seems to be changing. We have ranks of promotion, similar to what tenure track folks have, though without the benefit of tenure. They just added a third rank, which allows lecturers to have room for growth beyond their first 5-6 years. Many lecturers were upset to learn that obtaining this third rank requires participation in pedagogical research, which had never been an explicit part of our job descriptions. Hopefully they'll end up offering additional funds to make that possible.",

          "text": "I will say this is a very discipline specific thing. \n\nLab research in STEM is really, really hard to nearly impossible to keep a really active program going with at a PUI, since there are constant costs, and getting grants requires competing with people who have 20-50 graduate students working for them full time + technical staff. \n\nKeeping up with your field is important, but there's a difference between keeping up and pushing the barriers to create new knowledge. The latter has a different impact than the former on teaching. \n\nI say this as someone who keeps up an active research program involving undergraduates, and while it's something I enjoy, it does not significantly inform my teaching. Most of what I teach is foundational material that is not rapidly changing. My research is a niche area that has little to no relationship to what I teach. Maybe once every few years I'll get a chance to teach a special topics course related to what I work on for research. 95% of my teaching does not touch on anything related to my research.\n\nThis is very different for my colleagues in the humanities and social sciences- they much more frequently get a chance to teach courses related to their research, and their research involves more engagement with the literature and an ever-changing body of work that they will teach.",

The brief history of the field, is as useful for academic theoretical teaching, as the bleeding edge of technology. The bleeding edge of technology can also be irrelevant to be taught a few years later as it was all hype and the results were problematic. \n\nIn practical terms it is a bit different, but this is really a post-graduate issue.",

My field (machine learning) moves fast enough that a conference paper presented last year can easily be the standard method for solving a certain class problems this year. But those courses are often taught as research seminars anyway. For basically everything below that level, pedagogy is probably more important than being absolutely current in your field in terms of student success.",

I teach research methods in my 3- and 400-level lab courses and my students get the basic skills of experimental design and data collection through those experiences, while my actual research interests (that I can engage with in the summer months if I so desire) would hardly benefit the vast majority of my students because of how incredibly narrow they are compared to what I actually teach.",

For instance, in our CS department we have a teaching faculty that teach game courses who makes games rather than write papers about games, and I think this is fine. Something like this might be easier to do in CS than in other fields though. \n\nUnfortunately I've seen several teaching faculty that don't do anything in their field outside of teaching. They come in, teach the same courses on auto pilot for years and years, do a few hours of admin work, and collect a fat paycheck given the amount of time they put into the job. This is pretty unethical IMO, and typically it leads to these faculty 1) teaching outdated material, 2) being unwelcome to new pedagogy techniques (e.g., active learning techniques) and tools, and 3) thinking that their courses are the end all be all of a student's education and not seeing how their tree of a course fits into the curriculum forest.\n\nAll that said, the teaching-only faculty that do _something_ ( a little research or some other activity to apply their discipline) tend to be the best damn educators I've ever met. There's definitely room for faculty whose only job responsibilities do not include heavy research, but IMO they can't just check out of their field and still be a great teacher.",

Also if you are the leader in your field, doing the most novel results pulling in cash, that doesn't mean that there is actually that much cash to go around, a new researcher isn't turning up and pulling in millions, like the original PI might be. They need to learn skills that are functional and broadchurch that will allow them to do their research, not some super-specific technique that they will probably never use, if it can even be used out of its very specific role.",

They tend to end up using those as fielding grounds for new lecturers so they can get used to the admin. It does help though to at least be aware of what's happening in your field though. I distinictly remember the day some researchers announced that they found something travelling faster than the speed of light and it was all over the news. Asked our physics lecturer about it and he broke down how it's proooobably not true and that some of the authors were taking names of the paper etc. But with my third year and final year courses they were becoming specialised enough that it was important that lecturers addressed new developments and especially since it helps put out feelers for students that might be interested in postgrad. I'd say have dedicated staff for the first and second year for teaching (and research on the side as well) but keep research profs for later years and just give them goddamn training on how to teach.",

My undergrad experience at a research university had quite a few teachers who had absolutely no love or aptitude for teaching (they are primarily hired for their research which is their main thing and then the teaching responsibility is tagged on.) Additionally, most college tuition does not go towards paying teachers or the institutions directly supporting teaching. Compounding wealth growth and non-profit requirements have created ridiculous administrative bloat within academia in addition to a plethora of shiny surface features and developments to attract more donors and students from affluent families (who will mostly remain affluent due to, again, compounding wealth growth and estate tax loopholes, making them pretty safely future possible donor alumni)\n\nMaybe as we reframe our mindset towards all institutions, we will look towards the inability of academia to support the workforce of PhD grads it is creating, and with a possible change of priorities and values, find a demand for new types of jobs. There are applications beyond teaching to a person who is skilled in self-teaching and teaching others, and who has an interest and understanding of other people. The actual guidance and mentoring support offered at universities tends to be an afterthought, and only sufficient at a bare minimum.",

I have colleagues who have been teaching faculty for 20+ years, and they're out of date, don't know what's happening in their field, and they don't know much beyond the textbook or teaching materials that they've been using for a long time. In some fields this is ok, but in most, things change frequently.\n\nI'm not suggesting someone has to have a robust research agenda. I simply mean that they should be actively engaged in a network that gives them access to what's happening in their field, and to write an occasional paper. That way they're still a contributor over time, and they know what's going on in their area. \n\nFor example - I recently had to correct a history faculty member who has been at my institution for 30 years. He was teaching something very old and out of date. He said that the oldest continually inhabited city was Athens. I gave him a list of cities off the top of my head that had been continually inhabited longer than Athens. I'm not a history professor either. This is what happens when people don't pay attention to new developments and disengage and stay in their classrooms.",

      "text": "I disagree with the idea that universities hire tenure track faculty for their research, at least not in the way people often mean. It is true that people are not hired for teaching, and usually their teaching abilities are barely considered by the hiring committee. However, people's research abilities are also not considered and neither is the quality of their research and their true research productivity. What is considered primarily are people's likely ability to bring in third party funding and their ability to generate large research stats and especially prestige stats. People need a large list of publications, especially in high impact factor journals, but it does not matter if any of these publications actually contain real research.",

      "text": "Your argument is one bought into by just about every US university. [73% of faculty are non-tenure-track](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/12/about-three-quarters-all-faculty-positions-are-tenure-track-according-new-aaup), meaning they focus exclusively on teaching. I couldn't find numbers indicating how many of that remaining 26% are mainly focused on research rather than teaching, but it's a small percentage. \n\nSo congratulations: higher-ed in the US at least agrees with you.\n\nETA: the rampant downvotes are fascinating: is it the factual nature of this that people disagree with, or that I've dared to point it out?",
