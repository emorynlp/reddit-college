  "title:": "Q about personal websites",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've created a personal website for myself, just out of curiosity. I used Hugo, Netlify, and Git + Blogdown. \n\nI was wondering what kind of things do people like to see in a personal website? So far, I have added links to published+working papers and conference presentations, plus some essays and press coverage. \n\nShould there be other things that I *should* include? How formal/informal is okay? \n\nTo reiterate, it's made out of curiosity. I'm really not sure how I'd be leveraging it at all (tips appreciated), but I'm assuming that other academics + maybe others interested in my work may check it out.",

I guess you could have a news / blog page but honestly it's a lot of work to keep on top of. If you are a particularly good speaker videos of your presentations can be good to. \n\nYour website is a secondary source that people go to after they are interested in you to find out more. Usually you drive them there from social media.",

      "text": "If you are a PhD candidate entering the job market, being more formal is better. If you are a tenured professor, you can have a blog, photos of your pets, a link to your novel written as a hobby, etc. It is your freedom to do whatever you want, but if I was personally advising my PhD student, I would recommend this to reduce the chances of rubbing the people the wrong way on the job market (there are many \"old-fashioned\" academics in the field higher up in the Department hierarchy).\n\nWhat you have done sounds great (e.g., published and working papers, conference presentations, etc.). Make sure to also add a dated CV on the website, so search committees can routinely check your website for updates.",

      "text": "This is just my opinion, but when I am going through a prof's website I'm always interested to see a few things apart from the ones I expect (CV, publications, research interests, teaching material). Often, at least for students, papers are largely inaccessible and don't provide a glimpse at how the professor thinks. I try to see if there's maybe an article that's about something general/out of their academic area, or their favourite music/films/interests. Just something that helps me learn a little bit about them or about how they think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as I said this is just my preference and it's certainly not required off of a personal webpage. As someone else mentioned, it might be frowned upon to have a slightly informal website as a young researcher/academic.",
