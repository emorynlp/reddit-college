  "text": "I did a 1-year Master's and really enjoyed it. I worked long hours, but getting to choose what to study and what to do research on was really fun. I especially enjoyed getting to do independent research with original data. It was especially a joy after having spent 10 years in the workforce, and feeling really ground down by the lack of intellectualism, the lack of rigour of thought and just plain repetitiveness that seems so common in office culture.\n\nBut I suspect a PhD would feel different than a Master's, I'm just not sure exactly how. Can you give me any insight into how I would know whether I'd enjoy the PhD experience?",

      "text": "If you liked the independent research aspect, then you might enjoy a PHD. The people in my program who left early often did well in the classes at the beginning of the program, but had no idea how to work independently on research projects. \n\nThe main consideration when starting a PHD is what next? For a PHD in Biomedical Science, I think less than 15% of graduates remain in academic research. What type of job do you want? Will having a PHD open up mobility in that job? It's very field specific.",

However, I read that if you can get into a business PhD program in something like Organizational Behavior it would be much better. So I guess maybe I would try and reorient toward something like that? Previously I've studied more Political Science and Public Policy though.",

There are only so many permanent academic jobs.\n\nLets imagine that there are 100 permanent academic jobs. Each permanent academic, over thier lifetime will have between 1 and 4 PhD students every year, lets say it takes 4 years to finish a PhD (ok for the UK), so thats a PhD completion rate of between 0.25 and 1 a year. \n\nLets say the average academic is in post from 35 - 60 (many stay n into their late 60s or 70s or may start from even earlier), thats 25 years thats between 6 and 25 PhD students from that academic over their career.  When they retire thats 1 job back into the pool. Each year we might expect 3-4 of the 100 PIs to retire, thats 3-4 positions for this potential 25 - 100 PhD graduates. \n\nIn reality those numbers aren't quite right, and some estimates are that only around 12%^1 to 3.5%^2 of students will end up in permenant positions (~88% do other brilliant things). But it still takes many, many years to get to a permenant position. Years of struggle to get to the top isn't something to be surprised at, but years of being the world's expert on a topic before your first permenant job is not healthy for you as a person. \n\nThis isn't a STEM issue. And it's even worse when you think about the ratios for undergraduates or Master's students where the chances of success are fractional. Again, PhD students, by getting to where they are have already demonstrated themselves to be among the most suited to academia our of a pool of people who have chosen to spend 3-4 years of their life studying a topic. Successful PhD students are amoung the 1% of most educated (not neccessarily the smartest 1% though!) people on the planet, yet they are still years and years from their first permenant positions.  \n\nedited for sense\n\n^1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25642132/\n\n^2 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06873-5",

Here is one article comparing relative ranks of placements in business and computer science (both very in-demand) with history (very not): https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005.full. That's among people who go into academia, not what share go on to academia, but still informative.\n\nLook at your potential schools' placement records. Then bear in mind that probably 1-2 people a year aren't listed because they haven't found a job yet at the time the site was put online - maybe even up to 5-6 depending on if the school cheats by \"hiding\" bad placements (e.g. obscuring that a position is a post-doc or lecturer position). Then count how many got academic jobs at an institution you'd be happy with - maybe you'd be happy only in a certain country or major city, maybe you'd truly be happy anywhere. While some people go into the PhD thinking they want to do the private sector afterwards, *very few do* (else they could get farther ahead by working - the PhD effectively lowers their salary, compared to a master's or MBA, especially in business). So you have to assume that *most*, but not all, of the people with private sector jobs didn't want that.\n\nI agree that the average in business will get a job that pays upwards of 100k in academia. But, you should think hard about the 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and not assume you'll be in the upper half, because everyone else who is coming in will have the same background and track record of always doing well. Basically, if 50% get a well-paying, desirable tenure-track job and 50% don't, I'd be worried, even if that is much better than other fields.",

That is the source that does worldwide surveys of business PhDs, and upon which people in this sub seem to base the assertion that the average business PhD will receive a tenure track job upon graduating that pays upwards of 100K. This is compared to Anthropology, where most will not find a tenured track position at all, and the lucky ones will find an adjunct position for 60 or 70K.

While I'm naturally biased as well, I can confidently say that no one that I've discussed the job market with has disagreed over the basic situation.\n\nIt is also supported by common sense as /u/drinkermoth explained. A vast number of new PhDs graduate every year, whereas only a few professors retire or leave academia. For every new PhD to get a tenure track position, the size and funding of business schools would need to grow at a massive pace. In practice, most PhD's don't even try to get academic positions and most of those who do need to be willing to travel globally for short (often low-paying) postdoc positions while applying for professorships. This requires a lot of personal sacrifice and flexibility, and still, the results are not guaranteed.\n\nAcademy of Management recently posted stats from their job board that showed how the ratio of applicants to open positions had increased drastically. While not the whole truth, it indicated increasing competition in the field. I tried to google the stats that I saw, but couldn\u2019t find them at a first try.",

A+ publications were before something that a professor would maybe land once in their career, if lucky.

It's really a crazy world, and many brilliant people spend many years trying, burn themselves out, and still don't succeed. \n\nThe number of new PhDs is increasing, also in business fields.

However, the folks over on the UX Research sub are also very negative regarding current job prospects in the field for newcomers.

                      "text": "If pay is an important consideration for you, I\u2019d recommend considering the business PhD instead of the social sciences. At my university (R1, urban, but lower-tier public), the salaries in the business school are MUCH higher than those in the social sciences. Social scientists here are mostly in the 60K-80K range (a few full professors make more, but not too many - the major exception is economics), while B-school (and econ) assistant profs routinely start at over 100K. This makes sense from a market perspective, since these fields are also in demand in the private sector. All that said, our pay is on the low end for our peer institutions in the US.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to how difficult it is to get TT professor jobs in all fields, but I can say that in my own field the supply of new PhDs now greatly exceeds the demand. None of my former PhD students have TT jobs. I would recommend that you do your research on the fields that interest you, but you also have to take into account that higher education has been in crisis for some time. (My own university isn\u2019t hiring at all this year, and even before the pandemic, there were only a few lucky departments getting to conduct searches for assistant professor positions. It has been this way for at least five years, and probably more.)\n\nAs for the experience of PhD vs masters, there are some great comments elsewhere, but I\u2019ll add a couple of thoughts based on my own experience and my experience as an advisor. For many students, doing a PhD can feel like running a marathon, but late at night on an unmarked and unlit track, with no one else around except the occasional competitor. It\u2019s a long and often lonely haul, and the challenge of figuring out what your research is all about can be draining. If you run up against the pettiness and narcissism that are so common in academia, it can be even worse. But as with all things, your mileage may vary. If you have a supportive advisor and a collegial cohort of fellow grad students, you can have a great experience.\n\nFinally, as for being a TT professor, it\u2019s very, very different from being a student. Many professors love their jobs, to be sure, but many of us feel disillusioned. It\u2019s a career that is easy to romanticize. I\u2019d recommend talking to as many academics as you can to get a sense of what the job is all about. And as others have said, have alternative plans at the ready.",

                              "text": ">I worked long hours, but getting to choose what to study and what to do research on was really fun. I especially enjoyed getting to do independent research with original data. It was especially a joy after having spent 10 years in the workforce, and feeling really ground down by the lack of intellectualism, the lack of rigour of thought and just plain repetitiveness that seems so common in office culture\n\nThat's a good question, and it's a tough one to answer easily. I think it's a combination of many things.\n\nFirst, I know that many professors are fortunate enough to remain excited about their research topics after several years of working on them. But many of us are not. There are a lot of associate professors (this is my rank) who find themselves burned out and floundering. What seemed exciting in graduate school may no longer seem worth the trouble.\n\nSecond, even if you have a TT job at an R1 institution, it's very difficult to find the time to work on your research anyway. When I was working on my dissertation, I was fortunate enough to have a fellowship that just let me work full time on my research. I see now what a luxury that was. Now, we have to squeeze that in, in between all of the other responsibilities that take so much time: grading, reviewing papers, serving on committees, filling out endless paperwork, etc. Again, some of these things felt exciting at first, but after 10 years, they lose their luster. \n\n(You mentioned the \"plain repetitiveness\" in office culture. Well, that also applies to teaching the same course 20 times. Yes, you can and must modify your courses to keep them fresh, but every time you make a major change to your course, you're making a major investment of time - and that's inevitably going to cut into your time for research. You simply can't reinvent the wheel and come up with entirely new assignments every time you teach your course.)\n\nIt's also frustrating (and this may be an R1 problem) to care about teaching, and to strive to do it well, but to find that so many of your peers do not. At many R1s, teaching plays absolutely no role in promotion decisions, for example. It's deeply frustrating to see people who are known to be terrible, uncaring teachers get promoted.\n\nIt's true that some professors are fortunate enough to find the kind of intellectual community that I fantasized about (my father was one of them), but for me, that just hasn't been the case. There's not a lot of intellectual community in my own department, and my efforts to find it elsewhere on campus have never led anywhere. \n\nWhen I was a graduate student, I was excited about guest lectures and conference papers. At this point, I've decided that most academics simply aren't very good at presenting their research.\n\nAnd then there are the other well-known foibles of academic life. Not all professors are arrogant narcissists with no social skills, but there are enough of them around to make life hell sometimes. You see all kinds of petty behaviors that I'm sure are just as common in the world of industry. I could get into the frustrations of dealing with university bureaucracies too, but that would get tedious fast...\n\nFinally, there's the fact that the higher education landscape is changing so much and so rapidly. We've been the target of budget cuts and political attacks, and this can be extremely demoralizing. There have been a few years in which you could practically smell the collective unhappiness on campus.\n\nAgain, I know I'm lucky to have my position, and the job has given me some opportunities I've been grateful for. I'm certainly not utterly miserable or anything like that (although I did seriously consider leaving the profession shortly after receiving tenure, and I am still planning on an early retirement if possible). And I do like the slower pace and freedom of the summers, even if it's never actually \"time off.\"\n\nBut the bottom line is that the life of many (maybe even most?) professors seldom takes the form of a joyful \"life of the mind\" or an exciting intellectual adventure. A lot of it is a grind, just like any other job.\n\nYou might want to read some of the articles that have come out about associate professors - in general, I strongly encourage you to read the Chronicle and Inside Higher Ed. Here are a couple of interesting ones about unhappy associate profs: [https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-associate-professors-so-unhappy/](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-associate-professors-so-unhappy/) (it has a paywall, unfortunately) and [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/04/associate-professors-less-satisfied-those-other-ranks-survey-finds](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/04/associate-professors-less-satisfied-those-other-ranks-survey-finds).",

      "text": "It's hard to say given the information you've provided, and it's important to understand how different one's mileage will vary on these things. One general key distinction to keep in mind is that Masters students generally pay their way through the coursework. As such, your responsibilities are basically limited to being an active, engaged student in seminar.\n\nConversely, PhD students are generally paid positions of employment. You might be required to teach an undergraduate course, to clean data for your advisor, etc. Your work assignment will likely be tied to your research interests in some way, but \"getting to choose what to study\" rarely comes into the picture here, and certainly not all of it is \"really fun.\" Doctoral students are still, of course, students -- but they're also assigned a job as a consequence of being paid to be there.\n\nNow, speaking to more personal experience here, I will say that my PhD program is simply far more rigorous and demanding than my Masters program; simply put, the originality of work is incredibly important. As a Masters student, I was afforded the luxury to pursue, for the lack of another way of putting it, \"vanity\" projects. I spent each of my seminars researching certain things simply for my personal enjoyment. As a PhD student, I'm still pursuing work I find compelling, but I am also expected to justify the work I am doing and to explain how my work contributes to the literature. Pretty much everything I do is still driven by my personal interests, but I have to regularly explain how the work I am doing _is significant._\n\nThere are just certain political, technical, and interpersonal realities I deal with as a PhD student that I did not as a Masters student. To put it bluntly: as a Masters student, I did a lot of the work I did simply for personal fulfillment; as a PhD student, I do a lot of the work I do in response to what others are doing (or not doing).\n\nOne last thing, and it's really a small thing, but as a Masters student I still looked at seminars as if they were undergraduate classes. I did things for the grade, and I completed my degree in the pursuit of a job. To some extent my PhD is still a marker of employment status, but my primary motivation for pursuing a PhD is to perform research. None of the grades really matter, and pretty much all the work I do in my courses either feeds into some kind of publishable project or ties into my dissertation. Generally, the most successful PhD students have a pretty clear idea of why they're applying to a program and have some inkling of an idea of what they want their dissertation to be.\n\nEven if that's not what your dissertation actually ends up becoming, there's a much bigger emphasis on big-picture thinking at the PhD level that is rarely expected of Masters students, and that is one of the integral qualities that separates good PhD students from good Masters students.",

              "text": "No problem! I have a very strange path, indeed. I was a professional actor for a number of years. Then, after discovering an interest in medicine (specifically, how arts and humanities can be used in medical contexts), I entered a master's degree in medical humanities and bioethics. After graduating from the one year master's program, I worked as a medical secretary for two years. While working as a secretary, I applied to PhD programs in a variety of disciplines, because no doctoral programs existed in medical humanities. I was accepted to several programs, none of which I had studied before, including medical anthropology and communication studies. I eventually went with the communication studies program because its emphasis was in health communication. During my master's program, I fell in love with end-of-life communication, so I figured this would be a great place to study my new passion and learn how to create research that could make an impact on the way we communicate about death in healthcare settings. As for publishing quickly, I was extremely energized and lucky. Because I was so happy to be there, I had an absurd amount of stamina, and conducted entire studies for my classes that were nearly ready for journals. The first thing I ever submitted to a journal, the flagship journal in my discipline (highest impact factor), was accepted with minor revisions. I was gobsmacked. A month later, another study I did in a class was accepted into the other flagship journal in my discipline. I am lucky, because my research is in a topic that is easy to justify the value of it. I am currently finishing my dissertation and applying for academic positions. I am humbled that people like my work at this stage of my career, and I completely attribute my success in the program to the fact that I came in hungry to learn. It sounds like you are also in a great state of mind to do something similar! Most importantly, the real reason that I was able to publish so much, is that I found a great friend and co-author. Two years ago, I had never even heard the term p-value, and now all of my publications are quanitative lol. That could have never happened without my good friend and co-author. Find someone else who is hungry and willing to work hard and do not miss opportunities to collaborate!  Sorry for the novel! I hope this is helpful. :)",

I think had I had a different advisor from the start, it would have been much different, though... so just choose your path carefully and wisely.",

We're all well-educated, but not in a field highly in demand (pretty much mostly just tech these days from what I can tell), have difficulty getting promoted or making enough money to feel secure, start a family, etc. Really, this isn't only an academia struggle...",

My committee chair and advisor who I started studying under suddenly retired one year in, and I didn\u2019t get along with my new chair (who thankfully also left, and now I\u2019m with someone I really like). Funding can change for grants thus affecting your pay, which is never great to start with, depending on your financial situation. I wouldn\u2019t recommend a part-time program...I enjoyed the program the most when I was full-time, for sure. And I\u2019ll echo what others have said about self-motivation...That\u2019s been the toughest part, as I reach the end. I\u2019m pretty much on my own, and being a perfectionist, I\u2019ll constantly want to rework things or think \u201cI need to work on this section more,\u201d thus pushing the timeline back. \n\nDespite all this, I have enjoyed the program....and can not wait to finish. I never wanted to go into academia....and don\u2019t plan to. I\u2019m in the education field and knew I wanted to work at the state level with policy makers, and a PhD will really open the doors for me. That\u2019s what started the whole process! Looking back, an EdD would\u2019ve probably sufficed, but I\u2019m happy I\u2019ll stand out amongst others. \n\nGood luck to you, whatever you decide!",

      "text": "A master's degree is dating, and a Ph.D. is comparable to marriage.  It can be far better and reshape your life.  But if it goes wrong, you will find new enemies, some financial problems, and will have to deal with regret.  At the same time, you may benefit from a partial experience.\n\nThere are rigorous firms and workplaces with a research bent.  Consulting is interesting because you find out just how much your thinking is worth on the open market.  However, do not expect academic institutions to be on the cutting edge of knowledge.  When they are, it is great.  Many institutions are treading water and maintaining paradigms.\n\nIn some fields (psychology), it isn't easy to be a practitioner without a Ph.D.\n\nAcademic institutions have their own corporate culture and views of what is acceptable and unacceptable.   As someone with extensive work experience, this may not be seen as an attribute outside of a professional school.\n\nYou are probably about two job changes away from what you want to do.  A Ph.D. may not get you there.   However, active publications in professional research journals do tend to advance people. \n\nOverall this really depends on your field.  In economics, a Ph.D. matters, and in statistics, not as much.  It is hard to say",

      "text": "I'm going to deviate a little bit from what others are saying about questioning if you will need a ph.d for your career. That's definitely something to ask yourself for sure. If part of the reason you're thinking about this is you think you might want to be a professor, then you need to know the sobering truth that it was already excruciatingly difficult to get a tenure track position before COVID-19 hit -- and now it's even harder.\n\nBut, there are reasons you might want to do one -- even if its not necessary for your career. If it's not in a field like clinical psychology where it's required to practice, ask yourself this: do I enjoy this enough to make very little money for six years or so. For some people, the answer may be yes.\n\nI like the analogy another person made about a masters being like dating while a ph.d is like marriage. It's certainly more intense in that regard. What's expected of you in terms of the quality of your dissertation is more rigorous. Most institutions, you will also have a teaching or research obligation to cover your tuition and give you a (meager) salary -- unless you are independently wealthy. Teaching is usually something completely new as a doctoral student, and it's a skill that you need to hone. My responsibilities as a doctoral student were far greater than those of my friends who were a TA during their masters. \n\nI would strongly recommend ***not*** doing a ph.d program unless you are offered funding, and are offered enough that you won't accrue any debt. It's an incredibly expensive endeavor if you have to take out a loan. This usually means you'll be living very modestly, and that can be a turn off for some people. I'd also recommend against doing a ph.d while you work full-time to make ends meet. That tends to make a ph.d completely unmanageable, and ultimately not a great experience because you need to go all in for a ph.d.\n\nSo it's like this. Imagine you're not going to gain anything from your ph.d. Is the ph.d itself something you find personal value in? Do you feel like the experience itself will be something that makes you happy/will make you happy? Are you ok with being poor for almost a decade while you devote your life to academics? The answer is different for everyone. But economically, a ph.d will only have value if either a). it's necessary for a job (like a clinical psychologist) or b). you're extremely skilled at marketing yourself and can somehow position yourself as somehow being a greater candidate for a job when the market ***OVERWHELMINGLY*** would prefer that time had been spent working in industry by a long shot.\n\nIf you think you do want to do a ph.d, the next step is talking to your masters advisor and seeing what they think. Not only do you need a reference from them (and a strong one), but they will also be able to tell you if they think you have what it takes to do a ph.d. They also might help direct you to a good program or to an advisor who would be a good fit.",

I have been working for around 10 years, and my financial situation has really not improved hugely over that time. Living in a high cost of living area, it has gone something like 30k->40k->60k->55k->80k->70k\n\nAnd while I don't know if I could get into a business PhD program, the average salary for new business PhD grads in academia seems to be over 100k.\n\nI think people who have spent all their time in academia can romanticize how easy it is to get promoted outside of academia, as much as I understand that the academic job market sucks for many/most fields now.",
