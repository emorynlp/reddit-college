Once I realized that citations are selective don't have to be comprehensive for most things (other than acknowledging any really specific findings), I found that I could almost always find a solid, collegial researcher to cite instead of an asshole for the same point. I will no longer inflate the citation numbers of some of these \"important\" researchers who refuse to acknowledge up-and-coming researchers that might threaten their egos by challenging them with new ideas. I also try to cite women and people of color instead of white men like me when possible. There is nothing neutral or automatic about citation, and we make a lot of meaningful choices when we do it.",

You can also look at the editorial board; if most of the editors and AEs are from well known (maybe top 100 worldwide) universities then the journal is probably reasonable.\n\nmany predatory open access journals are literal trash but even among \"respected\" non-OA peer reviewed journals there are huge quality differences, and many journals which arent really worth publishing in (in the sense that if your research is only good enough for one of those journals, then why did you even bother doing it? Although this doesnt really apply if you are an early grad student snd still learning how to do research).\n\nno, citing bad journals doesnt make you look unprofessional, you can occasionally get good papers in bad journals. It also depends why the journals are \"bad\" -- you get predatory journals that will pubiish literally anything regardless of quality/correctness, but you also get respectable low tier journals that publish work that is mostly correct, its just boring and unimaginative. Citing from the latter is totally fine, and some \"boring\" papers will have useful content (eg technical lemmas, etc).\n\nNote: the above is only really true for \"normal\" scientific fields; things will be a lot more complicated in fields which have weird political/methodlogical schisms where you get research frameworks/themes/etc which get systematically excluded from top journals/universities and end up publishing in separate venues which get looked down on by the mainstream.",

                                      "text": "I think it's important to make a distinction between two kinds of problematic journals. \n\nFirst, you have the typically predatory journal: these are pay-to-publish and don't involve any peer review at all. You'll typically encounter them because they solicit submissions with spam email. Often easy to spot by their overly broad names, sketchy-looking website, promises of very short turn around times, claims about being indexed by in all sorts of databases, etc. They also typically won't be indexed by Web of Science (but that is not a perfect criterion: some decent journals are not indexed by WoS; this varies quite a bit by discipline). Don't publish there, don't cite work published there.\n\nSecond, you have journals that in many ways function like regular journals in that they involve peer review and there is technically a chance that submission are rejected, but which engage in problematic practices. For example, Frontiers makes it difficult for guest editors to reject submissions. MDPI solicits enormous numbers of special issues (almost 3,000 at the same time at one of their journals alone)---and we all know that rejection rates for special issues are typically low. These journals have very high acceptable rates, and frequently publishing there is increasingly recognised as problematic. I don't think it's problematic citing papers in such journals---plenty of good scholars have been lured in by these publishers---but I wouldn't publish there at this point.\n\nUltimately, you should develop a sense of what journals are reputable in your field/subfield as you progress through grad school. A good supervisor should be able to provide guidance; I also think it's really helpful to follow debates on Twitter. That's where I often learn about problematic practices at different journals/publishers.",

      "text": "Honestly, I wish there was more research available out there, like a mega-search engine of all academic work. I\u2019m tired of using a combination of Google scholar, my school\u2019s academic data base, my friend\u2019s school academic data base to find reliable literature. \n\nThis would benefit both authors and student researchers alike. \n\nFor example, I did a paper on \u201cgamer gate\u201d and ethnographic research into physical and digital spaces. The research I did yielded maybe 5-8 relevant articles/publications, even with help from two librarians at two different institutions. Only two of the articles were relatable to my research, and one of which called gamer gate a \u201cmisunderstanding of video games\u201d by unfairly stereotyping the video gaming community \u201ca boys club.\u201d (That statement aged poorly.) Literally a year later after I put the paper to rest, I found out my a media studies professor ON MY CAMPUS specializes in ethnographic research in digital spaces/video games, and did a paper on a similar topic AND a contemporary analysis of gamer gate YEARS PRIOR TO MY RESEARCH!\n\nWhat the heck! \n\nI\u2019m doing a research paper currently on a very contemporary topic in the news, and I\u2019m afraid my limited analysis of the literature in the field thus far is only due to the limitation of the search engines and phrases I use. Seriously, even with the help of multiple librarians and my academic advisor, finding GOOD, useful literature on contemporary topics in social sciences could be made easier.",

People cite stuff they know, they don't typically put a lot of efforts into finding what has been done in the field through systematic google searches. Main ways you get your first citations is: \n\n- researchers you know (ex colleagues, friends etc)\n- advertising at conferences\n- advertising on social media\n- actively try to get press coverage\n- collaborations with people who are already famous and followed by the community\n\nThen you need to snowball: having some initial recognition and citations brings more, because people copy each other, and search engines show first the most cited papers matching the search. Little by little, you need to make an impression, people need to know your name and associate it with your work. You need to be the person people think of when thinking of a topic. When you have reached that, sit back and enjoy the citations \\^_^",
