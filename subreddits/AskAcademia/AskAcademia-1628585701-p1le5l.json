  "text": "Hi academics, \n\nI am a postdoc from a reputed institution in Europe. I have a good publication record both in my Ph D and postdoc tenure. Throughout my time in academia I did everything to ensure productivity, visibility in and outside our group of work and participation in team science.  The project in postdoc involved many people and I did coordinate with everyone and bring it to completion. In my capacity I did everything I could to make sure I get to the next level in my field of work. However, although I was well liked in both labs, the persons chosen to be asst prof in both labs I felt were unfairly facilitated. I say unfair because they were trained in techniques at the expense of the lab which they had no obligation to share with labmates and then put on every project with the excuse that they knew the technique. This always was always for at least second or equal contribution first authorship. So at the same time that we slogged for they waltzed with equal or more papers giving lectures about how it is not necessary to work after 5 when you are efficient. We as labmates noticed this very well but were not in a position to do anything because it was clear they were treated special. To give an instance, my boss would \"consult\" about a Ph D students thesis end point with this fellow favored Ph D student! Most of their weekly progress meetings seemed to be such discussions which they would almost brag about in social parties later. So Ph D students started discussing their problems with this Ph D as an intermediate between the boss and themselves. I have heard so many stories of such roles played by postdocs or technicians by other students. For me the shock of how inappropriate all this was apparent but I had to stay until I got my paper out. I still have difficulty processing how can I possibly overcome this position again if I still choose for position in academia. The question here is: Is this a tactic used by profs? How do you deal or address unfair favoritism in academia? Please share your experiences or advice.",

It sounds like you got passed up for assistant professorships in favor of insiders at both of those institutions, but while it sucks that nepotism is a thing...nepotism is obviously a thing. Part of grad school comes down to leveraging your skillset into getting onto other publications, and it sounds like these particular PhD students were successful at that.",

          "text": "Dear r3,  I understand the human need that your subordinate is someone that is easy to deal with. So I understand some people being more favorites than others. However, what happened was I was told that I was in the run for title, and I finalized what was expected of me. But the word given to me was not kept and in the meantime a postdoc who joined a couple of years later than me was facilitated to achieve the same with not much extra work. This was not about luck in experiments or having extra skillset or being more talented but clearly because of being placed in a project at the very end, being sent for outside the lab training, being added in prominent position with involvement only during paper revision etc. Ofcourse this was easy to notice when I was at a stage where I needed to get my paper and move out which I did. However, I don't feel it is ethical when you actively mislead a postdoc in to thinking he has a fair chance, make him write grants which will be ideas revealed that are no longer beneficial for his career, use his expertise to finish a tricky project and then reward who you favor. Its humanly impossible not to be bitter about it. So much of academic ethics seems to be dependant on whether the prof feels accountable enough himself rather than the system holding him accountable. I spent several years producing substantial papers for this lab, hard work and dedication that would have had a better chance with a more honest supervisor. My question is how can I see this sooner and protect myself better? \n\nPart of grad school comes down to leveraging your skillset into getting onto other publications\". Agreed. But in my lab all that I provided would have been extreme leverage if I was more favoured. My profs comments for me: You are made for science, very  dedicated, hardworking scientist with truly original ideas. Could do a better job in organization. In action: cannot give title due to financial situation in dept, was not favoured in any sense or facilitated except giving a employer recommendation. \n\nMy papers helped in securing another position but my trust in the process took a severe beating. In short, I don't want to work or facilitate a person who operates with less internal ethics. Not all ethics is covered by law but humans are innately tuned to know if what they did was fair or not. My question here is: how do I deal with the mistrust I have accumulated in this experience?",

      "text": "It's impossible to comment on your situation as an outsider but a few observations about these types of situations. \n\nSometimes PIs (and any manager) have favourites. It's unfortunate and unfair but if that's the situation then frankly you're better off leaving and getting out of a situation where you'll always feel frustrated and be losing out. \n\nThat said, people often expect their managers to know everything they've been doing and everything they want and that if they have to tell their manager this then they're some how aren't appreciated. As a manager it's very difficult to keep keep projects on track, deal with the daily minor crises, the occasional major crises and get your own work done. If your line report isn't telling you what they're proud they achieved, or what they need, or what their ambitions are then it's very difficult to make decisions. Your PI should set aside time to have these exact conversations but if they don't then you need to do it. \n\nAlongside not communicating with their managers people's behaviour often sends out a different message from what they intend. Working hard on a project often suggests that individual loves the project and loves that role and can signal they don't want to change. In addition, you mention raising the visibility outside the team, are you sure that wasn't interpreted as you're interested in making your next move outside the team?\n\nLastly, people often focus on doing lots of activities that are beneficial to the team but those activities don't necessarily get you noticed. And more than that they often aren't activities that signal you have the right skills for the next role up. I'm not saying you should be totally self-centred and never do anything altruistic, but you do need to actively manage your career and all too often people kill themselves helping everyone else out, never say a word to their bosses about their ambitions, expect that their boss will see their efforts and promote them and then feel resentful when the person who was actively managing their career gets promoted over them. \n\nAs a woman, I've faced a career of discrimination in the work place and I've felt constantly on catch up with men who have been promoted on less effort. I've had to produce exemplary results to demonstrate my value but I've also had to fight for everything and be prepared to be sharp elbowed about ensuring I get a fair reward.",

          "text": "Thankyou for pointing out things that I might have missed thinking about. I have actively had conversations about what I want from my career. It is true that my passion in science is very evident and sort of misread as being a reward in itself. I love science does not mean I will do it for cheaper than others. Fairness is pretty darn important to me. As far as outside the team is concerned, it wasn't holding an active interest in other jobs but being vocal (not controversial), present in departmental organizational activities and in departmental meetings, presentations. Frankly, I don't care where the right opportunity comes from, within or outside the team but I would think the right supervisor should facilitate either within his own team or outside if I am not a personal favorite. I felt when I did get a untenured asst prof position my prof felt more worried that this might benefit my new boss than truly facilitate me for it. I also know what you mean by the over-kill help. I did feel it was important to support build a team that is helpful and nonjudgmental to team members. I consciously worked in being part of this with the focus that my publications move forward. \n\nThe last paragraph you write: Well, this is me as well. How did you make sure you climbed the ladder?",

Luck is that I now have an amazing manager who cares about equality and spends time thinking about her team, making sure things are fair and she asks and listens to me. That said I started at my current organisation in the same month as two men. Same grade, same team, different roles. Both have been consistently promoted more quickly than me, despite me objectively out-performing them and most recently having significantly more responsibility. I'm back at being the same grade as them having recently been promoted (yay my manager) but they will be up for promotion sooner than me and of course the lifetime cumulative effect on earnings and their career progression can't be undone. I've just had to stick to my guns about stuff, had to get HR involved occasionally and learnt how to navigate a system that wants to be fair but cannot see problems under its nose.",

This is just one example....sometimes the discussion is about personality of other lab members or making fun of some lab members which the PI has with this student which is pure gossip. What happens then is the favorite Ph D almost brags about this in social lab events and other PhDs started counseling their issues project and otherwise with her using her as the intermediate to boss. They would do this and come out and speak rumors of this favorite Ph D having a more than supervisor-student relationship (I know this one can come from just rumors or human jealousy) but it was weird to see the lab function this way. Still not weird? I did not want to write such detail but I hope you understand that I write this just to get an idea if I am bonkers thinking this is weird!
