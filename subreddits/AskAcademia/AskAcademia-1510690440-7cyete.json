  "title:": "Update: Fly me cross country for a 1-hour interview?",
  "text": "Hi all ... Seven months ago, I posted this ...\n--\n\"I applied for a full-time \"Professor of Practice\" (non tenure track) job at an Ivy ... They offered to fly me out for an interview ... Department Chair says they want me to give a 30 minute presentation to faculty and take questions from faculty for 30 minutes ... To clarify, I asked if there would be anything else for me to do - meet individually with faculty, talk to students, etc ... Nope, she said, just the one-hour interview ... Question: Is this normal? ... I have a sneaking suspicion that I am being flown out so they can say they interviewed X number of candidates ... But I'm new to this game, so ... Thanks for feedback ...\"\n\n---\nSeveral commentators said 1) Yes, this is weird and 2) I should go anyway, and try to talk with faculty members once there.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\nThe interview was on a Friday, at noon. I arrived early. First, I tried to talk with the department chair. She wasn't available. Then I walked around looking for open office doors. It was a Friday, so ... not many faculty around.\n\nI went to the room where I would give my presentation and started setting up. As faculty trickled in, I spoke to several of them. They were friendly but it's hard to have a good discussion in that environment. My plan: Talk to them more after my presentation.\n\nEventually, about 75 percent of the faculty showed up. The department chair arrived two minutes before the presentation was supposed to start. This was the first time I had spoken with her - our prior communications were through email. We shook hands. I gave my presentation. It went well, I thought. Had a robust back-and-forth with faculty members. They seemed interested.\n\nOn the hour, my presentation ended. I picked up my computer and expected to walk out with everyone else. But the department chair instead shook my hand and said the faculty would now conduct a meeting. She thanked me for coming. I waited outside the room for 20 minutes or so waiting for everyone to come out. \n\nAt that point, I was pretty frustrated, so I just left.\n\nA month passed. I got an offer for a TT position at an M1 college. I contacted the department chair at the Ivy for a chance at a counter. She thanked me but said they had chosen someone else.\n\nI took the TT position. A few weeks later, the Ivy announced that they had promoted a lecturer already teaching at their school into the position that I had interviewed for.\n\nWhat to make of all this? My guess is that they already wanted to promote the in-house candidate but had to interview a certain number of people. I also probably could have done more while there to improve my chances, instead of losing patience and leaving. I'm not bitter (I don't think!) and I'm happy with my new job but it all just seems ... strange.\n\nAnyway, that's the update, for anyone who cares ...",

In these kind of circumstances that external candidate can kind of get caught in the middle through no fault of their own.\n\nHappened with a friend of mine recently, except the Depts first candidate then turned them down forcing them to go back to my friend  ",

I've always gotten a phone call in those situations.\n\n(Spent a good 3 years on the TT search....so I've got too many experiences to draw from. UGH)",

There's a lot of room between \"the fix is in\" and \"everybody comes into the interview as equals\", and that room is where most jobs lie.

They take themselves very seriously, and often take others not seriously at all, esp. with regards to job searches. (This, obviously, can vary by school and department, but what you've described seems entirely feasible in several places I've seen up close.) Don't expect that they would be even more friendly if you had become a colleague, esp. a non-TT one. You dodged a bullet. Be grateful and inoculated against the belief that \"things are better at the top\" \u2014 they have more money and resources, but with it comes more pressure, animosity, pettiness, narcissism, etc., in my experience.",
