  "title:": "Are Coursera and edX certificates worth paying for?",
  "text": "I have a Master's degree in Criminal Justice and am pursuing a second in Psychology, with the eventual intent of getting a Ph.D. in CJ. That said, in my spare time, I like to audit Coursera and edX classes to learn for learning's sake (it's fun). I usually take courses unrelated to my major, such as in medieval studies or writing. I noticed today that certificates for the classes are only $49 in some cases, or similar.\n\nI know MOOCs aren't as \"prestigious\" as, say, a university, but I find no discernible difference in the quality of instruction and materials than in my brick and mortar and online graduate-level courses. In some cases, the instruction is better.\n\nDo you think getting these certificates would be worthwhile? If I got some, would they be worth putting on a CV? I'm sure they wouldn't, but if I could just keep taking classes in anything forever, I would. I find structured learning a lot more enjoyable than reading on my own.\n\nThank you!\n\nUpdate: also, is there any value in taking the courses they offer related to data science, R, and Python if you intend to be a researcher?",

      "text": "Depends entirely on what you intend to do with them. I know many small schools in developing countries that allow students to take those classes and apply the certificates towards progress in their degrees (quite a cost-effective solution for the schools if you think about it). On the flip side, I know some professionals that get the certificates in the hope of changing careers, with the certificates acting as a gatekeeper to jobs in startups, for example.\n\nI'd say that once you have a PhD however, virtually nobody cares what classes you took (and you should be careful about those that do). A PhD implies that you are trained to be an independent scholar and, within reason, you can teach yourself anything that you need to learn. You don't need a certificate to prove that, your PhD does it. And you should not be listing coursework on a CV, in general.\n\nAs an aside, when I was a grad student, $49 to me was actually \"lunch and probably dinner for a whole week!\" lol. Naturally your circumstances might be different, but if you're going to be the typical graduate student, you'll probably want to save every dollar.\n\nEdit: In reply to your edit, depends again if you plan to use those tools for research. I know people in the social sciences that have found Python and R useful, but it was a niche research area.",

If you are currently a university student (post-grad), you may want to check out if your institution has sponsored Coursera courses (meaning you can take unlimited courses for free, with certificates after completion of the MOOC courses). Just sign in with your institution email and check. \nEdx courses are usually pretty pricey, so I\u2019ve only audited them. I guess what\u2019s more important is the learning experience, and whether you can apply these concepts to your future works. I feel that building your personal projects would be a better testament of your abilities than just certificates.\nIf you feel that getting a certificate can beef up your portfolio, and is useful/relevant for your future career, then perhaps you should!\nCheers!",

This is because **there is no nationally recognized, outside governing body that defines, oversees, and periodically reviews** the qualifications of the instructors/students, the content covered, the standards of instruction, the evaluative procedures, the outcomes of such programs, etc. \n\nThe second reason they have no value is because **you essentially get a certificate as long as you pay for it.** (That's also why for-profit \"universities\" are predatory and remain unaccredited.) This is why universities don't generally accept them through credit transfers. But these sites state upfront that their courses don't qualify.\n\nBut, regarding your specific update, since programming is a specific skill set meant to ***complement*** your formal studies in criminal justice, then yes, listing it under \"applicable skills\" or \"professional development\" is fine. In that case, I agree with /u/myristicae\n\nTaking these courses to show your investment in a very clear-cut, limited **skill** (i.e. a specific  programming language like Python) is very different than asking if these courses demonstrate or prove facility within a larger and complex discipline (i.e. Physics, Philosophy, Anthropology, Computer Science, literally any research field).\n\nOn the surface, the distinction between online and in-person education seems like it's about prestige, but it's actually about having secure internal and external mechanisms that regulate and maintain specific standards for each discipline. This ensures that our research is actually rigorous enough to produce new knowledge. (But having standards doesn't excuse all the elitism built into academia.) I also think it's easier to understand this distinction if you've had experienced teaching in both contexts. It's seriously night and day.\n\nOutside of academia, listing a few relevant courses on a resume may demonstrate diligence, curiosity, etc.\n\nHope this helps!",
