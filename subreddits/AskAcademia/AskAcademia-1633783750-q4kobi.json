  "text": "I\u2019m a TT prof at an R1 and have a PhD student who is interested in pursuing academia. They have all the right motivation and technical ability but they are just, forgive my frankness, a God awful writer.\n\nI feel I\u2019m letting this student down because I really don\u2019t know how to teach writing to non-native speakers. Every year in my lab I give a couple presentations on scientific writing. And I work with this student week after week on their writing during our weekly meetings but nothing seems to move the needle.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for any tips or advice that could be helpful. I have plenty of funds to send the student to workshops or seminars or whatever will work.\n\nAnyone have success stories to share with similar experiences?",

      "text": "Most universities have workshops that help students with academic writing. These are geared towards grad students who work on writing their papers/ thesis under professional guidance. Since you are in an R1, your university probably has a few of these programs. You can ask your student to look for these programs and join them. I did this when I was a grad student and now I ask my students to do it too.",

      "text": "One technique that has proven somewhat useful is to assign them reading (I usually tell them them to initially read 100 journal articles in earnest). When they begin scientific writing, if they are not a native English speaker, I tell them NOT to write using their own style/voice.  Rather, to imitate other successful authors\u2019 styles.  Once they have published 3 journal papers, I think it is ok to use their own voice.\n\nThe success of the student and their development is highly dependent on their dedication, English proficiency, and overall intellect. Results vary wildly.",

      "text": "I used to be an academic writing tutor and in my experience, most of my ESL students really struggled with definite and indefinite articles (the, a, an) and prepositions (as, at, by, etc). I found showing School House Rock videos and doing some very basic worksheets intended for grade school helped more than any college level type stuff - when students are struggling with basic concepts, you have to meet them where they are at, regardless of how silly it seems. The children\u2019s activities were a fun way to introduce and practice concepts, and the School House Rock songs are really catchy. \n\nAlso, the students will absolutely hate it, but, having them read their essays out loud to you will increase their skills tenfold, regardless of their ESL status. It just seriously improves all types of writing for all individuals, because it forces you to read what you actually wrote, not let your brain correct it to what you meant to write. I used to tell my students on day 1 of tutoring, we will be reading all assignments out loud every day, and they literally all fought me on it, but I didn\u2019t make it optional - it\u2019s really important and without that skill, their writing won\u2019t improve. Every single student over the years thanked me for that eventually and told me how much it helped.",
