  "text": "I just published my first major manuscript, a chapter for my PhD dissertation. I\u2019m obviously relieved it\u2019s published and \u201coff my to do list\u201d, so to speak. But I\u2019m already moving onto the next item on the list. There\u2019s a lot of hard work, wait time, and failures to get to a win in academia\u2026 (and life!), so I want to know- how do you all celebrate your wins?\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you all for such supportive suggestions and responses! I\u2019m glad to hear so many of you *do* actually take the time to celebrate your wins and successes and I\u2019ve loved reading through your responses! Thank you all for the suggestions. I hope this helped others realize they can and should celebrate their wins too :)",

If a university pays out regardless of where the article ends up, yeah, that's obviously asking for trouble. But any university that seeks quantity without quality control probably want too legitimate to start with.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that the university doesn't play any role in getting us published. If I can get 10 articles into the Lancet or Nature, that's all on me and the journals' reviews.\n\nAs for salami slicing, I've seen plenty of Q1 and Q2 journals put out calls for very specific topics for issues. If I have a 30p paper with a very solid segment that addresses the topic and I can adapt it into one or even five tight research articles that address needs, what's wrong with that?\n\nYes, if a lot of other checks and failsafes aren't enacted, paying for content without parameters of quality is troubling, but that doesn't take a PhD. I mean duh, of course we need checks and rules in place to guide the process. What sector doesn't?",

              "text": "As a PhD student, I think the \"it's your job\" attitude is even more important to us than it is to tenured professors:\n\nWe actually have the time to turn every paper into an existential struggle if we want to, whereas full professors tend to juggle several writing projects, various admin issues, their teaching load and their family life simultaneously. They fit in an hour or two of writing where they can, but the sort of monomaniacal focus that requires celebration to decompress is simply not an option for them.\n\nI've written three papers so far and with each one I \"celebrated\" by taking a week off after submission, just to restore some sanity and order to my life - cleaning my apartment, regular meals, walks in nature, amends to my girlfriend, ... That's not healthy. Writing papers is my job, it should be a sustainable activity. Write, submit, move on to the next thing.\n\nBut it's hard to keep that in mind. I just started the writing phase on something new yesterday, and I'm so itching to go to the office and continue, even though I know that it's not good for me to work weekends, even though I promised my girlfriend I'd bake a cake, even though we wanted to go for a walk in the afternoon and then watch a movie or something.\n\nImho \"it's your daily job\" (actually a part-time job, I only get paid to work 26 hours a week) is not so much \"negative miserable energy and pessimism\" as it is a way to protect yourself.",

                  "text": "The main difference between the professor and the student is that the professor went through the PhD, postdoc, and already started their career. With the post OP being a stem PhD that first paper took at least 1-2 years of collecting data and countless failed experiments and weekends in the lab because of 10-day experiments or even 24-hour experiments. I\u2019m honestly getting the vibe that you and the person I originally replied to both aren\u2019t stem students- if it\u2019s a writing day/literature dive on pubmed or jstor type of day you typically just stay at home for that or go to the library. Also my PI and other PIs always celebrate student paper publications in the lab by going out, buying everyone a beer or orders food for everyone. There\u2019s two different attitudes in life towards jobs- you can celebrate the small milestones in life and enjoy the little things or you can just treat it as another job (typically the people who aren\u2019t passionate about their field) and be as happy with your life as someone working a depressing cubicle job",

Years, failures, and 24-hour long experiments (but that part was for a different project), and of course loooong fieldwork weeks to get the samples in the first place. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I think *finally* having this bigger part of my PhD out there is really motivating me to get the other parts done (which is why I want to pause to celebrate first before diving into my other projects and getting burnt out *again*!)",
