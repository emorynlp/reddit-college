  "text": "I\u2019ve been contemplating of finally applying to PhD programs next cycle. I\u2019m currently 27 and finished masters at 25. A lot of PhD candidates I know - in Australia, specifically - are 24-25 when they started the program. \n\nI\u2019m worried that I\u2019m too late or behind in the program. Particularly looking at programs in the US/UK. Am I too old for the program? Whats the average age in your cohort?",

I was worried about my age going in, and many people reassured me beforehand that it wouldn\u2019t matter. However, I found that it really did matter. I had been working in academia for a while before applying, and had a specific project I wanted to work on. I\u2019d also held jobs in other industries, and I took a pay cut to be there. A lot of my peers were right out of undergrad, or had been working in low-wage jobs beforehand, and didn\u2019t have a specific project in mind. I felt really \u201cold\u201d and isolated. I recently dropped out\u2014I just felt really undervalued and isolated. At the end of the day, unless you\u2019re independent wealthy, no matter what kind of experience you have you\u2019ll be making the same as the person who just walked in out of undergrad\u2014and if you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll be watching your friends move on in their lives while you struggle to make it on a stipend. So I would say, if it will get you where you want to be, do it!!! If you are in the humanities or the school isn\u2019t a perfect fit, maybe think about it! I\u2019m a hype man at the end of the day, but also hope others can learn from my experience!",

      "text": "So to run slightly counter to the grain, what do you mean by 'too old', what exactly are you concerned about?\n\nYour age won't be held against you in admissions and your 'extra experience' may even be of assistance, *but* there's more to this than 'can you do it', at 28 do you want to spend the next 3-7+ years living on a PhD stipend when your friends are off getting married, buying houses, going on nice holidays and starting families, especially as post PhD comes the postdoc grind and the struggle to find a permanent position. You could be 40 or older before you feel that you've 'made it' and that's assuming you 'make it'\n\nAge itself won't be a barrier but that doesn't mean there aren't reasons to consider whether you really want to start a PhD at 28. So again, the question is what do you mean by 'too old'? If its just about admissions then, no you're not too old. But if its the broader question then only you can really answer that.",

You can absolutely do it. \n\nIt will not be easy (it isn't supposed to be). Choose an advisor who does not require 60-80 hour weeks from you. Also, I highly, HIGHLY recommend choosing an advisor who is a new assistant professor themselves, as it will push them to publish, meaning you get to publish early too. Having a publication early on practically guarantees that you get to graduate on time, because many departments require at least one publication in order to graduate.",
