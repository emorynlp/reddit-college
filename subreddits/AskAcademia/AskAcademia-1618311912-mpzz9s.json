They also know that just because you're qualified to get a job doesn't mean you'll get one. They understand  it's no fault of your own if the job market you're in has collapsed. They'd want to help; they just couldn't. (Especially with one of them having died relatively young, which incidentally also had to do with poverty.) If you know, even subconsciously, that they have the capacity to not let you starve or live on the streets, that's already a level of psychological security a lot of first generation PhDs don't have.\n\n\nTo be clear: I'm not accusing you of being some sort of spoiled bougie brat. I'm saying that a lot of us run a genuine risk of experiencing homelessness and malnutrition during/after grad school, and that that creates an extra level of stress. That feeling is doubled if you've experienced those things before and are deathly afraid of going back to that place. This is a reality for more and more young people worldwide, but especially in the US. It just might not be yours.",

I recently left academia and the entire time i felt incredibly burdened by the expectation to compete against my \"higher performing\" aka WEALTHIER or more financially stable peers. For me, academia was just one of the three-to-four jobs i had to hold to sustain myself since my humanities phd stipend was laughably low. It was infuriating to me to work my absolute ass off in a class/exam/publication while ALSO working the dinner shift at a restaurant or whatever i found--and then being held to the same exact bar as my classmates who had literally never had a job before entering their masters. And actually some departments say that their humanities students aren't \"allowed\" to seek employment elsewhere during their degree, which is insane given that my monthly stipend would just barely cover rent + utilities in most parts of my city. I also felt incredibly limited by the processes of reimbursement for traveling/research expenses that most universities partake in; i often had to sit for months with hundreds or even thousands of dollars in credit card debt until my department could pay me back for a flight/registration fee/necessary purchase. Sometimes i could make the debt work but other times i simply couldn't afford whatever archive trip or purchase that my peers were accommodating with (financial) ease. Obviously this isn't particular to academia, but it is especially egregious within a degree process that many people can't get a *non-academic* job without.",

There are jobs at the university that I simply cannot do even though they would be helpful for advancement because I can't take a pay cut just to do them. For example, Department Chairs get two course releases and a $4,000 stipend per year. However, they can't teach overloads or over the summer/winter terms, so being a chair would literally cost me $19,000 a year. I just... can't.
