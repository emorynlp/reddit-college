  "text": "\\*EDIT\\* I love you all, thank you so much for the insider insight from your own experiences.   \n\n\n*(I felt like I needed to try and write this entire post as if it were a student paper for fun, but you all have been reading enough of those!)*\n\nHello all!\n\nI've been dating a full time professor who teaches at a teaching university for a while now. I'm head over heels for them, and still can't believe I found someone so amazing to love. While things have been going well, I've noticed that most of the tension and pain points in our relationship seem to relate back to the academic work and lifestyle. While I can leave my work at work; they must spend hours daily grading, reading, writing, and planning (weekends included). And this is beyond their actual class time, office hours, and committee involvements. I won't even touch the bedtime differences on top of this.\n\nWe have been good so far on communication over each of our needs and wants when it comes to each other, but I want to learn more about where they are coming from.\n\n* Those on either side of a relationship with an academic, what have you found helps with such an imbalanced work/life between the partners? I'd love to hear thoughts or advice from a non-academic as well that's in my position.\n* Are there situations or topics you've struggled with and could either warn about or help advise?\n\nOverall I just want to better understand how others have run relationships when one partner is a busy academic, and the other has the ability to lean on an 8-5 job. Thank you for your thoughts or suggestions!\n\n*^((P.S. It is a pain to try and search for advice on dating a professor, there is a LOT out there focused on students interested in this...)**)*",

                      "text": "Ok, thanks! This is helpful. So, as I understand it your partner is in a tenure-track position, but just starting out, and is at a school where research is not the primary focus.\n\nThere's some great advice in the rest of the thread, but I'll add two points:\n\n1. Even though research isn't a focus, they'll still be expected to produce. Understanding the pressures that can come with that (late nights editing/revising/drafting, long hours in the office/lab, etc.) would be helpful. This can be as simple as understanding that spending time together around a deadline might be impossible and being ok with that.\n\n2. There are (usually) a couple hurdles on the path to tenure. Now, this isn't true at every institution, but usually *about* halfway through their time as an assistant, they'll have a 'pre-tenure review' (often a 'third year review'). These *feel like* (and to a degree are) a *big deal*. They're an opportunity for the school to say \"You know what, this isn't working, see ya!\" That *rarely* happens (at most schools), but your partner will likely feel the pressure of that timeline. Of course, actually going up for tenure is the *big deal*. That's when your partner will find out if they get to hang around 'forever' (for some definition thereof) or if they are back on the market/their career is 'over.' \n\nI raise those two reviews because they're likely to cause a lot of stress and anxiety for your partner; just *knowing they are coming* will allow you to better prepare and communicate your own needs while supporting your partner's as you see fit. I am *not* suggesting you subjugate yourself to their timelines, that would be unhealthy; rather, discuss their timelines and think through how it will affect your relationship - how might you prepare together? What can they do for you, what can you do for them?\n\nIt sounds like you're on the right path and I hope it works out in a beautiful, healthy, and long-lasting way for the two of you. \n\nAs a bonus, if you think through timelines a bit, your partner *likely* has a sabbatical at some point - could you align that with a long vacation at your own work to really travel a bit?",

      "text": "As a disclaimer at the outset, it's difficult to answer as specifically as we might like without knowing the details of your partner's position - the advice varies substantially depending on if they are tenure-track or not, adjunct, assistant (pre-tenure), tenured, and so on.\n\nAs there are two sides to a relationship, there are broadly two sides to the advice:\n\n* On your own side: you may have to make adjustments in your expectations. For example, if your partner must work so many hours (but see below), it may fall on you to take on the bulk of household duties - cooking, cleaning, even household maintenance (yes, the kind with tools!). I must stress: **This does not mean that you must do these things, *a priori*, or that it is your partner's right to expect this from you.** This needs to be discussed explicitly and arrived at as a mutual conclusion that you are both satisfied and happy with - do not treat this as giving up your own autonomy for the sake of love. A relationship must be built on compromise, not one person sacrificing so the other can live their ideal life. Which brings me to:\n\n* On their side: your partner needs to recognize that they are busy, and therefore place a high priority on making time for you and your relationship. This seems obvious but it is not always immediately apparent that this requires *deliberate* attention, care, and planning - and commitment! - to the professorial party. This *may* mean that your partner inevitably has to make compromises at work to place your relationship in an appropriate priority in their life, but almost certainly it means they will have to plan for, and respect/protect, dedicated times with you - if y'all schedule Saturday, 5pm to 10pm as a date night, it is Dr. Partner's job to make sure that their work does not infringe on that time. Yes, this is possible, academia is after all not a world of emergencies and nearly always something can be done later (unless there is a proposal deadline, then maybe not so much, but this can in any event be planned around).\n\nThe key words are communication and commitment. Both of you need to know clearly what is expected from you to make things work, and stick to it as best as you can. I can't tell you much about what the details need to look like - that is unique to every couple. But do work out those details, and then assess if this is a relationship you can honestly see yourself maintaining. Love is great, but it may not be enough to sustain you if your actual life is miserable.\n\nA word about job position: the major distinction is between tenured or not, for a tenure-track professor (though I am oversimplifying in saying this). If your partner is on the tenure track but still working towards tenure, they may not be able to do much about the volume of work thrust upon them for a while - but once they have tenure, they should have the security and flexibility to make some changes (if they are willing...). A tenured professor has job security and freedom to do \"whatever they want\" albeit subject to the whims of their funding sources, thus will have considerably more ability to actually cut back on work and make more actual time for a relationship. **This is very difficult for a lot of professors.** Most professors are conditioned to work 169 hours in a week to do as much research/teaching/publishing/etc. as they possibly can. Ultimately, it becomes a question of *priorities* - your professorial partner at some point needs to assess what priority they are putting on the relationship, how much priority they are willing to put on their relationship, and how much priority you need to feel loved and valued in the relationship. It is entirely possible (I hesitate to say probable, but I would like to be optimistic about the statistics here) that there will be some disconnect between these degrees of priority, which may pose a challenge for your relationship - again, communication and commitment are the keys here to determine if this relationship can, in both of yours honest assessments, work.\n\nThat said, it is certainly not impossible - professors are human beings who need love too, and many are willing to make some sacrifices to pursue it. Best of luck to you both!",

I have a Ph.D. and I'm working in a research lab, which means weird hours. My wife works M-F 8-4. She was getting really upset with me for having weekly game nights with my friends, but seemingly rarely setting aside time for her. The difference was that game night was regularly scheduled for Sunday afternoon; I always knew in advance that time was for fun not work. Like you, she felt like having to \"schedule\" time together was impersonal or a burden. To me, it seemed as though she felt entitled to all of my time after 5pm. \n\nOne we started scheduling more things, the benefits were obvious. There are still times when we can be spontaneous. I do finish working at a reasonable time some days. BUT ALSO Sunday is Game Night with the boys, Monday is time together (including going to sleep at the same time), and Thursday is date night. Other plans get discussed beforehand and put on the whiteboard, with the assumption that I might be working late if we don't have other plans. We actually only stick to this schedule about half the time, but it's a **starting point for communicating our expectations,** e.g. I've got a lot of work this Monday, but I'll be home before 6 on Tuesday.",

      "text": "Welcome to life with a teacher. The same issues come up with K-12 teachers in my experience, though in different seasons and with different intensity at times.\n\nI'm a prof married to an academic adminsitrator. We've both worked at the same university for 20+ years and were in grad school (and college) together before that, so have close to 35 years together in various academic settings. The work/life balance issues are *still* a challenge from both ends at times. For example, as a prof I have pretty flexible work hours...outside of my scheduled classes I can do what I want when I want. So that means I do all the stuff that has to happen during business hours, like taking the kids to the doctor (or the dog to the vet), car repairs, banking, etc. Which is fine. It also means that some days I don't have to go to campus until 10:00am. However, grading often means I work in the evenings/weekends, sometimes until well past midnight. I travel for work sometimes, and have done field work with students that has taken me away for weeks at a time. I'm not under contract in the summers, so use that time for my research and to relax, so then I'm working maybe 20-25 hours a week. But during the regular year I will often have committee meetings that keep me on campus until 6:00pm, I frequently have to do things with students in the evenings (or even teach night classes), and I go to campus on the weekends often as well. Grading sucks up huge amounts of time, but so do the endless one-on-one meetings with students we are expected to have...I'm a department chair and in a typical week I will have 20+ hours of meetings with students on my calendar in addition to all my other work.\n\nBy contrast my partner is expected to be in the office from 8-430. But she often ends up working until 600. She gets federal holidays and a few extra days at Christmas, but doesn't get the school breaks or summers. So in a given year I might have a total of five months where I'm not actually required to go to work at all when she is, which creates some tension when I want to sleep in, or travel, or start some big project around the house and she has to get up at 630 to be ready for work.\n\nOne balancing factor for us is my partner teaches occasionally (like a course every couple of years) so she knows what it's like from my side. By contrast, I haven't had an 8-5 office job since the 1980s, so I get frustrated with her having to track leave, to put in required hours in the office, and to deal with the ridiculous workload expectations everyone in her office faces.\n\nThe reality of faculty life for most of us is that it's a flexible job but 50-60+ hour weeks are commonplace. If your partner is at a teaching-focused institution (we're at an SLAC) there may be very high demands for student contact hours that go into nights and weekends. If they are in a big R1 in a lab field they might have endless hours in the lab. Lots of variation. But literally no academic I know is able to just \"leave work at the office\" more than occasionally, except in summers. What this has meant for us is a lot of split schedules-- some days I can do stuff with the kids (or take them on a trip) while on others she does. Whoever is home and free cooks, cleans, etc. For us *both* to be free to do something more than just dinner together usually means scheduling it out a few weeks in advance so we can both protect time on our calendars.",

I think there is some great advice here regarding planning dates in advance, understanding that you are appreciated, etc. I'm not saying that you are doing this now, so please don't take this as an attack - but don't get caught in the trap that his work is more important than yours. Maintain your own friend group and hobbies. Just because your guy is busy doesn't mean you can't spend your off time doing fun things. Additionally, it's okay to have your own wants and needs and it's okay to decide at some point that he isn't able to meet those for you. That doesn't make either of you bad people.\n\nI'm the academic in my relationship. My boyfriend has hobbies than can be done while I'm working (like gaming). He does the majority of the domestic chores. And yeah, I do appreciate him, and I let him know, but anytime he starts acting like my work is more important than his, I shut that down. It's not (although maybe if I worked in cancer research, I'd feel differently). He has his friends and other hobbies, and before the pandemic, he spent a lot of time on those while I was stuck working. That's the way it should be.\n\nIn my industry in my particular corner of the world, it's very common for men to be the academics. It's absolutely sickening to see countless examples of girlfriends and wives with their own jobs and own lives picking up the slack in their relationships and acting like that's normal or, even worse, something to be proud of. I hear about my colleagues who haven't spent proper time with their kids in weeks or who haven't taken their partners on a date in months. It's awfully nice that these women are being so accommodating, but I can't help but feel that they think their own lives aren't as important and therefore are okay with that arrangement. Your own career is just as important, no matter what you do or how much money you make.\n\nI realize this is coming across ridiculously judgmental.

It can be stressful at times, but the ability to explore our passion and to share that enthusiasm with others is the main motivation for this academic life.  As such, it's really no problem to choose a few more hours working on that grant or manuscript or experiment in lieu of a few hours of TV or doing home maintenance.  When I go on \"vacation\" with the family, I usually spend at least 4 hours per day in a coffee shop getting to the work that I can't seem to get to at home. My favorite part of about vacation is getting caught up on work.  In our normal lives at home, I can be persuaded to spend an afternoon with friends or extended family, but I feel restless and just want to get back to my studies and the ideas rattling around in my head.  My immediate family is the only real exception to this - I love being with them.  If I ever had to give up my academic career for the sake of my family, I would do it, but I would never be as happy.  My spouse is the same - perhaps even more so. \n\nIt may also be the case that being this focused and passionate about one's subject may also be necessary to be successful as a research professor. \n\nThe traits you are describing are likely an integral part of your lover's personality. The activities they inspire are probably necessary not only for their career success, but also for their psychological well-being.  To move forward in the relationship, I suspect it will be important to be honest with yourself about whether you are really OK with that.",

If I was a non-academic dating an academic, I would want to know the following:\n\n* What is motivating this person in their work? Some reasons I've noted among peers:\n   * They genuinely love the work. It motivates, excites, or energies them.\n   * They want recognition. This could be from peers, friends, students, or it could come from one of those deep-seated parental issues.\n   * They feel constant pressure or guilt. They constantly feel like they \"have to do \\_\\_\" even if they aren't exactly sure why. Maybe the pressure/guilt is material. Maybe it's personal. Maybe they feel that they can't do anything else.\n* Does this person have a plan to reduce their workload in the future?\n   * Are they currently wrapped up in a specific research, teaching, or service project that might just be taking over right now but not next year?\n   * Is this person chasing tenure or some other permanent position? How long or what do you think it will take to accomplish this?\n   * Would this person be okay with having \"off\" hours with you? As in, turn off everything 2-3 hours before bed every night (or something). Or maybe you can have every morning together, or maybe a long lunch and/or long dinner?\n   * Would this person be okay with having at least one day off a week when they are not working? This is pretty \"normal\" ask, in my opinion. I worry a lot about my colleagues who work through every weekend...\n   * What will summers and other holiday times look like?\n* If it's in your mind: what would the whole kid or ailing parent situation look like with this person? If they can't keep good work/life boundaries now, how would that work with a kid or any other responsibilities in the future?\n\nMost importantly, you have to ask if it's worth it for you after reflecting on and finding answers to these questions and anything else related. Being with someone is about time. If someone doesn't have time to give you to be together and PRESENT (not just co-working), then you're not really together.",

      "text": "I'm typing this at 8pm as I mess around on reddit and my tenured prof partner is sitting next to me catching up on emails, doing admin work, and editing a paper. I'm a former academic (quit at the postdoc level) and he got tenure before we started dating so all of the tenure-track/tenure package stress has never been an issue for us. That being said, and important thing to remember about academics is that they will focus on whatever is most urgent. Whatever is on fire is what gets their attention. If your relationship is going smoothly (which it sounds like it is) they may not initiate the relationship maintenance stuff. There's always something with a student, with a conference, with a proposal that is URGENT.\n\nA few things have worked well for us: real quality time, and planned activities. Let me explain.\n\n* When he finishes work in the evening it's time for REAL quality time. No phones, no email. We look each other in the eye; we talk about our days; if needed, we do household chores like dishes together. I also use this time to put things related to our life together on his radar. Which leads me to my next point.\n* Planning is crucial. Setting expectations early and making it clear what is urgent. Do you have a stressful week coming up? They may not notice or know off the bat (every week is stressful for them), so bring it up and say clearly what that means for you. I'm a project manager, so when I have a big meeting or pitch I make it clear the weekend before and lay out my schedule, e.g. \"This means I'm going to be really absorbed in prep on Monday and Tuesday, let's plan to order food.\"\n* The whiteboard is the center of our world. Everything that needs to happen as a household is on the whiteboard. It's in a central location that we both walk by all the time, and when one of us adds something, they make it clear to the other one \"I'm putting X on the whiteboard.\" For us it works. Things on the whiteboard get done.\n* I'm not sure what your hobbies look like, but it's nice to have a few you can do quietly while sitting next to each other on the couch. I like to read, and game, and color, (and browse reddit obviously) and sometimes it's relaxing for both of us when he's stressed about work and I can cuddle up and do my own thing. You might give that a try occasionally.\n\nAll this being said, it's important that you don't get totally sucked into catering to them. If you're reading an interesting book and they finally surface from their emails/grading/lesson prep. that doesn't mean you have to drop what you're doing. I myself know it's pretty tempting. But you shouldn't center your world around their availability. Sounds like you're pretty wise to all this and just looking for ways to improve, so that's great.\n\nOne final tip: We have a dog so we kind of have to do this, but every night at around 9-10pm we take a long walk around the neighborhood together with the dog and it gives us a chance for a \"final check-in\" every day.

      "text": "I have a PhD and two kids. When I was postdocing and momming (crazy) my husband (nonacademic) scheduled himself into my life... literally... in my calendar. Sometimes it was very practical, like just walking the dogs for a half hour, cooking dinner together, or even grocery shopping. We onve scheduled my sister to babysit so we could go lock ourselves in our room and watch a movie (we just fell asleep). If you're creative, anything can be a date. Since I had kids I ALWAYS take my vacation, and we do at least a few days \"turned off\" when we shut off the internet and our phones. Its an incredible feeling when you get over the discomfort. I also text and email my husband, though not so much now that were working from home. When we were both working it was awesome to get a love note in my inbox. It keeps the intimacy even when you cant be together. \nMy biggest piece of advice is to communicate. Seriously, this conversation you're having with us, you can very gently and respectfully have it with them. Dont accuse or anything, just ask how best to work around this work-is-life situation. They probably know its hard for you, and may have some great ideas of their own",

      "text": "Prof here. I find that we tend to fall into two camps, for the most part:\n\n1. We need/want to be with another academic because it is a lifestyle for many of us, not just a job, or \n\n2. We adamantly want someone who is NOT an academic so that we can create a more concrete split between personal and work life. \n\nMy biggest take-away for you is this: normal people don\u2019t become professors (we chose to spend our lives in school because we enjoy it!). The Academy is a cruel mistress and finding balance can be a real struggle. For many of us, asking us to change our work patterns and such is akin to asking us to change our personalities. It be done, but it\u2019s hard.  I\u2019m not trying to make excuses or give your significant other a pass on being a shitty partner, but I think it\u2019s helpful to recognize that we live in a world that is competitive, cut-throat, and that we have likely been in this system for our entire lives.  Plus, we live in a world of ideas. There have been many times that I\u2019ve been talking to someone, gotten \u201cthat look\u201d on my face, and pulled out some paper to write down an idea. In the middle of a conversation. \n\nAll of this to say that I think you hit it on the head: it\u2019s extremely difficult for us to separate personal and professional (again, it can be done, but that typically results in us being seen as lazy or unaccomplished by our peers - a big no-no in academia). You really need to figure out now if this is a partnership/lifestyle that will work for both of you, because it will involve sacrifices on both sides. I tried dating people outside of the academy but they could just never quite understand me or my world, so I ended up marrying an academic. \n\nBest of luck!",

We also have a few nights during the week that are \"our time\" whether it's an acual date night, or just hanging out. Yes, it feels cold to schedule time like this, but many of us will let work run our lives, and willingly - scheduling time together makes it part of the routine. Most important (for me, at least): Hard start and end times. If I know what is happening and when, I can work around it.\n* I need solo time. Your partner may not, but it's worth talking about. Work and relationships both take energy. Sometimes I don't have energy for either and need to recharge. I have scheduled days during the week for this. \n* Avoid ultimatums. Do not put them into a position where they have to choose between you and their profession. It only builds resentment on both ends, regardless of what the answer is. \n* \"Holidays\" are not always holidays. Typically, we will take some time off, but those breaks are really time for us to get caught up or do the work that our other obligations have gotten in the way of. \n\nAs with any relationship, it's all about communication, adjustment of expectations, and discussing what are reasonable compromises.",

Then I may be talkative and 100 % present. 30 minutes later I might be struggling with a problem that require me to stay completely focused, and if she starts up a conversation (the same way I did 30 minutes earlier) work is interrupted, or worse. Other times I may sit by the computer and  and do simple work, and may be able to talk some without any problem. It is obviously impossible for her to tell the difference.\n\nThe main issue from her perspective is that I don't have any clear boundaries between work and leisure time.

I'm not dating my partner because he's an academic (on the contrary...see LDR for all but 6 months of our 7+ year relationship) but it helps because he's living the same life. That said, we're at different points in our careers so we tend to lean on the other at various times. We started dating shortly before his defense, so he really leaned on me and then I leaned on him four years later when it was my turn. It's nice because I get to see him go through experiences before I go through them. All of this is, of course irrelevant to your situation but I bring it up because the importance of support cannot be understated. You've gotten great advice about scheduling/carving out relationship time, which unfortunately you kind of have to do just because of the...flexible...work hours of academia. For me though, when things are tough, it's just nice knowing I have a support system and a cheerleader rooting for me. Or someone that believes in me when I don't believe in myself. \n\nI don't want to be a downer and say this, so please don't take it as such- many relationships involving academics do not work. That's the bad. The good, here, is that, it's so wonderful that you are actively trying to figure out how to be a good partner for your partner and what they need. Communication is important, but it has to be open and honest. I think it's great that you're taking these steps. Usually when it comes to relationship advice (especially reddit related relationship advice...), my advice is always \"talk to you partner about what they need, silly\" but if I've learned anything from being and dating an academic, it's that we can be absolutely terrible at recognizing our own needs. \n\nAlso, thanks for sharing that you found someone and you're head over heels for them. That's something that made me smile today, internet stranger, so thank you. It's a nice reminder that there's still good in this world. :)\n\n(PS-ugh, dating professors as students, definitely don't want that on the search history!)",

He just got the tenure-track position in 2020. \n\nThe professor in the relationship has a really demanding schedule, one that is pretty drastically different from the 9-5. It puts you each into different mindsets. There are times when he has a break between classes and wants us to go to the grocery store and I remind him that I'm still on the clock. Conversely, it could be 6pm and I'm ready to spend the evening doing something, but he has grading to do (for the next 3 days). So, a lot of it is being able to adjust as you go. Planning absolutely everything in advance is the only way to go. I have to know if the next few weeks are all about work or if he will be less busy so I know whether to expect to spend time on my hobbies/reading/making plans with friends or if we're going to plan something together. Keeping even an hour before bed to chill out and do nothing together goes a long way too. You might not have a proper date for weeks at a time, but as long as you know how long you're going to be waiting and they actually make plans with you in the less busy weeks, it is manageable. It's more demanding earlier in the career, but if they are a workaholic as many profs are, they may always work that much. You really need to enjoy having your own time.\n\nHowever, this is the dynamic now with him being tenure-track. Meaning, he's staying put. If your SO is not currently on the tenure-path in their position, then the priority conversation has to be about how you are going to manage the possibility that their career uproots them. Contract positions don't magically become TT, and I'd wager most people get their first TT outside of where they graduated from.

There have been a lot of good comments but here are just a couple I want to highlight:  \n\n\n* This year has been a year like no other for academics. Moving to remote learning or hybrid learning takes a lot of time.  There is also an increased demand to support student's needs which takes time.  So take what you've witnessed for the past year with a grain of salt.  It's not always going to be quite this bad.\n* The trade off for the \"on-all-the-time\" culture is flexibility.  Your partner will have a lot of control over how they spend their time, and that can be very helpful in a long term relationship -- take advantage of it! It can be particularly helpful if children are in your future.\n* The pre-tenure time can be very stressful even for the most well adjusted.  There isn't really anything like the tenure system outside of academia, so it's worth understanding what the process is like for them, how they are feeling about it, what they are willing to sacrifice at the altar of tenure.",
