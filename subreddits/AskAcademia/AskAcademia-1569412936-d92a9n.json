I have learned it today and it's helping me a ton so I'm posting here if anyone else could use this-\n\n1. **Citation chaining**: this will help you develop a well organised coordination of the existing literature that you've reviewed. See [here](https://academicanswers.waldenu.edu/faq/73253) for details.\n2. **Look for works done based on a certain research paper**: if you have a core paper from past and you want to see what the state of work is or follow-ups based on this, see [this](https://academicanswers.waldenu.edu/faq/72660) link (should work with other search engines, not just google scholar)\n\nHave fun!!",

Each person gets a prominent journal in your field to scan through,  and they each give a quick report on the current/recent articles.  (and if there is a very relevant article, by all means go through those citations as well).\n\nedit:  that is written as \"3. \" as in the third point.
