  "text": "Hi all! \n\nI\u2019ve got a bachelor\u2019s degree in public finance (GPA: 9.3/10) and a master\u2019s degree in urban planning (GPA: 7.9/10). Both degrees from Russian universities. \n\nActually, I\u2019m not happy with urban planning as a field and my primary goal is a PhD degree in political science (preferably in Canada \u2014 McGill/UWO/York, but I take other countries in consideration as well) because I really interested in local government and urban policy issues. \n\nFrom this point, I have a huge doubt regarding my chances of becoming a political science PhD student in a top North American or European grad school. First, my master\u2019s degree is not directly connected with political science. Second, my master GPA is quite modest. I guess one should have GPA 3.5/4 or higher to be admitted at the top grad school. \n\nIs a second master\u2019s degree in political science a good idea to obtain related courses, increase my GPA, and induce my chances to be admitted at the doctoral program?\n\nOr should I ignore these circumstances and try to enter a political science grad school without second master? \n\nIn a word, feel very confused. Would be happy to receive any advice",

There's nothing stopping you from just emailing a professor in Canada and asking if your credentials can join their lab, and no problem in telling them that you want to switch areas and are incredibly interested in their area of research right now (as long as you tell the truth). If they don't think you fit they might tell you you need a more relevant MA.\n\nIf you can afford application fees, there's also no reason not to just apply with a good statement explaining why you want to switch areas.\n\nFinally, [this](https://www.wes.org/advisor-blog/the-differences-between-phd-studies-in-the-u-s-and-canada/) and [this](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14661/is-it-possible-to-obtain-a-phd-in-canada-without-having-to-attend-courses-for-a) both say in Canada it's possible to do a Master's for one year instead of two and switch to PhD.\n\nEdit: fixed link",

So, there is a chance to be admitted at these universities with planning degree. \n\nI will follow your advice and will email professors directly, not grad admission directors\n\nUnfortunately, your second link doesn\u2019t work",

      "text": "Nominally, you do not need a second masters to get a PhD. However, realistically and with few exceptions, students from Russian universities (analogously to students from most other \"non-Western\" country unis) have to get a western masters before they have a realistic chance of a PhD. Your best avenue is to consult with your masters and undergrad advisers or ask classmates from either course who have gone on to PhD work. If you come from a school of the level of HSE, maybe RANEPA, your professors may have connections abroad that will allow you to circumvent a second masters. But again, for most this is not realistic.\n\nAs an aside, if your interest is\n\n> local government and urban policy issues.\n\ndepending on what that means, you might not be served by the average political science program. You'd more likely be looking for a public policy dept. In that vein, I would not discount your masters in urbanistics.",

Is it true?\n\nYes, but the chances of getting an academic position in political science are relatively low, so I would not go into this assuming that any PhD guarantees you a future in academia. There is also the issue that, if your research interests are not a good fit for political science writ large, your project of admittance into a PhD program becomes exponentially harder. If the goal is *a* PhD/immigration to Canada, casting a wider net is something to consider.\n\n> Moreover, in most case PubPol, PubAdmin, and PoliSc are combined in one school/department/program\n\nPerhaps in Canada. They are not in the US.\n\nThis is just a general suggestion for you to consider. I don't even know what your research is.",

Pick an area of work that you enjoy, and for which  contracts can be found, and for which you can legitimately apply for with your qualifications and skills - build up a portfolio in that field.  \n5. While building portfolio, register for PhD part time.  \n6. Begin to compile the projects you work on, into a papers, answering novel questions in your field. Aim to publish 1 paper per year.   \n7. After 4 - 5 years, submit that your as a portfolio phd - all published - all linked to your field.  \n8. Bam! you built a business and got a PhD!",
