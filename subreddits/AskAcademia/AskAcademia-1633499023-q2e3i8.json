  "text": "This is probably a dumb question but if i have submitted an article for review and I realised that I made an error in analysing and the conclusion is now a whole different thing, would it be okay to change it since it has not been approved to be published yet? \n\nFor instance, let say the reviewer responded with their revision and I edit my article based on that and update my results, then inform the reviewer about the change in results, would that be considered acceptable? \n\nFor context I'm submitting to a language/linguistics journal.",
