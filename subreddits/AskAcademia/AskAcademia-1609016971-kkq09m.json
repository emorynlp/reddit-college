  "title:": "Did any Professors go easy on the grades this semester?",
  "text": "I am a literature major in my last year at a University in CA. Due to virus, campus closed and everything moved online. I have social anxiety, so I was ecstatic to switch to remote learning. I attended zoom class from the beach, for christ\u2019s sake. This semester, I got the highest grades of my life, period. Straight As, and I am typically a poor student (am also a first generation college student, so not a lot of support or motivation). I worked hard this semester, but I expected maybe a B average. Is there any chance that our professors were encouraged to go easy on the grades this semester (due to covid)?",

              "text": "This can make a huge difference for some students. \n\nI've had semesters where deadlines for projects or papers were the same across 2, 3 or (only once) 4 classes, and after the first round came and went, I realized I had to basically pick two or three to actually focus on and \"sacrifice\" the quality of the other project or paper, because it was too much. I asked for extensions, and was denied, and even asked if I could get the details for the project early, with an early due date, to try to spread out the load, and they said no, every single professor, even after explaining the situation, all but two times with one professor. While this is atypical, and usually only happens a few times a semester at most, they can be assignments that count for a huge portion of your grade. \n\nIf those professors were just a little more lenient or understanding with deadlines and extensions, I would've had better grades overall (I had 3 As and a C+ one semester like that, just because I couldn't handle 4 projects and papers all in the same 2 weeks that were each designed to take 2 weeks), and better mental health.",

      "text": "I'd say yes, across the board in my department. We actually had meetings to discuss this over the summer. We agreed that due to COVID, hybrid delivery, stress, isolation, and related factors, everyone would move more of the semester grade weights onto daily work, group projects, and lower-stakes assignments. We also dropped some of the regular elements in common courses like our junior and senior research classes that would have been harder to deliver/complete in hybrid mode.\n\nThe result was significantly higher grades overall. Not a lot less *work* mind you, but we shifted grading weights so that students who showed up and did the work they were asked to generally ended up about 1/2 grade higher overall than they would have a year ago. We also agreed to approve extensions of deadlines more generously than in the past. Lots of our students ended up with COVID (we were in person) or had roommates who tested positive, so things were pretty rough this fall. They deserved a bit of a break and I have no qualms about providing a bit of on in the midst of a pandemic, especially when they were still being asked to do largely the same work (with some minor exceptions) as before.",

I was definitely more lenient with accommodating schedules, late work, and with missed in-class questions. I think that everyone had a pretty chaotic schedule this semester (myself included). I also made all of my exams open book/notes/web. To balance that though, I was a little more stringent in my exam grading. This ended up resulting in the exam averages staying about the same as previous semesters. All together, I feel like the bar was set exactly where it has been in the past - my adjustments simply took into account our altered circumstances.",

As long as they submitted everything, they passed.\n\nI also implemented labor-based contract grading for the first time this semester, which I think helped my students in several ways -- as long as they do the work and meet requirements for each assignment, it counts as labor done for the class.

(I taught an intro to video editing seminar, which had much fewer technical issues for my students than I had expected).
