  "text": "I am into military history, in particular naval history. I think it is a very specific subject and there are only few universities in the world that offer a degree in naval/maritime history, therefore it may give you interesting opportunities. Am I wrong? \n\nIn addition, I am thinking about applying for the MA Maritime History at the University of Plymouth. Do you have any feedback? Do you have friends that obtained this type of degree?",

The fact is that I already hold a master's degree in International Relations and I would like to focus more on the history of warfare or war studies... IR studies are too wide... The big problem is that most of these programs are offered by UK universities which, because of Brexit, have incredibly high fees for EU citizens like me.",

      "text": "It really depends what you would try to do with such a degree. At the MA level, the applicability is basically the same as any history MA: museums, teaching history in a high school/maybe at a 2-year college, etc. And of course there\u2019s plenty of things you can do with a humanities MA that have nothing to do with history directly. If you want to teach in a university then you\u2019ll need a PhD, and there aren\u2019t really \u201cmaritime history\u201d job openings as such. You would identify yourself as a historian of a certain country or region with an interest in maritime history. There are plenty of historians out there interested in maritime aspects even if they aren\u2019t explicitly teaching in a maritime history program. I do know of one other explicitly maritime program, at the [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/history/colonial-and-global-history/maritime-history).",
