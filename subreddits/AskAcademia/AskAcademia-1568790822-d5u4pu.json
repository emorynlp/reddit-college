  "title:": "What kind of reading schedule do you maintain to be on top of everything while completing a major research project and going through day to day life?",
  "text": "I only ask because I'm a final year undergrad who has gotten by through bursts of productivity on some days and days where I am out of commission. I might read 4 articles/book chapters a week in depth and loads of skimmed material ie. stuff I didn't have time/energy to complete. There is no regularity or sense of control involved. I am always fighting against the clock, my mental health and my ability to get it done. \n\nI hope that understanding the day to day workload of someone undertaking a major research project like a pHD can help me plan out my own routine when I take on my thesis next year. I want to take some control back. I know with my mental health issues, it will always be a struggle but being prepared is what has gotten me this far!\n\nI know answers differ individually! I'm just trying to get a rough idea so I can build towards my own goals little by little.",

Spend the same time every day reading, and it quickly becomes part of your routine and you won't have to worry whether you've done it or not. And you can easily scale it up or down to find the ideal balance.",

      "text": "During the first two years of my PhD (in the US with no prior masters degree), when I was first trying to learn everything about my the topic of my thesis, my goal was to get through 14 original data papers a week, so average 2 a day.\n\nIn the beginning this was a challenge, and whether I met that goal depended on how much other stuff I had going on in class and the lab that week. At that time I was reading every word of every paper and it also took a while to make sense of each figure and to synthesize all the results into a complete picture in my head.\n\nBy the end of my PhD (5 years), I had created weekly PubMed alerts for a few specific keywords related to my project, and any new papers that came out directly related to my work, I was able to  scan through and get the important details out of figures in probably 15-30 minutes per paper, so it was not difficult to stay on top of the directly-related literature. I would also probably spend 4 hours a week reading broader literature that was not directly related.\n\nWhen I started my postdoc on a new topic, I went back to the same system, 14 papers a week. But I was a lot better at reading papers and absorbing relevant information, so this was not particularly difficult. I wrote an NRSA on my postdoc project 9 months after starting, and after writing that is when I felt I was fully caught up on the literature.\n\nNow I keep up to date with literature using weekly PubMed alerts for terms directly related to what I study, and also by subscribing to table of contents alters for the big journals, and some smaller journals that frequently publish work I'm interested in.",

Then start doing the tasks in your list and keep going until you hit a milestone, finish the task, or run out of time. If you get bored of the task, switch to another. For example, you gotta do some writing. You start but you really don't feel it. Switch to another task on the list, like reading. Of course, if you have a due date close by, you gotta suck it up and do your work. But if you efficiently handle your tasks and time, you may get to suck it up less frequently. \nIn a nutshell, you gotta keep a dynamic, flowing, loosely defined schedule.",
