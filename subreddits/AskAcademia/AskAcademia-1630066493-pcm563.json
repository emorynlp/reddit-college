  "title:": "Advice on leaving academia",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been working in my second (1 year, renewable for a second) Postdoc in biology for 6 months now, with the first 4 months being remote work. My advisor is absolutely wonderful and a star in my field - the position has been challenging and fun and I really do love the work I\u2019m doing. However, I\u2019ve been considering leaving academia for about a year or two now, and recently it\u2019s become untenable for me to stay. I have serious health issues my spouse usually helps with, but we are currently doing distance since they couldn\u2019t move with me and won\u2019t be able to for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m finding it very difficult to live alone and would like to move back \u2018home\u2019 and am willing to leave academia for this (the long hours, stress, lack of job security, etc. isn\u2019t good for my health anyways). But I\u2019m not sure how to chart an exit plan. Not sure this is the right place to ask, but figured I\u2019d give it a try anyways and appreciate any advice!",

      "text": "Biology isn't my field, but from what I've heard, it is a glutted academic market. You do not want to spend the next five or so years cobbling together a series of postdocs when you could be starting a reasonably compensated career outside of academia.\n\nI recommend thinking about how you can translate any quantitative or coding skills, if you have them, into a non-academic job. For example, I'm acquainted with an engineering professor who as a side project wrote a machine learning tool for graduate admissions at his university; this resulted in a 20% jump in the number of applicants (while maintaining applicant quality). This example happens to be \"academia adjacent\" but all sorts of industries get googly-eyed about data analytics.",

      "text": "Assuming that you would want to keep your career in biology on track, I would start by thinking about what you would want to do next, outside of academia. Industry, consulting, sci-comm, etc. Then, you can talk to your advisor about your plans, and if your postdoc or PhD advisor is receptive, start networking towards your next career. My worry with leaving academia without anything lined up is that it becomes harder and harder to get back on track once you're away for a year or two.",
