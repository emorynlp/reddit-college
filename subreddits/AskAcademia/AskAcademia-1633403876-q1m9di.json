      "text": "A love of learning is frankly a really bad reason to get a PhD. A lot of people who do really well in undergrad and enjoy learning struggle in PhD programs because they\u2019re really nothing like each other. In undergrad you get to constantly learn new things and expand your knowledge. That\u2019s not the case with a PhD. In a PhD you\u2019re studying the exact same things over and over again for years, focusing on an incredibly narrow topic. The point of a PhD isn\u2019t to learn but to learn how to do research, and those are not the same thing. \n\nMore practically, it\u2019s a huge commitment and the attrition rates are high for a reason. If you don\u2019t become a professor, a PhD is a liability in the private sector. One, because businesses are wary of hiring PhDs in many cases because there\u2019s the assumption that they ultimately want academic jobs and won\u2019t stick around long. Two because you\u2019ve spent 5-7 additional years of your life in school post-undergrad and are competing with people your age that have actual industry experience. \n\nYou\u2019d honesty likely learn more and live a more financially secure life if you got a private sector job and continued studying the topics that interest you independently. The only reasons to get a PhD are because you need it for your job or you want to go into academia. If you think there\u2019s another reason, you probably don\u2019t fully understand what goes into getting one. \n\nAs for being a professor:\n\nPros: \n- You get to do research in a field you enjoy. \n- Teaching can be very fulfilling. \n- Interactions with other professors and with students are often quite fulfilling. \n\nCons:\n- The job market is brutal and you\u2019re unlikely to get a job (most PhD holders don\u2019t become professors). \n- You give up any control over where you live. If you have a partner with an inflexible job, or want to be near family, or want to live in a certain country/part of the country, then you will need to make severe compromises. \n- Job security is very low until you get tenure. Most people spend upwards of a decade jumping between post docs and poorly compensated adjunct jobs.",

      "text": "Pros: You get a lot of leeway in what you teach, what you research, and how you manage your time.\n\nCons: Pay is lacklustre, job market is insanely stupid, job security for a substantial part of your career is low, the workload is often ridiculous, the demands on your time often get in the way of you doing the things you actually like doing.\n\nAs a passing note - \"I\u2019m gonna do a PhD eventually\" is a really bad way of looking at things. THe only reason to do a PhD is if you genuinely want to get into research and be trained as a researcher. Most people have a pretty poor idea of what doing a PhD actually involves, and getting a PhD - while opening some avenues - can also act to close others. Non-academic employers can be put off by PhDs. Attaching yourself to the idea that you're going to do one in the future is a bad plan. Instead,*if you find yourself going down a path where you might need a PhD* - then look at what might be involved and see whether it's something you really want to comit to. They represent a huge opportunity cost, and - as others have emphasised - the job market at the other end is far worse than you think it is.",

              "text": "This is a great answer by OrbitalPete. I went into a PhD for the wrong reasons. Now, I'm a few months away from completing my dissertation and no longer want to continue down the path of academia. So, I'm juggling between finishing the degree and researching how to transition into an industry job. I have no idea how to get or do a nonacademic job because my education has not prepared me for that- only research and teach in a very narrow area. It's stressful, scary and I feel I've wasted many years. \nThat's not to discourage you from doing it, just be very sure that you absolutely love your field and want to dedicate your career to researching and teaching in it. Good luck with whatever you decide in the future.",
