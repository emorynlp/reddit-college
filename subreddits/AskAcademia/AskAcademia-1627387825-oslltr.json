  "title:": "Advice for a European looking into a humanities PhD (media/Japan) in North America",
  "text": "Hello! I'd like to ask a few questions as a poor Italian guy who's trying to enter a PhD program.\n\nI've tried a few times to enrol in Italian institutions. Unfortunately, there's only a handful of people here carrying out the research I'd be interested in. After a couple of failed attempts, I decided to actively look for people who do the kind of research I want (basically Japan and media).\n\nI've found a few universities in the US and Canada, and got in touch either via email or via videochat with a few professors I'd be interested in working with. They were all somewhat positive about being able to offer supervision. Still, most of them stressed the fact that selections are very competitive, and a couple of them gave me suggestions/offered to stay in touch before the application. \n\nI'm assuming that's part of their institutional duty to not overcharge my expectations and be as kind as possible, but since it's mostly big-name institutions, I'm seriously wondering how much of a chance do I actually stand.\n\nOn the negative:   \n\\-My backround is in linguistics and cultural studies, so I lack some of the foundations for both a media program and a Japanese studies one, even though I've been reading/studying primary texts for the past few months.  \n\\-I come from a one-department university. It's extremely small (my high school probably had more enrolled students than my uni).   \n\\-I suck at test-taking, so my GRE and TOEFL will probably be very underwhelming.\n\nOn the positive:   \n\\-My final BA and MA scores were pretty good (110L/110, which I think would be 4.0 honours or something) but my overall exam scores, especially for non-degree courses were quite average (with two or three bad grades, but that was during my undergrad).  \n\\-During my studies I managed to go abroad once as an undergrad and once as a graduate students, for a total of 1,5 years spent in Japan, one year being at a well-known Japanese private institution (in their media and communication department).  \n\\-Thanks to a super kind professor of mine who's helping me to build up my CV, I've got one article out (Italian journal), one under revision (Canadian journal), and one due in a couple of months (Italian journal).   \n\\-On my own I managed to get a couple of presentations at international conferences (one held in Japan last year, which was unfortunately cancelled, the other one in Canada, happening in a couple of weeks).  \n\\-I'll be teaching for two or three months at a publicly funded cultural association in a month or so (English and Japanese courses I designed)\n\nI'm not sure whether my overall decent academic curriculum might be undercut by the fact that I come from a small university, and whether not having a background in media or Japanese studies may play against me. Plus, I'm not a great communicator (that includes my native language), so I fear not being convincing enough in my SoP.\n\nDo you think that I may be taken into consideration? What should I focus on?",

      "text": "Usual caveat about every program being slightly different from one another, but in your case, the first question that comes to my mind is what level of Japanese language proficiency do you have? I ask in part because depending on whether  you're applying to a media/communications program or an Asian Studies/Japan Studies program, this could be a decisive issue. \n\nAs for the general competitiveness of admissions, my knowledge is more on the Asian Studies side of things, but yes, this can indeed be the case, mostly because the size of the cohort is determined by how much funding the department is able to offer at any given year (and with all the cuts in public universities, this is likely lower now than it was pre-COVID) and depending on the configuration of the department, usually Japan is only one area within a broader regional scope, so all manner of other factors come into play in admissions decisions (e.g., cohort balance between areas, availability of endowed funds for specific research topics, advisor workloads, etc.). \n\nAll that said, in my experience, if a prospective supervisor is willing to go out on a limb to back your application, that can really make a difference. So a solid writing sample and statement of purpose that can show not only research potential but also a good fit with the particular profile of the department is essential. Keep in mind that most Asian Studies programs are relatively small, and so tend to specialize in a few research areas as the numbers don't allow for coverage of everything. \n\nI hope that's helpful.",

          "text": "Thanks for your answer! \n\nMy level of Japanese is pretty decent on the comprehension side, though I have little evidence to back such a claim. I was preparing to take N1, before all testing centres in my country cancelled this year's sessions (the same goes for last year, both when I was in Japan, and when I got back to Italy, for obvious reasons). Now I'm stuck with a N4 I got like 5-6 years ago.   \nNaturally, testing and actual skills are different beasts, but I've been able to read books and articles in fields I'm passingly familiar with, and with little in the way of understanding for a while now. On the production side it's a different matter and I need a lot of practice.\n\nAs for distribution, I see. That makes sense. I was told someting similar by one of the professors, who explained to me that the department seeks to balance out research. Still, there were a fair amount of people researching either Japanese or Chinese media and culture among the students in that department. I hope that means I'm getting the general direction right (or it might mean that they're already full, who knows).\n\nI am not sure whether any professor will go out on a limb to work with me. Again, they were super kind. One of them wrote me that the general direction I am going for would be a good fit for the department. That's definitely enough for me to try, but I'm just not sure whether they were just being kind. \n\nAt any rate, thanks! That was very helpful\\~",

      "text": "I'm in a different Humanities field, so grain of salt:\n\n1) My impression is that Italian academia is viewed somewhat suspiciously in North America, and in my experience looking at applicants, I've seen a lot of candidates with 110/110 -- a lot more than with 4.0's from good North American institutions (again, that is just my experience).\n\n2) Given that, I think your activities in Canada might be more important, as well as your publications and writing sample. Top Ph.D. programs in North America might admit 5-10 % of applicants, so it is hard, but I know of \"non-standard\" candidates getting in based on an exceptional writing sample. It's normal for people to work on the sample and polish it for a long time. \n\n3) If I were doing admissions I would be thinking most of all about your intellectual potential in the field, less about whether you have the right degree and less about teaching experience, etc. And I wouldn't look so much at the number of publications as at the quality.",

          "text": "Thanks for your answer!\n\nI was a bit worried about that. Admittedly, getting a high final score here seems easier than in other systems. Not sure whether that actually checks out, but I can see why someone might be suspicious. That fed somewhat into my wanting to write here.\n\nAs for the writing sample, I'm now studying (and I've being doing it for some time) to gather enough sources to show that I'm willing to put in the work. Also, I am not sure what I should go for in terms of writing sample. Given that I want to put in all the work needed, would you think that drawing from different sources and trying to propose something that shows both where I come from, and that I am caught up with my desired field would make a good impression? Or should I stick to something easier to categorise, maybe a  variation in a common topic in the field I would like to work in?\n\nIn any case, thanks again for your answer, it was extremely helpful!",
