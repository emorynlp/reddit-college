  "text": "Hi everyone. I was wondering how to address an issue that may come up during either my admission process or beyond. During my undergraduate years, I was paying for college by working as a cam model, and another job.  I then took a year off to focus on the sex work to pay off my undergraduate school debt while working in my field. I am worried that the sex work may come up during my admission to grad programs  or while I teach in academia. I essentially did it to pay for school and knowing how judgemental people are, I chose to obviously omit it. How would you handle this?",

Well, that would either mean that (a) I was watching camgirls or porn myself, and I made the connection between the images I saw on the computer and the person who was entering my graduate program.  The former isn't out of the question-- I'm a guy after all-- but connecting the pictures to the actual person seems a big stretch.  In any event, I'd never bring it up to my colleagues because then I'd have to explain how I knew the connection, which would open a whole different can of worms.\n\nThe other possibility is that (b) someone knows and outs the grad applicant.  In that case, we'd probably all be so nervous about screwing something up from a gender bias type perspective that we'd actually bend over backwards to treat the applicant as fairly as possible.\n\nIts not really an issue either way.",

As a veteran of far too many search committees I can't imagine circumstances in which anything like this would ever come up in an academic job search-- we *are* required to do background checks now before an offer is made, but they are entirely pro forma and intended only to reveal outstanding felony warrants and people on sex offender registries. We would never bother (or be interested in) looking into employment history that isn't noted on the c.v., nor usually anything prior to the first academic position.\n\nWhy would a grad school care-- or even know? They aren't in the business of peering into people's personal lives either.

A couple of them are assitant professors, one works in big  pharma and the other is a patent attorney. I dont think they are being \"haunted\" by their past. \n\nLuckily we live in a modern society (especially in academia) where people understand or atleast dont let their personal views influence how they value merit.",

That's just an unnecessary risk that could end me up with HR.",

It was a lucrative position and you did what you needed to to get to where you are today.  Of course, if it does wind up hurting you, and you can prove it in any way, you\u2019d probably have a big lawsuit against the school!",

I was serious that progressive societies might actually view this as a good thing so it's probably less concerning at institutions in those political environment.  Regardless, it doesn't hurt to have a plan should it come up.  If someone brings it up during an interview, then discussing it in a professional manner is probably your best bet.",
