She would get some funny reactions when telling people what she did for a living, but the neat thing about engineering is its objectivity: she could *prove* her competence. \n\nHow about you?",

      "text": "I\u2019m a (white, cis) woman in Computer Science. My favorite example:\nToward the end of grad school, I was chatting with some male labmates at a multidisciplinary conference when a very friendly first year grad student from another university came to introduce himself. He was in one of the non-computational disciplines that fit the conference and was very excited to hear that my labmates were in CS and who their advisor was (never gave me a chance to introduce myself). He started asking them about a particular algorithm he\u2019d heard of that might be useful for modeling his work. My labmates suggested something else might work better\u2014at which point the student turned to me. \u201cSo XYZ algorithm is a computational technique...\u201d\n\nI interrupted him, told him that I knew very well what that algorithm was, and finally introduced myself. He was clearly surprised and  embarrassed. He may have even apologized. But that incident really made it clear to me that the default assumption would never be that I am an expert in my field.",

Below are a few examples:\n\nI once had an old man ask me: Are you just doing math because they give girls scholarships now a days? \n\nIn undergrad I had a TA ask: Who did you have to blow to get that grade?\n\nAnother time someone asked me to study for a test and they came over. He kept asking questions about dating and if my boyfriend and I were serious (dating for 4 years). He wasn't taking studying seriously and was trying to flirt and even asked me to break up. I asked him to leave and I was really upset because he wasn't taking me seriously and just saw me as someone to have sex with. \n\nThere are a few bad apples but most people are supportive...",

I'm a woman and a geneticist/computational biologist, I dress pretty stylishly and (though very \"introverted\" by nature) I used to be quite the social butterfly at parties and a big entertainer. Folks were always saying, \"wow, you don't look/seem like a scientist.\" Now, people take it more in their stride, I'm sure partly because I at least look more professorial by dint of being older.\n\nI never had an issue with a student, but I have issues all the time with colleagues and higher-ups. They say that men are judged on their potential and women on their results, I very much feel that has been the case for me. I feel like I have to do twice as much to get the same recognition as my male colleagues. The ranking among white people in my field feels like: (1)  straight men or straight-acting men, (2) gay men, (3) women who are good looking but don't dress or look particularly nice in the conventional sense (this includes more \"butch\" gay women), (4) straight women who are more femme or high femme. (The only exception to this I have seen is a transwoman who transitioned after she had tenure and was an established scholar.) If you're a woman of color, you are definitely picking up the rear.\n\nI have an Asian woman colleague who is often treated quite poorly. She is the most productive member of the department and a real rising star, so that protects her from a lot. However, even with that, the more senior people still treat her like a pet and someone who doesn't know any better. For example, when it was time for everyone to get annual raises, afterward she encountered the provost. When she saw him he immediately grinned at her and said she is surely happy with her big raise - as if she would never have the wherewithal to find out how much he had actually stiffed her compared the men at her stage. And I can't imagine the provost suggesting one of our male colleagues be openly grateful to him right at that moment for a raise that was clearly earned.",

Check for the gender differential for tenured faculty. More women may study biology, but many more men than women succeed in becoming biologists. And this is decades after the shift in women getting biology bachelors. \n\nTo give you a concrete example, mother's college yearbook from 1945 is sorted by major and half the biology majors are women, and over a third in chemistry are as well (oddly, only seven people studied physics - it was before the space race or nuclear arms development became big - I think it was two women out of seven).

Even when I've literally published papers on a topic - and they know that! - I've had to cajole and argue and provide sources just to convince some men of the most basic, uncontroversial technical facts in an area they've never even worked in. \n\nAnd then there's the few specific men in the field who the other women warn you not to get too close to because they're a bit handsy, and the men who shake the hands of the other men but just sort of... gloss over me.\n\nAnd conferences, oh my god.  It's a regular occurrence that I ask a poster presenter a question and they then direct their answer to some random man who happens to be standing next to me.  Or I'm discussing my own work with someone and a male colleague of mine happens to walk past and says hello... and then the person I was talking with immediately starts asking my male colleague questions about *my* work apropos of nothing.

Again, because in Europe black people are so few that they can't be born in a black subculture or a black neighbourhood like some do in the US. They can't go to a black majority school, because any school will only have like 1 black person for 300 students at most.\nIt's different for Muslims and middle easterns, as they are plenty enough to create e.g. Turkish neighbourhoods where the kids grow up speaking Turkish and not e.g. German in spite of living in Germany. Those are the people that have trouble immigrating and that will expierince prejudice and discrimination because its obvious that the local language is their second language, they have a different religion (that Europeans don't like) and they have different views because they don't talk with locals until they enter school",

Not as overtly as that, but many people (only non-scientists) just assume I am a little dim in the logic and education department because I am not an atheist. When I tell them I am actually a geneticist (and an evolutionary genetics at that) they will either not believe me, change the subject, or imply that I'm obviously not a very good one. Not every atheist reacts this way, not even most, but it happens quite a bit. \n\nTellingly, this never happens with another actual scientist, because science is full of even more religious people than I. I think people have sort of imprinted on Richard Dawkins as the epitome of scientific intellect and all that goes with him must clearly be part of it. Ironically, in his own field and at his own institution (where I also was), he is no longer taken very seriously as an actual scientist - though respected a scholar of the history of science. Scientifically, I think a lot of people think of him as the typical successful scientist who did a few great things early in life and then sort of went off the deep end thinking this gave him intellectual license to speak on solving all of life's abstract and philosophical mysteries.\n\nIt's distressing to see how many people rely on science to answer all their questions about life in every way, because there is so much we don't know and the process of doing science is very flawed (though maybe the best it can be).",

There is a big difference between how some specific people treat me before vs. after my presentation at conferences, and I dread presenting late into a conference because it will quite simply cease to be a networking opportunity for me.\n\nLinguistics as a field is halfway between a) having points that can be definitively proven, and thus, a way to stand up to people who are clearly not taking you seriously ad hominem; and b) deferring to claims from big names and trends in the field, leaving your fate to established cliques and how well you regurgitate dogma. The frameworks are particularly bad for this: do an analysis with Optimality Theory and it will by and large not provide any further insight into whatever you're working on (if the analysis pans out at all given OT's toolbox), but you'll certainly make friends in certain circles, and vice versa. I've had a run in or two with a big name who dislikes me (am currently ABD), and they threw everything at me from \"I don't think your data exists\" to \"I've met your participants and they don't agree\". So even when you can prove what you're saying, some people will have decided whether they like you or not, and have no qualms hiding behind their tenure to act unprofessionally and attack you.\n\nAt least our journals/conferences are generally reviewed blind. I can't imagine having to navigate the fields where it matters who wrote what.\n\nOh, and fieldwork in some regions is gatekept by missionaries (SIL), who require you to be straight and married to work with them.

In grad school woman would look down their noses at me when I showed up with hair and makeup for class. Nevermind that it was THE ONE self care thing I could do for myself during the dark times of grad school. I have since switched to wearing glasses instead of contacts + wearing less makeup and not doing my hair to be taken seriously. This is insane to me, but necessary. It also helps keep the men from being gross.\n\nI'm also proud of my Bavarian heritage (I dont advertise this, but will confirm my heritage when the blonde jokes emerge), and I've had several woman assume I got here by using my white German privilege, rather than my brain. Which like, obviously helps, I'm sure. But to try to minimize other woman's acomplishments for any reason just makes it more ok for men to do it for even stupider reasons.

      "text": "I'm in astrophysics, but a heavily theoretical side. I've literally never met a woman in my sub-field, and it may genuinely be all white men.\n\nI remember in undergrad there were the usual snide comments suggesting I'd done \"favours\" for my grades, or that I only won scholarships and awards for being a woman. And it was complicated because for some scholarship or fellowship applications, I *did* mention my experiences as a woman in physics in a very rural (think ~Deep South) area, so I really *was* capitalising on that. And, of course, the comments that I didn't deserve my disability accommodations and that I did well only because I had extra time on exams. It didn't bother me too much though because I could easily prove my competence, and their comments didn't hold weight when I had a 4.0 and they were failing physics for the third time. My socioeconomic background was a bit more of an issue, just because I had to change my accent and mannerisms a fair bit, and that was just to study at the rural university. I literally sound like a foreigner to people in my home town now. I also sound like a foreigner everywhere else because this accent and mannerisms are fake, so you end up in a weird limbo where you have no \"home\".\n\nSince moving to an incredibly rich area for my PhD, the differences are more stark. My accent and mannerisms aren't as big of an issue here because it all sounds foreign to them, but there's definitely an inherent assumption of wealth. I don't know how common that is in PhDs in general, but we're expected to have money for things like conference travel which is then reimbursed later. It's always the case that we have to front up **thousands** of dollars to be reimbursed later. The department is now changing things to accommodate that better, so all expenses just go directly on their credit card, but it's still tough always being the person who has to point these things out.\n\nOne of my peers actually said in a diversity meeting yesterday that he'd never realised different people had such different upbringings to him. He never realised just how much money he had, and how valuable his family's safety net was. He knows *Latin*. He had never considered how hard it must be to attend university while poor, let alone to graduate and go on to a PhD. On the other side, I barely even *see* poor people anymore. And this is the world these academics have grown up in - squeaky clean, showering in money.",

But I'm not sure if that's not representative of the broader population.

I kept waiting for it to be the lead in to a lecture, but it wasn\u2019t, he just thought that was an okay use of our class time. I didn\u2019t know how to report this since I was the only girl in the class and i couldn\u2019t imagine how it would stay anonymous. \n\n- becoming friendly with an almost 30 year old grad student when I was an 18 year old freshman after asking for help because he had taught the class I was taking, and having him aggressively hit on me and ask me out repeatedly despite me telling him that I wasn\u2019t interested every time. Eventually ended up having to completely cut him out and avoid the places he would hang out (the physics building where i studied!) \n\n- being asked out by a 28 year old ex marine in the class that I was TAing at 19 (less wildly inappropriate I guess but why would you ask your TA out?)\n\n- being told that i \u201cwouldn\u2019t understand\u201d why one of my classmates wants to leave academia to work in tech since I\u2019m a woman and don\u2019t have to care about money as much (???)\n\n- a different undergrad research advisor yelling at his post doc in front of me for \u201cswearing in front of a girl\u201d (again, ???)\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many more. Generally a lot of incidents that might be pretty minor individually but in reality are a part of a larger pattern that becomes tiresome to deal with and contributes to making people feel as though they don\u2019t belong.",

      "text": "My issue was more my own line of thinking. Before I went back to academia I had a career in marketing. Although I'm an introvert at the core, I come across as very bubbly and friendly. When I came back to get my PhD I felt like I wasnt the typical bookish type, that I wasn't the \"right kind of smart.\" That maybe I was socially smart and maybe I was logical but I wasn't that true cerebral smart. Turns out I was wrong. I won best paper in my program and have presented five conference papers and published one top tier journal article in the last 2 years. Turns out being resilient and hardworking and reasonably intelligent is all you need. My favorite stats professor (who has like a million citations) said once, \"almost no one is a genius. Very few people are brilliant, you might only meet a couple in your life. All I am is intelligent.\" And he was right. You just need to be intelligent to be a scholar.",

I see that the top comment right now is also from a woman in mathematics. It's wild, especially  if you like to do \\*anything\\* with your appearance. Honestly, I've stopped dying my hair, stopped wearing makeup, started wearing men's clothes.... but I still get treated differently, I still get underestimated, people are still shocked to learn that I study math.\n\nOne interaction that is coming to mind right now: I was an undergrad, walking home from the grocery store, and I stopped to pet a cat on the sidewalk. Eventually a little old lady came out of her house, told me the cat's name, and made small talk. Since we were near the university, she asked me if I was a  student, and what I study. I told her that I study mathematics and that I was going to go to grad  school for  it and become a professor, and she was so happy, but  she told me she was \"so excited and happy to see pretty girls studying things like mathematics.\" It was really sweet but also kinda hurts on a  deeper level, you know?\n\nPretty much all of my friends are men, because I am mostly friends with my classmates/cohort/peers, and a lot of them are really decent people but still tend to underestimate me, talk down  to me, or view me  differently than they view other peers. It does drive me to do better and make sure I surpass  all of them and prove them wrong, though.\n\nI play into it too though, maybe because I feel like I have to? I  like to joke around  with people, make fun  of  myself and talk down my own abilities, joke  about how much I drink... I find myself unintentionally portraying myself as someone who isn't so smart, isn't too intense, has plenty of struggles... and I don't know why I do that.",

There's lots of \"women in stem\" highlights in academic conferences, all the gender based scholarships are exclusively for women, and faculty tend to be biased towards trying to be supportive of women. This doesn't mean all problems are solved and that there's no cultural problems that uniquely affect women in academia.\n\nHowever, you seem married to the idea that all your hurdles are caused by being a woman.

Good job sharing the one article that every single guy shares to try and prove they are really the persecuted ones. That study was pretty recent and I wonder if you ever considered that hiring biases changing over time has anything to do with more women being on search committees and fighting for equity. Here is some evidence for that if you care to read it. When female students have a female professor to look up to, they do better in stem classes and are more likely to pursue it. I'm sure you've seen the papers describing females' cognitive ability relative to males - or maybe the research describing young women deciding to not go into stem bc of environmental factors like lower expectations for girls.\n\nCarrell, Scott E., Marianne E.

Try immigrating into a country, have no access to most academic scholarships, having no one in your family have the inside knowledge of the academic world. Having to pay over double tuition than your peers, going over all the administrative hurdles of the government visa process...\n\nAnd yes I am aware, I have had the displeasure of helping a friend file a sexual harrassment complaint. As I said, I am not dismissing or trying to sweep under the rug the problems that women do face. I am challenging you because of the comment \"you are judged differently for being a man\" as if A) there wasn't a lot of positive differential treatment for women (which doesn't eliminate the bad) and B) I (or other guys) never had to fight or struggle unique pressures that our peers did not.\n\nLike the comment on itself is a paradox, you iso facto judged me and made a narrative about me based on my gender.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, yes women objectively face hurdles that affect primarily women. However people also primarily focus on women and their issues so the level of institutional help and support is different to women. This doesn't eliminate the bad, in many ways it exists BECAUSE of the bad. But as of right now there are many biases that positively affect women.\n\nIt's not a men vs women problem. And if you are going to claim \"you know nothing of the hurdles of being a woman\" then you also don't know anything about the hurdles of being a man. The problems both sexes face are often too different to be put on any form of scale or hierarchy.",

I came from a financially strapped but very bookish family and had several problems that did not allow me full scope to excel.  I went to a rather elite school, despite my guidance counsellor writing a  letter indicating that I should not be allowed in because I would dilute the quality.  I got into the undergraduate program in math, with rattling good aptitude test scores.   Despite being an overweight, clumsy and ill-dress young person, my ability to solve commercially valuable problems answered all hiring me.  I remain awkward, but now wear suits that cost more than most peoples' cars.   \n Moreover, building a software company and selling it, straight out of my undergraduate, resolved the next set of questions I faced.  When applied to a graduate business program, the entrance committee suggested that I would not be the right \"social\" fit elite Canadian business circles.  Do not forget this was a time when medical boards favoured sons and daughters of doctors for entrance to medical school - Canada early 1990s.  My response was that the Canadian elite paid through the nose for a firm I built.  Although many firms that would not hire me, these companies were increasingly dependent on my software.  I responded by noted that I could start a new company and build software for industries' competitors and change the competitive landscape.  I argued that my fit did not matter, nor did my acceptance to their graduate school, I was going to drive change on my terms.  \nI gained entrance with a generous aid package and asked by two researchers to collaborate.  Twenty years later, I continue to do exciting things and am quite comfortable.  \nThese struggles are not new, and I sympathize with the frustration people express because they seem impossible.  However, when you are facing a losing game, change your strategy.  Moreover, new people get into leading positions because they have changed the game.  \nWhen I was an undergraduate, I used to hear Marxist professors talk about fixed class struggles, and the only option was a revolution.  The students that took this bullshit seriously did not understand the opportunities, and fragility in capitalism.  They ended up trapped in pessimism.  The real issue is that you prove your worth when you resolve uncertainty.   When you can answer a question by saying I can do this and here is the proof stupid questions fall off the table.  \nCarry on",
