  "text": "I think it is silly to hinder a non-major from graduating because their final grade in my class is a 59 instead of a 60. But what about a 58 or a 57 or a 56? Do you have a line? Do you consider the financial cost of retaking your class and staying in school? Do you pull an extra credit assignment out of a hat and make them sign a NDA so they do not tell others? Or is hearing the lamentations of failing students the best thing in life?",

When I taught undergrads, I would constantly have students come to me and tell me that I was the only thing standing between them and keeping their scholarships/getting into grad school. Which was annoying because it simply wasn't true. Maybe my class was their lowest grade, but if they didn't get a bunch of other low grades, my class wouldn't matter. I would never raise their grades. Now if someone came to me with a 59 and if I gave them a 60 they would graduate, I would probably not turn them away. I would first try to see what happened to the curve if I bumped everyone up 1% and, if I was still within the permitted distribution, I would do that. I would be very reluctant to just bump them up, but I would probably do it.",

She was working her ass off for this class and super stressed about it, but doing perfectly fine in all her graduate coursework. The prof thought it would be ridiculous for her to end up on probation for this and said something like she was going to grade undergrads and grads separately at the end of the class. Whatever she did facilitated the grad student getting her minimum grade to keep going in the program.",

There was an optional class that could be taken that essentially focused on writing and how to take the test.  While I was confident in my ability to pass the test, I needed the units to maintain my full-time status so I took it anyway. On test day, while reading the instructions for the test it quickly became obvious that what we were being taught for the preceding eight weeks really wasn't applicable.  When the results arrived I was one of three students who passed the test (I think there were 25 in the class.)  Lots of people were upset as this was all they needed for graduation, the gal who sat next to me all semester was in tears as she thought she'd lose her scholarship.\n\nThis upset me enough that I wrote a letter to the department chair about the issue.  The class was taught by an adjunct who I suspect was not given any information about the test beyond \"teach them how to write essays.\"  As someone who has been thrown into similar teaching situations I also felt some sympathy towards him.\n\nThe final day of class the prof indicated that he'd received a phone call from \"his boss\" and that if there were questions about test scores that they were welcome to meet with him.",

It's adviseable, but you won't see half the students. They'll learn the syllabus and still ace the exam. Also, generally office hours are only for students who have genuine questions or issues. This is a bit different during the master year when every professor guides a dozen orso students with their thesis, depending on the subject. \n\nMy mother studied at the Sorbonne in the 70s for a while. She remembers how many students would come put their voice recorders in front of the lecturer at the start of the class and then come back to pick it up once the class was finished, even when Foucault was speaking. While some professors do indeed take offense to these practices, simply showing up from time to time and listening is already considered to be a good effort.\n\nI mean, this is an academic environment with many students working/studying around the clock. It's not that they become jaded, but they start feeling at home. I've seen students eat, read a paper or sleep during class at times, but they'd still be engaged when something came up that stumped them. So these things never really play into my gradings. I look at redeemable qualities within the work they produced or extenuating circumstances.\n\nThe way university education is approached here is that these are adults who don't need to be taught how to act or behave. They don't haveWe teach them courses and give them the tools to succeed at those. Frankly, it's more worrying when someone fails my class who has attended all lectures and has been a model student. At least, the first few years I would be more likely be lenient when someone hadn't used all tools available and almost passed. I will obviously advise them to start using those tools - such as attending classes - because grading in the final two years will be far more strict and they require you to act more engaged and professional",

Pedagogically it makes no sense to give feedback and then not let them improve upon it (most won't so it's not much more work).\n\nArbitrary deadlines are evil and whenever I teach, I allow people to submit assignments and take the test even years later if they decide to unfuck themselves and finish the course (and I am still employed). Doesn't matter if you're sick, enlisted into the marines, whole family died in a fire, had a drug addiction, burnout or simply played videogames.\n\nFuck admin that doesn't allow you to be flexible, it's a blessing when instead of 100 submissions over a 1 week period of time they arrive one at a time over the next year or so. Mostly during/after holidays when people try to catch up.\n\nI was the kid that never did anything on time, returned assignments 6 months late, took the final exam 2 years after the course ended and so on.

I imagine you teach a non building type of class. If a student doesn\u2019t do the first unit in a math or science class, they certainly won\u2019t be able to do the second. Or the third. Or the cumulative final. The deadlines are just as much for their benefit as it is for my time management.",

One single soulless instructor like yourself and they don't get their prereqs done for their next year and you add up a lot of unnecessary stress to whatever is already going on in their life.\n\nYou are just lazy and on a power trip. It does not take a lot of effort to grade the handful of students that worked their ass off during the holidays catching up and instead you choose to fuck them over despite their attempts to make things right.\n\nYou are actually paid to teach a class. If you grade 10 fewer students in December and grade the 10 students during Jan-May, it's still the same amount of minutes spent grading their work. Allowing students to improve their grades, retake the exam etc. is also not a lot of extra work.\n\nYou spend more time reading and answering to sob stories and making exceptions (most will make up a story that will force you to accommodate them) than you'd spend actually grading their work.\n\nI know plenty of instructors like yourself that just teach because they are forced to. They don't care about their students. It's a shame that the administration keeps hiring people like you instead of people that actually want to teach and care about their students enough.\n\nYou can still have soft deadlines, retakes etc. and the majority of the class will adhere to 90% of them. But everyone has that one week when they have a flu, a family emergency or multiple deadlines at the same time and it would reduce a lot of stress if they know that they can put in the extra work during Christmas holidays and take the exam in January instead of December. Hell, I had a student that had a kid and still graduated on time because they could do all the work and take all the exams in bursts when the kid started sleeping through the night and the family/spouse could help out with the kid.\n\nEveryone is different and have different circumstances in life. \"I don't have time\" or \"I don't have the resources\" is a bullshit excuse.",

I let other people chase grants for funding research that pays the bills instead of what they want to research   Every step j took in college and Grad school was intentionally aimed at this field. \n\nB) I went to college in my late 20s and early thirties, and I was that exact student you\u2019re describing. \n\nYou are advocating for a ridiculous \u201ceven years later\u201d 100% open policy. \n\nThat type of mentality you are teaching your students is why people in industry get fired for not meeting deadlines. It is part of your responsibility to teach those people who leave the ivory tower to function. Open assignment policies teach them that they can do whatever they want when they want. You\u2019re doing a disservice to your students pedagogically. \n\nI have a kid working on every homework assignment that was due in September right now at no penalty for life circumstances. \n\nI teach a 5/5/3 load. There\u2019s no fucking way I\u2019m grading something after December 11. And I\u2019m not going to bat against the Vice President of the college to do it either.

There is no extra work involved.\n\nYou plan to spend X minutes per student on grading their work. If they do not return it by December that means you get -X minutes in December and +X minutes in whenever they return the work.\n\nYou already are legally required to provide reasonable accommodations whenever someone gets to serve a tour in Afghanistan or is disabled or a bunch of other reasons. You already MUST DO THAT.\n\nThere are concepts of inclusivity, accessibility, and availability. Instead of designing your course for a specific assumed model student and then scrambling in panic when someone actually asks for accommodations that you are legally required to give, you design your course to be flexible, accommodating and work for all kinds of people.\n\nThis not only benefits someone that is disabled, called up to serve in the military or otherwise has \"extreme circumstances\", it also benefits the average student that for one reason or another could not adhere to the schedule. Which is the whole point, instead of making returning late require you a giant sob story and fighting it, you make it the default. Return your assignment whenever given that you are still employed there.\n\nYou shouldn't care WHY someone is returning things late or taking an exam later. Students do not owe you an explanation that might be very personal to them. In fact, you are legally forbidden from demanding an explanation in most cases anyway.\n\nDesign your courses in a way that people do not need to ask you for special exceptions. That time you spent reading someones email and writing a response could be time spent just grading their damn work or creating an extra exam available for everyone.\n\nIt's not hard, you are simply disrespecting everyone else and making yourself the most important person in the world since you're the instructor and everyone has to beg for your mercy. That's called being on a power trip.\n\nGo take some pedagogical courses or something, this is super basic stuff of being a human being.",
