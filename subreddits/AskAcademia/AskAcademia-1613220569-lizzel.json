When you admit someone to a PhD program, you're not choosing a student, you're choosing a future colleague. I know what kind of colleagues I want. \n\nGetting good grades has many components, but two significant ones are compliance with professor directives and effort put in. I was never into compliance for the sake of it (I wanted to learn, damn it!) and I'd always take a B and a good night's sleep over an A that wouldn't add to my overall knowledge or skills. \n\nIn other words, grades don't tell you that much about a future colleague's ability as a scholar/scientist. Let their work speak. \n\nEdit: I have been corrected that grades can predict publications and faculty ratings. At least when aggregated and analyzed statistically. I concede the point. Thank you for the resources cited. However, I maintain my conclusion. Should both candidates meet the minimum gpa standards for admission, I would value the one who has already demonstrated research aptitude over the one with a higher gpa. My personal choice.",

Many people come into my discipline as a second career and their early degrees are often quite a ways behind them and in an unrelated field. \n\nI retract my previous generalization that grades are not a predictor, particularly in the sciences, but I maintain my overall conclusion. *I* would put more weight on someone's work, especially original research, than on their gpa. When aggregated across hundreds or thousands of students, perhaps grades are statistically significant. But when making a decision about *one* student, I wouldn't give them too much weight, especially if they already meet the standard. Setting standards is important, but after that, it helps to look at applicants more holistically. \n\nI'll see if I can find some research about gpa and success in the humanities and social sciences to share.",

                              "text": "The problem is that most studies in specific disciplines are based on tiny samples---somebody analyses a few cohorts of their programme, finds that GPA (or, more often, GRE, because it's hated so much by some people) isn't a significant predictor, and thus concludes it doesn't matter. That's why it's good to rely on such a meta-analysis.\n\n(If you are looking at studies, also a word of warning: Many studies look at admitted students only. This can easily lead to a situation where the actual relationship between a predictor and the outcome is obscured. The reason is that students may have been selected based on multiple variables---say, GPA and prior work. Likely, those with low GPAs will have had to make up for that with better prior work. This can lead to a case of Simpson's paradox, where GPA does not predict success within the programme even though it is related with success in the population (and would be predictive had everybody been admitted). \n\nOf course I'm not saying that grades and standardised tests are the only predictors of graduate school performance. But they are good predictors. And especially the GRE has the advantage that it is largely unbiased: There isn't any strong evidence that it disadvantages certain demographic groups. \n\nThat's not the case with prior research experience: We *know* that access to research opportunities is highly inequitable, depending on the resources of their undergraduate school, students' need to work to support themselves, and other structural barriers. But we don't know how much relying on prior work leads to biases---it's plainly not been studied. That's why I'm quite worried about the current rush to move away from 'hard' measures (esp. the GRE)---they are, for all we know, the best and least biased predictors of success we have.",

I've coached many international students in their study for the GRE. Often they do great at the math (better than me), but struggle with the English portion. I don't think there is a solution there, as they need a certain level of English comprehension to succeed in grad school, but I've seen many exceptional students lose out when their visas expired before they could get good enough scores. Provisional admission with discipline specific esl support could be a way forward for these students.\n\nThat said, the very factors that predicate prior research experience (e.g. need to work, structural barriers, plain old fashioned bias) also impact GPA. I've seen clear instances of professors who graded BIPOC and women students harder for the same work (and been fired for it, but by then the transcripts were in). And a student who works her way through school with a B average is higher in my book than a straight A student who never had a job in their life. \n\nThis is why I think large scale gpa studies are good for setting minimum standards and expected ranges, but not deciding individual cases.",

Also, I agree it should not be possible for someone to make a 4.0 and be unable to apply what they learned, and yet it happens. In at least two cases with which I was personally involved with, they were both very high achievers in high school, not exposed to failure, and thought they had to be perfect. This led them to not ask for help, and to avoid risk in their course selection, preferring to hit a home run with with an underhand pitch rather than swinging at a fastball. One managed to get out of grad school with a master's (barely) but their thesis work will never be published. The other had a meltdown when their field season didn't go perfectly and their coursework suffered, and has withdrawn. Both were from decent undergrad programs. In the case of field technicians (who typically are fresh out of undergrad) I've seen the same in at least two cases (but not to the same extreme as the graduate students).\n\nPlease note, I'm not saying GPA is a worthless metric. I'm saying GPA alone (beyond a certain threshold) isn't a great predictor about graduate school and field success, and it isn't like I refuse to interview people with a 4.0; however, I've found the best grad students and field techs are those who have already had a taste of adversity. They do not buckle as often when it is time to produce novel research.",

You're competing against people who are astounding in all areas.\n\nAlso, you're asking people at non-Oxbridge universities. They will all do things slightly differently. Oxbridge greatly values the academic profile in admissions. Your grades will matter to them because it may be the only way for them to distinguish candidates at the final stage. In the UK it is **rare** for undergraduates to do research outside of a Masters and few will have published their Masters work by the time they apply to PhD (seeing as they apply 3 months into their Masters), so research experience may be the more unfair metric and it wouldn't be right to prioritise that. The situation is different in the US.",

                                      "text": "You also have to remember that funding is usually separate to the position in Oxbridge, and that funding **is not** largely decided by your department, your supervisor, or perhaps even academics in general. The funding is what allows you to actually attend and the people who decide that will have their own way of ranking candidates that is very disconnected from what the department does.\n\nIt is not helpful to \"try to get an idea of how academics tend to think\". It will not increase your chances. It won't even indicate your chances. People with perfect grades, loads of publications, and more teaching experience and conference experience than you get rejected. Why? Who knows, maybe they didn't get funding because there were 10 others in their field who got funding and they wanted to spread the rest around other departments. Maybe a particular supervisor could only take 1 student and they had another more amazing applicant who'd already interned there and proven themselves. Departments choose who to put forward for *consideration* for funding, but they don't ultimately choose who gets funded (a department might have a couple of scholarships of its own, but not many).\n\nYou could be accepted. You could just as easily be accepted with zero funding (as are most people who get offers) or be rejected outright. The only thing you can do is wait. No one in the Universe can give you the odds you're looking for, not even a ballpark figure.\n\nMy advice? Assume you will be rejected (or accepted without funding, it's the same outcome). Make sure you have other options or plans you would be more than happy to follow. Pining over a university just won't do you any good because the pain of rejection etc is way more intense than the joy of acceptance. Since you've already applied and have nothing left to do, may as well start expecting the worst.\n\nEdit: For reference, I had a perfect GPA, publications, teaching experience (started a tutoring scheme in uni, was a TA for 3 years), presented at international conferences, had (apparently) astounding LORs, gave public lectures to thousands. **I still didn't manage to secure funding at Oxford.** I did at Cambridge, but just as easily could have failed there too. *That* is how fickle admission results are at that level. My stats gave me a 50/50 chance on the face of it. But does that mean yours are less than 50%, given your grades are scraping the bottom of what they'll consider? I don't know, no one does. And if you're looking at 30-70% range, does it even matter what the number is? It's all too close to 50% to be worth anything at all.",

Also, objectively defining what is an \"amazing\" versus \"okayish\" research project would be helpful.  \n\n\nA strong GPA suggests to me that the student has a greater likelihood of succeeding in graduate school from a course standpoint, and also that they have a good set of habits and learning skills. Decent research projects and references could have been greatly contingent on the school they came from, whether there were even \"amazing\" opportunities available at their institution to begin with, etc.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, having one amazing research project but an okay GPA could suggest that the student is incredibly creative when it comes to thinking about research, but the average GPA would have me concerned as to how successful they'd be in graduate school. Based on a 4.0 scale, the strongest graduate students I know are the ones at least 3.8 or above.  \n\n\nThe main questions I ask myself including the following: Who has more potential?  Who could grow the most academically? Which student is more self-aware in terms of what they're aiming to get out of graduate school? In my perspective, the student with an excellent GPA will have a stronger foundation to take on all sorts of research projects, hopefully more \"amazing\" ones, if given the chance and will likely be able to successfully see them through.",

The initial screening of \"Is the GPA so low that we can't be confident they'll complete the coursework?\" and later on with \"Did they get poor grades in subjects core to our program?\" In other words, they don't care about high GPA's but worry about low ones, and they don't care so much about the overall GPA as what your transcript shows about grades in relevant subjects.\n\nSame with test scores. My highly competitive humanities program has no problem admitting people whose quantitative GRE score is in the bottom quartile, but applicants have no shot if their analytical writing score is that low.",

Generally that would be considered a red flag unless you were able to use your advisor for a recommendation and they said \"They're a fabulous student, the thesis doesn't reflect their skills, and I have no doubt they would thrive in your program.\"\n\nA rule of thumb for committees is they don't want to admit someone they have doubts could complete the program.",

My CV was also \\~3.5-4 pages long of all of my other academic achievements (none of it was filler, at the time I had multiple professors take a look to make sure and they had me add items not remove them) and still was rejected from all but my last choice school. Several of my undergraduate professors also looked at my essays to make sure those weren't the reason why either and they still couldn't figure out why I was rejected.\n\nIt honestly can be a crapshoot because it depends on who else is applying, the school's funding for the year, and just general factors that are out of your control.",

When applying, I have found a common theme amongst grad schools that they are looking for: collegiality. Do you have a record of working with others or are your projects independent? That might be it. I stressed collegiality in my statements (ending paragraph or starting paragraph).\n\nFor reference:\nI graduated with a 3.3, 2 NIH program participation\u2019s (4 years total), 3 papers in the pipeline, 8 conferences (+2 more oral presentations), and 3 page CV. Also, minority applicant hear so probably that\u2019s factored in (first-gen). We are comparable.\n\nSurprisingly, I have interviews with 1/2 of the schools I applied to. 1 of which gave me an offer.

There are few papers with more than one author (books might but those tend to be different authors write different chapters that come together to form a scholarly resource). Typically in studio art collaborations are reserved for large projects that aren't feasible for one person to put together (although I do have several of those). I also have experience helping to organize group shows.\n\nLiterally the only thing my professors could figure out is that the schools got candidates with the exact experience/focus they were looking for or that there were just a ton of candidates with similar experience/focus to me. That's kind of what I meant by it being a crapshoot. Depending on the year the one applicant's work with minimal changes could go from being a first round elimination to a top applicant depending on who else also applied. It's especially true when most schools have 5 or fewer open spots per year (I was a finalist for a different program that had 4 per year but they wanted a different focus for that round).",

Did you do anything that is considered atypical?\n\nIm in the biology field, and it seems like altruism is a huge thing in my field, aside from personal aspirations, for admissions decisions, in the context of candidates with comparable credentials. \n\nI think, what set me apart from other applicants is the fact that I trained others in my lab and have a history of working with others. I collaborated with another university outside the US. I think collaborations are typical, but what might not have been was the fact that I give without expectations of receiving back. After seeing university videos (previously inaccessible), they expressed this mentality. \n\nI wonder If there is anything you can do, within or outside academia, that may resonate with the evaluation committee. My housemate is trying to land a job for graphic design and although his work is good, he would stand out as an applicant if he did a more grandiose project. What I'm trying to get at is showing commitment and a fearless mentality for attempting novel things within any field. It feels like everyone is competing for positions using similar outlines for what it takes to get into grad school. I think novelty is highly regarded in consideration of an applicant with a typical resume. \n\nWhat do you think?",
