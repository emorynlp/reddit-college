  "title:": "How stop seeing my professors as parental figures?",
  "text": "I'm wondering if anyone who has also experienced this this has any  insight or advice on dealing with these feelings OR if anyone on the other side (i.e. any professors) would be willing to share their perspective, so I can see things more realistically and be more empathetic and self-aware about my behavior.\n\nI'm basically experiencing strong transference, but with my professors instead of my therapist.\n\nI am resolved to be professional around my professors, and I think I'm doing okay, but sometimes I am not sure whether I am burdening them unintentionally or simply giving off such a desperate, dependent vibe that it makes them uncomfortable.\n\nEven though I try really hard not to bother them, I'm sure it's obvious that I idolize them, and care far too much about their opinion of me. I don't purposely do this but I keeping seeing them as potential parental substitutes and sources of love, and so yearning for a more intimate connection even though I know it's not possible or ethical. I want to be around them pretty much any chance I can get. I hang out in the department a lot, go to departmental events, spend a lot of time trying to excel and impress them with my work, and even got a job as a student assistant to the department admin, mostly just to feel closer to my professors and the department in general. This is probably starting to sound really creepy. I'm sorry.\n\nThis is not an excuse, but I was abused by my parents. I also have several mental illnesses. I am depressed and have been struggling with major clinical depression and anxiety for many years.  I hang on to every kind word and encouraging gesture. I frequently re-read the marginal comments on my papers, or nice emails professors have sent me, if I'm feeling particularly down. Even just being smiled at and told to \"have a nice weekend\" by one of my professors would make my day, as stupid as it sounds.\n\nI know it is totally inappropriate and unfair to put this kind of pressure of my professors, or anyone, really. It is not their job at all to be my parent or care about me as anything more than a student. Yet my affection for them is very persistent and it is sometimes very hard for me deal with the asymmetry of it and realize that I mean so much less to them than they mean to me. I literally love them and want them to love and be proud of me which is just ridiculous.\n\nI'm at a SLAC, and have very small classes, and a small department, so it's a bit more normal to have close relationships. But still, they are meant to be grounded in academic/intellectual achievement, not self-actualization.\n\nI've been told all my life that I'm an extremely sensitive and emotional, and this is true. That is probably why I am drawn to my field (English). I'm constantly having to refocus myself away from the personal and emotional and toward the academic and professional. I feel like I am perpetually trying to hide, hold back, and restrain myself from expressing my enthusiasm and devotion because it's always just a little \"too much.\" My favorite professor once told me that I \"cared too much\" about his class. Another wonderful English professor once told me that she worried that I was too personally enmeshed with *the material*, that I cared too much about the authors themselves and had exaggerated fears about misinterpreting or misunderstanding them.\n\nI know it is unhealthy to idealize people to the extent that I do. I know in my head that they are only human. But my heart does not feel it that way.\n\nI'm in therapy but progress is so slow, if I'm making any at all. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on the matter, if you have any. Even if I accept my feelings as normal and not \"creepy,\" it is still sometimes really distressing. I am always wondering where I stand and whether or not I am being overly effusive. Mostly I feel distressed when I realize the one sided-ness of it all, the lack of reciprocity, even as I know it is impossible. Most people I talk to said it was normal, but that they grew out of this phase, usually before or during college, or that the intensity of their idealization and longing lessened. But at 23, I still feel this stuff as intensely as ever, and maybe even more. I feel hopeless about ever \"growing out\" of it. But I think I ought to stop before I devolve further into self-pity.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "I'm a young professor. Like others, I think your post shows a real thoughtfulness. Self-awareness in and of itself isn't enough to enact meaningful cognitive and behavioral change. One must actually develop strategies and do the slow work of changing. But your willingness to acknowledge the complexity and intensity of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors means you ***are*** making real progress.\n\nSomething I haven't seen asked directly is: **how are your friendships?** Because, as you noted, there's a real asymmetry (both in institutional power and in interpersonal connection) in professor-student relationships. This asymmetry works in tandem with boundaries. While professors do most of the work of delineating and maintaining these boundaries, students also participate in this work. You already know this, which is why you try hard not to reveal the extent of your attachment/projection.\n\nLike teachers, friends also can't replace your parents or erase your history. But they can come a whole lot closer. Kind, supportive, hilarious, quirky friends ***do*** help us self-actualize. They ***do*** help us learn how to self-soothe. They ***do*** help us learn how and when to lean on others. And they ***do*** help us learn how to let others lean on us.\n\nIf you've had difficulty in this area, you should discuss it with your therapist. I'd gently suggest that **fixating on your professors would be a huge obstacle to making or deepening meaningful friendships**. Not only might you unfairly judge your friends in comparison to an idealized version of your professor--you also might feel too embarrassed to admit to your friends how attached you feel to your teachers and why. You don't ever have to disclose anything you don't want to; but shared (keyword: shared) vulnerability is what makes us feel close to people.\n\nYour negative feelings don't just come from thinking that other people don't love or want you. These feelings also arise *because you don't have people* ***truly available*** *for* ***you*** *to love and want.* \n\nReceiving love is amazing; giving it is extraordinary. But giving only feels good if the other person is **available** to accept that love, without you filtering it or changing its shape. Having one without the other will always make you feel empty. If you receive but don't give, you feel like you're living a lie or taking advantage. If you give but don't receive, you feel used and undeserving.\n\nYou're lacking **reciprocity** in intimate relationships, so that's what you need to seek. *You already know you can't get it from us.* When I realize I'm doing something that actively prevents me from getting the thing I say/know I want, I have to ask myself: **am I self-sabotaging because on some level I don't actually believe I deserve this thing?** \n\nBoundaries are meant to protect the professor ***and*** the student. I'd actually contend that healthy professor-student relationships mirror the therapeutic relationship. There are exceptions, but those come later in life. That's because the student--now in their 30s and married with children, for example--has gone through key stages in adulthood. They're no longer impressionable or in awe of their professor.\n\nWhile it may take sometime time to change your thoughts and feelings, changing behaviors is easier. (Not easy, but easier.) Even if you continue to feel certain compulsions (like attending all departmental events or rereading saved emails), as long as you make sure you don't tip over into obsessively contacting professors/their loved ones, lying to/manipulating them, prying into their personal lives, stalking, etc., **you will be okay**. And things will get better. I wish you the best of luck.",

I want to get a better sense of what you expect of me and what I can expect from you going forward\". This allows them to set a boundary that's comfortable for them (as individuals).",

      "text": "I think there's nothing wrong with seeing your profs as parental figures. As long as you realize that 1) you can have more than 2 parental figures easily, and 2) unlike for bio parents, you can choose your parental figures for all other stages in life. There's a name for people like that - mentors. And having mentors is good. And developing a more personal relationship with them isn't bad at all. As another person here answered, there are healthy and unhealthy approaches to it, of course, as to everything in life, but generally, the ideas of mentorship, and cross-generational friendship, are both good ones.\n\nWe are not automatons, we are humans. No one can pursue \"intellectual achievements\" without also being alive, confused, in love, in pain, losing hope, regaining hope etc. It's normal, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. When I organize academic talks at my school, I actually ask speakers to talk not only about their academic work, but also a bit about their personal stories - and more about their failures, hesitations, and confusions, than about their successes. It is tremendously important for students to realize that we all are not well-oiled machines, but vulnerable and often rather fragile humans who just keep getting up and going forward, you know?\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Just wanted to say that I very much identify with what you wrote, and in my case (and with, literally, decades of therapy), I found the source of this to be core feelings of worthlessness. (Yes, from my upbringing, too.)\n\nSo I wanted to suggest \u2014 if this is applicable in your case too \u2014 that if you want to delve right into the heart of the matter, with your therapist\u2019s help, that you read and learn as much in the self-help and psychology literature about self-worth, worthlessness, and how to overcome it.\n\nThe single most helpful thing that I learned along the way about self-worth was this:\n\nImagine a graph, plotting your worth (value) as a human being over the course of your life. Now, imagine that when you were born, you had 1 unit of worth. Then, over the course of your life, you still had exactly one unit of worth. Nothing that happened, nothing you did, could ever change that, no matter how you subjectively felt due to your upbringing.\n\nNow, imagine that for the remainder of your life, you will still continue to have one unit of worth, and when you die, you will still have exactly 1 unit of worth. You don\u2019t have to do anything to earn it, and nothing you can do can earn you any more. It is just there.\n\nWe all have value, no matter our circumstances. We don\u2019t have to look to others to establish, or to gain, or to earn, or to increase that value \u2014 not your parents, not your professors, no one.\n\nI am now in my 50s. It has taken me a long time to learn this and to really feel and believe it. I hope that this can help give you a head start!",

      "text": "This is really common, and as others have said, it's ok to take comfort from close mentoring relationships. Keep going to therapy and paying attention to your instincts about whether your level of devotion to these professors is too much.\n\nSomething that helps me a lot when I feel myself getting too attached to an authority figure is to consider what I would think of them, and of myself, if my feelings were returned. Would I want to be a stereotype, a grad student in a relationship with her professor? Would I still respect a professor who wanted that with me? And even if we were somehow a super normal pair of exceptions to the rule, would I be happy in a close personal relationship where I would forever be junior or second best in work that is important to me?\n\nI know it's hard to do right now, but I think it would also help you to get closer to your peers. Find work or projects or groups that bring you into regular contact with other students, to whom you can get as close as you want. If there are any issues that really speak to you, student activist groups and unions are definitely still meeting right now over email and Zoom. My grad college's writing accountability group continued to check in all summer over Zoom, my department has open coffee breaks. If you don't see something like that that you want to join, maybe you could start one.",

      "text": "Consider reading the legends of Chiron and Asclepius (god of medicine). They are known to be wounded healers. They healed others, and taught others to heal, despite living in pain from their own wounds their whole lives. Both were orphaned at birth, but Chiron was raised by a god (Apollo) and Asclepius was raised by Chiron. They found themselves and made their way in the world under the tutelage of a mentor, not a parent. I think the fact that Asclepius was actually Apollo's biological son and was abandoned by his father (Apollo had other matters to attend to as a god) but left to be raised by a mentor (Chiron) speaks to the sanctity of the mentor-student bond. In many ways, this bond is stronger than a parental bond.\n\n[https://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/KentaurosKheiron.html](https://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/KentaurosKheiron.html#Sagittarius)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron)\n\nSo, people have been idealizing the mentor-student relationship for thousands of years. It may even be the best way to transmit knowledge and values, and, in turn, give a student (e.g., you) meaning in his life. As such, the Hippocratic Oath requires a physician to treat his mentors as he would treat his own parents.\n\n\\> \\[I swear\\] To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of [money to share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership) mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the physician\u2019s oath, but to nobody else.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic\\_Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath)\n\nRest assured that a lot of (wise, accomplished) people feel similarly to you. However, you're right to keep your relationship professional and restrained from creepy. Just find that balance.",

      "text": "I'm late to this post, but thought I could try to comment as someone whose background and circumstances seem similar to yours.\n\nSo, looking back at your account history, I see you've posted some about your history growing up, and I see you've posted in r/BPD. Given that, I want to bring up the idea that perhaps this is part of that idealization cycle or the search for an identity, if you meet either of those criteria. You seem self-aware and mentioned being in treatment; it could be worth thinking through what emotional role these relationships are serving you, how you can meet those needs yourself, and how to navigate those relationships while maintaining the boundaries that are healthy for you and the other person. It seems like you're already on the way there, as far as understanding something is off here and linking it back to your experiences as a child.\n\nWhat also may help you, if you're able to see early signs of you doing this or behaviors that you feel aren't adaptive related to this, is to consciously distance yourself a bit, and to remind yourself what this situation is. I also heavily idealize professors, I think for reasons similar to yours. It's good to remember that this is a person doing their job, and you're one of dozens of students they're taking on at a given time. You should absolutely take something positive from that -- someone believing in and rooting for your success and growth with few conditions -- but it's worth remembering that there's a difference between that and what you're really looking for.\n\nEdit: a word",

      "text": "First of all, this is pretty normal. There are levels of devotion, of course, and your case may be on the more extreme end of the scale, but you\u2019ll find tons and tons of students who have a similar view of their professors, although on average it\u2019s probably milder than what you\u2019re describing here. \n\nIt seems like you have a lot of self awareness and that you\u2019re doing a good job of channeling your feelings in a productive way. Hanging around the department, going to events, being active in class - these are all good things that can further your career. I\u2019m a bit like you, and I channeled my feelings into really engaging with the classes themselves and I always kept my conversations with professors on topic. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time going to events, hanging back after class to talk to the professor, emailing professors or setting up appointments to talk to them about classes or about their research. This has given me so much. In addition to having learnt a ton, it\u2019s also given me a leg-up career-wise. I\u2019m a recent MA graduate, and I currently have two research assistantships that I got because I\u2019d made an good impression (the professors in question approached me directly to ask if I wanted to work with them, I didn\u2019t even know the jobs were available). I also have plenty of references for the PhD application I\u2019m currently working on, and there are professors I know well enough that I feel comfortable asking them to sit down with me and discuss my proposal. It sounds like you\u2019re on the same path, as long as you manage to keep it professional, being devoted can actually be a huge advantage. \n\nHonestly, the thing that worries me most is what you say about being scared of misinterpreting the authors, etc. because this can really hinder your learning. I was an English major, too, and I promise you this is a counter-productive approach. Don\u2019t be afraid to be wrong, and above all don\u2019t be afraid to disagree with your professor. In our field there are not right or wrong answers (there are of course good interpretations and bad interpretations, but we\u2019re not dealing with solid facts here). A text is only imbued with its full meaning when it is read, and you are a reader. Tell your professors what you think the text is saying and how it\u2019s saying it, if they disagree you\u2019ll have a productive discussion and you\u2019ll learn.\n\nYou\u2019ll be fine! Keep going to therapy, keep being smart and self-aware, and you will find a way to manage this!",

None of these things are bad at all, in fact this was a very human and positive experience for all of us that were his students.\n\nWhat OP is describing is the symptom of a much larger underlying problem, and OP is doing the right thing in terms of working it out with a therapist. Shutting out the larger community in favour of a robotic work environment where no one develops close, collegial ties sounds like hell and serves to just make academia more unnecessarily soul-sucking than it already is. It also doesn't address the underlying issues that OP has.",
