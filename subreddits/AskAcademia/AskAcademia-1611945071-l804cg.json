  "title:": "Is it fine to email a Professor at a different university to ask about their work?",
  "text": "Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate who took a seminar last year on an interesting, but extremely niche, sub-topic in my discipline. There is one paper we covered that I have been thinking about on occasion since the course ended and I wanted to get some thoughts from the author on new developments in the field that relate to their paper. However, because this professor does not teach at my university, I'm unsure if it would be rude to contact him unannounced...\n\nWould a formal and polite email along the lines of \"Dear Dr. X., I read some of your work in Seminar Z last year and would like to know more about this or that... would you be able to share your thoughts on this or guide me to some other resources?\"\n\nOnce again, I worry this might be gauche considering this professor has no obligation to me. What are your thoughts? Thanks!\n\nEdit: thank you for all of the kind and helpful answers! I should clarify that the question itself is much more detailed and the above was just an illustration of what I might say after posing the question.",

Would it be totally presumptuous to ask if we could meet? I feel like a lot of people (or at least I) would find it a lot easier just to explain something over Zoom or such (which now, because of rona, we all have), and would be a lot more willing to give up 5-15 minutes to chat with someone than to write a whole long email.\n\nSo if I want a more complete answer, but don't want to burden them with a homework assignment of writing me a whole long response, might it be appropriate to say,\n\n> Hi there, I'm a [whatever]-year at [wherever], I found really interesting your paper on [topic], and was wondering if you could clarify some questions I had, and potentially give me some guidance on pursuing the topic further. Would you have a spare 15 minutes to meet with me over Zoom and discuss this week?\n\nOr something like that? Or would that be too much of an imposition? (And of course, I wouldn't write that exact email, but slightly more fleshed-out, but this is a Reddit comment so w/e)\n\n---\n\nAlso, unrelated: what is a PhD in Business? I don't think I've heard of that before. I know of the MBA, of course (pretty sure every man in my family besides me and my uncle has one), but I didn't realize there was an equivalent PhD program -- or is it a separate thing?",

And then ask to meet some time in the coming month (as a matter of politeness).\n\nI work in a business school. There's not a PhD in business but there are PhDs in marketing, finance, accounting, supply chain, and management. I just list \"business\" in the same general way other people mention \"STEM\".",

They should have a research services department that can do some of the legwork of \"I read this paper, what resources does the library have on this topic?\" and they'll find textbooks, \"the\" papers on it that everybody reads or cites,....  Not as much of a literature review as the material that you'd use to write a literature review.",

Then ask some foundational questions about how they got there to yourself. It\u2019s a great thing to look into others\u2019 work. Get over elevating professors, but do your work before asking questions.",

A lot of professors just ignore most of their emails so don't take it personally if you don't get a response but you might",

Some academics (like me) have to have side jobs to make a living. We are always asked to do free labor. If someone offered to pay me, I'd prob just send an email response and not accept payment, but I would feel pleased that they recognized the value of my time and labor.",
