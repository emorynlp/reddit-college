  "text": "Hi\n\nAfter working for 13 years in my field, I have decided to apply to do my PhD in Social Work. I am trying to figure out what to submit for my writing sample. I can't find any papers from my master's degree, and my current work doesn't allow for the type of writing I need.\n\nAny suggestions???",

Some people may, but it's not really the norm.\n\nOP - if you don't have anything professional that is suitable, then write an essay/paper/report on a topic of your choice to submit. That's considered perfectly acceptable if you don't have something you previously published or received academic credit for.",

We also have a University policy of only commenting on one chapter, so even pre-online submission, I'd never have a final full draft. I'm considered odd for keeping the hard copy submissions for ten years, frankly (just sent 20 undergrad dissertations and a dozen Masters ones from 2011 for shredding, plus 3 theses from the same year) - they take up a lot of space!  I did consider keeping them, now we don't use hard copy, and I won't need the space for future years as a result: but really, even one year's worth takes up space, and that's already at a serious premium. \n\nDo you keep everything indefinitely then? We don't have the server space, apart from anything else.  How often have you had requests for past student work? It may be a location-specific thing also, perhaps?",
