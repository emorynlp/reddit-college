Do they write about and research multiple topics simultaneously?  Is it easier because they are experts and familiar with the relevant literature in their field?",

My experience with publishing has been nothing but a nightmare. I tried to get my masters research published at 3 different journals before finally giving up. My first manuscript from my PhD I submitted over a year ago and was rejected twice. Now it's been over 5 months under review at a third journal without a word. Luckily my second manuscript got published a few months ago (i.e. second one written, first one published). And I have a third manuscript that I've been waiting over two months for my adviser to give approval on....just boggles my mind. It's like pulling teeth just to get my co-authors to respond, let alone give permission to submit. Then I know I'll probably wait another 4 months for any word at all from the journal, and potentially have to submit somewhere else after all of that. And yet everyone else seems to just coast through the whole process. I really really hate publishing.",

      "text": "I'm  a co author of close to 400 papers. But I'm nothing, e.g., to somebody like  Andy Fabian with 1200 papers (I know that he has contributed significantly to a very large fraction of them...)\n\nI'm working in astrophysics and and I am a member of several astroparticle physics collaborations. In some of them it is not possible not to be on a paper since all publications are done by everybody in the collaboration (to be fair, I spend about 3 months a year full time doing service for these collaborations, so this is a lot of behind the scenes work and the papers are my \"payment\", so to speak). These papers count for about half of my refereed publications, with between 15 and 3700 co-authors (yes, I'm a co author of [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..12A/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..12A/abstract) , and I am proud that I did manage to get a few sentences revised before submission ;) ).\n\nThe remaining 200 are led by people in my research group or by close collaborators. I have on average between 5 and 10 PhD students in the group, and there are another 15-20 or so PhD students who are advised by the 5 groups that we have close collaborations with, in the sense of weekly telephone conferences, lots of exchange of people between the groups, joint theory/observation projects and so on. This gives another 10-15 or so papers per year. I've been in the business for more than 20 years, so it's easy to get to that number. \n\nBefore you ask: Yes, my group is larger than those of my collaborators, which has to do with the different structure of academic research in Germany than in the US or some other European countries. The number of senior academics in my field in Germany is fairly small, while the per capita research expenditure  in astrophysics in Germany is comparable to other economically strong countries - for example, there are only about 100 university professors in astronomy/astrophysics in Germany (i.e., associate and full profs). This is less than the number of professor-level astronomers that you find in Boston and in the greater DC area. So, while in my field a typical prof in the US has 1-2 graduate students, I have 5x more. As a result, the number of my first author publications sucks compared to people in the US. I manage one in 3-4 years, if things go well, but I have contributed tons of text and ideas to the papers led by my students, have rewritten and streamlined their texts, and, yes, I can tell you what we did in all of these papers. The typical number of co-authors here is between 5 and 20. In many I've written a quarter of the text or so, however.\n\nSo, yes, once you're a senior academic, getting more papers is easier since the fraction of time one gets to contribute higher level ideas goes up compared to the \"work in the trenches\" (I spend much less time on my own data analysis or theoretical work, which I really miss, but because of the experience I have, I spend much more time to trouble shoot larger problems and to work on text than my students)\n\nFinally, one shouldn't discount the experience one collects over the years. I've seen most problems that my students encounter before so I am usually in a good position to point them in the right direction. And I've structured and written significant parts of a large number of papers. This means that the parts of the manuscripts that I contribute get through fewer revisions by the coauthors than things written by students. Productivity does indeed go up - and it would be far higher if there weren't the distractions of administration, writing grants, and teaching (I like the latter, I don't like the former, but I spend more than half of my time on them).",

      "text": "I\u2019m 21 years into publishing and number 118 in Scopus (add in book chapters, proceedings and other scholarly peer-reviewed works, it\u2019s around 130). In the beginning, I led most of the efforts (collected/collated data, did the analyses and wrote the first drafts). In time, I proposed research that allowed me to hire statisticians and post-docs; this magnified my reach immensely. Further, I collaborated extensively, in working groups and other broad collaborations. Thus, as my career matured, I went from mostly First Authored publications to a mix of Last Authored and Middle Authored publications. Some don\u2019t value middle-authored works, but I don\u2019t need to worry about tenure and such, so I work in collaborations where I can address the topics I want to address. In recent years I\u2019ve averaged 10+ peer-reviewed journal articles per year; I\u2019ve averaged, however, about 1 first-authored publication per year. The problem that frustrates me now is that I\u2019m less a researcher than I am a research manager. I want to collect, analyze and write, but anymore my time is spent on hiring, supervision, budgeting and proposal writing. Something has to go if I\u2019m to take a bigger role in publishing. I haven\u2019t figured out how to get back to it.\n\nEdit: I have about 3 main focal areas of research, each subdivided further. It\u2019s, frankly, too much to be an expert, another reason I\u2019d like to pare down. But anymore, it seems being a jack-of-all-trades is valued perhaps more so than having a deep well of expertise. I\u2019d like to be globally renowned but my partners and funders need someone flexible enough to meet their information needs.",
