  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI want to apply for a few postdoc positions in Psychology/ Health in Germany and was wondering whether anyone had any advice (or even an example to share; in German or English) of what a good German academic CV should look like? \n\nIn the UK, it is common to give quite a bit of detail about specific analyses that you performed or studies that you managed and what you achieved/the skills you gained. From the very few examples that I could find online, it seemed like this is not really the case in Germany and people seem to only name the positions they had and the rough topic(s) they researched?\n\n Is this correct, or have I just been looking at poor examples? And do you need to evidence your specific skills anywhere?\n\nAny help would really be appreciated! :)",

      "text": "I have evaluated a couple of German applications for research positions and grants. The one thing that struck me as super weird was that they all included where they went to school K-12 and upper secondary. I just assumed that it is a German thing. It did baffle me, quite honestly. Who cares what you did as a child and teenager if you are applying for a professorship in your 50s???\n\nAnother \"cultural\" thing that is vividly apparent in this and similar subs is how differently letters of recommendation are used. (Where I am at it is basically a non-thing.) I remember one application process where I was one of the evaluators where the American applicant had 20+ letters of recommendation full of superlatives, while the Finnish applicant just had a brief notice that, \"Yes, this person was employed here\". The two were on a similar level research- and teaching-wise. (I don't remember who got the chair.)\n\nJust my 0.02. Hopefully, you get more insights from German Redditers!",

          "text": "Yes, the traditional German CV has all your schools on it from the very beginning. I agree this does not make a lot of sense once you get into the later stages of your career, so people usually have their highschool diploma (Abitur) as the earliest entry. When I was taught how to write a CV in highschool about 15 years ago, people also still included the names and professions of their parents (!), but that's not in fashion anymore.\n\nHaving said that, research institutions are certainly accustomed to receive applications in a more international style. For a PostDoc position, people usually expect to receive a CV of 2 pages or 3 at maximum (the list of publications is separate). \n\nAbout the brief notice instead a full letter of recommendation, that is probably due to data protection.",

Do you know by any chance if usually, any detail would  be given on the topics researched while holding a specific position, or the tasks undertaken while being on a committe? or is it more common to just list these without any additional description?",
