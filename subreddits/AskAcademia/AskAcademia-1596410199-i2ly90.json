  "title:": "Taking two years off in the middle of a PhD to have a baby",
  "text": "I am a 2nd year female PhD student in the United States, pursuing a degree in chemistry. I am having a baby with my husband. He has a well paying job so financially I can afford to be a stay at home mom for a few years after the baby is here.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask the department to take two years off so I can stay at home with the baby until it's old enough to go to daycare? Is this something people do? The alternative would be mastering out and after the two years are up either reapplying to a different program or moving to industry.\n\nI don't know any female students in my department who have been pregnant, so I have no idea if that's an acceptable thing to ask about or if they'll just laugh and say hell no.\n\nFor the record, both my PI and the department in general are usually very helpful and understanding.",

It is making the whole phd process pretty long, but the timing is right for my family and my supervisors are supportive. Personally 2 years would have felt too long. It was hard enough going back after a year. But everyone is different.",

      "text": "Graduated from a PhD program in the US and I've never heard of that. Honestly, people in our program had enough trouble getting and balancing a basic maternity leave (e.g., a few weeks-months) without it impacting their career too much. I think it depends on what your ideal career path is, how intense your program is, and how your PI and department handle these sorts of situations. I could see taking a term off (or a summer and fall term, for example, or spring + summer) at most. In addition, when going on maternity leave, folks in our lab would still agree to do some work on maternity leave (e.g., reviewing manuscripts they were co-author on, doing any R&Rs that came back on their pubs, etc.). I just can't imagine taking two years off wouldn't significantly impact your trajectory or motivation.\n\nEdit: why is the option to leave your program for 2 years or indefinitely? Maybe you can work out a flexible work schedule after maternity leave (e.g., come to campus 3 days a week). Many post-docs or students in our lab would either have a nanny (shared with other kids) or had family watch one or two days a week. If your husband can also have a flexible work schedule (e.g., 4 days a week, 10 hours a day + a day off), you could minimize the cost of child care.",

You can absolutely take full PTO and not work during it if it\u2019s important to you, but allowances such as editing papers that come out during that time because you\u2019re a co-author, or completing a revise and resubmit on your own manuscript isn\u2019t really taking advantage of you- it\u2019s actually more helpful to you than anyone else. You could be taken off those manuscripts after all. Or if you\u2019re an assistant professor, you could work harder upon your return to make up for that lost productivity, etc. So I think for each person, they need to decide for themselves how to balance maternity leave with their career trajectory and decide what barriers they are willing to draw.",

In some places they now start to acknowledge that you \"officially\" had time off and therefore extend deadlines or change how they view your accomplishments during that time, but there are still institutions who view it as a time without productivity. There still is an incentive to keep working, since you still want to have as many publications/grants/etc as possible and especially grants or scholarships might only start after your leave ends, so you benefit from applying during your leave to benefit from them quicker once you get back to work.  \n\nPlus, intrusive questions like \"are you done\" are still common or people just plain say that you can't be serious about science if you had kids (usually men high in their career who had a supportive wife that took care about everything while they kept working).\n\nThe big main problem in academic really is that your career is looked at in a few numbers (number publications, citations, secured funding, ...), which means to stay competitive you need to get as much of those as possible in as little time as possible. So the incentive to overwork is extremely high and the assumption that you can't be competitive (or serious about staying in academia) without it is widespread, even though a lot of people definitely hurt their productivity by working too long hours.",

Maybe get the Masters degree now and then take leave, initially for six months or a year with the possibility of extending it if needed.  There should be no need to make all of the decisions now, so get information and defer the decisions until you need to make them.  Take full advantage of whatever flexibility the university will give you.  But getting the Masters first is a good idea no matter what, as you have no idea what the future will bring.",

My kid is awesome but he\u2019s a lot to handle so we have him at childcare three days a week at the moment and he absolutely loves it too. Happy mum, happy bub, happy family :)",

As a TT physicist, I'd imagine that your talking about relief only from your teaching duties - which comprise roughly 25% percent of your assignment.  I'm an assoc. prof. in physics and that's how it works here.\n\nEven then, 1-2 years seems optimistic.  I'd recommend looking closely at the sick leave accrual rules rather than listening to someone with hazy memories of the rules that trying to recruit you.  For example, where I am, you get 4 hours sick leave every biweekly pay period.  Effectively, that means you accumulate a week of leave each semester that you work.  There are about 20 weeks per semester, so you'd need to work 20 semesters (10 years!) to get a full semester off.  What saves person in a typical physics department is that they're probably only trying to get 25% off (or some similar fraction) so it takes around 2.5 years to accumulate enough leave.  They'll still be expected to keep up with research and committee work.  If your teaching is 33% of your duties now you need to save up sick leave for 3.5 years... etc.\n\nFor someone with only teaching duties, things are much worse.  For example, my partner is in year 5 of a TT position that is all teaching (no research) and their leave is only enough to cover 4 out of her 5 courses for one semester.",

It's only unpaid if you want it to.\n\nYes, other countries in better in that regard. Canada, where I'm from, allows you to go on unemployment during your parental leave (3 months go for a person who physically give birth, 9 is parental and can be split between either parent as they see fit). The payout is 55% of your income up to the insurable threshold (54K), for 50 weeks. So that's the princely sum of 28.7K for the year, taxable, and you have to reimburse some of it if your income exceeds 66K for the year and you've ever used EI within the last 10 years (which will probably be the case - [Canadian faculty salaries for assistant professors are in the 80-100K range](https://www.macleans.ca/education/comparing-the-average-salaries-of-canadian-professors-in-2018/))\n\nIt's better, surely, but it's not amazing.

A lot relies on work and life balance as well as support from spouse.  I've give birth as a postdoc (so no teaching or classes) but I've tried to maintain work hours and home hours.  And I found a reliable, affordable daycare where our baby goes to while we work.  But it also depends on how your PI is as a mentor and person how well you can do it.

      "text": "I'm pregnant and in my fifth/last year of a Phd and my plan is to move back near my parents for support when the baby comes, finish my Phd remotely, take the three months paid maternity leave we are offered, and still just finish on time.\n\nI know it is doable because my mom got pregnant with me during her fourth year of her Phd and still finished it on time. I think when you're later in the game it can be done.  \n\nAnother girl in my department had a kid when she started and then got pregnant again in her third year. She also just took the three months maternity leave and got right back into things, and somehow she is managing to finish a year early! And she doesn't even have any extra family support other than her husband. \n\nSo I don't think you need to take two years off or master out, unless you a) have no access to familial support b) have no access to daycare or are unwilling to use it (maybe thanks to covid, I agree that is very reasonable) c) don't have enough money for a nanny and d) have no flexibility to your schedule/no ability to work at home. \n\nThat last point is another key factor. With my working remotely everything I do will be from home, so I will just take turns on childcare duties between me, my husband, and my mom, with me being the most flexible one who will have to work around their schedules. \n\nAnother option is, check if your university has unpaid leaves as well. We have a set up where you can take an unpaid leave for a year here.  So if that's an option that plus maternity leave (if you have it) might be a safer combination than taking off a whole two years. Though I don't think taking two years would ruin your career or anything, it just might make things a bit harder.",

I used the former when I received an external fellowship for the year, but that's because I wanted to continue to pick up my fellowship when I returned. If your institution has something similar, you might be able to string the two leaves together. Are you still planning on receiving the funding when you come back? If so, that might be a point of contention. If not, then you could likely figure something out with your department.",
