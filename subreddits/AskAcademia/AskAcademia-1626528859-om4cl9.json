  "title:": "How do you truly feel about being e-mailed by prospective PhD students?",
  "text": "Hi All, \n\nI\u2019m an R1 PhD student in the social sciences (with a business focus). It\u2019s customary, and often encouraged, for prospective graduate students to contact (i.e., email) potential faculty members they\u2019d be interested in working with. \n\nI understand this is also extremely common in other fields as well. Nevertheless, we don\u2019t take the time to inquire about the feelings/emotions evoked by this tradition. \n\nSo, how do you feel when you\u2019re contacted by potential students? Is there something that you typically like to see in these emails? Is there something that absolutely pisses you off? Please share as I\u2019d love to be able to provide some feedback and context for upcoming applicant cohorts. Thank you!",

However, no department in which I've worked has it helped applicants. Only the DGS and Admissions Committee had any say at all in either funding or admission decisions. These were all large Big-10 departments that each year had 200-300 applicants and admitted about a dozen. Small departments or departments with a much better admission/applicant ratio it may help. \n\nNow, that said, I was DGS for 10 years, Grad College Dean for 8, and served for many more years on admissions committees.  Except maybe in some very small U's (and I mean the U, not the department), don't bother emailing (or snail mailing) the Dean. Those tend to be read and deleted by the Dean's secretary. \n\nBUT, if you can find who is on the admissions committee it won't hurt at all to email them, If you know who is the DGS, it won't hurt to email him or her. Where I've worked we are legally required to add such emails to your application file so that all of the other persons involved in the admission and funding decision process also can read them.  FINALLY, where I've worked on admissions or as DGS, if I got an email saying that \"I want to work with Professor X because... and these are my qualifications that may not be obvious from my application...\" I would share that information with Professor X to get their input. \n\nSo, this is my suggestion for large schools like the Big-10.  It may well be different (and I expect it is) at small schools regardless of presage or private/public status.\n\nNow, as an anecdote that may or may not be useful in this question, while DGS I once had a colleague who, while on sabbatical at a U in Germany, promise admission and funding to some students at the U where he was teaching. The students never applied but showed up at his office one day announcing their presence and demanding admission and funding. Against my better inclinations we did admit them, but we did not provide any funding at all. They did get partial funding (and tuition) because the professor who did this had a research grant. However, though he agreed to it rather than having the kids deported, this about exhausted his grant money even giving the kids half funding .  So, why do I give this anecdote? Things can be flexible, but don't count on it.\n\nTL/DR: It probably doesn't hurt to email a potential advisor, but also it may not help Be polite. Be brief. Tell them things that add to what is in your application rather than just repeating what already is known.",

I got to talk to the PI and discuss projects and general stuff in the field, and I think that definitely helped in writing the SOPs. \n\nAlso seems pretty important to know who you could be working with before you commit to the programme, even if you have rotations first. If there\u2019s only X people in your area and you don\u2019t like any of them personally then you want to save your money and time and not apply.\n\nAnd it\u2019s especially worth it when it doesn\u2019t have a clear downside. Either your emails get you what I\u2019ve mentioned or they\u2019re ignored. If people are being moved to the bottom of the pile because they emailed, that\u2019d be pretty important info they should have beforehand.\n\nEdit: and it'd be nice if individual profs made their preference clear too. Maybe you can't easily change what's written on the prospie pages, but you can definitely add it to your faculty profile page. At least then you'll know if the applicants bothered to read your page or not.",

In the more coursework heavy traditions in the US, at least the first several years are going to be dedicated to common course works, quals, exams, etc, and the actual dissertation only comes after all those initial steps are over. It is also often the case that students only get a clear idea of the topic they want to pursue after going through all those steps first.

Seems more like a business.\n\nBut otoh I just watched an interview with a North American prof talking about what prospective students get his attention when they contact him. He was picky about who he chose and made it clear who should and shouldn\u2019t solicit him based on their proposals, etc. Advisor-student relationships are mentorships and the advisor vouches for the student and helps get them in that research community. I\u2019d be surprised if it was mostly just \u201cthe student got assigned to me and we just happened to get along really well\u201d. If nothing else, I don\u2019t think powerful and influential professors would accept that kind of work arrangement with their employer. They are generally very choosy about who they will work with.

This indicates a lack of interest in the mechanics of grad school when it comes from someone who has an MS, less so for undergrads certainly.

      "text": "In my field, profs have no say in who is admitted unless they happen to be on the admissions committee that year. And admit rates are super-low. So there is no point in my responding to an email; they likely won't get in, and if they do, they will likely choose to go somewhere else, and even if they got in and accepted the offer, what are the chances they will still be interested in working with me after a couple of years when we all know students' interests evolve?\n\nSo, sorry to say it's basically spam. The students should probably know their audience, and this will be field-specific. I mean, that's fine, I don't hate it - but it definitely gets annoying if someone repeatedly emails, and at best is mildly annoying and gets ignored.\n\nWorse is when they email a long list of profs using cc rather than bcc, or write assuming the wrong gender....\n\nEdit: AFTER admissions, it's a completely different story, and I'm happy to talk with potential students. But before admissions, why bother?\n\nEdit 2: For clarity (as I got downvoted), they have <1% chance of being admitted due to limited funding being available and I have 0 say over it. Anytime something is not at all under your control, it's frustrating, that's why it's important to know your audience and disciplinary norms. Out of the people who email me, the typical person probably has a <0.1% chance because they are signaling they don't know the discipline.\n\nVery different in a bio lab from what I hear, or any other place where your future supervisor actually has control in admissions.\n\nOTOH, if someone wants advice about the discipline *more generally*, *NOT* at my institution, then generally I have a phone conversation with them if they approach it right, to give advice on how to apply more broadly (as they may apply to dozens of schools). But that's not people who get in touch with me saying they want to work with me specifically because they are just deluded and what they're asking is something I have no control over.",
