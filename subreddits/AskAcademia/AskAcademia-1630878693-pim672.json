  "text": "I\u2019m from the US, looking at UK universities. I see several MSc master\u2019s degrees. I\u2019ve never heard of them. If I applied, got in, graduated, then put \u201c\\[university name\\] \\[years\\] \\[GPA\\] MSc in \\[my major\\] . . . would people who see my resume regard the MSc as a true/real master\u2019s degree?\n\nAlso, instead of typing \u201cMSc,\u201d could I just write \u201cMaster\u2019s in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d on my resume?\n\nI don\u2019t know if US people in particular would consider an MSc as good as a Master of Arts or Masters of Science degree.\n\nPlease enlighten me (you guys, this is a genuine question, please do not fault me for not knowing the answer to this)\n\nis the MSc degree viewed as inferior to an MS degree??",

Your diploma will probably have the full degree name spelled out \"Masters of Science in ......\". The abbreviation is up to you  to choose. Also, most people will know MS and MSc both stand for Masters of Science so it isn't really a big deal which abbreviation you use.",

Note that many UK programs combine an undergrad and masters-level postgraduate degree into 1 credential (e.g., MEng in engineering).\n\nHow good it is would be no different from comparing any other 2 postgraduate masters degrees, and would depend on the quality and content of the programme. I note that it can sometimes be easier to get into an MSc after undergrad than to go the undergrad+masters combined route.",
