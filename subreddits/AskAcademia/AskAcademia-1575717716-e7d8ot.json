  "text": "I'm expecting to have my first journal paper from my PhD accepted soon. Is it normal to feel like I don't want to tell anyone once it's confirmed in case they read it and find a lot of mistakes? I'm scared I'm accidentally a fraud, rather like when you go through airport security and are scared that you accidentally packed 3kg of cocaine and an AK47. I guess feeling this way is like imposter syndrome?",
