  "text": "Hello everyone, I could use some advice/guidance. FYI, full-time assistant professor in Year 3.\n\nI just received my department committee evaluation for my reappointment, and it appears (convincingly) that I won't be reappointed.\n\nAt this point, I don't want to come back to this institution - it's a toxic, hostile work environment, and department politics are overwhelmingly negative.\n\nI'm wondering how to best set myself up for a future position with a different institution. I'm convinced that I should resign before I'm fired. But when? Is it a red flag to future employers (universities) if I resign in April 2022 right before my termination? Or should I resign asap? During winter break?\n\nI'm just looking to set myself up for better employment long-term, and am unsure of the best next steps.\n\nGuidance much appreciated.",

I love academic podcasts and I want others to be aware they exist! I listen to mine on Apple Podcasts. (Sorry for formatting, mobile)\n\nThe Hello PhD Podcast has many wonderful episodes on how to excel in academia. Here are a couple episodes I found that are about leaving academia and making that decision.\n\nEpisode 078: Knowing when to leave academia\n\nEpisode 027: The road more traveled: stepping off the tenure track\n\nI swear there\u2019s also an episode interview of someone who unexpectedly didn\u2019t get tenure (I believe he stayed in academia after that), I just can\u2019t seem to find the episode.\n\nThe Surviving Academia Podcast has lots of good episodes on how to succeed, but still has a few about leaving academia. Here are a few.\n\nEpisode 18: Job market materials\n\nEpisode 13: Those that quit\n\nThe Recovering Academic Podcast has many great episodes for finding yourself, your skills, and your new career goals for those leaving academia.\n\nThe Cheeky Scientist Podcast is for scientists who are leaving academia and are facing many brand new challenges.\n\nThe Agile Academic Podcast is geared toward women in academia, and talks a lot about self care, self-identity, balance, and passion in academia. This one is not as closely related to the topic of figuring out what to do if you\u2019re not granted tenure, but it could give you some insights in how others process \u2018what it means to be a scientist/to be successful\u2019 and other important (semi-related) ideas.",

If 2, you could make the argument your skills were a mismatch for the type of institution/institutional culture, but be very selective about your letter writers. If more toward the 3 end of the scale, best to retool for another career.",

      "text": "Don't quit, do start looking. I've been on far too many hiring committees over the years and will admit that it's harder for people who had unsuccessful runs at a prior institution. But it's *much* harder to get a job when you don't have one already...far better to be applying from within an institution where you have an email, letterhead, and mailing address that says \"I've already been hired elsewhere.\"\n\nWhen applying you'll need to explain, first in your cover letter, why you are looking for another position. I'd advise limited honesty-- it's OK to say a position wasn't a good fit, you want to be closer to family/nature/city/dog parks/whatever, that your partner wants to relocate, that you feel a different type of institution is better fit, etc. I would *not* say \"I'm on the market because I know I'm not going to get tenure here\" unless \"here\" is Harvard or some equivalent known for not tenuring junior faculty.\n\nOne of the hardest things for people in your position is securing references. At my school we will not-- *can not* \\-hire anyone without a reference from their current or immediate past employer due to HR requirements. So even if someone was fired we'd have to contact their last supervisor, verify they were employed there, and ask the same questions we'd ask of any other reference. (We might not care what they say, if we knew the circumstances, but HR requires the call.) That said, you don't have to provide the chair or dean at your current school as a reference; use a faculty friend but make sure they have seen you teach in person (if you're applying for teaching jobs). You can use other professional references as needed but *really* put work into securing at least one from your current institution in your final year(s) there if you can.\n\nAnother reality is that it's generally easier to go down a tier in prestige/pay after a tenure denial. People I know who have been denied tenure or had a negative third year review *usually* end up at a lower-ranked institution for their next position. Not always, and not for publishing/grant superstars, but for Normal People that's often what happens. So cast a wide net when you go on the market. \n\nIn the meanwhile, build those references, start/keep publishing, teach well (for good final semester evals when you go), and start thinking about how you'll explain your situation in your cover letters because hiring committees *will* want to know why you're leaving-- if you don't tell them they'll assume the worst and likely toss your applications. So state it in your own terms and make it read like a problem with fit (even if you hint at a bad environment, etc.) since the hiring school will not be interested in someone whose application makes them think either 1) this person got fired, there must be something wrong with them, or 2) this person is going to be trouble for us. Because after all, you'll be competing against blank slates, new Ph.D.s with limited experience but strong references who the search committee/department chair assume can be mentored in to their culture...which is harder to do with someone who has \"experience.\"",
