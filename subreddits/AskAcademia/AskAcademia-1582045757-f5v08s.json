  "text": "Each and everyone of them is godawful. \"Greetings!\" \"Rejoice!\" \"Eminent!\" I thought the point of them is that they preyed on either grad students who don't know much better and were desperate to increase their publication count - so why has so godawful language in them?\n\nI just got this today:\n\n>Dear Professor,\n>Hope I am not irritating you with my email. If yes sorry for the inconvenience caused by my end.\n>\n>I am [NAME] working as a manager of Scholarly Journal of [SUBJECT] (SJ[S]) sends invitation to eminently like you to help me in growth of my Journal. I know that you are getting hundreds of solicited email and got fed up with the invitations that you have got.\n>\n>But, please be in my position understand the problem I am facing as nowadays it is becoming very hard to get trust of authors. Trust me in my efforts, I will believe in you that you are the person who illuminate my hope for my journals future.\n>\n>Today I am leaving my desk in a small hope that tomorrow will be my turning point for me, and my journal and I get novel article from you. Please help me in rejoicing this day.\n\nDear lords, I'm pretty sure soon they're going to enclose picture of their family that only get fed if I turn in a 2-page opinion piece by Friday. \n\nDoes this work on anyone? I understand they spam everyone - wouldn't it make sense to get one good version of the spam message and re-use it? How come in the whole universe of scam journals and conferences, not one has managed to write something halfway professional? Hell, can't they just lift it from a legitimate journal and just change the names, if they're that inept at the language?",

The people \"presenting\" know they're just getting a free flight, 2 days per diem, and 1 night hotel at the destination, so they can book a few more nights on their own dime to get a vacation. The conference organizers know they just need enough of an agenda to not be investigated by the IRS. The companies know that they're providing their highest performing employees with a tax-free bonus in the form of an all-expenses paid vacation to a tourist destination.",

Knowing the strict, restricted and prolonged policies about experimenting on humans without/before approvals from the authorities (W.H.O and the government), we have been able to rally round both male and female individuals voluntarily. **These individuals are either depressed, suicidal or very poor and are all willing to risk or and lose their lives just for a temporal taste of good living, happiness or satisfaction**. All healthy and within the age ranges of 21 to 55 years.  \n   If you have a need to run test on human subjects but can\u2019t handle the possible backlash of ignoring policy protocols and can\u2019t stand the time procedures require.  We are here to help you out in a very strict, discreet, virtually untraceable and secure way of providing you your needs. \n  If interested in our services, make an equivalent of 1,000 dollars (0.13615  BTC) down payment into the bitcoin wallet provided below, this is non refundable and proof of seriousness and commitment. Then send a screen shot of the transaction confirmation to this email. Afterward\u2019s within two working days, you will be contacted via a more secure medium with further information\u2019s.\n[URL TO A BLOCKCHAIN]\nN.B:  For more discretion. We advice that you open a new email and use that to contact us. Below are some emails addresses that don\u2019t need any form of confirmation and can\u2019t be traced back to you.

      "text": "In many parts of the world academic careers are assessed by publications in English language international journals. So many people who have not had the opportunity to learn English to an appropriate level are forced into direct competition with native speakers of English. This system particularly disadvantages people from poorer family backgrounds, and I don't feel comfortable laughing at their English. Formal and acceptable workplace English in many Commonwealth countries is also very different to that in USA and Europe, and I would urge tolerance of these differences. Let's spend our time fixing the system to make it more fair and inclusive instead. If our publishing system truly worked for everyone these predatory journals would go out of business.",
