  "text": "If your institution normally reviews tenure/reappointment files internally, have any of you successfully petitioned for your file to be externally reviewed?\n\nIf so, on what basis did you petition for an external review? The qualification (or lack there of) of the department committee? Conflict of interest? \"Politics?\"\n\nThank you in advance for sharing.",

It\u2019s possible there\u2019s something in place at some universities, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve seen. In general, beyond the outside referees, I think that any kind of external appeal would simply be going back on the job market and getting someone else to hire you. \n\nHonestly, it seems a bit weird to think that some outside body would have the authority to tell a university whom it has to provide a position for life.",
