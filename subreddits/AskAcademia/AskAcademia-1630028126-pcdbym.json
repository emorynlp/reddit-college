  "title:": "HELP! Accidental plagiarism in thesis",
  "text": "I'm absolutely terrified that I've ruined my academic career. I submitted my thesis last month and just realized that I copied about 6 sentences next to each other almost word-for-word from a paper in my introductory chapter in my thesis. This was completely inadvertent, I was summarizing the literature that had been done on my topic and copied those sentences as a note for a section of the summary but completely forgot to change them. My entire thesis is 350 pages but I'm now afraid that this accident will ruin me. Do I say anything? Am I screwed here? I cannot correct the thesis now. I did cite the paper it came from, and the paper is open acceess under a creative commons license, if that matters. I know this isn't good and I truly did not mean for this to happen but now I'm terrified.",

      "text": "You have the right attitude. Mistakes happen. You at least referenced the paper, just neglected to paraphrase. You are fine.\n\nI am a professor that advises graduate students. If I was your advisor I would have caught this because we run all theses through an originality check. But if somehow it made it through to submission then I would just tell you not to worry as long as there is not a pattern of this in the thesis. It is only in the intro chapter, right? Nothing to worry about.\n\nNext step is to turn your thesis into a publication or two. If you do that then anyone interested in your work will read the journal article rather than your thesis.\n\nI know you worked hard on your thesis and you are probably very proud! And you should be. But the truth is that theses are rarely read.\n\nI would be surprised if this ever causes a problem for you.",

          "text": "I appreciate your response, it really, really, helped me mentally. I truly did not mean for this to happen. Unfortunately my thesis never went through an originality check like what normally does when you submit to a journal. It is only that one section of the intro chapter that has the issue, the rest are all my original research chapters which have already been published. I do plan on turning the intro into a review paper, but will definitely change that section before I submit to a journal. I still feel shitty about this, but trying to correct it would likely cause all sorts of additional issues.",

This is exactly why. \n\nHave you done your viva/defence? If not, presumably you will need to do minor corrections anyway, couldn't you fix it then? If you can't change the thesis I think you're going to have to live with the fact it could come back and bite you. However, it's a tiny element of a very large body of work, it's really unlikely to be spotted and assuming you haven't accidentally plagiarised other bits by cutting and pasting I can't see anyone retracting your PhD over this. If you get caught out, just own it and apologise. Shit happens.",

In reaching out to others I\u2019ve learned mistakes are very common and hardly corrected. This is very minor compared a mistake in a data analysis, for example\u2026which I should also warn you happens all the time. Many scholars I know refuse to read their work again after publishing because they will inevitably find things they wish they had done or said differently. One thing I have learned is that it\u2019s possible to read something too much to where you can\u2019t see your own mistakes. Don\u2019t let this consume you though. I was paralyzed after finding a coding mistake in my dissertation. Trust me, it will pass.",

It is highly unlikely that anyone else will discover it, but *should* that happen, the consequences could be serious. However, if you report it yourself, the only consequences should be the hassle associated with dealing with it. That\u2019s what I would do.",

Because you didn't quote the sentences, you plagiarized. The question is how serious it is, and that is where intent is considered. If someone came forward and explained what you explained here, I would consider it a minor problem to be corrected in some way by updating the thesis or issuing a corrigendum or something. I know our former Graduate Dean very well and he would be equally sympathetic.\n\nI can't speak for the anyone in your university, because there \\*are\\* idiots out there, but I do know a lot of other senior administrators and none of the ones I know would make a big deal out of this if you came forward and explained what happened.",
