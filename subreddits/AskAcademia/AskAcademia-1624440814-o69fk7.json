  "title:": "Professor is either developing dementia or burnt out...",
  "text": "An older professor in our group has always had a very rude character but lately she's been super weird. I've cc'd her in an email to a collaborator about a data transfer and she replied: \"why are you asking him how to handle him the data?? I don't understand!! Didn't I tell you to handle him the data?\". When I asked her what I should present to an online meeting that was about to happen in 6 days she organized she replied \"what on earth are you talking about?\". She had no idea there was a meeting...\n\nI talked to the people she's the PI of and they're desperate. In the last 6 months she's been constantly sending them incoherent emails with contradictory request, if the text even made sense at all. She refuses face to face meetings (both her and her staff have been fully vaccinated for more than 4 months). They've also told me that... In most of these rambling emails she keeps writing \"I don't understand\". A sentence she hasn't ever used before. And all of this of course results in huge delays in all of the projects.\n\nShe's probably got some huge issues... We seriously suspect dementia (she's the PI of a team that studies Alzheimer's disease) or maybe just a burnout due to pandemic stress...  And... How do we tactfully deal with this? What exactly can be done about this?",

      "text": "Sorry for the long answer, but I have been in a similar situation. My graduate advisor was older, and had always been famously difficult to work with. While prickly and not great at communicating, the first few years were managable. During the last two years of my degree, she became unbelievably difficult to work with. She would disappear for weeks at a time and when she resurfaced she would send incoherent emails, she never provided any feedback on research and clearly was not keeping up with the literature, she would miss important deadlines and come up with wild, implausible excuses as to why - a couple of times I went to her house (she lived alone), and I found her front door open, or other things very out of place. Lots of concerning things, and I firmly believe she had dementia. She ended up retiring before I finished my degree (while I was doing my dissertation research abroad, and she didn't even officially tell me) and I finished with her as my chair but as an emeritus professor. No one ever directly addressed her health, but I had multiple meetings with my other committee members and department chair before defending where it was made clear to me that she would not be an obstacle in me finishing my degree. I also had committee members tell me they would step in and write letters of recommendation (it was not *directly* addressed as to why I would need that) and other such offers that made it clear to me that everyone was aware of the situation. I finished up one paper with her after I graduated, but after that I moved on and found more reliable people to work with. \n\nAt the time it made me absolutely crazy and I could not believe everyone would just let her behave like that, but looking back, I think it was actually handled with a fair amount of grace. She retired (I never got an answer as to whether she was forced to or decided herself she needed to), the department made sure I completed my degree, and my committee helped me get a job. \n\nI would suggest you reach out to the other people she works with and discuss the situation without being to explicit before going to any higher ups. Bring evidence of her behavior with you if you do go to the dean, but only show it if it becomes clear that they are unaware of the behavior (I always had the emails/ texts/ etc. of her communication with me for meetings with other people, but never needed to show them). Figure out which of her students can finish their research with her minimal envolvement, and who may need to transition research groups. If you can, try to finish up or disentangle all of your own research collaborations with her and then cut ties. Also, if you are in a position, think about her current students and if you can offer to be references for them. It was incredibly valuable for me to have other people to step in and write recommendations when she could/ would not. Hope this helps!",

If you have a good relationship with either of them they may be able to tell you if something is already happening or may be able to raise it themselves. Good administrators are the life blood of any dept and are a great place for junior staff to get contact with the higher ups. That's also why bad admins are so toxic to an org.",

PAs often have much closer relationships with people than other staff plus also tend to know what's going on because they're managing diaries and sometimes are sitting in on meetings. This means that they can sometimes raise stuff that other people can't, and they can sometimes give you a steer about what to say and to who. If the PI has a PA they may have noticed something and/or may be aware that something is being done. If the PI's boss has a PA they may be able to raise the issues with the boss.\n\nI'm fairly senior and I work in the office of the most senior person in my org, I have regular meetings with them and have access to the rest of the senior leadership. I still talk to their PAs all the time to talk about what they have on, what the best timing for something is, gather intelligence, generally find out the lay of the land whenever there's something tricky for me to deal with, and sometimes the PA will raise stuff because it's easier for them to do it.",

      "text": "I'm an academic, and I've seen similar situations. Academia is not like the business world, in which loss of competence is recognized by various co-workers, including some who are not afraid to address such issues because of impact on the business. In academia, people tend to work longer before they retire and senior, tenured professors are given a lot of independence. Students are probably much more familiar with the competence of faculty members than are their faculty peers, who may only interact closely in occasional meetings. I've seen professors with serious behavioral issues do egregious things yet continuing working for years because no one wanted to intervene. It can be very difficult to motivate a department chair or dean to address problems like this, or even to alert the family. Even if they want to resolve the issue, it can be a long and complicated process. Recently at my university a professor was discovered to have had serial affairs with grad students, but it took almost 3 years to remove them from the department. This one reason why you must alert this woman's chair, and/or dean, and encourage others to join you. It may take a protracted process to see any results. Also, it sounds as though this person may have a serious issue that needs to be addressed-and you can't rely on others to alert people.",

He was meant to become my academic advisor, so this was a serious relationship, in a class of 12, seated at a round table. But his class was at 8am and I missed it 8 times in a row- almost three full weeks. I went in desperate to salvage whatever I could of my grade- I took my place at the table and he was discussing our \u201cresearch papers\u201d, which we had apparently been asked to have an idea for, ready to be approved that day. He looked right at me and said \u201cI had suggested that you might want to do something on entrepreneurship in Meiji Japan, but you didn\u2019t seem to pick up on my suggestion\u201d- and I realized that he DIDN\u2019T KNOW that I\u2019d been absent. So I quickly agreed that that was indeed the topic I had chosen, and he was very pleased.\nA few weeks later, he passed out a \u201cstudy guide\u201d fir the final. We all studied together. The. We got the actual exam. IT WAS THE EXACT SAME PAPER. \n\nI got an A+ in that class and everyone else failed the final and got a D, because \u201cIt SEEMS like some of you worked together!\u201d\n\nWhen I tried to get my schedule signed fir the spring semester, there was a note on the door. He had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Everyone got a B, except for me. I retained my A+.",
