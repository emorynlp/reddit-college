  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a STEM master's student in Canada and about a year into my degree. I couldn't really find a good discussion on the topic, so, like the title says, I'm curious to know about what you did during grad school that you felt help you stand out? Did you join a graduate council or a field-related organization? Did you teach yourself skills that aren't necessarily related to your work? Did you start an initiative of some sort? Apply for awards?\n\nI feel like I could be doing more, but with COVID, and working entirely remotely, it's hard to get new perspectives and ideas.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "The answer will depend a lot on what your goals are. People are going to grad school for reasons beyond attempting a career as an R1 researcher these days, and for those \"alternative\" careers, publications will not be all that matters (though publications do help in essentially all careers that follow grad school).\n\nFor instance, I knew I wanted to teach at a PUI after finishing my PhD. Because of this, I picked a school with a specialization in biology education and an advisor who promised me that I could do as much teaching as I wanted as long as I met her standards for productivity. I ended up taking a few classes in pedagogy, earned a tack-on \"teaching certificate\" with my degree, and by making it known in my department that I wanted to teach I was given a lecture course as instructor of record during my last year. That lecture course is the biggest reason I landed my current position at a small liberal arts college right out of my PhD.\n\nAnother example: my office-mate in grad school wanted to work in industry and wanted to keep options open for science communication. He started science outreach programs, worked with multiple groups across the large university to get involved in as many opportunities for collaborative projects as he could, and he networked his butt off. He's now working in an industry position and keeps active in communication where he can.\n\nThe biggest advice I would give: ***talk to people who have the job you want and especially listen to those who got those jobs within the last 5ish years***. Place all advice in the context of who is giving it to you. I mostly say that because R1 professors have rarely worked outside of R1 universities and thus often only really know how to get jobs the same way they did.",

I'm a PhD student in 1st year, and one thing about reaching out to other professors within my university who are working on the topics I am interested in that makes me nervous is that my advisor brought me in as their student. how do I bring up the topic that I am interested in other topics? Would it be bad if I communicated with other professors to get an understanding, then inform my advisor? Or should I ask her first. How would the process work if I wanted to collaborate with another professor on a topic that is not related to my advisor, thus resulting in no collaboration on those topics with them?",

I was very much the same in grad school. But it\u2019s also important to have accomplishable projects within the scope of your PhD. It may sometimes be beneficial, logistically, to stick to projects with a single mentor/advisor and seek out other projects later in your PhD and postdoc.",

      "text": "Standard disclaimer: N=1, ymmv. I decided I wanted an academic job so my advice is generally tailored to that. I'm not suggesting that academic jobs are better, only contextualizing why I made the decisions I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\n\nI learned by doing cool projects and publishing the resultant papers instead of stressing about classroom performance. I wrote with friends and with people I admired. This helped me cultivate a network of people who I genuinely like, so the work was more fun and the network was stronger. Bonus: had a bunch of papers for job market season. I might have some of the worst grades in the program actually, but that never came up at an interview. \n\nI also took on leadership roles that initially I thought I couldn't handle. For example, I accepted the opportunity to organize a summer institute in my second year - despite feeling like I wasn't 'advanced' enough. I'm now on the 4th year of said institute and it (and the skills it teaches) have become a foundational part of my academic trajectory. It turns out I was advanced enough, I just didn't believe in myself enough. I also have given talks and guest lectures that made me a little nervous and have been glad I did it. In some fields (like mine) you can get away with barely presenting your work or barely teaching - but I put myself out there often enough that I got comfortable with speaking skills and talks. I think this really paid off on the job market and in the quality of my teaching/presenting. Now when something pops up that could be stressful like a conference I forgot about (story of the zoom era) or a big meeting - I'm not worried about those foundational skills and can apply my efforts elsewhere.\n\nSometimes the best thing to do for your career is to just to do things that make you happy: I made friends in different fields not because of academic machinations - I just thought they were dope and wanted to be friends with them. I've also attended conferences out of field because they sounded cool and they've been dope. I have stayed open and flexible to opportunities I hadn't considered, and for the most part, they've been lit and occasionally result in random academic products too. For example, a friend (from a random different department) and I have a passion for a niche topic and got hype to do a random bonus project on it just for fun and it ended up being a really good paper sort of by accident. We went from cheerfully ranting about it, to voluntarily researching it, to 'oh maybe we should write this up', to presenting it at conferences together, to sending it in for review. And we had fun the whole way. And it's awesome to see the mind-meld glory of you and your friends' work decorating your CV. \n\nThis is where your mileage will vary, but I realized early on that the best fit academic job for me would be a place that was excited about people with many interests and interdisciplinary sorta stuff, so I was less worried about having a varied output portfolio. Sort of related: you could see this from my post history - but I have a hell of a lot of piercings, some in my face or other unusual visible places. I was advised on many occasions to remove them because people wouldn't approve in some of the more conservative spaces I work in (like court lol). I declined to do so. I know there are some people who passed on working with me because they didn't like the look, but after fully considering the pros/cons I decided to leave them and get some more. This is of course an N=1 thing and sort of different because piercings are usually a personal choice, but I'd say they were the most major source of academic bullying I got during grad school. But ultimately, I really like my piercings and would rather leave the academy with them intact then be part of the academy without them. It all worked out well and I felt all the places where I job talked/interviewed were surprised but cheerful about them. I also have a wonderful network of colleagues and advisors who either don't care or think they're cool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\n\nBonus points for some skill development that is industry-relevant that is also sneakily productive. For example, I wanted to learn to code so I did some computational projects. Published the projects, had the skills in my back pocket in case I decided to exit the academy. I decided not to exit the academy and now have those coding skills to do more cool projects. Nice. I also did some consulting during gschool that blessed the bank account.",

I like it because it gets me in contact with faculty I wouldn't have met otherwise (some of whom hired me for the aforementioned GIS work) and gives me a more well-rounded perspective on the field of public health. Before I reached the dissertation phase, I took a lot of part-time research assistant jobs like that just because I found the work interesting.\n\nSpeaking of fully taking advantage of my time here, I got student health insurance to cover my tubal ligation.

I love research and academia, but the idea of having to develop a specialized research thesis for my specific niche frightens me - my interests are too all over the place!",

      "text": "1) Take time to learn marketable skills now, because you likely won't have time to later. As a Biologist, for me this meant programming, computing skills, GIS, etc. After exhausting the few classes in my department geared towards developing computing skills, I took more in the CS department. This has been  a major advantage for me moving forward after graduate school, and I think would also help if I decided to leave academia. \n\n2) Get involved in things. I got involved in some capacity in nearly every project in my (fairly large) lab group, which is now starting to pay off in terms of co-authored publications. It also helped me both in learning from senior colleagues and learning to help junior ones. \n\n3) Don't work too much. I realize the above recommendations take time, but I think the best thing you can do is set aside days to enjoy life. Hobbies, fostering personal relationships, traveling (if you can afford it), etc.. Generally I think working 40 hours a week with enough breaks to feel energized and fulfilled is more productive than working 60 hours a week being burnt out.",

I was far happier than I had been the whole rest of my time there and got to know more students from other departments too. \n\nThe best things about being in a university are often closed to us by grad school policies like \"YOU SHOULD DO NOTHING BUT YOUR RESEARCH EVER.\" Before Covid hit, I had a day as a professor where I sang with a grammy award winning guest conductor in a morning rehearsal then booked it across campus to teach an afternoon of classes, then threw on my concert clothes and came back and did a show at night as a member of the choir. THAT is the advantage of being on a college campus and a member of the campus community for me.",

      "text": "If a professor in my department was offering hourly research positions ($15/hr is standard pay for hourly grad positions), I'd gladly volunteer if it was related to my interests, either empirically or methodologically. That has been hugely helpful, since I did a ton of interviews for my professor, who is now on my dissertation committee as my methodology consultant, if you will. A lot of other opportunities just happened to kind of fall from the sky, and I am very lucky about that. \n\nApplying for awards is a good idea. A couple years ago, I did win the department award for best graduate student paper of the year - which means that I get a nice line on my CV and positive recognition from my department. Same goes with applying for fellowships, even though my fellowship application record is one win, and many many losses (which is just the reality of things; learn to not take it personally). At least the one win was the one thing I wanted most. \n\nWhat really helped me stand out was publishing - in my first or second year, I already managed to publish two articles (two authors on both, and I was first author on one). Faculty will see that and see that you know how to write well and how to navigate the whole publication system, and then may be more likely to ask you to collaborate on papers/projects with them. Teaching yourself new skills could also be a huge asset (knowing programming language that your peers may not but that could be very useful to you and faculty can open doors), but also do not forget about demonstrating that you can mentor younger students (grad or undergrad, though in a MA program, that may not be relevant) and/OR collaborate successfully and peacefully with others is also important. People want to collaborate with people they've heard are great to work with.",
