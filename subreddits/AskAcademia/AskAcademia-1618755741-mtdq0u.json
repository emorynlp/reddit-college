  "title:": "5th year med student, I miss mathematics a hurtful lot",
  "text": " \n\nHello. I am not sure if this is the right place to write this, but here I go. I'm an Italian med student, currently in my 5th year out of 6, so I'll be graduating next year.\n\nI have a huge love for mahematics and I miss it so much. I hate that in medicine we're always seeking the smallest detail when studying, and I hate that studying medicine is not really intellectually stimulating as maths is. I feel like an excel spreadsheet being stored with information that if I forget I might put someone's life in jeopardy. I think it doesn't take much talent to be successful in med school, although in professional situations you can instantly tell the smart doctors who always asks himself or herself questions from the one that just learnt every textbook known to man by heart.\n\nI had a painful doubt when in high school about the choice of university. I loved mathematics, but I was afraid I wasn't goig to get any good jobs with it, much due to social pressure and my parents' pressure. I partially know that this isn't the case, but I still don't know much about the professional demand of mathematics. I quite liked medicine and i still do, but nothing here is as exciting as maths. I miss the creative thinking I used to do in maths, the frustration of not being able to come up with a solution that suddelny vanishes when you get there.\n\nI am in a good university after a very selective national test and I am doing pretty well because I am good at studying, so I am aware that many people would like to be in the position I am. I'm saying this not because I have any intention of showing off, but because I hate this argument that my parents threw at me countless times. I don't care how many people would like to be wheere I am. I just feel out of place. My parents have been really pressing especially in my first couple of years, but luckily they appear a little more supporting now.\n\nI don't know what to do with my life. I am seriously afraid of ending up in a job that i don't enjoy. I quite like infectious diseases, and I am doing an internship there, because it's quite close to basic sciences like microbiology and immunology, because it is broad as you can see diseases of any organ, and because it can open the way to epidemiology for me, where I might be able to jump into mathematical modelling. I'd like to use maths in my everyday job to solve problems, but I don't know how much doctors do and how much they leave to mathematicians to do, and I don't know how much I'll be able to study in order to do that kind of job. I don't know if maybe I am idealizing maths careers too much either.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post, it really was off my chest. Thanks to everyone even only for reading this.\n\nHave a great day :)",

If you want plug and play (this is all math till grad school) you can swap to a math-reliant specialty of medicine. If you want to contribute you will need to take it seriously and spend a couple years away from medicine just to catch up (epidemiology).",

You can look into systems biology or modelling of diseases or cells or whatever you like. There is a huge demand for this kind of researchers and there are so many interesting thing you can do. You can also look at scientists like for example [Uri Alon](https://www.ted.com/talks/uri_alon_why_science_demands_a_leap_into_the_unknown?language=ur) who went from physics to biology and is doing very fun research . Would suggest you to finish your Medicine degree and then venture to academia, industry or bio-tec and the whole world is open for you.

I don't know how to do this in medicine, but in my STEM field I'd do this by looking up relevant faculty on university webpages and emailing them my questions or asking for an hour-long coffee chat. You might also try posting the \"how much math do you do?\" question in a medicine-specific subreddit. I discovered this week that the subreddits for medical professionals are very active, so they might have answers for you!",

      "text": "Italian college student here at the first year of biomedical engineering (so take what I say with a grain of salt), I choose this degree because of reasons that have parallels to yours (started off in Maths, realized I needed a more hands-on approach but I absolutely loved the medical/biological world so I ended up here). Have you thought about doing a PhD? A Laurea Magistrale a Ciclo Unico such as Medicine is equivalent to a Laurea magistrale from an administrative POV, so you may access a PhD directly, and there are a few PhD programs that deals heavily with the computational side (for example [at Milano Statale](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/corsi-post-laurea/corsi-di-dottorato-phd/aa-2020/2021-dottorato-medicina-dei-sistemi) or [at Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/dottorati/2021-2022/scienze-biotecnologiche-e-farmaceutiche) or [at Pavia](http://phd.unipv.it/corso-di-dottorato-di-ricerca-in-tecnologie-per-la-salute-bioingegneria-e-bioinformatica-prosegue-le-attivita-del-corso-di-dottorato-di-ricerca-in-bioingegneria-e-bioinformatica/) ). All these programs may be accessible with a Medicine degree while also including large amounts of Maths, and would let you go on on a rather coherent path without you needing to study for another degree or start working in a field that doesn't interest you. \n\nHope this helped. Good luck, and best wishes!",

In order to get here, I did some research in undergrad which resulted in a paper doing SEIR modeling. As long as you have a solid footing in differential equations, it is fairly simple to at least get at start in SEIR modeling. I also found it not to be as steep a learning curve as other mathematical pursuits that I\u2019ve encountered. And, it was quite fun! I mainly do more pure mathematics now, but applied mathematics is always fun and there are numerous career opportunities in it.",

Finished a PhD in biology but desperately missed math, wasn't sure how to integrate it into my research career, so I am taking courses part-time on the side working toward a masters. Kind of unusual but I'm here to suggest that you consider it. I have -loved- getting back into math this way and the masters (if I eventually get it and this isn't just a phase) comes with its own career options. Because, yes, like you said - it's hard to just squeeze math into your career otherwise when there are trained mathematicians, statisticians to occupy those roles. But if you have a full-blown credential you can carve out a little niche for yourself. Good luck!",

I did 3 years of research in infectious disease modeling, mostly within-host immune modeling but also dabbling in models of disease spread through a population. Generally, I found that the field is very limited by messy data. If you really love pure math and don't want to get into computational models, I'd recommend something more based in physics, like radiology. If computational modeling is something that also excites you, then infectious diseases and cancer is something to think about. I absolutely love mathematical oncology and if you have an MD then it'd be possible to collect clinical data. Modeling cancer therapy is a huge field. Oncolytic virology, drug delivery, radiation or proton therapy, radio frequency ablation. Definitely look into Moffitt cancer center in Tampa - they do some amazing work integrating math modeling with the clinical side of things",

      "text": "I love maths as well! And i do miss it being the nr 1. focus. However i don't think we have to give up on it!\n\nI'm done with bachelors and am currently in research year with some neuro/hemodynamics. There are so many great opportunities to do interesting math/physics in my lab. \n\nFor me it was very purposeful that i chose medicine, in that although i might like to study maths or physics more in terms of the curriculum in and of itself, i wouldn't want to work in the fields/positions that would be open by simply having those educations. \n\nFrankly, i don't care much about what it is i am \"baseline\" studying. i consider my education *mine*. One thing that is helped by being  a little bit older/experienced is that i don't see medicine as something that's going to define my life at all. I don't want to \"be a doctor\", i couldn't give two fucks about what label i have.  I've been in the millitary a little, homeless for a while, doing stupid hard jobs for years. I'm *already* a nobody, and it's incredibly freeing.\n\nMy education is not something that i feel i get from the curriculum. All educations need to be so broad that it is impoverished in depth no matter what you enroll in. University is about finding who you are and delving into what you want to delve into. \"med school\" just means that a future patient has a guarantee that i've done the breadth of medicine standard for docs, so they can rest assured i won't misapply the tools of modern diagnostics and medicine in their treatment. \n\nFor me, med school offers something absolutely unique though! \n\nIf i don't succeed in finding out something impactful to people in research, which is one thing i might like to do, i can always be of use as someones doctor and make a real impact in someones life. If i get tired of that clinical practice, it's always possible to either teach or do research. Even weird kinds of industry jobs is open. \n\nOf all the other educations i considered, none had this kind of breadth of *opportunity*. I use mostly online courses to study what i want on the side, and choose not to care *too* much about med school grades (there are also many phd courses at the university i'm at, but they mostly aren't *exactly* what want, so i go online - BUT aremember to see if they can give you merits at uni - i found out that if i had enrolled in one of these courses \"officially\" it could've counted towards my PhD body of work). Also be sure to try to find peers at your university with similar interests though, i find it makes the studying deeper. I just go to the maths department and strike up conversation...\n \nSince i've involved myself in research from the beginning of the run, i feel like doing a phd will be simple to get into if i want to, and in my country that and motivation is valued above grades when trying to get specialty positions, so there's really no future utility for going to stupid lengths wasting time getting perfect scores on every test, when you're going to forget 99,9% of those lists of side effects of anatomical mnemonics anyway.\n\nNo other education would've let me do these things that medicine might let me. I couldn't enroll in physics and \"jump over\" learn some medicine and treat patients if i wanted to. IN the research labs i've been in, i feel like we as medics have a very fortunate position. if we want to involve ourselves in the math/Physics of it, we can. The folks on the other side can't really jump to our side and practice clinically. \n\nI guess what i'm mostly trying to say is that, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from learning mathematics and applying it to your life/work in any way you want. Perhaps you might consider sacrificing a few (potential) gradepoints for it.",

(And if anyone questions you about wanting to learn it, you can always justify it by saying that doctors need to understand patient databases, etc.) \n\nYou have a lot of really interesting career options ahead of you! Just stay focused for what you want in a job and you can make it work.\n\nMaybe Cross-Post in r/bioinformatics for more ideas of potential fields! Good luck!",

So in many ways you \"think\" you know what it is like to work as a doctor but as a student, you have absolutely no idea.\n\nIf you are quantitatively oriented you may find a career in public health medicine rewarding, with research there is a need for being able to wrap your head around statistics. But in my opinion statistics is a very different type of math, and I've met math people who stare at statisticians like they have six heads.",
