  "text": "I'm doing a Computer Science Bachelor's degree in University and for one of our assignments we had to create a 'learning journal' website.\n\nMy 'friend' was too far behind and copied mine and changed a few things. His is really barebones due to this and works poorly, but still has my style and layout. I knew he was looking at mine a day before the hand-in (didn't know he was ripping it 1:1) and told him that:\n\n\"I can see you've used mine as a sort of template to phrase it in such a way\"\n\nand then I said\n\n\"Make sure it is different though, especially the left side bar\".\n\nShould I report him for this? If I do, will I be in trouble for what I said to him in case it looks like I gave him permission to use my work?",

If you tell someone else it adds a delay as they report what you said to the instructor for resolution. A good reason to talk to someone else (like your academic advisor or dept chair) is to complain that cheating has occurred and gone unpunished. And they will of course report that to your instructor, perhaps motivating a little more effort. But you aren't there yet anyway.   \n\nAside from all of this your school may have a dean of students or student advocate. They are basically on your side and would help you navigate the situation.

Also violations can cost students scholarships and financial aid which is effectively the same as expulsion for some students. \n\nSecond, I will speak for law school, but all schools require you report all honor code violations, academic violations, etc. Even ones that are dismissed. They absolutely can and do keep student out of law school. \nThen for law students you have to pass a character & fitness evaluation before you can sit for the bar.\n\nI assume pretty much all graduate programs take it just as seriously.

That's a strong indicator that this isn't just a shared inspiration issue. Each small thing in common reduces the probability of coincidence.\n\nAs for your email, unless there's a reason why you have to do it today, I would not send that email. Things in writing have a tendency to escalate. I would personally tend to handle it in person if possible, and use non-accusatory language. \"I want to raise an issue, and it feels like a lot of copying took place. I can't be sure, but I felt it was important to raise this with you\" That type of thing. And if face to face is impossible, only then would I go for email. Even if in your gut you know you're right, in my experience that's not the way to kick off a conversation you want to go your way, and then let your teacher make up their own mind. Good luck!",
