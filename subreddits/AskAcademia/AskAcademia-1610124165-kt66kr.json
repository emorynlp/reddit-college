  "title:": "Science professor at major US university promoting capitol rioters, election disinformation, COVID conspiracy theories, etc. on Twitter. Who do I report this to?",
  "text": "I recently came across the Twitter account of an academic research scientist (professor at a well known university) and saw that he has thousands of tweets promoting all sorts of insane conspiracy theories, pro-Trump propaganda from extreme right wing news sources, and even conspiracy theories about COVID-19. The COVID stuff is really shocking because it is not that far from his field of research! He looks to be a mid-level professor. This is disturbing to me. Scientists are supposed to be promoters of reason, truth, and evidence. What this person is doing is the antithesis of that. This Twitter account is under his real name, but it seems to be flying under the radar because he is only following a bunch of right wing propagandists. He has no followers in his field and isn't following any other scientists. I have verified that it is indeed the professor's account. His username is a science term from his field, and he has posted some slightly less inflammatory things publicly on facebook also where his photo is visible.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? Contact his academic department? Retweet some of his stuff to draw attention to it? His research is funded by the US government and I don't think a conspiracy nut and propagandist should be in charge of a federally funded research lab.",

              "text": "If he were teaching anti-science nonsense in the classroom, then there should be a discussion with the chair/provost (this is where having the documentation would actually be useful).  If he were manipulating data to fit with his batshit agenda, he should be reported to the funding agencies.  However, personal beliefs (even disproven beliefs in the individual's field) should not be grounds for disciplinary action or retraction of funding.  If his research is high-quality, as determined by peer-reviewers and funding agencies, then it should be funded.  If he's teaching evidence-based science in the classroom and leaving out the unproven stuff, he should be allowed to continue.  Even vaguely saying \"there's lots of stuff we don't know and stuff we used to think we knew and now realize we didn't\" is entirely appropriate because it's true.\n\nAs long as he's not teaching courses on epidemiology, I don't see where his beliefs on COVID would affect what he presents in the classroom.  If you had a planetary physicist who was a flat-earther, that would be a problem.  A flat-earther neuroscientist would be weird, but not as much of a problem because it shouldn't ever come up in their teaching or research.  Same for a planetary physicist who believes that humans are just shipwrecked Martians.  \n\nI would worry a little about his grasp of the scientific method, but that would be more of a question for people who have taken (or TAed) his class.  Konrad Lorenz was a eugenicist, but we still teach his theories on imprinting today.  John Watson believes that certain races are less intelligent because of their genetics.  We certainly shouldn't applaud these people's abhorrent beliefs, but it also doesn't make their scientific contributions less valuable.\n\nMost of the cases in which such a professor has been fired for these beliefs usually has to do with them 1) teaching nonsense in the classroom, 2) falsifying data to fit their agenda, or 3) misrepresenting the values of the university or organizations to which they belong.  But the last one usually only happens if the professor goes out of their way to loudly proclaim these ideals and is more related to public relations than academics.",

Some issues we've debunked. For example, I don't explore flat Earth in my Earth Science course because it is debunked. I also don't explore non-evolution-based speciation in my intro biology course because it no longer fits in the framework of Biology. That's even given that I spend a significant amount of time working on exploring science and pseudoscience with my students in the classroom. Sometimes you just have to teach what we know and hope that the good will you've garnered will allow students to trust the sources you provide them as being backed by the same scientific processes you've already shown them. And those are students who I have a multi-week relationship with, not some rando on the internet who thinks all information is equal, especially information that comes from people who hold certain degrees.",

That being said, since he is not even a professor at your institution, I would advise you to not let this consume too much space in your mind. We are all fallible and people can easily get sucked down political conspiracy rabbit holes, even scientists. This is not to say his online behavior is not troubling, but that there really is no case against him thus far, as long as he does not make threats of violence or attempt to incite it. It is a tricky situation, but especially if you are a grad student and not tenured faculty, I would not venture too deep into his online cesspool.",

              "text": "The funny thing is, that Popper is always quoted with these lines. I wonder how many of those who quote him have actually read the book and/or belong to ideological groups that Popper sees as threats to the open society. Hint: It\u2019s not only \u201ethe\u201c right. \nSo, in \u201eDie offene Gesellschaft und ihre Feinde\u201c, he defines intolerance as a) rejecting rational debate and b) violence and call for violence against those who disagree and have a different worldview. Popper himself was very critical of intolerance as a means of protection. In this book, he put debate and argument before what today would be cancel culture etc., freedom of expression and opinion are crucial to Popper, eben more so because he strongly advocated democracy which lives from open debate. One could even say that tolerance is a zeitgeist phenomenon, we define it different than those before us and those after us. And we\u2019re far away from its original meaning, today\u2019s definition is more and more a justification for censorship. Tolerance, in my opinion, does neither mean that someone can swing the political correct hammer to silence those who hold different opinions or views, nor does it mean that prejudice etc can be spread without consequence. But tolerance means to to have an open, free and honest debate about these things, a battle of options, if you will, it also means that A has to endure Bs worldview, since that is exactly what the Latin \u201etolerate\u201c means: to endure. Not accept, not agree, but endure. \nSo, if the professor really posted these opinions, - remember, to all here but OP this is hearsay -, the first step according to Popper is to engage his beliefs, not the person. Ad hominem etc leads nowhere. Why does he say/ post these things? What sources does he offer to back his statements? What are his arguments? ... ? What made me suspicious about OP is the lack of proof of what\u2019s going on, the idea that the Professor doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and the idea that something as a universal and binding truth exists, even more so in academia, of which dispute, agree and disagree are integral parts.",

I have to point out that I\u2019m not a virologist, I can only make my case from an historians point of view. \n\nI agree with you that there is a line that divides irrationality from rationality. Beyond that line, there\u2019s little a rational argument can do or change, especially regarding people with an \u201ein the trenches\u201c-mentality, no matter what issue. I disagree with the idea that you shouldn\u2019t talk with or debate those people. While the agitators might be lost cases, their audiences, however, might be not. That\u2019s why rationality is, as you called it, doing the heavy lifting. Moreover, I disagree on getting someone fired from his job just for differing opinions, but, and I think we are kind of on the same page here, again there is a line that shouldn\u2019t or mustn\u2019t be crossed, otherwise there will consequences. \n\nConspiracy theories aren\u2019t necessarily untrue, think about the doubts concerning Tonkin Bay or the staged Nayirah testimony before Congress 1990. Those in doubt were labelled conspiracy theorists too, because they didn\u2019t believe in the proof that was offered in these and other cases. \n\nNow, for COVID-19: The only conspiracy theory I know of is that it was manufactured in a lab, ideas like \u201eit\u2019s only a flu\u201c, no matter how wrong they are, are merely conspiracy theories, in my opinion. Regarding the theory, I know that there\u2019s a paper (https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-015-0422-1) from 2015 that discusses bat origin and human corona viruses. I thought there was one from 2006 or 2007, but I couldn\u2019t find it. Anyways, it was argued that the findings of the 2015 paper were the starting point of the manufacturing process of the current corona virus. The response was \u201eno government would do that, it wouldn\u2019t be controllable\u201c etc. etc. While I agree that this conspiracy theory indeed is a very long stretch, it\u2019s not beyond governments to do that, for instance, I\u2019d like to point out the Guatemala syphilis experiments (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828982/) or Operation Sea Spray (https://books.google.de/books?id=JCU9KV00aCkC&pg=PA2&redir_esc=y) as a domestic case that was kind of uncontrollable as well. Covid-19 isn\u2019t an experiment gone wrong, or worse: going as planned, but I don\u2019t put unethical trials beyond governments. At this point, I\u2019d like to bring Popper back to the table. His falsification theory states that a theory is only valid or beyond doubt as long as it isn\u2019t proven wrong, meaning \u201ewe\u201c could be right, \u201ethey\u201c could be right, all of us could be wrong. That means questioning any information we consume, and that\u2019s the \u201edilemma\u201c of the academic and informed citizen. \n\nRegarding election fraud, the Carter Commission issued a, in my opinion, ambiguous report (https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2020/united-states-050620.html). In this statement on voting by mail it claimed that Oregon was a prime proof that voting by mail is almost immune to fraud. However, right before it was also pointed out the increased potential for fraud for a couple of reasons. In my opinion, the text could be paraphrased as follows: Things are more likely to go wrong but since one state managed to get it right, all will - it really depends on how you read the text and on your personal stance. I admit that it could be interpreted in a different way. The argument of election fraud isn\u2019t new either - it happened in 2016, it is mentioned for the 2008 and 2012 elections as well in this paper (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015587156). In my opinion, the reason that the left is going batshit crazy over the idea that the election might have been rigged is, because in their opinion, the right candidate (Harris) won and the right candidate (\u201etheirs\u201c, Trump) lost. Do governments rigg elections? Yes, they do. Meet Charles D. B. King, who won the 1927 elections in Liberia with ~230.000 votes from ~15.000 registered voters (http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/1927ElectionsMF.htm). I chose that example because it\u2019s a very impressive one from a democratic country, of course there are more current others. In the case of the 2020 US election and considering how eager they were to get Trump out of office, I definitely didn\u2019t rule out fraud. However, after all that has been said and done, it\u2019s very unlikely that is has been. That brings me back to the general point about conspiracy theories - they are subject to falsification as well. The theory didn\u2019t stand, end of story. \n\nIn this case, we don\u2019t know what exactly the Professor did post, we only have OPs word that he did. We know nothing about these posts, content-wise they could be anything. At this point, it\u2019s either \u201ebenefit of the doubt\u201c or \u201elisten and believe\u201c until there\u2019s some reliable proof. Personally, I\u2019m all for the first option. \nI do have a Problem with your opinion that \u201eit sounds like they are using their position of power to spread propaganda and misinformation.\u201c While I agree that it sounds like this is exactly what he\u2019s doing, it takes two - transmitter and receiver. That leads to a problem: If the professor is good at what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s an asset for the university and the program. Does his opinion affect his research and teaching? He didn\u2019t make his statements in the classroom, that\u2019s why I\u2019m opposed to fire him or any harsh measures. He is entitled to an opinion, almost no matter how right or wrong. What bugs me is that OP may or rather may not be attending that university/program, since he isn\u2019t sure about the professors position and didn\u2019t bother to check either. That\u2019s another issue - students should be able, since they\u2019re old and educated enough to be in university and college, to check and research when something a professor says sounds strange or uncommon or comes from a field that isn\u2019t necessarily his expertise or related to his expertise. That\u2019s why I sometimes like to open my lectures and seminars with a famous quote from Marcus Aurelius: \u201eEverything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.\u201c \n\nI hope that covered your question and sorry for my bad English.",

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u2014In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.",

If you talk logically with someone 1-on-1 the likelihood that they\u2019ll pay attention and give your ideas some thought is much higher than not presenting that opportunity to them in the first place. That\u2019s considering you\u2019re able to hold your composure, remain civil, and treat them as an individual without making assumptions before getting to know them. But from the wording of your writing, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019d be very good at that. I may be wrong, but you did make quite a few assumptions of a whole group of people consisting of many individuals you haven\u2019t met before. Just try and be a bit more open-minded. \n\nIf you can learn where someones racist tendencies stem from, you may be able to develop a better strategy at combatting it. \n\n^^ that\u2019s an example of how talking to a racist may be a learning opportunity",

                      "text": "You make some good points, but what makes you assume that the professor is a conspiracy theorist in the first place? Who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t use some sort of logic to arrive to his conclusions\u2014even if the logic is flawed. You can only hope that if you make it apparent to them where down the line their logic possibly went awry, maybe they\u2019ll decide to take that into account. Discussion and understanding is a much better alternative in my opinion to crying and calling for help if someone disagrees with you. \n\nOf course you may not be able to change everyone\u2019s mind you come across. Who knows, maybe they\u2019ll even share some information you weren\u2019t aware of and you\u2019ll find that YOU were in the wrong. Of course you\u2019ll run into people who are ignorant while also arrogant. And that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s also important to recognize when you\u2019re acting in the same manner you voice yourself as being against. It\u2019s entirely possible that the opposition has the exact same perspective of you that you have of them. Maybe they believe YOU are the ignorant sheep or conspiracy theorist. And just for the record, I\u2019m not taking any sides regarding the actual topic that was tweeted, I\u2019m speaking in a general sense. Taking the stance of believing that you have the \u201ccorrect\u201d way of thinking makes you no better than those whom you oppose. \n\nYou can\u2019t change someone\u2019s mind by ignoring them. You need to have dialogue and show them other routes of thinking. A good example is that of Darryl Davis, a black musician who got about 200 KKK members to quit the clan by befriending them. By conversing with them and spending time with them, logic prevailed in the end. The klansmen realized that the idiotic rhetoric being disseminated at klans rallies didn\u2019t describe Daryl Davis, and actually had a change of heart. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes",

By you saying that you like chocolate ice cream, I could make the statement that your belief encourages people to buy chocolate ice cream even though they may be allergic to chocolate. That\u2019s why American law on free speech is very clear. If it doesn\u2019t directly incite violence, it\u2019s fair game. Regardless of how offensive the words may be perceived. You can\u2019t control how others react to your beliefs. You may see it as the professor pushing political propaganda, but I see it as the professor practicing his first amendment right to free speech. \n\nAnd again, you are making an argument from a position of authority, as if you know the objective truth to the matter at hand. Your claims are on the exact same level as his claims unless backed up by evidence. So why should anyone believe that the professor is completely wrong unless you prove them wrong by using logic and reason? And newsflash, you can\u2019t use logic and reason on someone whom you refuse to converse with. If anything, engaging with ideas you may perceive idiotic should be seen as a form of enlightening and educating others. It\u2019s a similar thing with flat earthers for example. If no one ever disproved flat earthers, people who are new to the subject may see that idea as being completely valid. It\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. Refusing to educate and engage with people is counterproductive. It\u2019s this type of ego-trip and laziness that has the potential of hindering personal growth, as well as societal growth.",

And further, your evidence that they are indeed objective. At this point your dogma is approaching religious fervor. \n\nI also find it baffling that someone can sit here and criticize the merits of free speech in a democratic society, without even hinting at the disastrous consequences that censorship has wrought historically. Tell me, historically has it been free speech that has been the bane of liberal societies or has it been censorship? When evaluating the transition from a closed society into an open society, do we generally see free speech taking form or more censorship? \n\nAuthoritarians love the reification fallacy. They are all about \"the common good\" and the \"good of society,\" they're the protectors of the abstract. Your \"absolute moral truth\" is no different than the Saudi's, and they like you are willing to censor any and all information contrary to the status quo to protect the \"good of society.\"\n\nSpreading lies about the Coronavirus online is dangerous and shouldn't be tolerated? What about sharing anti-vaxxer news? Should all anti-vaxxers be censored? What about spreading creationist information online ? Isn't that dangerous too? What about teaching eternal damnation to children? Don't studies show that it's inimical to their mental health? Should we censor them?\n\nA professor is batshit crazy for being a trump supporter and spreading coronavirus lies and should be silenced/censored as a result? What about a professor that believes we originated from two humans named Adam and Eve, that a man who sacrificed himself for humanity will return and that there will be a fiery apocalypse in the near future wherein all those that lacked his belief would then experience eternal hellfire? Should this person not be allowed to disseminate such ideas on his personal twitter account?\n\nI mean where does it stop. And who's moral authority are we operating from? Anything and everything can be censored in the name of \"civil society\" or the \"common good.\" That is why it's best to err on the side of free speech than on the side of censorship.",

There's a statistical difference between people who are professors and those who aren't (like PhD students), but there's plenty of exceptions. I know this very well, because I know a lot of people who both are and aren't professors. I also know that most of the professors I know would think that your conception of what knowledge being a professor affords is BS. As I've said before in this thread, you come across as naive, and this is another example of it.\n\nBTW, the way you talk about the situation involving the OP and professor they're talking about, makes me wonder whether you are the OP, under a different account.",

Without tenure and similar protections, we risk a group think mentality taking over and ultimate stagnation.  I have no doubt this prof is a moron, but you are the bigger moron for wanting to tattle on him for making you uncomfortable.  Grow up.  If he hasnt threatened anyone, incited violence or otherwise violated the law he has every right to be a moron.  People like you are very dangerous and a threat to science more than one moron.

Life isnt meant to be all rounded corners and safe spaces.  The price we pay for liberty is some inherent danger.  I fear where your solution takes us much more than I fear some asshole prof with a twitter account.  \n\nAfter 9/11 everyone was scared of terrorists.  So the US let the government have broad powers to stop that 'dangerous ideology' which lead us into endless wars and a surveillance state.  It eroded our liberties and empowered the government to torture people.  The solution was worse than the cure.  \n\nEveryone is so quick to silence people, and no one is wiling to calm down and think through where this could lead.  Who gets to decide what's too far?  If you like Trump you gotta go, what about if you like Jesus?  Guns?  Drugs? Dave Chappelle (he's racist as fuck).  Should we hire a bunch of people to sit in an office and sort through people's social media and decide who gets to keep their job and who gets to be shut up?  WHO MAKES THE CALL?  OP on a reddit thread?\n\nTrump is a dangerous psycho, but millions of emotional left leaning people with no problem censoring people they disagree with, labeling 70 million people as racist traitors and advocating for random profs with twitter accounts to be silence are vastly more dangerous.  I'd gladly put up with Trumpers to keep my right to say what I think under all circumstances, ESPECIALLY in academia.",

However, the professor has chosen to publicly spread information that is harmful to other researcher studies and potentially even to the health of those around him. That's his choice, but you're also allowed to bring this up and discuss it with colleagues, or circulate the tweets in question. If spreading anti-science nonsense and right-ring fascist propaganda hurts his reputation when others see what he's saying, so be it. He is spreading this misinformation by using his credentials and name as a doctor and professor. Then he also has to be able to defend these views if they fall under public scrutiny. Such is freedom of speech, and such are the ways of science.\n\nI'm not sure what would have happened in our department... maybe an email chain among students. Perhaps you want to anonymously share the tweets. It's up to you.\n\nSome may call it \"cancel culture\" or \"unfair\" if his reputation is hurt, but this was his choice. And frankly, it's common sense. If you say crazy things, expect people to think you're crazy.",

Complaints about \"cancel culture\" are the latest iteration of it.  (which is why I mentioned Horowitz, etc.) \n\n\"Cancel culture\" *doesn't* exist.   I'm a real professor at a real university, and I can assure there's no wave of Black Lives Matter students and their crony professors trying to stifle speech.  That's all *bullshit*.    \n\n(now, there are *other* issues revolving around the topic of race in the academy that *are* disturbing and uncomfortable... and I'm happy to engage about those.  They are indeed potentially-damaging.)  \n\nBut \"cancel culture\" as framed by Fox News?    a lie. \n\nWhich means that u/HappyUIUCguy is parroting a Fox News lie, and using a post by a random person on Reddit to 'confirm' his Fox News framing. \n\nWhich means u/HappyUIUCguy is either very much in the game of politics (and his claims about 'totalitarian boot' a bit disingenuous), or he's just uninformed and gullible, which is why I bothered with my rant about the radical right-wing efforts to steer/shape the discourse about how \"unfair\" the universities are to \"conservatives.\"",

But I do struggle with the fact that, as scientists, we **have** been using science to disprove their conspiracy theories for almost a year now and they just keep on coming through and putting up more and more strawmen to these, despite having little to no evidence on their side. Adding people who are experts in nearby fields to their ranks adds credence to their claims and helps to spread disinformation even further. \n\nI guess I'm at: we've already seen that while we've used science to disprove their conspiracy theories, they've chosen to not believe that we have. So I just don't know what to do about scientists furthering these beliefs.",

In fact every time I gave them what in my opinion was a strong, well researched, thorough debunk they seemed to double down on their beliefs. So even though I love writing paragraphs talking about the shape of the Earth it became frustrating eventually. This situation feels similar. Except flat-earthers didn't actively worsen a public health crisis.\n\nI'm actually a little bit lost and tired in this regard, and more so when I have such a conspiracy theorist in my family. These beliefs don't come from a rational, factual place. It's an emotional response, and they seem either completely oblivious to it or in denial - either way I can't always do much. And certainly not in the case of people on the internet.",

Be concise and be sure to provide evidence. I think in this case what's important is to shut down bad ideas with better ideas, so retweet them and argue them. I think if you cause a real uproar then you might ruin another person's career and life. \n\nPlease be careful though. I recently was listening to the useful idiots podcast and a similar situation occurred, however the professor's statements were completely taken out of context by the students. The prof was a prominent critic of Bush, Mark Crispin Miller. I urge you to listen to listen to this podcast, both Matt Taibbi and Katie Halper or long standing progressives and make really sound arguments. \n\n\"*His research is funded by the US government and I don't think a conspiracy nut and propagandist should be in charge of a federally funded research lab*.\" This is not for you to decide. If his research proposals are error filled they would be rejected, based on evidence. We cannot and should not censor people based on their personal beliefs, even if they are based on falsehoods.\n\nAlso keep in mind this might not be completely his fault and approach with compassion. Watch the netflix documentary the social dilemma, to see why anybody in their right mind would even believe this kind of propaganda. It might make dealing with people like this easier since you have an idea as to where they are coming from and handle this issue with more tact.",

Three seperate points which have come up in this thread: \n\n- (1) Not persecuting an individual for having insane beliefs, \n\n- (2) Not being able to ridicule an individual for having insane beliefs, \n\n- (3) Not letting insane beliefs propagate.\n\nWhere I stand is\n\n(1) Whatever goes on inside someone's head is nobody else's business.\n\n(2) All ideas should be open to criticism. A society that doesn't allow open criticism and debate is probably one based on tyranny.\n\n(3) I think this is reasonable.\n\nI just think we should have stronger and more effective mechanisms to quash disinformation before it goes viral. One more benign recent example of a failure in this regard is the resurgence of Flat Earth within the past decade, which many think was attibuted to the Youtube algorithms, before soon spreading off platform. At the moment, the algorithms of social media (Facebook, Youtube, Snap, etc.) favour divisive and contentious information, and often allow disinformation to spread faster than information and rebuttals. \n\nIf you are a biology professor that wants to believe we faked the Moon landing and spread that belief online, I believe it's the platform's responsibility to write the algos or put in place effective controls so that your message reaches as few people as possible outside of your immediate social circle (and the institution's responsibility to make sure it never reaches the students). We have a right to hold dumb ideas, but that doesn't mean we shoud be enabled by society or academia or technology to effectively spread them to others. There should be negative feedback mechanisms in place.\n\nIf someone were spreading health conspiracies, that's not protected within freedom of speech as it becomes a public health issue; face the full ramifications of being permanently banned from the platform, sacked from your job, shunned by academia, and prosecuted by the law or whatever is a proportional response, so that the misinformation doesn't result in unnecessary public health issues.",
