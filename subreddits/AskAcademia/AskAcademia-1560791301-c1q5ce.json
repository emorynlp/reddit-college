  "text": "Thankfully I'm still a very early-stage career scientist, I'm a master's student to be specific. However, I already have a publication out there with my old name on it, and I also have a google scholar page with the same name as well. This was before I was living with a full-time female identity. From now on, I will be publishing any papers under my new name. If anyone else has gone through this, your insight would be appreciated. Is it possible to change the name on my Google Scholar page? As well as still having my pre-name change publication show up on the page? Also, would it raise any kind of red flags if I list that publication with my male name on my resume with my new name? My surname is pretty unique, but I would worry that a potential employer or PhD advisor would see that and wonder why the names are different and I'm not extremely keen on discussing an issue as personal as transitioning during an interview if I can help it.",

You can find people approaching this in multiple different ways.

My own approach is to switch to first initial citation because I want there to be no excuses for using the old first name. Beyond that, being queer has become part of my work and statements. It's been suggested to me (by a knowledgeable, trans HR headhunter ) to take care with using the word \"transgender\" at all in letters and interview, and only refer to myself as transitioning. Take that as you will. I likely will move institutions, and at least be interviewing during my tenure year as a backup. I would expect my gender not to come up except specifically in reference to my research, and I would try to end any curiosity as politely and quickly as possible.",

We never want to \u201cleave a paper behind\u201d as we all work so hard on each publication. I reached out to married female mentors and got advice on what to do. Married female PIs would be a great source of advice for you.\n\nIf the first letter of your first name will change (i.e. you can\u2019t shorten the citations on your CV to A. Smith if you are changing your name from Adam Smith to Amy Smith) then you may want to include \u201cpreviously Adam Smith\u201d somewhere on your CV. If you do not feel comfortable doing this, then I would suggest making your previous and current names bold in the author list in your publication section and using your ORCID ID as a prominent piece of info in the publication section or in the header of your CV as a way to tie all of your papers together. You do have to publish under your legal name, so keep that in mind if you are planning on submitting papers before you legally change your name.\n\nIn my experience most scientists are not terribly concerned with name changes and I seemed to care more about having different names for different papers than anyone else did. At my graduate school a PI transitioned MTF after quite a long career and changed her name and people were very understanding. Scientists are typically open-minded. If you do encounter people who are less than accommodating in job searches and whatnot, this is a red flag and that department will likely not be a good fit for you for other reasons as well. I wish you well!",

Echoing others here if you have an  ORCID profile it'll help. Also, keep in mind you can publish under a different name I use my middle name for my papers instead of my first name. A lot of the married women in our department took their husband's last name to make things easier with family stuff (older generation, it's less common with younger faculty) but still publish under their maiden or former married name. As long as it's consistent then everything should sort of work out.",
