  "title:": "How to Detect Papers from Online Essay Mills?",
  "text": "I am a Composition instructor, and I'm 99% certain some of my students use essay mills (sites where students pay for others to write essays). It's pretty easy to tell when it happens, especially if the student's homework assignment vocabulary does not at all match the essay vocabulary (or syntax, grammar, spelling). I use SafeAssign, but that only goes so far and cannot detect original papers written by ghostwriters. Is there any way I could prove students have used an essay mill?",

      "text": "Realistically, you can't. You could spend an inordinate amount of time stringing together textual analysis that supports your claim, but it won't really go anywhere. A student could be getting help from friends, or outright paying a service to write the essays. They could be utilizing academic support services on your own campus to a considerable degree. Who knows at this point.\n\nThe point is that you can't be sure of how they are cheating, or even if they are. I ultimately think you should just give up on those students as it were. Spend your energy on something positive, like helping the students in your courses that need help. \n\nIf you are willing to up-end your course a bit, you can make it much more difficult for these assignments to work. I break my papers up into sections and require in-person peer review for most of the sections to count. A student that can't string together a sentence can't buy their way out of that classwork. My peer reviews total 25 points per paper, so they could squeak by with a C. It's more work, but I think it's also better teaching. \n\nIn short, either ignore it or stop assigning fire and forget essays.",

Students are given the opportunity to make their case and appeal the charges.   \n\n\nI follow this order--I ask them to meet with me, and bring with them ALL sources they used for this assignment (hard copy or electronic, as appropriate). If they cannot produce all of the sources they used, I tell them straight up that I do not believe they wrote this assignment in a way that meets out academic honesty code, and that I will be reporting it. I then tell them that the committee who handles these issues is typically more lenient in their recommended repercussions if the student acknowledges honestly that they did something unethical as part of my initial report. 80% of the time, this leads to a full confession. In this case, I typically recommend slightly more leniency than I might otherwise (for example, have them re-do the assignment for 50% credit rather than a 0)  \n\n\nIf they DO bring all of their sources, I ask them how they found them. If they can't or won't answer those questions, I proceed as above.  \n\n\nIf they bring their sources, have an explanation for how they found them, AND are able to explain their reasoning in the written work, I drop it and accept that sometimes I misread a situation, even if I am still skeptical.  \n\n\nRecently, I've started requiring my students to submit all work in MS word files (my university provides the MS Office suite for free). 9/10 times when I've busted a student from buying essays off the internet, someone else's author name is in the document properties. If they're lazy enough to plagiarize, they're almost always too lazy to cleanly cover their tracks. Documents with only a few minutes of editing time get red flagged also--because my university provides the programs for free, I feel fair asking them to actually compose in MS Word, OR be prepared to show me their original Google Docs document if they're claiming that's where they drafted it out (should be time stamped with edit history).

We are also partnered with a for profit ELL program that has a base on our campus (I do not ethically agree with this at all), and unfortunately, many students coming from that program have learned that not only *can* they get away with plagiarism, but in many cases, it's the only way to graduate from the program (their instructors are severely underpaid and overworked, and they have super high turn-over in their staff--it's bad situation where everyone involved loses)  \n\n\nI'm actually leaving the university at the end of this year because if I followed all of our policies to the T, I would also not be able to sleep at night, as it would involve making serious compromises on my own personal pedagogical philosophy and general ethical principles about what we are trying to do here. Moral injury is real. It sucks having to choose between ignoring policy and putting myself at risk, and adhering to policy and punishing students who actually *need*  additional care and support more than they need a slap on the wrist.

The first report is fully internal, as in--it doesn't go on any record beyond the office of academic misconduct at my university. Students only suffer serious consequences (probation, expulsion, a mark on their transcript) under our policy if they have been reported multiple times, and if the incidents were clearly intentional (and not issues of insufficient or incorrect citations). The first report results in them having to attend a \"academic ethics\" workshop, and write a summary of what they learned. Our policy states clearly that when in doubt, report, and allow the academic misconduct committee sort out whether or not it is a valid report.   \n\n\nAs for how they found their sources, I typically try to find them myself before I meet with the student so that I have some context for their explanation. If they say they just \"googled it,\" I ask them what search terms they used, and ask them to replicate the search in front of me. Often, the student cannot find the source live, which is pretty hard to explain. Most often when I have concerns, they've used articles that I've tried to find myself which are behind paywalls our university does not have access to, or are from older print-only sources which we do not have on campus, or have only been published in a language other than English.  \n\n\nTo be clear, I have never filed a plagiarism report that I wasn't absolutely 100% certain about myself.  I make sure I am explicitly clear in my reasoning in the report as to why I feel confident that the MOST likely explanation is academic misconduct after carefully considering alternate explanations. I have also had dozens of conversations with students where, going in, I was 99% certain they had paid someone to write their essay for them, and by the end of the conversation, I was 100% certain they had written it themselves. That is to say--I do believe that it's really important to go into these conversations being open to reconsidering your initial concerns. If I am feeling ambivalent about what happened, I tend to personally err on the side of not reporting, as I'd rather be wrong than damage their trust in me as their ally.",

You get to research something new all the time, across multiple fields, no academic politics to worry about, no getting bogged down with the details - just fun, high level stuff. You can probably pre-write papers as you find interesting things, saving them up for a future buyer...",

He was writing crap for people who couldn't tell it was crap, and those people would submit it to professors who would recognize it as crap but couldn't do anything about it due to administrative policy. I wonder if he learned much of anything from writing those thousands of pages of material, or if the knowledge went in one ear, lasted long enough to write twenty pages of garbage, and then went out the other.",
