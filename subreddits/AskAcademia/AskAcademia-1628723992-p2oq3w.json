  "title:": "Vacation Time and Sick Leave",
  "text": "I am currently a doctoral student considering a move into academia after I complete my studies. I currently work in industry where 2-3 weeks of paid vacation is standard. \n\nAs professors, how does vacation and sick leave work? Do you have more autonomy in your schedule than someone working a corporate job? I understand that this may vary by industry but I\u2019d really like to hear from academics how their schedules work. Also, do you have to request days off from a supervisor? Do you have a \u201cboss\u201d in the traditional sense?",

      "text": "If I am sick or have a trip that for professional (e.g., conference) or personal (e.g., funeral) reasons cannot happen at another time, I do not hesitate to do what I need to do. I might technically be supposed to tell someone, and I would definitely give a heads up for any classes, meetings, etc. missed, but in general, I don't think anyone would care about a short time away without scheduling leave or anything like that. I personally wouldn't go on a random vacation in the middle of the academic year, particularly since there are so many other times I could do so that don't interfere with my work.\n\nAs a faculty member, you will no doubt do plenty of work outside of standard M-F 9 to 5 hours. As far as I'm concerned, if they want to count vacation days, then they should count all of the time you do outside of regular business hours as extra time. Put another way, you'll easily make up any time you might miss.\n\nUltimately, this varies a lot by institution. Other institutions are more rigid than mine. When you're on the job market, you might look through the faculty handbook about institutions where you're a finalist and you might see some language about this. It might ultimately give you a feel for how the institution is run more broadly (e.g., flexible, big on red tape, etc.).",

I\u2019m not allowed to take off during the semester, but can take off the first week of August, a week in December, and essentially all of May. I save up to essentially not show up to committee work during May to have three months of summer break.",

      "text": "I was part of a state university system at a baccalaureate college (teaching only--no research requirements). We are on 10 month contracts and don't get vacation days. Having said that, our work semester starts around Aug 12 and ends when finals are over around Dec 10 or so. Same in the spring. On our campus we teach very few Friday classes so the faculty parking lot is largely empty on those days. We get 10 sick days a year and can accumulate those forever. Those who choose to be in the pension system can use sick days as credit to retirement time. I retired at 38 years but had almost 2.5 years of sick time. We can only use 2 years of sick time toward retirement so my last couple of years I donated as many as I could each year to the campus pool. I ended up with slightly over 2 years of sick time so I got credit for 40 years of work. At 2% per year, my pension is 80% of the average of my 2 highest years, including summer pay and overload teaching and so on. I was the \"boss\" in my last 5 years as chair. Faculty only had to talk with me about time off if they were going to miss class or required meetings. As long as they had an \"equivalent educational experience\" it wasn't a problem. I never had anybody abuse the essential freedom they had to live their own lives as long as they met their teaching obligations although I know of other departments where some faculty apparently really abused it and chairs had to respond.",

      "text": "I'm a tenured teaching professor with 12 months of employment each year.  Officially I have 26? days of vacation a year.  In practice I have as many vacation days as I want as long as I'm not missing any classes. I can take the time whenever I want (again, as long as I'm not missing classes).  I have far more autonomy over my schedule (outside of class times which I have some influence on but can't fully control) than I would in most corporate jobs.",

      "text": "If you teach, you have effectively no sick time. Some will say that they can cancel classes or find subs, and this is true, but where you can do this you can also do it because you want to go to a conference or a beach.\n\nIn many ways, teaching is like a performance, and your presence is expected at most meetings. Don\u2019t expect standard labor laws to apply in all cases.\n\nIn some states you may not even accrue sick time at all. OTOH, getting reduced duties for having a kid or some other family thing is possible, and can be much more generous than what FMLA requires.",

      "text": "I don't go on vacation on days I am teaching. If I'm sick I can cancel class but haven't ever been that sick so far. I canceled class once for a funeral. Vacations I take during winter break, spring break, fall break, or summer break. I can also squeeze in an extra day before or after a conference or a three day weekend trip, but will only so that if it doesnt interfere with class (so for instance this semester I teach Tuesday and Thursday, I have a board meeting I have to fly to on the opposite coast that is on a friday-saturday so I scheduled midterms for that Thursday when I am flying there and will have my TA proctor them, then will spend an extra day doing sightseeing on Sunday and will fly back on Monday in time for my Tuesday classes).",

      "text": "Teaching schedules are fairly standard year after year, and specific dates set months ahead, so avoiding a conflict between vacation and teaching is no problem.   Sick is sick, so nobody can schedule that, but I suppose I have been lucky in that I have never had to cancel a lecture because of illness.  On the very rare occasions I am sick, I would just give  a heads up to my lab that I will not be in.\n\nI am allowed three consecutive sick days before I need documentation (a doctors note), so again, that is rarely a problem. Formally I do apply for vacation time, and it is approved by the HoD, and deducted from my annual allowance.\n\nTraditionally we have huge independence to schedule our work ourselves.  \n\nFor the odd day off, well, I normally schedule a vacation day - most where I work do not.  Nobody is really going to follow up if you were really at the library, or the other campus, or meeting a collaborator, or just working somewhere \"quiet\".",
