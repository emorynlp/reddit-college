  "text": "I am a victim of workplace bullying. My tormenter is my Director.\n\nShe calls me in her cabin, closes the door and starts with her destabilization tactics. Character assassination and demoralization are her tactics. Many people have put up with her harm either by teaming with her or doing work for her.\n\nShe starts by telling me how pathetic my work is and devalues all my publications, even if it was published in Nature.\n\nShe will deliberately remove me from allocated responsibilities and tell the evaluation committee that I am not doing that job properly during my evaluation, while the committee doesn\u2019t know that she has already removed me from that job responsibility.\n\nShe keeps reminding me of all the blunders that I did when I initially joined the institute.\n\nI am tired of her persistent attempts to demoralize and destabilize me.\n\nBut yes, she protects sexual predators at workplace, just because they have cut a deal with her.\n\nI hope I find a new position some where else. Unfortunately, she is there in every academic recruiting committee in my country.\n\nWhat should one do when a woman leader bullys, harasses and torments another woman who is her subordinate?\n\nWhy are there no #metoo movements for women bullying women? She micromanages everything and everybody, who should I ask for help in such a situation. Everybody is terrified of her, tries to avoid a confrontation or a dialogue with her.\n\nI am at the verge of a breakdown now. ",

She was a big shot in our field, and it was very difficult to watch her receive international recognition for her work when we knew how cruel and impossible she was. Eventually she left our institution; I remember the day I heard she was leaving \u2014 I was ecstatic and texted all my friends like I\u2019d just won the lottery.\n\nAs for advice, I agree with others here who suggest you document everything. You will need this documentation if you decide to file a formal grievance against her. Talk with your HR Director so they know this is happening, and to learn about your institution\u2019s faculty grievance policy. And, yes, read about how to deal with malignant narcissists. It\u2019s about setting clear boundaries and not personalizing their abuse \u2014 definitely easier said than done, I well know. Take care and good luck.",

Document everything in writing with dates and times and as much as you can remember during or immediately after meeting. If you have a union, contact them and [again if possible] request a union steward to accompany you to any private meetings. Or, alternatively, you could request that anything she wants to say be said in front of your coworkers. Ive found some of these types of distasteful people to immediately panic the minute you break out pen and paper during a conversation to take notes on what they say. Just some ideas to think about. \n\nNot to make this about me at all, just wanted to share that I too went to HR at a large company when dealing with a harassing manager who would corner me alone physically preventing me from leaving the area to repeatedly tell me how bad of an employee I was. When I contacted HR, the representative told my manager who said exactly what to the rep. My manager again cornered me at my locker alone with both arms on either side of me threatening to fire me for making up lies about him. I wonder if he knew there are cameras watching that area 24/7. My coworkers became like work parents and would signal me anytime he was in the area and would demand to be present for any conversations. The union failed me completely and so did HR. The only change happened when I contacted ethics and the federal partner union and threatened a lawsuit. The company promptly busted my manager down to a grunt mechanic again just like the rest of us. \n\nDon't give in, don't let them win. Whether you stay or leave is up to you, but no matter what you are strong enough and better than they will ever think.",
