  "text": "Having really enjoyed my past work in my industry makes me want to work for an NGO and not in academia. I do want to pursue a PhD though because I'm interested and generally enjoy being in academia. (Just don't want to work in it; I'd rather do other stuff!) I don't expect my paycheck to be higher as a result of the PhD. I just want to do it because it sounds interesting, I enjoy research, and a PhD is something I've always wanted to do. Is there anyone out there who did a PhD knowing from the start that you didn't want to work in academia? Is it a waste of effort/income-boosting years? Was it taboo to be open around professors about the fact that you didn't want to be in academia? Do you have regrets?",

Some PIs didn't really care, figured I would change my mind, were kind of supportive, or wouldn't touch me with a 10 foot pole if they knew I wanted to go into industry. You will probably run into a lot of professors that talk as if they know all about industry, but they really don't have a clue. I agree with the loss of income with postdoc positions.

None of these programs are the type where you apply directly to a lab, but rather decide after you are admitted. I\u2019ve gotten into one school (my safety school) but am still waiting on responses from the other two (complete radio-silence so far from them). \n\n1) do you think this will affect my chances of admission?\n2) is this something you think I will need to consider when picking a lab?",

Let me put it this way, if it does it's probably not the school you want to go to anyway. \n\n2) This is something you need to strongly consider when picking a lab. First, you want to make sure the work you'd be doing in lab will actually be applicable to the work in industry. Just because you have a PhD in organometallics won't necessarily make you qualified for industry jobs. Academic research can be very academic niche so keep that in mind. \n\nSecondly, you want to make sure your PI will support you. During grad school my roommate's PI would only act as a reference for them if they applied to academic jobs or post docs. They refused to help them in any way if they tried to apply for industry jobs. This PI was particularly horrible but there are some PIs out there who have similar views so, they aren't someone you want to work for. \n\nThirdly, if your PI has good contacts in industry it will help a lot. You can still get an industry job if they don't but it's *a lot* more work for yourself. ",

I know this is rare in some countries and I count myself fortunate to be in such a position.\n\nI've always wanted to teach Physics, so at the time I was applying to the PhD, I also applied to a PGCE (the UK masters qualification needed to be a teacher). I was offered both, initially I was offered a PhD project that was not my first choice but thankfully there were new staff starting in the same year and I ended up working with one of them (honestly the best thing to happen tbh). This all happened before I knew if I had been accepted onto the PGCE course! So I made the decision to see what research was like full time because I could always go back to do the PGCE.\n\nMy supervisor asked me within the first few months what my plans were for after the PhD. I was fairly honest and said that I was either going to stay in academia or pursue teaching. She was super supportive and just wanted to know so that she could do the best she could to get me relevant experience. Even when she asked me more recently what my plans were, she was happy to hear that I was applying for the PGCE again.\n\nConsidering that academic jobs are so competitive, I really think more supervisors should be supportive of alternate careers to academia.",

This is of course with the notion that you do and want to work hard. Academic setting exposes you to endless meetings and co-authoring possibilities, but you have to be able to say no and focus on your own thing.\n\nPer effort, academia allows you to undertake huge projects by your own. Anecdotally, I ran my own company before coming to academia, and I switched solely because venture capitalists did not want to fund my project, because it assumed so much basic research done. While venture capitalists see your effort as binary, a success or failure, academia on the other hand gets rewarded from progress towards the end goal and are as such, a lot more flexible with huge risks.\n\n\\> Was it taboo to be open around professors about the fact that you didn't want to be in academia? Do you have regrets?\n\nI am on my first year and I have said it openly. I do not work well with some postdocs. On the other hand, some really like me and give me a lot of freedom. I do not think it is a bad thing. There will be people from the both ends of the spectrum.

Do you want to retire early? Probably don't do a PhD, if it won't increase your salary. Do you want to do research-related work (including R&D)? A PhD could open up opportunities, even outside academia.\n\nIn many programs, the implicit assumption is that students intend to stay in academia, but that's certainly not universal. A colleague of mine is focusing on getting lots of small papers out during his PhD instead of aiming for a Nature/Science publication because his advisor told him that would be more valuable for the kinds of industry jobs he wants.",

It also increased my capacity to do research in my own school and to apply research.  In my field, only about half wanted to work in academia.  Honestly, it bothered me when I had a professor that has never worked in a K-12 environment.  I believe that in most academics should have some experience working within the field.  The professors that come from the field were a cut above all of the other professors.  \n\nAbsolutely no regrets.  ",

      "text": "I am near the end of the first year of my PhD in Europe, field could be vaguely described as environmental policy studies. I developed my own PhD research project and am funding it via a scholarship, as opposed to most PhD candidates here who apply for a PhD position within a funded research project at university. This is directly linked to my main motivation for doing the PhD: I am genuinely interested in the research I am doing and conducting it as a PhD research seemed to be the most suitable way.\n\nI could imagine staying in academia afterwards, but could also envision to start working for some international organisation involved with my field of research (very much related to international development etc, so there are quite some possibilities). Both my supervisor and the selection committee for the scholarship naturally asked about my plans for after the PhD, and I was quite honest with both of them: I don't know yet, both ways (academia / not academia) are possible, and please just ask me again in two years when I actually have some experience with proper academia and can evaluate whether I like it or not. Got the scholarship, so it was obviously not a problem there. I am also very fortunate to have (chosen) an awesome supervisor who is supporting me either way, making sure that I get ample opportunities to network both within and outside of academia.",

      "text": "I started my PhD a bit uncertain about academia to being with, but learnt very quickly that I absolutely do not want to work in academia. My primary aim is to work in visual science communication, visualisation and illustration - it's part of my illustration business outside of my PhD and I have been pretty successful with that. Ideally I'd like to freelance full time or work for a company in that field, but that will take more work to get to that stage. I am also happy to work in industry (i.e. marine biosecurity) or do teaching also.\n\nAs far as my supervisor's thoughts...not sure yet. She is supportive of my business outside my PhD but is definitely very academic inclined, and I have seen her say that she is disappointed about her PhD students who have gone into industry or elsewhere. I do regret some days where I feel the process has hindered me, but overall I would regret leaving my PhD more because I genuinely am passionate enough to see my research to the end. I also feel my PhD has benefited me and given me a foot in the door that I couldn't get otherwise. And it provided consistent salary for 3+ years (hard to get in the ecology field at any rate). \n\nI choose to keep my options quiet with -some- tenured professors just because I don't want anymore negativity or judgement about my career choices (copped that my whole life). At the end of the day: it's my choice to do a PhD, my choice to choose my career paths, and my choice to weigh up options between passion and what gets food on the table. And honestly, academia ain't it for me.",

              "text": "Of course I don't. You only own the decision on who to select, and I would only select those interested in research / staying in academia (which in my field is nearly 1 to 1).\n\nThe reason you take on PhD students is to train researchers, to continue your academic lineage, to grant prestige to the university who granted the PhD through the success of the PhD student. Having students who don't follow through on their side of the bargain is an enormous waste of resources. Now, if after 5 years they don't want to stay, that's fine! People learn and move on with their lives, I don't begrudge that at all. But if you don't seem interested in staying in academia from the beginning, there's no way I'd select you.\n\nImagine you were on a hiring committee for NASA. Astronaut training is enormously expensive (time and money wise). Wouldn't you only hire people who actually then want to become astronauts and not just those would enjoy the super cool experience of astronaut training?\n\nOr for the analogy does not hold. Undergrad or masters education. For an undergrad or masters education, you are paying the university more than they spend on you (not including scholarships). Therefore the institution doesn't really need to bother caring about what your reasons are for the degree, it benefits either way. Therefore it selects primarily on merit. This is not the case for the PhD, most of the returns to the institution are intangible (reputation). Therefore it shouldn't just select on merit (test scores, grades, prior research experience etc.) but who actually aligns with the goals of the university (publish research, become professors at prestigious places etc.).",
