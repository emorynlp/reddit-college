  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI work at the Univ of Michigan with a cloud-based software called [ViewPoint](https://ai.umich.edu/software-applications/viewpoint/). It helps you improve students' engagement, knowledge, and soft skills by letting you effortlessly create and conduct immersive and realistic custom role-playing simulations. This innovative tool empowers students to make collaborative decisions in multi-stakeholder situations.\n\nPlease join us next month to hear Liz Gerber, ViewPoint inventor & UM Public Policy professor, discuss the tool's positive impacts on instructor & student experiences. She will showcase a sampling of illustrative simulations that have been implemented across disciplines such as social work, public health, public policy, and business.\n\nFind out more about ViewPoint in these videos: [Sanger Leadership Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzPNeU0ISNw&t=57s) and [Simulation-based learning in criminal justice & criminology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywd4O_FOFaY&t=36s).\n\n**WEBINAR REGISTRATION**\n\n**- Thursday, 12/2 @ 4-5 PM ET:** [Register](https://umich.zoom.us/webinar/register/2116372828798/WN__QgUAilKStySnA9dsMO7gQ)\n\n\\- **Monday, 12/13 @ 12-1 pm ET:** [Register](https://umich.zoom.us/webinar/register/4316372831131/WN_PKDv-j6FQyqgegqdDpLhvw)\n\nThanks & please feel free to DM me if you have any questions!
