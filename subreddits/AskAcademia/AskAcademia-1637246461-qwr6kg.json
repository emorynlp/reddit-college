  "title:": "Survey about Reference Management Systems",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am reaching out on behalf of a group of master students from LMU Munich to ask for your support for a university project course. \n\nwe are currently researching the topic Reference Management Systems (RMS) (also known as Literature Management Systems like **Citavi, EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero and many more**). We are assuming that most of you have probably used a reference management system at some point and we would like to find out what you think about these tools and specifically about Mendeley.   \n\nFor this purpose, we would like you to participate in our short survey (no prior knowledge necessary). We would be very grateful if you could give us some insights into how you have already dealt with these tools. **Here you can directly access the survey:** [https://lmubwl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5ooyZuRBe9GIw62](https://lmubwl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ooyZuRBe9GIw62)\n\n**Thank you very much in advance for your participation! Also , feel free to leave a feedback here or at the end of the survey :)**",
