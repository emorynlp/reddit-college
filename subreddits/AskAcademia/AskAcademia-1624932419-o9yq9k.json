  "title:": "How much choice do you have in where your job is as a professor?",
  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm a current undergraduate student studying physics and math, but planning to continue into grad school by studying atmospheric science. I'm strongly considering a career in academia as I believe I would love the balance between performing research and teaching students. One of my main concerns though is that I wouldn't get much of a choice in where I would end up geographically. For example, I'm from the midwest USA and would love to remain in the area whenever I get a career (to be somewhat close to family, etc.).\n\nHow much of a choice do you really get in where you ended up geographically? Is the job market competitive enough that you ultimately took the first opportunity that came up no matter the location? Or did you wait for an opportunity in your ideal location/region of the world/country? Or was it somewhere in the middle? I'm aware this is probably entirely different for everyone, but I'm curious what the range has been like for everyone.\n\n Being in the field of STEM I'd specifically love to hear from others in this field, but would greatly appreciate help from any areas of study. I'd love to hear about what your experience of getting into the career was like and if you have any suggestions! Any advice and comments would be greatly appreciated!",

The person you replied to is in CS - its very rare for people to do multiple post docs there. Most people will just do 1 (maybe 2 at most)  and then get a TT job. Some might even get a TT straight after their PhD. Its hard to convince people to tolerate shit living conditions when they know they could easily be earning $150k tomorrow at a tech company.\n\nIn general if you find you have to do a lot of postdocs then its maybe time to ask yourself why (and the answer might unfortunately be that youre just not strong enough to get a TT job \\[at least at a good institution\\] or picked a field where there just arent any academic jobs). I know its field dependent but personally If I didnt have TT offers after my first post-doc then I'd just have fucked things off and went into industry. No way I'd spend my 30s bouncing around between low paid jobs in different cities in the hope that someone would eventually employ me, that isnt any kind of life.",

Unpopular opinion (amongst academics and this sub) but that's a personal failing.\n\nSure, you can argue these people dont deserve sympathy on a personal level since they have made their own choices. But there is also a structural issue where its extremely bad for the pursuit of science to have a lot of the smartest/best people self-select out of academia due to the bad lifestyle, and to create incentives for those who remain to do rushed/sloppy research since essentially everything about modern academia incentivises doing shitty work to get high impact publications. This is especially true given the current replication crisis where its now abundantly clear that many/most papers in top journals (especially in social \"science\") are just really careless work by researchers that mostly just care about getting papers published rather than about finding truth. This is directly incentivised by basically every aspect of the modern academic career/hiring process. Doing painstaking careful work is actively discouraged at every level since (at best) it will result in slower publications and (at worst) will lead to you constantly having to abandon projects that dont work, rather than torturing the data until you get publishable results.",

If you don't start saving until your 40s you have to tuck away like 10X per month to reach the same end goal as someone who started in their 20s. A decade of missed savings/interest might not seem important when you are 30, but when you are in your 50s it takes on a whole different meaning.",

The way I see it, the problem with not going into the PhD right out of undergrad/masters is that a few years in industry is going to significantly impact which grad school I can possibly end up in. And since universities seem to prefer younger academics for faculty positions (at least this is common in my country), waiting doesn't necessarily help in an already competitive environment. \n\nSo if someone certainly wants to at least do a PhD to have a shot at academia (like me) I think there really is no choice. Because I'm always going to be competing with people who didn't take a few years to do work/see what industry is like, in between.  I can try putting whatever is left over from my allowance/stipend into an SIP but no amount of understanding compounding helps really.",

This means that you're not really increasing the danger of getting age-discriminated against later if you spend a couple years in industry between undergrad and PhD.\n\nThat said, because that discrimination is an issue for you, make sure you always prioritize staying in good health through your 20s and 30s. Exercise a little and (more important) eat sensibly, don't overeat very often. Being overweight and in poor health (leading to skin or hair issues) will make you look old way faster, and those things are difficult to reverse quickly because they're (usually!) the cumulative effects of years of choices. \n\nSo as you do your PhD, make sure to always get enough sleep, and have more healthy-cooking days than takeout-dinner days.",

In my field, once you reach prof level, research is really writing grants, committees, mentoring grad students.  My PhD mentor (and others) did the basic minimum when it came to teaching so they could focus on research.  Depending on the university, most of the tenure packet focuses on research (papers, grants, presentations), graduating grad students, and teaching scores on the end of the year evals.  Some universities are more teaching focused but the larger ones aren't.  It's also why profs don't always make great teachers or lecturers.

It's still not the same amount of choice as people in normal jobs - more like 'I'm okay living in India or Europe but not Brazil' and 'I'm okay with the Southeast/Northeast US or Upper Midwest but not the West Coast.'",

Then, I built my portfolio and eventually made the move to someplace that was acceptable to my partner.\n\nIt is a lot easier to get a TT job if you have a TT job (assuming you're a productive researcher) than if you're unemployed or in a contingent position. There are a few things you can do to improve your chances of ending up somewhere desirable geographically:\n\n1. Go to a highly-ranked / prestigious PhD program with a well known advisor. Don't choose your PhD program based on anything other than reputation (e.g., location, stipend). Repeat for postdoc if that's a thing in your field.\n2. Apply very widely for your first TT job, and assuming you don't get an offer in your desired location, take the best offer available (best as in most prestigious school), regardless of geography. The better your current job is, the more attractive you will be when you move.\n3. Stay very research active. I cannot emphasize this enough. The minute you slow down in publishing is when you become unmarketable.\n4. Network with people in your desired geographic locations and let them know you are interested in moving if the right opportunity would arise. In contrast to your first job (which was the result of applying very widely), your second job will almost certainly be a targeted application; ideally, you won't be applying \"cold\".\n\nEdit: to be clear, none of this is easy.

Its a really bad idea to move to a brand new city in your 30s since making  close friends at that age is extremely hard and its just a recipe for loneliness in general.\n\nBest approach is to do your PhD at a prestigious university in a city where there are a lot of universities nearby  so you can spend your 20s building up a life and then hopefully get a job nearby (or just go into industry if you dont get one).

It\u2019s a lot easier to get a position in a  smaller regional school, especially in less desirable rural areas.\n\nAll of the candidates that make it to on-site interviews at my current institution (R1, top 10) have 5-6 papers (fewer if one is in CNS), usually a NIH F32 or even a K99/R00 (much less common). I know multiple people with 1 postdoc paper and no independent funding that have gotten positions at small schools in Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, etc. the pay is abysmal however, even less than the NIH pay for postdocs but they are tenure track positions.",

Offer came late in the season so there would likely not have been alternatives coming along, though I did receive 1 request to interview a few months after I accepted the job offer.\n\nDespite the above, I did avoid applications to areas where we were not all interested in moving to, we enjoy where we live now, and the environment of my institution is ideal for me. We had the flexibility of 4 countries thanks to my wife's multi-nationality and her working in a field with credentials that could be recognized in the other countries.\n\nIf I had stayed where I was during my post-doc, or where I had done my PhD, I would have needed to rely on sessional teaching to remain in academia.",

My first (tenure track faculty position) job was halfway across the country in **B** (small liberal arts college), which was  in a desirable place but the job kind of sucked.... a few years later **C** (R2) called, I got the faculty position, and we moved there, where I did most of my early-to-mid-career stuff.  I am back at **A** now as a soft funded research professor/scientist where I want to be after a research breakthrough. So it took a while, but it also involved 'world class research results' - so take that into consideration.\n\nIf you get a PhD in atmospheric science you should do all right. You probably won't end up staying in the first place you get a job unless you are super lucky (in the sense that you are where you want to be and happy there). If you really like research there sure is plenty to be done and there is federal money to do it. But funding is horribly competitive like with most fields.",

Part of the reason (aside from stiff competition, not sure what it looks like in your field) is because you just have to go wherever the job is, and it takes a heavy financial investment to go through PhD without much financial return. If you prioritize family, lifestyle, and your location over your job, it\u2019s probably not a good profession to pursue.",

      "text": "Most important factors are undergrad GPA, GMAT score, what subject and specialty, economic cycle, and most important the prestige of the department and supervising professor.\n\nEspecially for academia, hiring in public universities is driven by state tax revenues. When State revenues are down there are hiring freezes, so fewer job openings for a more or less constant supply of graduates.\n\nIf you major in a high demand subject, such as many STEM and Business majors (finance and accounting) as a student of a professor highly ranked nationally there's considerable flexibility in where you work. If you develop a good publication record, then that latitude will grow, as will your pay. This is for research universities, of course.\n\nIf teaching is more your cup of tea, there are more positions available in 2-year and 4-year teaching colleges. I don't know much about those opportunities, but there are lots more positions available. The teaching load is a lot higher there.\n\nI had plenty of offers as an undergraduate electrical engineering major way back years ago. Many years later I went back for a PhD in statistics. Plenty of job offers also, but due to my parents health, I needed to stay geographically constrained. I took a year of teaching as a visiting assistant professor at the University I graduated from to have more flexibility in where I found a permanent job. Found one only an hour away from my parents the next year.\n\nIn short, it boils down to supply and demand. Some of the choices you make will have a strong influence in how appealing you are in the job market. When you're considering where to go to school ask where they have placed their recent graduates. That will help you know what your prospects are.\n\nHope this helps.",
