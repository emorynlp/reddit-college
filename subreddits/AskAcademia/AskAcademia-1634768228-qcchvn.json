  "title:": "How can I finish my thesis?",
  "text": "So after this horrific year, my studies ended up being terminated after 3 years. Thing is I was already in deep into my thesis, and I\u2019ll never get round to finishing it (the uni I\u2019m looking to do a credit transfer doesn\u2019t finish with a thesis/dissertation project, so I wouldn\u2019t continue it there). I\u2019ve already got all the research, and the method written up, but I\u2019ll never get round to carrying out the experiment itself, but I don\u2019t want to just drop and forget about it. Is there a way I can finish it off without results, as a scientific paper or review article? I don\u2019t know what sources to look at to help me go in the right direction, or what type of paper I\u2019d be looking at trying to write. \n\nEdit: I was doing a bachelors in microbiology and currently hold a diploma of higher education (what you get after two years towards a bachelors in the UK)\n\nApologies of this is the wrong sub to ask. Thanks.",

      "text": "I'm unclear what you've been doing for 3 years that you've started writing a thesis but you have no results? What is this thesis for? I think it would help you get more advice if you gave specifics.\n\nHowever, based on what you've written I don't see a way to finish the thesis. Theses aren't generally published and are submitted to universities for assessment towards a degree. If you were to write more who would you send it to? And you don't have any results and without results it's not a thesis. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by you did all the research, do you mean you've reviewed the literature? If you've done that you could write it up as a review article. You'd need to look at the author guidelines on different journals to see what they say about reviews and what's required.",
