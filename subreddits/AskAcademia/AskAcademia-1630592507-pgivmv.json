  "title:": "Terms like \"presentism\" used in the teaching of history - how to present historical figures as the real people they were, flaws and all, without students taking it out of context and losing sight of things?",
  "text": "What are some of the \"buzzwords\" or trends in the teaching of history that are worth bringing up in the first week of class with students? I have taught a course on the history of the chiropractic profession for over 14 years now and I try really hard to present a full picture of the characters and events and not do the standard, whitewashed gloss over that makes these real people seem like they were perfect. I think it adds a lot of interest to the stories and fills in a lot of the blanks that people, like myself, who were taught the standard, scrubbed version, have questions about. At the same time, students will often misunderstand this, claiming that I \"hate the profession\" (couldn't be further from the truth) or that \"so and so was a piece of garbage and now I'm questioning my choices...\" even though these events are 100+ years in the past and will have no bearing on any of these students' clinical effectiveness.   \n\n\nIn my first week or two of class (15 week trimesters), how do I address things like presentism and try to balance not whitewashing historical figures and events while also not having students take them out of context? Are there other \"buzzwords\" in addition to presentism I should be reading about to educate myself? My goal is to present these historical figures as real people, flaws and all, and not just gloss over things as is typically done in my profession. Any help much appreciated, thanks!",

      "text": "I mean, I don't think there's any way to avoid these things. History is powerful, and people like myths. If you use history to skewer a myth, it'll be hard for a student to adjust if their approach to the subject is for mythical reasons. This is true physics as it is chiropractic; physicists get very uncomfortable with \"true\" (human) portrayals of Newton, Galileo, and Einstein, and can also see them as \"attacks on the profession\" and so on.\n\nThe way I deal with this personally, as a historian of science, is to always point out in advance that a) all people are \"real people\" and are just as flawed as the rest of us (and we should be suspicious of any expectation that people be saints or perfect geniuses), b) that just because the history of something isn't perfect doesn't mean that everything associated with it is junk (I mean, what on earth would satisfy that requirement?), and c) that understanding the real stories behind what happened is useful for thinking about what one would want to do differently if one were in these situations today (which is pretty much an embrace of presentism, in its own way \u2014 it is about using history as a positive force for the present and future). \n\nSince you know what the possible negative responses are, I think it's worth just addressing them on the first day of class. Explain your own position on things, as much as it matters. (I often talk about the history of religion in my classes, and I make clear that I'm not doing it as someone advocating for, or against, any particular religion, or religion as a whole, that I'm just regarding it as a historical, cultural phenomena to be studied.) It's worth just highlighting to them what they might think, and why you think that might or might not be valid. \n\nYou also just need to accept that you are not going to be in control of what lessons they draw from the history. Maybe they will re-think their choices. That's not on you. Your job in teaching them the history is not to make them comfortable. They will have to synthesize this new information into their world-view. That's a large part of what education is, in the end. (And let's also just admit that some of them might have been re-thinking them _before_ you talked to them. This happens frequently with students, and sometimes you're just the excuse.) Some of them will just reject it no matter what you say. Again, I think the best you can do is point out that you are aware that this is a possible response, and explain why you do or don't think that's a valid interpretation.",

      "text": "I think perhaps you're approaching this in a way that won't be the most helpful to you. Teaching a balanced historical narrative isn't about \"buzzwords\" to use or avoid as it is just showing that history is complex, and the figures you're talking about are just human beings. You can do that effectively by using varied sources. When there is an issue to address (for example, the role of race and gender in medical practice) you can present those readings and give students the opportunity to engage in that. If you give students both sides of that narrative (on one hand, important discoveries, and on the other, problems within that), you should be able to guide them into understanding that it isn't a story about someone being good or bad.",

      "text": "The idea that someone or something is a \"product of the times\" to contextualized flawed behavior, bigotry, etc is easily the biggest one and it's one that permeates a lot of conversations about history.\n\nIt posits that progress is inherently linear and that the things discussed were beyond us, but it also erases people in those same time periods. \n\nAs an example, if someone grew up in Jim Crow, that doesn't somehow contextualize their bigotry as if people in that time were just inherently bigoted by virtue of the time period. In practice, they had a vested interest in upholding white supremacy and made the choice to do so and they grew up in the same timeframe as the civil rights era.\n\nIt's a really frustrating struggle for women, people of color, lgbt people, etc to have to deal with this because there's no level of engagement or people act like you're somehow judging historical figures by present standards as if people only recently discovered these issues. \n\n\"New concept\" and \"New concept to you\" are two very different things, and a great deal of history is built on deliberate erasure. There's also a difference between something being normalized by society and something being acceptable.\n\nIf I can give a direct application, the University president of my alma mater refuses to remove the image of a known abuser because they think it's unfair to judge them by modern day standards as if people only recently discovered that abuse is unacceptable.\n\nIt says more about the students who have a lot of unlearning to do if they take criticizing historical figures or applying critical thought to their actions as \"hating the profession.\" With the number of historical disparities that permeate most of academia, they're doing themselves a disservice if they're not willing to come to grips with having to be critical of the material and people they're engaging with.",

I love your approach, and I think it's similar to my own.\n\nSo, in my intro class, we read William Faulkner's \"A Rose for Emily.\" We talk about his craft of story, the Southern Gothic aesthetic, his influence. You know. All the stuff that people have focused on, generally, in his work and legacy.\n\nBUT. We also talk about how he was a supremacist and racist in his personal life, and we talk about how that shows up in the work. We also talk about some objectively abhorrent things he said in regards to race. I think it's really important to have those conversations, but I also think it's important to make room for both to be true, if that makes sense.\n\nSome people say we shouldn't teach Faulkner. Some people make apologies for his racism because \"it was just the time.\" Either way, I try to remind students that there's room for both. Was Faulkner, a white man born in Mississippi not long after the Civil War, a product of his time? Yes. Some would argue he was even rather progressive for a white man in the Jim Crow South. Did he also believe in white supremacy and have some ideas that are just objectively racist and awful? Oh, hell yeah. Does that mean his work has no value to us anymore? I don't think so. I try to make it clear that we're not reading his story to celebrate him, and we're not talking about his racism to defame him. We're getting the whole story. Ultimately, it's up to the student to decide how they measure those against each other as a person, but as scholars and professionals, we have to see the full picture and recognize they exist together. \n\nAnd I wouldn't shy away from the reality that some people excuse it and make apologies, but seeing it as a slight on the whole field is just the different side of the same coin. The most informed way to see it as future members of the field is with both in mind...and it's okay to struggle with it. The way they see the issue professionally doesn't reflect their personal values. And when necessary, I'm authentic about the way I make the distinction. Faulkner's racism makes it hard for me to enjoy his literature or admire his accomplishments as a human being. As a professional, though, I do recognize that there are things to learn from him, and I think we have to learn those things with his flaws in mind to reap the most benefit.\n\nNot sure if this translates well to your field, but I admire your approach, and I hope it goes well!",
