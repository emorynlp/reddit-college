  "title:": "Journal article vs Book Chapter",
  "text": "I am an undergraduate senior majoring in biotechnology. My university requires us to do projects during the final year. Because of the pandemic, our project had been changed to a Lit review and I have been working on it for about a couple of months now.  \n\nInitially, the plan was to do a journal article and my manuscript is also tailored to the scope of the journal. But my PI suddenly decides to submit it as a book chapter because people have been submitting Lit reviews during the pandemic in high numbers and publishing the manuscript might be difficult.\n\n1. How exactly is a book chapter different from a journal article? \n2. How should I change my manuscript for a book chapter? (citations etc) \n3. Is a book chapter less credible than a journal article? (since this would be my first article and will be included in my CV when I am applying for masters)\n4. Do people usually submit their manuscript to more than one journal to get a higher chance of publishing it?\n\nAny insight is appreciated. Thank you for your time.",

      "text": "The core of this is a question for your PI because it will depend on the book and editors you are submitting too.\n\nThe credibility of book chapter vs journals is field dependent but in general journal articles are better regarded as they're fresher research and peer reviewed (book chapters can be peer reviewed but they're not always)\n\nfor 4 Yes, start with your dream journal and work down until accepted",
