  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD candidate studying cognitive psychology, specifically attention and perception.\n\nI enjoy research but I know the academic job market is nearly non existent.\n\nI have worked in three internships and did my best to keep an open mind but I kept being disappointed and uninterested in the work (usability testing for particular product).\n\nWhat options are there for someone who is an academic but will not likely be able to work as a professor at a university?",

      "text": "I am not in this field, but my best friend has her PhD in cognitive psychology. About 2-3 years into a post doc, she got frustrated with trying to target an academic job and found a job in measurement for an assessment company where she validates cognitive assessments and publishes the findings (not in journal articles usually, but more like psych assessment books). It\u2019s been a great job for her. Six figure salary to start with and just as much flexibility and autonomy that I have as a Professor.",

          "text": "I\u2019d have to take some time to list them all but essentially experiment creation and data analysis with Python but my coding ability is no we\u2019re near that of a programmer. I have writing and oral presentation skills. I can work independently and set self made deadlines. I can read academic papers and generate new ideas. And more I\u2019m probably not remembering at the moment.\n\nI want to do academic research outside of academia and that\u2019s probably just not a thing that exists.",

              "text": "Any generic data analyst role would be good. You have programming hard skills, show the aptitutue to learn other technical languages, and also you can translate/communicate to different audiences.\n\nA digital marketing role which is geared towards production/analyst has the above, but you can also have some of your psychology background help you, i.e. behavioural economics and nudges basically underpins most digital marketing nowadays. Plus most A/B are just glorified \"online\" randomly controlled trials, so if you know your research design and methods you'll shine.\n\nYou can do \"academic\" research outside of academia. I work industry and have published a few stuff at conference proceedings, journals, etc. I collaborate with some old/new contacts who I know from networking. Plus on the computer science/social media adjacent journals you find a few researchers who have published. I.e. a researcher at Microsoft Research co-publishing with an academic.\n\nGenerally it is a bit of a joke that most the soc sci grads who did their thesis on/using social media data ended up working for Google, Facebook, Microsoft Research, etc making big money.",
