  "title:": "Just got asked to be a reviewer for the first time during my second year of a PhD. Should I accept?",
  "text": " Long story short, I got my Master's thesis published at the very beginning of my PhD program last year (both at institutions in the United States). Earlier this week I got an email from a journal asking me to be a peer reviewer of a research paper that is on a pretty similar topic. Fortunately I had a professor last year who would give us papers to read as homework and have us write a referee report on them, so I have that bit of experience with the process, what their general tone/flavor should be, etc.\n\nI know it's not a task to take lightly by any means, would it be irresponsible/unethical of me to accept this role when I'm not even halfway through my PhD? Also what are some of the pros of being a reviewer at this particular stage of my career (and cons for that matter, but I figure the main one there is that it's a lot of work). **Any** and all advice for someone who was just asked to be a reviewer for the first time would be appreciated!",

But if you haven't seen too many paper reviews, please consider running your first couple of reviews past a more experienced mentor just to make sure it hits the right notes and isn't too hung up on minutiae (this is a common issue with less experienced reviewers). But you're at a good stage to start reviewing in my opinion.",

Perhaps show the paper and your review to your supervisor or an experienced colleague and talk through any 'issues' you identified - to make sure that your review is neither overly critical nor overly positive in tone. That's the tricky bit - making an assessment of how severe the problems are, and  communicating this to the author in a supportive way.  New reviewers are sometimes too fierce!",

(A rare case for an uncommon field where I\u2019ve published, but still. As review comments are anonymized, the authors don\u2019t know, any more than I know much about them.) \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m presently working on a review now. \n\nAdvice for the review itself: focus on your strengths. If grammar is one, comment on grammar; if not, provide commentary from the perspective of your area of expertise. I also often find reviews interesting, due to looking up subjects that an author touches upon that I don\u2019t know so well.",

      "text": "I never understood why anyone would make a big deal about reviewing a paper. It is part of academic life. If you are a PhD student, then you are also part of an academic community. How far into your are into your PhD does not matter. There are PhD students on their 4th year that have less publications and academic expertise than highly motivated first-year students.\n\nAs an associate editor in a journal, I invite people for reviews when their profile matches the research that needs to be reviewed; i.e. people who are qualified to pass expert judgment. I will assume that the editor did the same or someone recommended you to them who knows your work. In any case, the editor\u2014who takes the ultimate responsibility\u2014judged that you are qualified and that is all that matters.\n\nThe 'ethical' thing to do is to review at least as many papers as you submit every year, otherwise, the peer-review system won't work. There are some individualistic benefits of being a reviewer during your PhD:\n\n1. You may learn something from them and get a new research idea. Even your review may turn out to be the basis of a future paper \u2014some journals in philosophy ethics, allow reviewers to directly publish their reviews.\n2. You get to experience the process from the inside. You will learn how reviewers think\u2014by being one yourself\u2014and how any discussion/rebuttal phase works. These lessons may help you write better papers in the future.\n3. It is a line on your CV.  anything more than a postdoc position\u2014or even when hiring a postdoc that is already in a postdoc position\u2014I expect to see that the person acted as a journal or conference referee.\n\nAs a PhD students supervisor, I may pass review requests to my students (as my supervisor passed to me) as I think it is  a great way for them to learn. The negative is that you spend time away from research directly related to your dissertation.\n\nNow, how to write a good review:\n\n* I found this guide from Wiley's quite useful as a starting point: [https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html](https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html)\n* Ask your advisor to proofread your review.\n* ECRss tend to be harsherrors, do not be unnecessarily harsh. :-)\n\nAfter you submit your review, spend some time reading the other reviewers' comments. They may help you identify things you may have missed \u2014or disagree with them!",

I would be unlikely to select a more junior PhD student unless I knew them personally or I was directly familiar with their work.",
