  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI am planning to do PhD at a university in Australia but in a different uni, is there any tips to find a good professor. My major is Chemical Eng.\n\nThere is this one professor that is interested in my profile, but I never worked with him before. How do I know he is good.\n\nOn scholar.google, his h-index is 55 with over 10k citations. Is he good in his field?",

      "text": "I think you're asking the wrong question. Don't ask is he good, ask can I succeed in his lab? Academia is full of highly awarded professors who have left scorched earth behind them. There's no point in being in a lab where the PI wins a Nobel, if they provide no supervision or mentoring and everyone is bullied and fighting with each other and 5 years down the line you're submitting a bare bones thesis, you're exhausted, demoralised and arguing over authorship on a paper. Better to be with an average prof who cares about their students, and supports you to success.",
