IDK, maybe my field (composition/rhetoric) has a different way of thinking about feedback; we largely don't use conference QandA to tear people down.  Criticism should be constructive, not destructive ffs.  On a funny note, my father-in-law runs a small military museum in a college town and was invited to attend an academic history conference at the university. Apparently, he was so horrified by how mean the historians were to each other (hostile questioning and such) that he started to worry that was what I was going through every time I presented at a conference. He was very relieved to hear that my conferences were not like that!",

You can't have sessions overrunning so participants get no coffee breaks, or 15 minutes to eat lunch.\n\nParticipants need to be able to efficiently get food and coffee in breaks. I would much prefer an option for not-great food that is faster than needing to sit for an hour and a half to get a sit-down meal when I really need to catch up on emails, work on my talk or take some personal time in the lunch break.\n\nA good conference dinner and some evening activities are also great for building connections. For example I've been to some good evening poster sessions with freely flowing local beer and nibbles facilitating a well attended poster session with lots of great exchange. Ideally posters should be hanging around in the coffee break area for a couple of days before the session so people get a chance to look around and decide which posters they specifically want to talk to people at.",

The main advantage of going to a conference is to network, form collaborations, and get feedback on your work. It's very hard to do that at some of the big conferences when you have 10,000+ attendees spread out over hundreds of sessions. So if you're organising one I would say make sure there are plenty of opportunities for attendees to interact and ask each other questions, rather than just having an endless blitz of presentations and posters.",

I think the biggest thing I wished was different was giving us more break times in between all the events, and maybe less events overall. I understand the value of having so many talks, but at the same time, conferences are also places to foster networking. I felt like I didn't have the time or energy to do so at the end of each day. Additionally, it wasn't very accessible for people with joint issues, as we would basically have like 5 minutes to run between conference rooms on the other end of the building or up/down 2 flights of stairs, so more time in between would've immensely helped with that.",

      "text": "Probably two experiences (both at virtual conferences) jump out at me as bad so far:\n\n1) I was presenting at a famous international conference in my discipline; our 20-minute talks were pre-recorded, and we would attend a live Q&A session on the day. I went to one of the morning Q&A sessions, and every single chair expected presenters to have a truncated 5-minute version of their talk ready (including slides etc.), which wasn't stipulated in the conference guidelines. Everyone then panicked and many presenters ended up repeating their 20-minute talks as they couldn't ad-lib at such short notice. I think every single session ended up running over by at least half an hour. I was lucky to be in one of the last sessions, so I could cobble something together, but it sucked to have that sudden stress when we thought we were all set.\n\n2) A small postgrad conference I was presenting at had issues with many of their presenters: either they didn't respond to their acceptance emails and never showed up, or had terrible connection issues. I couldn't attend for the whole conference as I was teaching that day, and when I turned up at my timeslot, the screen told me that everyone was on lunch break. I messaged one of the organisers, and they told me that they had been forced to move everyone's slot forward 1.5 hours to fill the vacant times, so I had long since missed mine. They never sent me any warning emails or suggested that this might happen during the organisation process.",

      "text": "At my second or third conference, I didn't get any questions after my talk. It was a bit surprising because first it was a good and interesting talk for the audience and second if nobody asks a question then the chair was asking something for sure. I mentioned this to my advisor and he told me that I could have gotten a few questions if I hadn't leave there in 3 seconds. Apparently I left the stage as soon as I finished the presentation haha. He is a chill guy so didn't care and people asked questions in-person. So it was fine overall. But boy, I used to very nervous at presentations and I'm still quite uncomfortable so I work a lot for the presentation.",

      "text": "Speakers not staying to their allotted time limit.\n\nI was one of three speakers in a session. We were each given 20 minutes for our talk. The first speaker spoke for 45 minutes. The facilitator did not enforce the time limit upon this person. As the last speaker, I was rushed because there was hardly any time left in the session. As a result, you could hear the nerves in my voice, I stumbled over my words, and I even skipped over entire sections of my talk (all the more mortifying for me, as a distinguished and respected scholar in my field was sitting in the audience). And it wouldn't have been that way had I been given my allotted amount of time to present my paper.",

Everyone attended everyone else's presentations then had active conversation afterward, sometimes referencing other presentations from earlier in the day. \"I had a question about _____, now John, you talked about this yesterday so maybe you'll have a comment too\" It was nice. \n\nWorst was a huge conference with a big emphasis on networking. As soon as people learned I was an adjunct at a school they hadn't heard of they almost physically turned away to find someone else to chat with. That one also had terrible wifi that half of the hundreds of attendees couldn't connect to.",

I\u2019m trying to understand if you\u2019re asking about our personal experiences AT a conference or if you\u2019re asking about we experience THE conference. Does that make sense? Like the difference between the time I had a PowerPoint with spelling errors and how awful that was to see on the projection vs. the lack of guests at an 8am panel because the organizers, for some awful reason, thought people would want to be at a panel that early. One is me, the other is the conference organizers.",
