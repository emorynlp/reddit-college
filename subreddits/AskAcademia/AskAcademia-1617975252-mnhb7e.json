  "text": "Okay so I do understand that self citing is important because it helps you show that you've done stuff based on the same.... but it's a well known fact that self citing increases h index and impact factor even though it hasn't been cited by any other researcher.\n\n\nFor example I found this Physics research paper, which has approximately 120 citations, out of which 110 citations are just self citations, so the same researcher( I do not prefer to name)  does the same thing for every paper of his.....\n\nIn turn the h index of the author comes out to be 30 / 40 , so me being not a physics student, If I need to know whether the research is legit, how do I find it?\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the meaningful responses, my question has been answered ;)",

The advantages of having more citations and a higher h-index far outweigh the disadvantages of the odd person looking at your stats and thinking you cite yourself too much.

For sure, and these are the kinds of games you have to play in the clown world that is modern academic if you want to survive, unless you already have tenure of course.",
