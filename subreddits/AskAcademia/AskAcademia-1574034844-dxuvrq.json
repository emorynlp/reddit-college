I didn't publish in anything prestigious, rather I used the proceedings of an international talk I presented in.\n\nI don't really know how you can start a research, but for me what helped was the support I had and not being too ambitious as to where to get it published.\n\nBe greedy, know what you want, but don't be too ambitious or too harsh on yourself either.\n\nBut really, have a prof to help you through everything, that's what made the biggest difference. I wouldn't have been able to do it without help",

                  "text": "My paper was on vowel harmony in the Votic language, from. The Finnic family. The most interesting aspect of this  project is twofold. First, I abstracted away from morphological domains and instead used aspects of logic and set theory to represent phonological segments. This means that we are not using morphology to account for phonological behaviour. For example, we cannot say that \"vowels in a root\" do not harmonize as a solution. It's a descriptive fact, but it is not an account. We can, however, say that vowels of a certain set do not harmonize, and this set is based on phonological features. \n\n\nThe second, and related aspect of this project is that, by viewing phonological segments and natural classes as sets, I was able to model vowel harmony through the use of set theoretical operations. (unification and subtraction for example). \n\nBy doing this, I was able to account for irregularities in Votic vowel harmony (transparency and neutrality) that had either been badly accounted for (arbitrary or ad hoc assumptions), or not accounted for at all (neutral vowels that do not harmonize) in the literature. \n\nDown the line, I really like this framework, but I don't know how viable it is. I just want to push it as far as I can.",
