  "title:": "What options do I have outside of academia?",
  "text": "I finished my PhD in curriculum and instruction specializing in social studies education/teacher education this past May at a top 20 program in the U.S. I had a three job talks last year at R1 universities but nothing materialized. I'm currently doing a post doc at the same university I graduated from but in a different department. My post doc is funded for three years.\n\nThe job market is shaping up to be even worse than last year and I'm losing optimism that I'm going to land a TT position anywhere. I was a high school teacher before getting my PhD and returning to that is always a last resort, but what other options do I have outside of academia? Most government (state or federal) positions typically require expertise in quantitative research which I do not have. Any insight into my options would be appreciated. Thanks!",

If you are getting that many invites, you are in good shape. If you've got some time that is still funded ahead of you, may not be worth jumping out at this point.

Not exactly the industry I'd want to be in from an ethical point of view, but I assume they need education PhDs in addition to k12 teachers for curriculum design, seems like they pay decently. \n\nYou might also want to try going on LinkedIn, searching for people with your degree, and seeing what they're up to other than academia. You can always try to reach out to them and chat, too, in my experience most people are happy to talk about themselves to an interested listener.",

You can work at organizations like Teaching Tolerance or others that focus on social issues and that have an educational component. You can work for community-based education organizations like 826.
