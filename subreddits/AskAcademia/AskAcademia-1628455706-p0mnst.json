  "title:": "Help! How do I survive a PhD with chronic fatigue??",
  "text": "So to give you some context: I've been living with anxiety and mild depression for more than 10ish years. While I've somewhat successfully learned to navigate it, some of the hardest parts of it are the periods of chronic fatigue that I've felt a lot more since 2017 (think spending hours in bed in absolute exhaustion, sleeping at random hours for long stretches, feeling tired from basic chores and even walking to school/supermarket and back. Sometimes it's so bad that I'm too tired to even  go grocery shopping and when I do manage to drag myself, I'm exhausted and need a 2-3 hour naps right after. I also take double the amount of time to do a task because I fade/burn out quite quickly.) I've been in therapy for years and it helps a great deal with panic attacks and other spells of dizziness and worry, but not much with my fatigue.\n\nI'm starting my PhD in Psychology in the US in a few weeks. I'm really worried about how I can manage doing this degree with my health. I managed my MA mostly because I had class only once a week, and a very supportive partner in the same city. I panic every time I think about managing classes, research, teaching, homework, chores, and socializing with this giant pain in the ass fatigue.\n\nI'm going to be an international student at my school, and on a very strict visa so there are a lot of concerns with taking it completely at my pace. I plan on talking to my PI about it once I'm actually at Uni.\n\nCoffee doesn't help and I've been taking vitamins haven't made much difference either. Cold weather aggravates it, and from what I hear, winters at where I'm going are quite harsh.\n\nIf anyone has any tips on how I can survive grad school on 50% less energy, I'd be so grateful.",

Don't leave things to the last minute in case you have a flare up close to deadlines",

      "text": "A PhD is hard work! But, I\u2019ve found there are ways to do your PhD smarter, and when you already have little energy it\u2019s important to learn to avoid extra stressors and make sure some basic skills for your PhD (writing, presenting, analysis, networking etc) are relatively well developed so they won\u2019t give you extra stress. Stress about your PhD is a huge part of what takes energy, sometimes even more than the PhD work itself, so try to get support in learning coping mechanisms in your daily work that give you the skill and confidence to work productively when you have your good moments. Invest in time management, planning, task management, building in moments for success and rewarding yourself in between, and know to be kind to yourself :). \n\nI realize your PhD program in the US is different from the EU system, but I just share my experience hoping it\u2019s any help. \nWhat helped me a lot in my EU university was the realization that getting a PhD is not necessarily about your final product, but about you becoming an integer, independent and resourceful researcher. That said: the product you write can perhaps be negotiated with your supervisor, so you can work the way that suits your qualities best. For me, writing my PhD in articles gives me a much needed flexibility to adapt to my own health, but also to for example the covid crisis and issues visiting labs internationally. It also tracks your progress and productivity in a different way that building a single, all-meaning manuscript. That way writing in articles is more motivating, and in comparison saves me spells of panic and insecurity, lack of progress, not being able to see clear results, while instead it makes separating your work into smaller tasks easier, and makes me work smarter rather than harder.",

Because you are going to have to work with them a lot at your new institution.\n\nThis isn't a fun thing to say, but you're facing a hell of a challenge. And I wonder why after your struggle with your MA, and the recognition that you got through it \"mostly because I had class only once a week, and a very supportive partner in the same city\", why you would choose to move countries to do a PhD? What were your expectations of a PhD? Clearly you recognise there is a difference between a PhD and your MA experience, so I'm wondering if that is a new realisation or if you just didn't consider it before.\n\nThe key thing here, to circle back to the start of my comment, is *you* realising what adjustments you require in order to manage *your* PhD. Because you're the one that is going to have to tell the accommodations people what accommodations you require. And keep in mind these have to be reasonable adjustments.\n\nPeople can give you vague and general tips, but I would hope that you already have some coping mechanisms to deal with your fatigue, because these are what you're going to have to apply to this situation.\n\nI'm not trying to be overly negative; if you were a home student I'd suggest flexible working with the option to explore going part time, or making use of leaves of absence, whichever fits for you.

If OP has CFS, then they have CFS and shouldn't be treated by a psychiatrist. But ruling out an alternate possibility which has standard treatments available is valuable.",

      "text": "Hey! I have chronic fatigue syndrome and I suffer from other post-illness syndromes. I cannot walk a lot because I get exhausted. I have been mostly homebound for five years but I left my place to attend classes and weekly meetings. I fell sick just before starting my Master's and now I'm three years into my PhD. You probably know this, but the therapy will probably not solve the fatigue because it's really an organic illness. Many people tend to psychiatrize the condition when in reality, it's linked to constant inflammation of the nervous system. So understandably, you'll have some pretty awful days, but remember that this is not your fault at all. I remind myself this when I feel awful and I try to sleep more to feel better. Winters are very terrible for me as well, I have neuropathy in my feet and it gets much worse with the cold. \n\nOn the \"tough love\" side - make sure you ask yourself the question of whether you are able to do this PhD. It would be awful if you had to drop out due to your health declining due to stress, for example. Do you have funding? If you have funding, I'd say \"go ahead\" because you won't have to pay debt afterwards (and having financial hardship on top of this difficult illness is something to avoid). On my part, I decided to do a PhD because of the funding. I wasn't planning on doing my PhD. Of course, I love it and I'm happier than what I expected when I signed up. I was just so sick three years ago and the funding for me was a way to get money without having to go on the job market because I thought I was unemployable at the time.\n\nMy tips for you to succeed would be to:\n\n* Prioritize your health whenever you can. If you feel tired, sleep. It'll pay off ultimately.\n* Learn to say no to opportunities which do not benefit you career-wise. There's a lot of people where I study that are involved in the student association and other side projects, but this only takes away time and energy away from their PhD. I've been very strict with **saying no** even if that was painful and I'm so thankful for my past self. \n* Your supervisor may understandably want you to do a very ambitious project. Learn to be strict by developing a realistic research proposal. I've had some cases where my supervisor wanted me to do more than what I intended. I stood up to him and this was extremely difficult, but now I don't have to worry about doing way more than what I can realistically manage. \n* Work from home whenever you can and be strict with that.\n* Try to have a strict work schedule and in the evenings, try to get some chores done even if it's very difficult. I realize it's better to push myself during the week so that I can relax and not feel overwhelmed on the weekend. Before, I would do most of my chores on the weekend and it was even more exhausting.\n* Try to find the adequate \"exercise\" balance that suits you. I can only walk a little bit, so I make sure to walk a little bit each day, preferably in the morning, so that I can be slighly more focused during the day. If you're too tired to walk, don't do it.\n* Make sure to be adequately dressed in the winter. Invest in a super warm coat. I bought a second-hand Canada Goose coat but there's plenty of cheaper options. I always get out with my snow pants lol. It looks ridiculous, but I'd rather deal with snowpants than perpetually numb legs and feet.\n* You can try to get an official chronic fatigue diagnosis and reach out to your university's services for people living with disabilities. Due to this service, I was able to ask for extensions even for my candidacy exam and this helped me incredibly. I was also able to apply to scholarships. In the two last years I have been receiving $5000 per year due to my disabilities. It has helped me a lot. \n* Don't feel obliged to maintain contact with exhausting people. You have your own health and problems to manage.\n\nOn a lighter note, what I like the most about the PhD is the flexible schedule. I find that it's super accommodating for people like us. The work rythmn in research is more slow and this is helpful stress-wise.\n\nGood luck and do not hesitate to reach out to me if you want to talk <3",

      "text": "I'm now over 2 years 2 months into my 3 year psychology PhD, and as I was beginning it I was going through some strange unexplained medical stuff, which included autoimmune issues and a diagnosis of chronic fatigue. It turned out to be caused by a major mould problem we didn't know we had (brand new apartment, hidden leaks and mould in the walls and under floors etc). I delayed starting by 1 month, but I needed the scholarship money to live, so had to dive in and get started. It took until 18 months into my PhD that I started to feel even remotely like myself again, and a few months later made the decision to get pregnant which has come with it's own fatigue amongst other things (hey I like a challenge lol). I'm in New Zealand so a PhD is different here, we don't have classes to attend instead it's entirely focused around a research project and thesis. So it sounds a little different, but here to say it can be done! I've managed to almost complete the research component (a couple months off now), publish several papers, and am talking at my first conference in September, as well as do a little casual paid work along the way.\n\nLots of good advice here already, my thoughts:\n\n\\- The way you work may look different, in the worst part some days I had to choose between showering/getting dressed and getting some work done. So some days I would just work on my laptop from bed. Other days I would make an appearance in the department, but accept those days weren't going to involve much work.\n\n\\- Totally agree with people saying they do less than peers and achieve the same amount, it's about being organised and time management. To do lists, working on things asap incase you hit a bad patch close to due dates\n\n\\- I have a 'daily done list' in google keep, every day is a new note and I keep a list of everything I do, all those tiny little bits of admin, emails etc are actually all part of the workload, and some days I would feel like I had achieved nothing big but over time realised every single day that I did something was another brick in the PhD wall. \n\n\\- On the worst days, when you can, do actually rest rather than trying to do work. Obviously this has to be an honesty system and balanced but sometimes taking a day for netflix and naps meant I could come back strong the following days, whereas the days I tried to push through I wouldn't get anything meaningful done, and ruined myself for days to come. \n\n\\- Hopefully you have a supportive supervisor. I was too scared to tell mine actually how bad it was, as I was worried I would be told to take a break and as mentioned, I badly needed the money to live, but I did mention I was having some health issues so she could be aware\n\n\\- Trust that you are doing enough unless told otherwise. I felt like I was operating at about 30% of what I could have been, but then at every review meeting I was told I was tracking well, so eventually I started to believe it!\n\n\\- Experiment with supplements where funds permit, iherb is reasonably priced. Look into coq10, pqq, reishi mushroom and l-theanine for sleep (restful sleep was sometimes hard for me even when I was exhausted), nadh, rhodiola, even just good old b vitamins. Definitely address any vitamin deficiencies, but look into proper supplements over a bog standard multivitamin that has minimal levels in it anyway. Also as someone mentioned, a light box for winter.\n\n\\- Look into support networks, I found really helpful resources on instagram, and people who were going through similar things.\n\n\\- Consider underlying issues, e.g. thyroid, mould problems, diet (this sounds boring but can have a huge impact), autoimmune illnesses\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! And feel free to reach out with any questions :)",

      "text": "From my experience, graduate school allows for a lot more flexibility than your typical 9-5 job. When I still did coursework, I'd basically just go home right after class and rest a bit, since I didn't have the energy to stick around and chat with people after a 3 hour class, or if I had a statistics lab that was optional, I'd only go for the intro to the assignment, and complete the assignment on my own at home (luckily I was good enough at my stats courses to be able to do this and do well). I was extremely lucky to have an external fellowship that freed me up from any TA/RA/teaching duties for a few years, because I did have to take a brief (as in, not a full year) medical leave during that time, and still got paid and kept my insurance. Now that I'm working on my dissertation research, I've learned that on really intense weeks, to take a day off - taking a day to rest means that I'm more productive and have more energy when I do work! But overall, I've found grad school to be quite accommodating of my needs, especially now that I'm just trying to finish my PhD and have always been very self-directed and self-motivated. The only thing is that I do feel like it has made me more disconnected from my department, as attending all department events and social gatherings is just something I could not always get myself to do (and now I'm temporarily in another state for my research, so now, that's just due to distance). \n\nThe medical leave was due to severe bipolar disorder, but that has been under control for a couple years or more now, thankfully, but I'm currently dealing with POTS and a weird sort of syndrome called inappropriate sinus tachycardia (and other weird heart/autonomic dysfunction issues I'm trying to figure out, despite being an otherwise, on paper and bloodwork, excluding EKGs and such, totally healthy 30 year old) and that has made me have to learn to be strategic about how and when I can work. I detest Zoom, but the one upside to the pandemic is that is has made working from home so much more normalized, so on days I can't really muster up much, I can work from my bed and still feel good about my day having been decently productive. I suppose I've learned how my body and mind operate and know when it is best to rest, though that's often hard because I have a tendency to push myself too far! Adderall (prescribed of course) has helped me a lot, and I am not a big fan of medications - I don't know if I necessarily have ADHD per se, but the overall autonomic dysfunction stuff I have creates the same sort of symptoms (including extreme inattentiveness) and has helped me be able to function so much better since I started it maybe 3 years ago? I'm curious if you've ever looked into some sort of dysautonomia as a cause of your fatigue, given your description - worth a bit of research, I'd say! I also tried Nuvigil for fatigue but it gave me headaches every single day, though I'm predisposed to getting a ton of headaches, as a disclaimer!",

I know it\u2019s really shitty because you said your doctors aren\u2019t the nicest, but their testimony will be critical for getting the support of your disability office at your new school. \n\nALSO \u2014 this flavour of chronic fatigue seems unusual for anxiety and depression? Please please look into autoimmune disorders and at least see an immunologist and maybe an endocrinologist. I have a history of anxiety and depression, and depression tiredness is qualitatively different from my current fatigue, which sounds exactly like yours. If you can walk into your PhD program with a diagnosis, that would be ENORMOUSLY helpful in terms of getting accommodations.",

Here\u2019s what I suggest: have a copy of your comprehensive blood work (thyroid, vitamin levels, EBV antibodies, the works) and share it with your new doctor as soon as you get into the country, which will give them a starting point. If you do get a diagnosis from your home country, that\u2019s even better because you can give the supporting evidence to your new doctor. If not, explain to your doctor that you have been checked out for xyz conditions, along with a detailed, specific set of description for your symptoms. That should get you through the first couple of months as your doctor in your new country runs all the tests and refers you to specialists. \n\nGood luck, what you\u2019re going through is awful but you\u2019re being so brave in pursuing your dreams!

I think they ask for a therapist or physician to sign a form confirming but it can also depend on the school.\n\nOthers have suggested there might be an underlying medical problem. If that's true, I hope they are able to figure out what it is, and that might point to the correct medical intervention for your fatigue. That said, there are medications for fatigue. In addition to medications that are used for ADHD like different kinds of amphetamines and the drug methylphenidate, there's also the drugs modafinil and armodafinil. I like modafinil off-label for depression, but it's on label use is for sleep disorders that cause fatigue. I don't want to push medication because I'm a). not a doctor b). this isn't a medical sub-reddit c). not something you asked for. But, I just wanted you to know that there *are* medical options if you want to go down that route.",

              "text": "I think it all starts with prioritization. First, you need to realize that you do not have the time to do your very best job on everything that you do. This is very hard for many of us who choose to do PhDs, because we have always been driven to do our best.\n\nLet me give some concrete examples. Many professors say that getting all B's in your classes as a PhD student is totally fine, because when you finish your PhD, people will only look at your research, not your courses. You should double check this with your advisor. If this is the case, then \\*do not\\* do any more work than you have to with your courses. Look at your course syllabus, figure out exactly what you need to do in order to get at least a B. Then write down a plan for how to do that \\*and no more\\*. This may be really difficult for you, but you have to learn to do it in order to manage time well. If you can save \\~5 hours a week by getting B's rather than A's in your classes, you just freed up 5 hours a week you can do something else with--whether it be research, sleep, self-care, etc.\n\nAnother example might be research projects that are not directly contributing to your thesis. Its fun to work on a bunch of projects with a bunch of people, but you have to figure out how to say \"No\" or \"I don't have time for that.\" I have said \"I don't time\" as an excuse to not do things, even if I know I've only been working 35 hour weeks, because I know that I need the time to take care of myself and to take care of my family so that my family and I can be healthy and happy. You have to put your own health over pleasing other people.\n\nOnce you have figured out what your priorities are, keep a TODO list of concrete tasks you need to do, and what date they are due by (I like using Microsoft Todo because it has a sort-by-due-date feature). Constantly update your list based on your updated priorities, etc. This will help you focus the time you \\*are\\* working on doing the most important thing for your career, whether its planning your next experiment, prepping to preseent at a top conference in your field, etc.",

Another pretty tame beginner nootropic is theanine combined with caffeine, which might help you if caffeine doesn't normally help. There's a whole pharmaceutical road that I would recommend caution with unless you have an actual doctor's supervision, but one of your doctors might be willing to prescribe you something like modafinil if you are napping all the time. There are some forums here on Reddit for nootropics that you could start browsing if you were curious.",

Medication wherever possible or needed can help too - I\u2019m working on my anti depressant dosage to see if I can find something that helps my anxiety and depression but also helps with my fatigue. Sometimes you just have a deadline and the freak out makes you get your ass to work. \n\nThe way I try and mitigate deadline freak outs is to do whatever tiny amount I can manage in a day. If I can write one paragraph, I\u2019ll do it. Sometimes I\u2019ll carry my computer around with me in the house, with my document open, so if I feel a bit less tired I can do something for 20 minutes before I feel like crashing again. I usually find the tiny pieces of work pile up until I have a decent amount done without realizing it. And I don\u2019t take my small periods of focus for granted.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard road my friend, but just have confidence and try to see if you can get some medical help wherever you can.\n\nIt is also encouraging for me to read the other comments here and see other people struggle with this and still lead great academic lives while mitigating mental health circumstances and fatigue!",

      "text": "I think you have to be very realistic. Usually the advice would be to do the PhD part-time, get support from your institution and supervisor so you can take things at your own pace and things like that.\n\nBut people do struggle to complete on strict visas when they don't have to deal with the issues you do. And people can find it tough doing a phd as an international student.\n\nI would contact the university and find out about the support they offer in advance, have a very honest conversation with your PI now, before you get there, as to what is realistic to expect from you and whether that will allow you to submit on time.  \n\nThey might say the work schedule can be made very flexible so you can work when you have the energy - that would be good to know and reassure you a bit. They might say there is room to take on little to no extra teaching - great. They might say 'my students usually work 40+ hours a week flat out'. I would't wait until you are there to find all this out.\n\nI am not saying people with all sorts of conditions can't complete a PhD - they totally can - but you need to be upfront with yourself about the circumstances rather than setting yourself up for four years of stress and exhaustion. You do have to live for those years as well as completing the phd.",

          "text": "The bonus (?) of my anxiety is that I'm realistic bordering on pessimistic - I prepare for the worst and work backwards to the best case scenario. I'll definitely try seeing what support and help I can get from the Uni. Thank you so much for this - the last line really stayed with me, that I do actually have to live for the next 5 years as I do my PhD!",

              "text": "In terms of preparing for the worst - do you know if your visa allows you to take a break/s in studies? It might be worth finding out, as break in studies stops the clock on your PhD time but there is nothing to stop you working independently during that time.",
