  "title:": "Underwhelming CV - any hope for a research position?",
  "text": "Hi, I recently graduated with my PhD in Biology (Ecology and Evolution; I'm in the US), but basically have a blank CV, besides a minimum of oral presentations as well as some trivial filler. My advisor stalled on ever letting me submit our manuscripts to publication through to the bitter end (he is coauthor on all of my thesis chapters). My thesis has interesting, publication-worthy research, but is entirely dead in the water \u2013 it will  never be published. I guess I knew a bitter end would come \u2013 my advisor  was a very sneaky guy throughout my tenure as a grad student \u2013 notoriously neglectful of his students, not present on campus, insisted on rewriting his students\u2019 manuscripts rather than giving feedback, and the like. I had to twist his arm to INCLUDE THE CONTROL DATA in the MS for one of my thesis chapters. In other words, he literally tried to get me to falsify data. Since, graduating, I sent him an angry email expressing these grievances. In a more clear-eyed moment, I sent  an apology but have not heard back.  \n\nI am currently adjuncting Bio 2 at my alma mater, but, as if it needs to be said, this is neither satisfying nor stimulating work. I feel I have more to offer. The embargo on my thesis will be lifted soon and I will be proud to point to it as an example of my work, as well as another manuscript my advisor and I produced that also just got eternally tabled. I know, this sounds laughable, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. \n\nObviously, pretty much every research job requires a publication track record. I don\u2019t see any way of getting around it, and don\u2019t expect there is a way of finagling it. Should I just redo grad school? I got paid more as a student anyway. I dropped the ball on networking in grad school too, as I was just kind of floundering while being gaslit by my advisor. I guess one additional piece of information is since another member of my graduate committee has retired, he has expressed reservation in being a  professional reference for me. So, I\u2019m down to two refs. \n\nAnyway, I apologize if this is incoherent rambling. I don\u2019t really know what type of advice to expect, but I\u2019m desperate. Please point me in the right direction if there is a better subreddit or other forum for this. Thanks to anyone who cares to chime in.",
