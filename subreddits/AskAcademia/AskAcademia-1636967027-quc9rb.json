          "text": "Going to be downvoted to hell, but you see, this right here is the problem. \n\nPeterson is arguably intelligent - he\u2019s well read in his field of study, can put together a coherent argument, and if you actually listen to him he does accept valid criticism and he reflects on it. He is a bit too arrogant, and leaps to a conclusion too often without enough evidence, but broadly speaking he contributes a viewpoint that is reasonably argued, even if many would disagree with it.\n\nThe reflection bit is key - real intelligence (an ability to think critically) is probably defined mostly by a person\u2019s ability to see another\u2019s viewpoint, accept the valid parts of that argument, but question the bits that are not valid.\n\nUnfortunately most people don\u2019t think critically they just leap to a conclusion, as here. \u201cI\u2019m right therefore anyone who disagrees with me is wrong\u201d (and thick along with it). I would argue those who simply cannot accept a different viewpoint are much more likely to be the thickos.",

I would wager most people who criticise him have not done due diligence and read his books or listened properly to his arguments. I could be wrong, it\u2019s just my viewpoint :-).\n\nPeterson has a world view that is anathema to many, he\u2019s also quite arrogant in that academic way. But he is arguably smart or at least educated - fron what I\u2019ve seen he got the better of very smart journalists such as Helen Lewis and Cathy Newman by marshalling his arguments, clearly having thought through his position and at the very least having read more scientific papers on the subjects he is questioned on than the interviewers. \n\nHaving not read his books I cannot comment on them, but if you think it\u2019s abusing the science I\u2019d be interested to hear why. But genuinely, does that mean he\u2019s dumb or cynical?\n\nI\u2019m not going to write you a long scientific article on it, but I think there\u2019s plenty of evidence that suggests the liberal-minded population on Reddit/Twitter etc could do worse than trying to understand the viewpoints of those they disagree with, rather than simply dismissing them as dumb. We might actually win some elections/change some minds\u2026. :-)",

As I\u2019ve moved deeper into academia (and I\u2019m only at the PhD level) I\u2019ve come to realize knowledge and understanding is really developed through the back-and-forth one has within their own academic community. So, to me at least, it\u2019s not really about how much information/knowledge a person can accumulate (all that accumulated knowledge means nothing if it can\u2019t be tested via debates and questioned by others in the field) but rather how much they engage their knowledge and ideas with others, so as to test it, refine it, or change it all together. Those are my thoughts at least, but it would be interesting to see what others think",

      "text": "Someone can be incredibly intelligent and study not at at all if we\u2019re looking purely at IQ. It doesn\u2019t mean your ideas or perspective is informed. It\u2019s even difficult to say how much \u201cstudying\u201d academics do because how do you define \u201cstudy\u201d? Academics can have an allocation for research in their contacts that can vary wildly but this can be a huge range of activities based on their field, topic funding, career stage, country etc. For example is conducting lab experiments study? Conducting a literature review? Interviewing people? People who are intelligent as their job, which is different to being an academic, seem to me to be used to promote a particular viewpoint. Their academic work (if they have any) usually seems to be very different in nature, tone and, sometimes, even content than their academic work. I\u2019m not sure how many academics take their work seriously unless it\u2019s something like science communication for a lay audience.",
