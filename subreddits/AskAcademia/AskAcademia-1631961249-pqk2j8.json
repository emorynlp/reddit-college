  "text": "Hi everyone, first time posting here, not sure it's the right platform for this so please be nice!\n\nI finished my PhD 2020 and I am at my first postdoc in an Asian country. During the whole time, everyone in the lab (both professors and colleagues), assumed 24/7 availability by sending emails or whatsapps with stuff to be done asap. At the beginning of PhD I was young and excited and just accepted it, but now it's taking a toll on my mental health. I recently worked on setting my boundaries, but it's not always possible and I live in fear of being fired from the job for being negligent.\nI wonder if this is a normal work ethic everywhere in the World. How do people cope with that for many years?",

      "text": "I can't comment on Asia but in the UK and Europe, no this is not normal or acceptable. I work for a research institute in the UK and not only do we actively promote a work life balance, we have disciplined staff who engage in the kind of behaviour you describe ie contacting staff out of hours and demanding work be done asap. Obviously, it's academia, so there is a culture of working outside \"office\" hours and it can put people under pressure but we are trying to change things.",
