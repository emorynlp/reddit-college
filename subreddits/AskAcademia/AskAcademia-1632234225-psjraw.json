I make $86k a year (will max out around $100k), I essentially get 5 months of \"work from home\", May-August and most of December (2 of those months are actual vacation). When I do work \"full time\", I have somewhere between 22 and 30 hours of scheduled work a week. There is a lot of class preparation and marking that needs to be done in that time, but this is *by far* the best job I have ever had.",

My base pay is about 15k less than yours, **but** I can take all the overload I want...so I earn about the same (albeit I have to take more classes, but they're classes I've taught a dozen times over online, so they're pretty self-sufficient aside from grading). And...my institution pays 100% of my health insurance...which...in the US is worth quite a bit.\n\nJust adding this for the US folks...community college gigs can be great. I have a lot of friends from grad school on the university job market, working towards tenure at a uni, or working on a PhD. I wouldn't trade my job for any of it. It's the perfect amount of engaging with a subject I love without burying myself beneath it.\n\nOh! And every position in our department is tenure track. You're eligible for tenure after three years, and you really only need to be a decent teacher, go to professional development every once in a while, and avoid any major ethics violations to get it.

I\u2019m tenured. \n\nGenerally, tenure track / tenured professors have a lot of flexibility in both what they do and how they do it. That flexibility is greatest in research. Funders set broad research priorities in my field (criminal justice) but they rarely specify the precise project. University admin doesn\u2019t care what my research is about, so long as it\u2019s productive (grant dollars or publications, ideally both). \n\nThere\u2019s usually a lot of flexibility in teaching too among tenure track folk. At many universities, course scheduling is done by consensus. Sometimes I take one for the team, sometimes someone else does. In my department right now, our preferences are diverse enough (some prefer teaching in the morning, others the afternoon, etc) that it mostly works out without anyone taking on something that\u2019s outside of our preference. \n\nService\u2026 I can be forced to be on various university committees, but again at my current job it\u2019s mostly by consensus. \n\nNon-tenure track professors and instructors generally have much less freedom and much less input in decisions. NTT cannot create courses at my institution, for example. \n\ntl;dr: tenured and tenure track = more flexibility than most jobs.

The rest is rather adaptable.   \n\n\nWhen funding is through a funding organization like the NSF in the US, there is some sort of freedom, but not that much, as you need to submit a grant proposal that will seduce the panel and the reviewers. Not all topics can achieve that as you may be into some problems which many researchers will find uninteresting. So, in this end you need to be interested in some problems you can get funding for. This is not total freedom. \n\nThis is actually a problem now as some funding organizations tend to favor research with short-term results, which is not very compatible with fundamental research, which essentially leads to long-term results. This problem has been pointed out many times recently when Nobel prizes winners got awarded for \"useless\" research (in physics) that would have never been funded by our current funding agencies due to a lack of short-term applications. \n\nThis was nicely illustrated by Jorge Cham there: [http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive\\_print.php?comicid=1436](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1436).\n\nFinally, I would like to recommend the short story by Leo Szilard, \"The Mark Gabble Foundation\" that describes how to limit and destroy a good research system. That was written  in 1948. It can be read there https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb33804055/\\_1.pdf.",

However, there are two considerations here: the first is that you have to publish in order to get a job and get tenure, so you have to be researching something that can get you published. Second, there are clear preferences in hiring. I am in Japanese studies, and there is a strong hiring preference for people who focus on pop culture and film.\n\nAs for hours, nobody pays attention. As long as I teach the classes and hold office hours, I'm not required to be in the office at other times (unless there's a department meeting or some other administrative task). It's up to me how much time I want to spend per week doing research, planning classes, grading, etc. In theory I could set up my classes so that they involved no grading or prep time, and then do no research so that I would end up working ~15 hours a week. But this would have medium-and-long term consequences and I would fail my pre-tenure review.\n\nBut the flexibility is nice. I had a dentist appointment this morning and I didn't have to tell anyone or rearrange anything. However, the flexibility can also have a bad side because if you're not disciplined it's easy to let the time slip away and not do much. Some people also have a problem where they spend way too much time on class prep and grading because there's no recommended or maximum time to spend doing that.",

Though not impossible, it\u2019s more difficult to get funding for a project in a topic you have no prior experience with. And to get that experience (i.e. a publication record), you often need funding. Forming strong collaborations with others in that topic can go a long way.

I was basically forced to try to build my lab from the ground up: apply for external funding to run a lab, apply for NIH LRP (because my salary $75k didn't allow me to afford to be able to pay my student loans), apply for multiple research grants at the same time, write manuscripts and submit for publication, advance research on-campus (while I was trying to get my lab up), and teach three courses, with the prospect of teaching four the following semester. Needless to say, this was a fucking nightmare. Sure, I had the \"freedom\" to choose which dragon I wanted to slay at which times, but I did not have the time to juggle all of those things, on top of my personal life. My university would not grant me relocation assistance, and cut my salary by roughly 40% (taxes included) for the first 6 months of my hire, leading into the pandemic where my wife lost her job and I was left breadwinner while we anticipated our first baby. \n\nNo one was my boss, I had complete independent freedom. I ended up having to file bankruptcy because the academic pipeline had no mechanism for me to be able to start from the bottom up on my own....essentially I needed to have some kind of generational wealth. I quit my job -- literally quit academia because I couldn't stand it any more. I had devoted roughly 12 years of my life to develop a career in a field that is basically functionally inept. Although I left academia without another job in-hand, I'm currently interviewing for positions at two different companies, where I can still utilize my research skills, but I'll be making roughly $170k, with $30k cash bonus, and $75k in stocks. \n\nI'll have a boss, but the culture of the company is incredibly healthy, and absolutely nothing like what any college or university has ever created....",
