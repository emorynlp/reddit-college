  "text": "Hello,im a senior physics major whos applying to a research project about quantum optics. I have never written an official LOM before and have no research experience to mention in my LOM(except for a little astrophysics data analysis project I was a part of last summer) Ive talked with the prof whos the head of the project and he was ok about me getting into the project but I have to write this LOM to get a scholarship for my internship,mainly. There are no guidelines that the funding agency wants me to follow,so im a little bit lost about what to mention in my LOM.",
