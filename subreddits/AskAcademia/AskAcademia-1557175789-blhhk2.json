  "title:": "Looking back, what do you think was the biggest mistake you made in your academic career?",
  "text": "Now having made a 'big' mistake doesn't necessarily mean that you don't like where you are now or that you necessarily regret it, but I've been reflecting a lot on my own trajectory and definitely noticed that there were some things I did that set me back or prevented me entirely from moving towards some of my original goals. I like where I am now, but it's interesting to nail down what my biggest mistake was that set me on this path instead of my originally intended one.\n\nFor me, TLDR it was this: **I spent too long underestimating what it takes to build an academic reputation and by the time I fully grasped it I was too far behind**.\n\n\\--\n\nThe long version:\n\nMy faculty advisers when I was in graduate school and my postdoc very much had the attitude that if you do good work and just get a lot of publications in good journals, you will gain a reputation from people seeing your work. Or simply: more publications = more reputation, and I adopted that. That is true - you can't have a good reputation without a decent publication record, but I've learned that nowadays that alone isn't sufficient to gain a reputation that's competitive for things like R1 TT positions in good locations, for example.\n\nWhen I came out of graduate school, I had an above average number of publications in good journals. I was reasonably productive during my postdoc as well. But while I had a lot of publications in good venues, no one in the academic sphere was talking about them. I was still unknown mostly to a lot of people in my field, other then them seeing a paper I wrote here and there and citing them. I didn't connect with other researchers in collaboration, through conferences, or other ways like social media, and my advisers weren't in to the whole academic advertising thing, so I didn't connect with other academics that much through them either. My school was a decent R1, but it didn't have the advertising chops of many other R1s when it came to highlighting research. I did gain a decent reputation among government agencies and industry since my work is very applied, which is why I have a decent record of getting grants, but in academic circles I was largely unknown.\n\nThere's a lot of hand-wringing about self-promotion and social media, and I understand. I'm quite introverted, and I am still not super active in self-promotion, but the lesson I would have told my younger self is this: If you're applying for competitive academic positions, you need to be more proactive in connecting with other academics in your field. Even if you have a lot of publications, there are at least a few other people who have just as strong of a publication record, but in addition are also more connected with people in the rest of the field, and when it comes to hiring decisions they will be chosen 9 times out of 10. Even if you're connected with industry/government, that doesn't correlate with your reputation in academic circles (although it does help with the whole grant getting thing). Some people don't have to think about this because their adviser / school / program is famous and connects them with people, they go to lots of conferences already and connect with people, or maybe they're just more extroverted and naturally have the initiative to connect with people.\n\nSome of my peers who were better about connecting with people in the field got included on projects and such that greatly accelerated their ability to publish and compete for competitive academic positions, well beyond what I was able to do. So even if productivity-wise I was strong coming out of graduate school and my postdoc, afterwards I quickly became uncompetitive for the kinds of positions I was applying for.",

I needed to lobby on my own behalf and secure votes more than I needed to get another great publication. My VAP ended at that university when the faculty voted not to extend me a tenure-track line. I had out published everyone and won two major teaching awards and it didn\u2019t matter one bit. I had trusted that keeping my head down and doing good work would be sufficient. It wasn\u2019t. \n\nUnderstood this much better at my second position. Kept a running tally in my head of how many votes I needed, how many I likely had, and always had a strategy for how to get more. Spent much more time than I did at my first post having lunch with colleagues, going to coffee with colleagues, making friends with as many people as possible, and otherwise shoring up support. Got a tenure-track line off of my VAP at this place and then sailed through tenure and promotion to full over the next seven years. \n\nGood work is not enough. In fact, It may actually work against you if your senior colleagues are intimidated. You HAVE to lobby for yourself and put in the social time. You have to make an effort with as many colleagues as possible. Even the ones who drive you crazy. It pays off in the end.\n\nTl;Dr I agree with OP. Self promotion matters INTERNALLY as well as externally.",

Even in the SLAC world which I frequent, networks and favors and collaborations are vital. On-campus reputations can make the difference in being asked to join a grant, chair a task force, or chair the faculty senate-- and they can also determine whose department gets a hire, who gets an endowed chair, and who the development office will raise funds for. Hell, it even impacts *admissions* on many campuses.\n\nUnfortunately, almost no graduate programs teach this at all. I picked it up by watching faculty in my grad program, including my advisor (who was a major international scholar so did occasionally drop nuggets of wisdom about this stuff).

Another got a reputation for being deceptive and only being out for herself.  She came within two votes of not getting tenure.

For me, lobbying for myself meant making sure that I was spending 1-on-1 time with literally every single person in my department at least once a semester by way of lunches, coffees, and informal office visits.  It also meant keeping track of what everybody else's \"baby\" was and showing up at their stuff.  The colleague who screened a film about an issue of importance to them? I was there for it.  The colleague who gave a talk across campus about a recent paper? I showed up for that, too.  I didn't brown-nose or stalk anyone, I just showed up and took an interest in their work.  That kind of thing can be huge and build so much goodwill.  Once I figured out (the hard way) that I needed to lobby for myself, I was amazed by how many senior colleagues hadn't had a junior faculty member stop by their office to chat in years.  What missed opportunities.  \n\n\nIn comparison, I had a colleague who joined our department as a VAP.  She was amazing: nationally-recognized in her field, publishing like a rockstar, loved by the students, super active in service work all over campus.  She refused, however, to leave her social comfort zone and network with colleagues beyond her close friends.  I used to implore her to stop by various people's offices, and she always had an excuse: \"He's so conversative.  He probably hates my work.\" or \"I think she secretly hates me.\" or \"What am I supposed to say?\"  I kept reassuring her that all of those people were kind, eager to socialize, and would be happy to chat, but she never made an effort.  Three years into her VAP, she was up for renewal and though everyone was impressed by her, no one fought to keep her.  The dean suggested that, financially, it might be tough to add any more TT faculty and everyone nodded and moved on.  She had no one (other than us younger faculty members who lacked political clout) to advocate for her.    \n\n\nBe friendly.  Show up. Take an interest.  Just do it a bit strategically.",

What will be important is making yourself indispensable-- be *that person* who volunteers for crappy service jobs in the department (assessment committee! admission committee!), who joins in all the campus- or division-wide initiatives (service learning! diversity/inclusion! quantitative reasoning!), and who is visible at campus events. You can skip the football games but be there at events where the president, provost, and/or dean are in attendance-- and of course your department chair/senior colleagues. Being \"engaged\" and being seen doing so are important, as they are one way faculty colleagues judge your commitment to service (departmental and institutional). As a department chair I actively warn junior colleagues if I feel they aren't being seen enough...I've had a few that want work to be a 9-4 job, and that can hurt them when colleagues are working that *plus* attending senate meetings, lectures, concerts, and other events on campus regularly-- and noticing they aren't present.",

      "text": "I worked on a highly controversial topic during my Master's and PhD and while I can't say that this was a mistake *per se*, it had a few implications that probably had, and still have, a negative impact on my career.\n\nSo the first thing is that we really had to fight to get our papers accepted even in relatively mediocre journals. That is not because our work in itself was bad. I've seen all sorts of personal attacks by anonymous reviewers over the years who tried to block our papers where we proved a theory wrong. They were published in the end, but the amount of backlash you face when you go against people that are famous and popular in their field, is simply incredible, and not something a PhD student should have to deal with.\n\nWhile our papers were published in the end, it wasn't a good use of my resources. I'm just one person and I can only do so much. If I have to spend three months fighting for a controversial paper that ends up getting no citations whatsoever, it would be better to write two \"normal\" papers instead. Although I work in a buzzing field, my work has had no impact at all. From a metrics perspective, my papers might as well not exist.\n\nAlso, this whole \"adventure\" has made me *persona non grata* in my own field. There are people who are well aware of my work, but won't cite it even if it's relevant for their own papers. As a consequence, less people see it, and so on. When I go to conferences, instead of trying to get connected with people, I hope that nobody recognizes me, because because then I can be just a regular conference participant, instead of *that person*. The result is the usual. Missed opportunities, missed connections, missed insight... \n\nI actually switched fields for my postdoc, and I finally get to experience \"normal\" academia, and it's great! People actually see my work as what it is. That's a first for me. But now I'm basically starting again from zero, but it's actually much easier because I'm not fighting a battle I can't win anymore.",

          "text": "My friend had an advisor that constantly hit on her and displayed sexist, sleazy behavior. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, he escalated to groping her. She discovered he had done the same to several other advisees, and chose to report him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe university did nothing. The department did nothing.  She and the other advisees threatened legal action. The situation is ongoing but in the meantime, my friend has left the phD program. I am unsure as to what happened to the other advisees. He is still teaching and doing research, of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might be thinking, wow. That sucks. BUT WAIT ! IT GETS WORSE. Before she chose to report him, a number of faculty members in his department met with her and pressured her not to report. They said she could have any advisor in the department she wanted, if only she wouldn't report him. And the faculty would solve the problem by making sure he would never advise any other women ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI assume you see the problem(s) with this solution. For starters, by making sure  he would never advise any  women ever again, his colleagues were admitting they know he had a problem, and yet, they were covering up for him. Also,  by making sure  he would never advise any women ever again, they were ensuring that no women in the program could specialize in his area of expertise.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost academics are inherently very conservative. My friend learned this the hard way.",

It's incredible how great of a resource it is. I can tweet out a question relevant to my research (a recent one was trying to find a replacement product for ThermoFisher's discontinued RiboZero) and get tons of responses within hours. I get to interact with other young as well as established people in my field regardless of their prestige or lack thereof. I keep up to date on literature by following people publishing in my area. I even found a PI whose lab I was interested in on Twitter while applying to grad school, we connected there and it led to me applying to and getting into her program (it didn't end up working out for other reasons, but it's still cool!) It's really a useful too for building networks - I already know a ton of people attending the next conference that I'll also be attending, so I'll have friends and people to hang out with! If you aren't already using Twitter to connect with other scientists you should consider doing so. I know that Twitter gets a lot of flack (and rightfully so) for sometimes being a cesspool of ignorance and negativity, but if you curate your feed in the right way it can be a great way to meet and connect with other academics.",

          "text": "> how much of a boost a PhD from a prestigious US lab can get you intellectually, socially, and reputationally...\n\nPeople here aren't going to like what I'm going to say, but working in science involves discussing also those facts people would rather not hear, so...\n\nThe reason I am commenting here is that what you describe is real, but there's another, more critical point of view to look at the same thing: There's been a concerted Americanization of university education in Europe. This manifests in many ways. The Bologna process, which is an international treaty aimed at harmonizing degree standards across Europe, imposes a degree structure lifted 1:1 from American universities, not continental European universities. When it was implemented, it was treated as an opportunity to overhaul everything, at least in my alma mater. I don't entirely disagree with the goal of increasing quality - this is a good thing and should be done. But, the European education system shouldn't be a bug-compatible copy of the American one. As a practical example, even regular students have to pay huge tuition fees, and then graduate students are treated like shit, and it doesn't get much better with postdocs. This is not good, because it tends to drive good students away from academia, because the salaries you can expect after graduating aren't that high. Trying to \"internationalize\" universities is just faux internationalization if the only \"right kind\" of international experience is from a particular set of U.S. universities. U.S. universities excel in science, but plain emulation of the U.S. model doesn't \"emulate\" the results. You don't get \"iPhones\", but \"[iphones](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/photo/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120223/0013729e4ad910b095f804.jpg)\".",

      "text": "I should have gone into math.  I was an ok physics major but I was always the best at math all through upper division math classes.  But I got it into my young stupid head that physics was above math because it dealt with reality and math often dealt with contrived situations that may never be useful.  Also my dad was a math major turned computer scientist and I feared following too closely in his footsteps.  So I stuck with physics so I would have a real impact on the world.  Instead I was unhappy and often bored.  I dont care what the equations of motion of a conic pendulum rolling on a tilted hyperbolic plane are.  I just dont.  \n\nI should have slowed down, taken a year in undergrad to turn my BS/BA into  BS/BS, gotten a masters studying Algebra and then maybe pursued a PhD.  \n\nInstead, ine years later I got a physics PhD, but it was in experimental biophysics and I hated lab work. I wrote a good paper or two, but the lack of love for my work held me back from really taking it to the next level.  By the end it was just about not quitting. I really tortured myself for 3 letters in a field I didnt love.  It took me a really long time to learn about Sunk Costs.",

Instead I suffered through three years of abuse from the hand of my PI's wife (lab manager) and the three female postdocs who liked to make everyone else suffer as much as they suffered from the above mentioned wife; so we had four people torturing us. (For about seven years the PI had no students graduating. I wonder why.)\n\n\nIt was an incredibly toxic place to be, and I wasted a lot of time (not to mention was severely depressed for most of the duration).\n\nSo the \"never give up\" mantra is pure BS. Sometimes you do have to give up to escape from a hellish situation.",
