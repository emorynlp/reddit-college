  "title:": "Is it normal to share a room with PhD supervisor when travelling for conference?",
  "text": "Supervisor and I (both female) are going to a conference and she has booked one room for the two of us (two single beds). The more I think about it the more uncomfortable I feel about this arrangement. Is it normal for a PhD student to share a room with their supervisor?? Should I ask for a separate room (or even share with strangers at a hostel) or just get over it?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone! Knowing that this isn't as atypical as I thought made me feel much better about the situation. I still don't like it, but it's her funding and hopefully we won't spend much time in the accomodation.",

If you don't want to room with them, you had better at the very least offer to pay out of pocket, but I would expect to pay for a room myself.",

In my post-doc, my travel to conferences was funded, and I got my own room, because I was on the grant. The grant should fund travel for all involved, and not put people together that would be uncomfortable together.",

My colleagues and I have also sometimes rented larger apartments (through AirBnB or similar) to have multiple grad students staying there for a conference-- with our biggest crew being a total of 11 folks (with 4 faculty and 7 grad students). It's been a fabulous experience every time, and I'm grateful for the shared experiences in so many ways.",

      "text": "I think it really depends on your relationship with your supervisor. I've done it with mine and it was fine. We are both fairly scattered when it comes to travelling so it was helpful for us to have someone there to make sure at least one of us had a room key/remembered where we were staying. We were in a financially conservative field, so it made sense and we spent some of the extra money on more convenient transportation and a few nice meals. However, I totally understand feeling uncomfortable especially if you aren't terribly close with your supervisor. It is highly unlikely you will be spending much time in the room and if you need alone time or a place to work, hotel lobbies or restaurants can be a good option. Also, it is likely that your supervisor will want to catch up with all their conference friends, so I would imagine they would also be out of the room most of the time.",

      "text": "UK based - perhaps things are different in the States (I know it's normal for undergrads to share dorms there), but for me this is not normal in a number of ways. First, sharing on a work-related trip is not normal - I think we have rules against this at the university level (unless it's something like a field trip to Angola and there's only one reasonable hotel in town). Second, sharing with a supervisor is very not normal. What if you want to take an afternoon off, or if you come back late one evening? What if your supervisor wants to talk about work over breakfast? It's one thing if it's with a peer, but it's quite another if it's your line manager. Third, it's not normal to assume that someone is happy to share without asking first. That's just basic manners. Fourth, it's not normal to expect someone to pay for their own accommodation if they want an individual room. If your supervisor wants you to attend a conference, they should pay for you to attend the conference. This includes travel, food and accommodation. If they can't afford to send you, they shouldn't send you - this is a job, not a charity case! And fifth, it's super not normal to assume that someone is happy to share if you don't have a friendly relationship. What if you have a dispute? And then you guys have to work together for 3 more years - this is completely irresponsible. Again, if it's two colleagues who can be tasked onto separate problems if there's a dispute, then that's one thing. But with a PhD supervisor, there's no way you can work separately without disrupting the PhD.\n\nMaybe this is okay in other cultures, but for me this is not a situation that is normal.",
