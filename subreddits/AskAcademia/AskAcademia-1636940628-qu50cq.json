  "text": "My partner is doing research and has asked me to fill out her IRB forms. We submitted, and were improved, for out study involving focus groups that were conducted online and provided minimal risks to participants. \n\nThat study has been more or less completed but we are adding another study to the IRB submission. In this case we are doing an online survey where new participants that are collected by a third party will be asked questions on a likert scale. \n\nWe will have to modify our consent form to be worded for the survey, but it's pretty mild. \n\nI guess my question is, what kinds of things do I have to submit to the addendum? \n\nThe forms are all confusing as heck and the schools IRB help page is 100% terrible.",

It asked for what we were doing, but not really reasoning when I was checking through the amendment forms. \n\nSuch a pain, do other universities have seminars with examples for this stuff? It seems we're 100% alone figuring this out",
