  "title:": "Can I get a supervisor if I\u2019m not with a university?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve just completed my post graduate course (MSc) and would like to carry on with some academic writing. I would have to do this independently as I am no longer at the university and don\u2019t currently wish to get a research job or work towards a phd just yet. \n\nI was just wondering, if I was to do this independently, would I be able to get a supervisor to guide me along with this? I\u2019m on really good terms with one of my previous supervisors and was wondering if they\u2019d be allowed to guide me through it even if I\u2019m no longer with the university?\n\nI just want to know if this a something that happens before I get in contact with him to discuss it :)",

      "text": "I'd expect not. Supervison is A LOT of work and if you're not paying tuition or consulting fees then they're doing it on top of existing workload for free so I'd be surprised if anyone would agree to it. Collaboration might be more of a possibility but you'd have to think about what you're bringing to the table.",

      "text": "I'd expect not, but you could potentially have a mentor. Lower your expectations though, because at the very best you might get a few casual meetings to discuss general directions and advice, or invitations to some seminars, so nothing like the kind of hands-on supervision you might be used to. For some people it's more than enough though.",

      "text": "I think one of your questions is whether your former advisors would be allowed to guide or work with you? The answer is yes. \nI think the other is would you be able to. Like others, I would not count on it. The most I would expect in this situation is they would tell you to send them a memo about your research and they would provide you brief feedback. But I would certainly try at least. Why don't you apply to the PhD program there especially if you are on good terms with a faculty there?",

Whether that person would work with you/mentor you is a different thing, and depends upon work load, personal interests, and even personal philosophy.  I personally think being a mentor, formally or informally, is probably our most important role as an academic.\n\nGo for it.  The worst the person can do is say no.",
