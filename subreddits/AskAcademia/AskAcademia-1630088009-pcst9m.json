Many institutions look at experience over credentials, unless the position requires a specific credential, of course. I know someone with an MA in English that\u2019s currently a Director at a university, but she had years of experience in higher ed. \n\nA go-to job board for many in higher ed is higheredjobs.com.",

But it's so hard to get even the attention of a local community college. At my university, I had several teachers that had a Masters in their subject and it was no issue. My teaching years have been at the middle grades level the most though, so 6-10th grades. Maybe that's what is holding me back, because of the drastically lower grade levels. \n\nI am glad that you asked this question because I was wanting to ask it in a similar way but was unsure of how to phrase it. I hope you are able to find success. Best of luck to you.",
