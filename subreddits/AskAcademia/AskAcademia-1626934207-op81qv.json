  "title:": "How long does it normally take EditorialManager to compile the PDF and send it to the corresponding author?",
  "text": "Hey everybody! This is the first time I've submitted a paper as a first author before and at the end of the submission on EditorialManager, it said that it will compile all of the docs into a PDF and send it to the corresponding author to give them the final say in submitting the paper. I thought that this process would be automatic and would only take a few minutes, however it's been a few days and I'm not sure if the paper has been forwarded to the corresponding author yet or if I've done something wrong? The \" Submissions Waiting for Author's Approval\" on my EditorialManager has stayed at 0, so I was wondering if anybody knows how long it normally takes to forward the compiled PDF to the corresponding author? Should I redo the submission process if something has gone wrong? TIA!",
