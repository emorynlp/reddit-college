  "text": "Hello,\n\n\nLong time lurker here. A bit about myself. I am third year teacher about to finish a Masters of Arts. I work in a pre-K-8th grade setting full time.  \n\nI am writing this post seeking advice and opinions on an online program from a regionally accredited (SACSCOC) traditional brick and mortar university. This program is a doctorate of education in curriculum and instruction. It is also CAEP accredited. It allows for a traditional dissertation or three academic articles. My questions are;\n\nIs this program credible to employers of academia, k-12 education, private education sector, or community/state leaders? Why or why not? I am looking to climb up the ladder in teaching or leadership opportunities. \n\nIs the cost (about 30k) worth it to advance my career? I understand for PhD you should always be funded but my situation is bit different with en Ed.D \n\nThat and any other advice/opinion would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you so much.",

You can also look at the credentials of people in your profession that have the type of career you aspire to. Are any of them graduates of the program you are considering?",

      "text": "As you note, it\u2019s pretty traditional for professional doctorates to require tuition.  Not a bad thing, necessarily, but a different model.  \n\nBest advice is to look at the job/career path you want.  Who is in those jobs now?  What degrees do they hold?  From where?  Where have they placed graduates? It\u2019s a problem if programs won\u2019t/don\u2019t tell you where their grads are.  They should be keeping track and willing to connect potential students with recent grads.  (And programs that don\u2019t are often hiding something.  They should be want to brag about where their grads have gotten jobs/promotions.)\n\nIf this degree gets you where you want to go, then cool.  If this degree won\u2019t get you where you want to go, that\u2019s a no from me.  If this degree isn\u2019t needed, 30k is a lot to be spending on something that\u2019s interesting/fun/etc, but you do you.",

      "text": "Former Louisiana teacher here and now postdoc having finished my PhD in curriculum and instruction. \n\nThe program is 100% credible. CAEP is the standard for most K-12 accreditation programs. However, depending on your goals, there are limits to a degree like this. You mentioned wanting to \"climb up the ladder.\" In a K-12 setting, that usually means entering into administration. In most settings, before entering into administration, you have to teach in a classroom for a minimum amount of years and obtain your administration certification (I don't know if you're in Louisiana or not as both of these will look different in each state). \n\nAll that said, while an Ed.D certainly can look good on a resume, it's not necessarily needed to enter into school administration. Typically a MEd is sufficient. Those doing the hiring will typically see these degrees as simply checking the necessary boxes the state or local school board have in place. Teaching experience is going to hold some of the biggest weight in addition to other leadership positions you've been in when applying for administrative positions. Have you been a department chair? Have you served on or led committees? Have you led professional development courses for your peers? These are the line items that will shine more than having an online Ed.D. \n\nMoving beyond school administration can be even trickier. Superintendent job positions can be national searches. Often you might find someone who has been in a district for 20+ years move to the district or state level. Again, none of these positions necessarily require an Ed.D. Moreover, there's a movement among R1 universities to combine Ed.D programs with law degrees. State level positions are going favor those degrees. \n\n\nLastly, you'll almost always end up paying for a professional degree like an Ed.D. It's significantly different both in experiences and requirements than a Ph.D in curriculum and instruction. I know this program allows for a traditional dissertation, three journal pubs, or a capstone project, but you'd most likely be completing a capstone similar to other Ed.D programs.\n\nYou stated that you are finishing up your MA. Depending on if that degree is discipline specific or a MA in curriculum and instruction, I'd potentially hold off on an Ed.D. Moreover, if you are teaching full time, some districts will pay for you to go back to school to get a higher degree--I'd look into that as that's how I got my Ed.S in gifted ed paid for. Also, most Ed.D programs are tailored for students that are working full time. Non-online programs should fit most people's schedules assuming they're nearby geographically.",
