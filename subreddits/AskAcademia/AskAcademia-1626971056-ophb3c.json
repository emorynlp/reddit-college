  "title:": "Should I phone my professor about an internship?",
  "text": "Hello everyone, I have a very silly question but I'm an extremely anxious person...\nBasically I'm looking for an internship, required by the curriculum for my master degree. I was interested in pursuing a photography internship with one of my professors, since he was looking for interns. I sent an email a while back and he phoned me, we discussed briefly and for the time being, I said I couldn't really work as much as he needed me to. He said that he would then contact me for sporadic work, or to just let me help at the studio, which I was really happy about! But I've never heard back from him...\n\nNow that my first year of master is done and the next looks way lighter, I was thinking of getting in touch again to try and secure an internship with him.\nSince he already phoned me, and he sounded very down to earth, should I call him back or is that super inappropriate? Should I send an email first, reminding him of our previous exchange (tho he never answered to my email and follow up messages...) and asking if he still needs interns?\n\nSorry again but I'm so afraid of messing this up, and working with him would really be a dream given what he does\n\nTLDR: should I call my professor to discuss an internship, since he had called me already, or should I first send an email and wait for him to get in touch?",

Restate the history of your previous communications as relevant, explain you now have more time and want to take on the internship, let him know you would be happy for him to call you to discuss if he is still interested. Dont cold call him, no one enjoys being unprepared for these kinds of discussions.",
