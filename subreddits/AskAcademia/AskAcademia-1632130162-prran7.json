  "title:": "Animal testing in microbiology/immunology research (academic or industry)",
  "text": "I'm in my second year of uni, hoping to eventually get into microbiology/immunology research in either an academic setting or industry setting.\n\nI understand that animal testing is necessary for medical research, but I'm not sure it's something I could handle doing myself. Especially killing an animal myself. \n\nMy academic advisor has been getting me to think about what direction to go for my research (pathogen or host focus and which specific disease) and I thought the answer to this may be tied to which has the least animal testing\n\nI just heard that ferrets are often used for influenza modelling which is very sad to me because I love ferrets and want to have one as a pet and I feel like because of that I'm less interested in influenza\n\nI've also been told that if you don't want to do animal testing, you don't have to but I'm guessing that will hinder my career.\n\nAny other animal lovers had the same issues with the field? Did you learn to live with it and compartmentalise it?\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful, thank you",

      "text": "I think you should discuss this preference with your PI. Maybe you don't have to be directly involved in handling the animals, you can do more modeling, data analysis etc. If you are truly uncomfortable you shouldn't be forced to do it. \n\nI work with animals and I also hate it. However, all the animals we use are particularly produced for research, they wouldn't exist if we didn't need to do our studies. So I take some solace knowing that nature overall is not affected, ecosystems are not harmed. Secondly, I make sure to follow the guidelines and ensure our animals are properly taken care of and minimize any pain or discomfort they might experience. And finally, as others mentioned, I try my damn hardest to make sure the results of those animals' sacrifice amounts to something, even a little advancement, so that their life is honored in that way.",

As others have stated, this may close some doors but many others will remain open. \n\nFWIW I take some comfort from the likelihood that our lab mice probably have simpler, less stressful lives than their wild counterparts. Ir so I like to imagine at least.",

      "text": "I conduct a pure in-vivo study on rats for 2 years. Practically, its extremely useful and translatable skill sets. Objectively, we perform it for the sake of scientific and medical progress. \n\nUnderstand that your medical product will require animal intervention eventually, because we need data and proof-of-concept for clinical and translational medicine. Can you confidently support your therapy/medication in human volunteers for clinical trials,  without first testing in animals? Would you volunteer yourself or family whose sick for an unproven product?\n\nNote that most lab animals were specifically bred, so they need to fulfill their purpose or otherwise sacrificed to prevent further costs. So, I promised to waste nothing and harvest everything from my animals - even when I don't need that organ/tissue. \n\nEthics committee also go through your experimental protocols to ensure no suffering (only minimally and in short time) of animals. \"Killing\" the animals is a skill - we have courses/certification for that. If you're not comfortable, you can always ask the assistance from experienced staff/students to minimize suffering of the animals. Hope you gain some clarity and good luck :)",

      "text": "Hi! I work in microbiology (food safety), and the only animals I work with are cattle. I collect their fecal samples and test for foodborne pathogen prevalence and antimicrobial resistance. I have friends that have never had to touch an animal. \n\nI took a human-animal interaction class in undergrad, and it was super interesting. We had a whole unit on animal research and the class was quite large, so there was a decent amount of views. In my opinion, the animal sacrifice is for the greater good, which makes it ethical to me. I just think that as scientists that work with animals, we need to treat them with the upmost respect while they\u2019re here.",

      "text": "Hello,European Horizon 2020 (H2020) started a new 5 years project which aims at using cross-omics to eliminate the use of sentient species in favor of drosophilia or daphnia. We hope this will change the way we use animals in chemical trials.\n\nAlso, animal testing is mostly for applied research. You could also do fundamental research and almost never get into a lab.\n\nFinally, if you don't like the wet lab, you could train yourself with a few key programming languages (mostly python and R in life-science) and switch to dry lab.",

Now how much and how many people will be happier as a result of this research; will harming this animal result in a discovery that eventually increases the happiness of many. The overall net gain is probably higher in the grand scheme of things. Also, think about if the animals deserve compassion, that ferret could be an asshole.",
