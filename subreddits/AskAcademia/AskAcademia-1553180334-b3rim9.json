  "title:": "I enjoy learning but I feel like I suffer from burnout and anxiety that affected my grades throughout school and has ultimately made learning harder. How to recover from this?",
  "text": "I am currently working now but have been in school for quite some time now (not a PhD, but I have a clinical degree + a masters) and feel like I developed a really unhealthy relationship with studying. Pulling all nighters and reviewing too much causing strain to my mind, which, in addition to personal circumstances  didn\u2019t fare well with my grades either (both degrees are sub 3.5). It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t study or got \u201clazy\u201d. Everytime a test would come I\u2019d continue to review and re-review, and was tense with anxiety but by the time I took the test my recall was hazy or sometimes I\u2019d overthink a question way too much and I didn\u2019t always perform well. \n\nThis has kind of ruined my self esteem quite a bit. I try not to compare but I continue feel less smart than my peers. I\u2019m not sure if this is even  imposter syndrome when some of them genuinely get better grades. I try learning on my own now but everytime I start, I just feel like I\u2019m not smart and I\u2019m trying to overcome this.\n\nI am not sure if this is sub makes the most sense to post, but I\u2019m sure many of you are students and tied to academia so maybe some can share their experiences? In case it will be asked, I do see a therapist but I feel I still have problems with this \n",

      "text": "I am a faculty member with ADHD who struggles--at times severely--with imposter syndrome. So, here's a game that my therapist and I play sometimes--let's say your *big fear* is that you are not as smart as your peers.  \n\n\nLet's, for the sake of the game, assume that *this is true.* Let's say that you are *actually not as smart as your peers.* Now, let's try to pick that idea apart.  \n\n\nWhy is this a problem? Why does this bum you out so much? Is it just a blow to your ego? If so, why are you *worried about it?* \n\n  \nThere will be many, many situations in which you will NOT be the smartest person in the room, and that's a good thing, because it means you have opportunities to learn from the people around you. It gives you an aspirational goal, and also the chance to figure out what they are doing or thinking about differently than yourself. Take advantage of this. Ask them for advice. It *seems* like this will make you curl up and die with shame, BUT! In my experience, revealing to someone you admire that you're struggling and would love their advice can actually feel like an enormous relief, and also they usually appreciate it as the enormous compliment it is.  \n\n\nDo you believe that intelligence is static? How do you define \"smart\"? Is it momentary and situational? Clearly, you are capable of working through the material and learning from it. You *know and understand* far more now, I am certain, than you did 10 years ago.  You've gotten through *two advanced degrees*. Do you know what a small minority of the global population that puts you into? Who, exactly, do you need to feel smarter than to be OK with what you've accomplished? What will it take?    \n\n\nDoes it feel unfair to you that you have to work harder at things than others? It IS unfair! It DOES suck! But here's what the easy ride gets folks--they don't get the gauntlet experience. They don't learn how to slog. They don't develop the tenacity of experience that you can only really get from trying your fucking hardest, coming up short, and then *showing up the next day to try again.*    \nMy husband was a slogger. Now that he's not in school, and is out actually working in his field, he is consistently praised for his ability to pinpoint what he doesn't know, and figure out how to learn it. He's a harder worker than others at his firm, and it gets him noticed. He's more critical of his own work, which means he *consistently produced better work than his peers.* He was never the top student in any class he took in undergrad or for his masters, but he is really, really, really good at what he does. He actually complained to me recently that he worked his *ass* off in school, and literally no employer since he graduated has asked him about his GPA.  \n\n\nIt also sounds like you have bought into the myth that tests are an accurate and objective way to measure knowledge of a subject--we know for a *fact* that they are not. We know for a *fact* that things like anxiety are not only disruptive to the studying, but also to the actual experience of being able to make good use of your working memory to recall information that you *know you know.*  It is ok to be bad at taking tests. This is not an accurate measure of your intelligence.   \n\n\nWhen I practiced investing less energy into figuring out whether or not I am *actually* smart, I learned to be more comfortable living in this body, with this brain. This is the only brain I'll get. It has some wiring issues. It makes things harder than they need to be sometimes, and that sucks, BUT! It has also been, overall, a really good brain. Maybe it doesn't matter if I'm as smart as or smarter than my colleagues. Maybe the fact that I am *here* is proof that I am \"good enough,\" and maybe I can thrive in \"good enough\" and keep learning not because I have something to prove, but just because I'm curious and I love it.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

          "text": "Thank you for this really elaborate and encouraging response. I do think when I was younger, I loved learning and was curious about the world naturally that became tied to pressure and presentation as I got older. I am just starting to accept that being \u201csmart\u201d in some conventional sense doesn\u2019t matter- in my masters program when I talked to my peers, I felt smart in some aspects and felt confident about myself when I knew what I was talking about and was also able to admit where I made mistakes or didn\u2019t get something-a caveat being only when everybody else was able to be honest too lol. I think when it came to testing the knowledge, that\u2019s where it felt I personally screwed up more than others. \n\nUnfortunately, I have a fragile self esteem that  probably got even worse when majority of my supervisors, PIs and currently my boss have been really condescending at made me feel like I\u2019m not capable or a total screw up. When I asked for feedback, many of them gave vague responses like \u201cyou just didn\u2019t do anything too special\u201d or something of that nature. I do my best to use these experience to honestly introspect and recognise where they may have just not been good advisers. But honestly, I\u2019ve never had an adviser or mentor who encouraged me so that feedback does go inward many times and has also made me reluctant to ask for help.\n\nI am hoping to get out of these thinking habits and establish a new way of looking at things and learning for pleasure! It is extremely difficult but I am determined to stay resilient. Thank you for helping to remind me of that! ",

              "text": "Glad I can help a little! And, because I'm avoiding work, I have more!  \n\n\nOne thing I learned in grad school is that I DO NOT DO WELL with \"tough love\" feedback. Many people do. I do not. Knowing this about myself helped me to vet potential mentors better before I pursued deepening a professional relationship with them. I actually *need* someone with more compassion and gentle-ness in their approach. I don't think I am bad or stupid or weak for needing this. Learning this about myself gave me the ability to seek these types of people out deliberately. I need someone who appreciates that validating what IS working well is important to the learning process as much as pointing our weaknesses.   \n\n\nI also learned to get better at asking the kinds of questions which could help my harsher critics frame their feedback in a way that I could make use of. I am far too easily wounded by negative feedback, and that's *my* problem. I've learned to ask better questions. If you are feeling frustrated and brushed off by super vague and general responses, get better at asking super specific and concrete questions. Practice follow up questions that don't feel defensive.   \n\n\nDon't assume you deserve 100% of the negative energy you get from others--many academics are, in fact, not great at giving helpful, compassionate feedback. Assume that what they are saying is both true, and not as bad as it sounds, and figure out what else you need to know to figure out how and why it's true, and how to adjust accordingly. ",

It is actually the only style of therapy I've ever tried that helped me make *noticeable, trackable* improvements with managing my anxiety, and developing some self-control and mindfulness (things which are super difficult with the ADHD).  \n\n\nAlso, I started my diagnosis process by talking to my primary care physician, who then made a referral. There is a lot of overlap between some ADHD symptoms and generalized anxiety and depression. I had been medicated for years for both anxiety and depression, though I've stopped both of those medications now that I am being properly medicated for the ADHD. I also know plenty of people with ADHD who have developed strong enough coping skills through therapy that they don't feel like they NEED the medication, which is an aspirational goal of mine. The same can often be true of anxiety--just because your brain has some default settings that really mess your life up doesn't mean you're trapped in your current situation.   \n\n\nCBT gave me the starter tools to think about my own thought process analytically, and to be much more self aware as to why and how things often *feel* the way they do in a way that doesn't quite match up with the reality that I can prove with evidence. It's helped me deconstruct and destroy some of those negative, cyclic cognitive distortions. ",

      "text": "Remember that the goal isn't to study, the goal is to learn the material and pass the exam. Studying without learning is an irresponsible waste of time. Many students make the mistake of focusing on studying, instead of focusing on the material. If you're studying just so that you can justify to yourself that you tried, you're doomed to fail. If you're confident in the material, you don't have to waste time studying at all (except perhaps a light review to be sure): spend the time on research or other tasks that will pay dividends in your career. \n\nThis is what the most successful students do. The extremely conscientious students often fall behind in grad school because they're spending their time studying material they already know, when they should be thinking, researching, and recharging. Producing high-quality original ideas that nobody has come up with before is inherently very demanding. Repetitive study habits are not enough.\n\nYour goal should be to spend as little time studying as possible while still learning the material, so that you can focus on your own research directions. Anything else is wasted time and effort. You'll fall behind students who aren't irresponsibly wasting their time on studying.",
