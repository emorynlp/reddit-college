  "title:": "PI requests I come into lab during COVID-19/Shelter-In-Place Order",
  "text": "Asking for advice of how to navigate this from other PIs?\n\nField: Physics\n\nTitle: Lab Tech\n\nCountry: USA\n\nBackground Information:\n\nPI alluded to, then straight up asked me (in private, over zoom), to come into the lab to resume the experiments during the COVID-19/shelter in place order in California. In the area I'm in, we're weeks out before the peak.\n\nI asked if we were even allowed, despite the order to *not* come in by the university president, but they respond with \"yeah, there are 'other' professors (cited only one) still coming in to do their work. They are just telling anyone that checks that it's \"essential maintenance\" of the lab\". They know I have a building key to get in.\n\nPersonally, I feel uncomfortable given that there's an active p a n d e m i c and the risk of exposure to my family/at-risk parents. I also feel like they are using my motivation and commitment to get data to publish/have publications for upcoming PhD applications.\n\nOn the other hand, I understand where PI is coming from, but only because they are pressured to have/present results in an upcoming meeting for federal funding. Given the track record of actions I've observed working with them over the past year, unfortunately, they seem driven by slight ego to prove their place in the field, since we're not at an R1 institution.\n\nAny tips to address this? I don't want to be completely blunt in my response because I do need their letter of recommendation later on/need them to have a positive view on my work before I leave.\n\nThanks in advance for reading this/replying(if you do) :)\n\n**TL;DR:** PI asking me to go to lab during pandemic, via loop holes, when I shouldn't. Tips?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Wow! Thanks again for all who are responding. Judging by how my PI is more focused on data right now, I think I have time to draft up response in writing. \n\nAlso, to clarify, the university has given out notices that the campus is closed, but is extremely vague when it comes to research personnel. It only states \"PIs should consider the necessity of on-campus research and implements plans to operate remotely to the greatest extent possible. Essential access, limited to sustaining research capability, will be authorized by the Office of the Provost in coordination with Deans.\" \n\nMy PI *says* that they have pushed for a clearer explaination, but haven't gotten any. Also they have said that the Department Chair and Dean have been working to determine essential employees, but haven't made the list available to everyone. On top of that, my PI alluded that they could get our lab and names on the list to make it easier to come to campus. \n\nLastly, to those who say to make sure I look for better PIs in grad school, I am definitely using this experience as a learning lesson haha Let this be a lesson for anyone reading this ",

This is an R1 in the US. \n\nBe completely honest and say you worry about your own health. just be kind about it. \"hello dr xxx, I'm sorry but I'm unable to perform the tasks assigned as I worry about the health and well-being of my family as well as myself during these trying times.\" something along those lines.",

The only possibilities that occur to me are (1) university officials who notice activity in the lab, or (2) police who might stop you on the way to campus, so it seems to me that your PI has either encouraged you to lie to the university or encouraged you to lie to the police.",

What we do expect is for people to be writing papers, creating models, etc from home as long as they're being paid. Expectations are not of 100% effectiveness they would have had if they were working regularly, as well, since we're all stressed out and dealing with problems of our own.\n\nFor example, I have 6 hours of WebEx today compared to what would usually be 4 hours of meetings. They're also way more draining than a regular meeting (everyone please invest in a good microphone and don't use speakers to reduce echo for your meeting participants). This means I'm supposed to have 3 hours to do my own work, but I'm going to be so wiped out I'll be lucky if 1 of them is effective.",

      "text": "This really pisses me off, and your PI is part of the problem with academia today.  This sounds like a typical psychopathic PI request - putting his/her own research ahead of the people who make it happen.  I think there are several things wrong with this request.\n\nThe first is the ethical and legality of the request.  A stay at home order in many states (California included, I believe) is an executive order, which means it's effectively law.  Is your PI willing to pay your fine if you get caught?  Is your PI willing to bail you out of jail if you get caught?  In my state, these are the consequences of getting caught, and it's not hard to get caught either.  If a cop pulls you over because of a broken tail light, and you're not supposed to be out, you could go to jail.\n\nI would also worry about working for any PI who places the health and welfare of his research team in such a low position.   On ANY research team, the most important resource is people.  Is your PI willing to sacrifice your life so that he/she can get another abstract at some conference that probably won't even happen?\n\nFinally, the whole idea of federal funding risk is overblown. The funding agencies are currently being quite flexible with the PIs at this time.  The NSF policy, for example, provides a tremendous amount of flexibility in terms of extensions, salaries, etc.  The NSF is even letting us charge cancelled trips to our grants.   If your PI is pressuring you with this, then I believe you are being mislead.\n\nIt's terrible when PI's abuse their people like this.  I would seriously consider finding another PI to work for.",

Labs freezers etc are being checked to maintain key supplies. I get the impact on grant and contract work as this will severly hurt a lot of research programs.  My concern here is the verbal ask without context of the university or department approach to research continuation.\n\n Are you an essential employee required to come to campus? Do you have a letter indicating it? Regardless you should express your concern in writing and concerns over the health of you and  your family.  If you are essential this could be very tricky... Follow up in writing with your concerns. If you get push back, I would look at uni policy and talk to HR for clarification on policies. There are some scenarios that make the ask reasonable, but I suspect your uni hasn't given clear orders to cease onsite research completely. Continuation of research right now is a bit ridiculous for non COVID projects if you can't do the work off site... If they have and the PI is ignoring orders, I would not risk my health or the ire of campus police to go in... If you get found you would need more than a Dr. So and so told me to come in...\n\nGood luck OP.",

      "text": "Obviously this is shady and you shouldn't go in.\n\nBut I'd suggest approaching this constructively. If the research really is that critical, then your PI should have no trouble coming up with an open, written plan to justify it, right? You shouldn't have to lie.\n\nMy lab stands to lose tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, especially if this is handled poorly. My PI actually takes safety seriously, though, so we shut down all lab operations a few weeks ago except for bare minimum equipment upkeep. Even for that, we wrote to the administration justifying why it needed to be done, and explaining how we would minimize the risk. There's a paper trail, and campus security knows who's allowed to be there, when, and why.\n\nWe hope to restart some of our research at some point, but we're not just doing it in the dark. My PI is working together with other PIs to put together a concrete plan. They're working on documentation to discuss the risks and come up with reasonable policies so that the most critical research can be done without unduly endangering students. The key is that this is all being done in the open, so they're genuinely weighing the risks and coming up with real plans to keep people safe.\n\nMy point is, if your research is critical and there's a way for you to continue it safely, then your PI should have no trouble justifying it to third parties, like your school's administration. Check if your school has some process in place for approving critical work. You could even offer to help your PI come up with a plan to do things safely.\n\nIf your supervisor refuses to even try to do this openly, then I would think you have even stronger grounds to refuse to go in.",

You're a lab tech: if your PI doesn't get funding in and publications out, then you don't have a job.  If it's important *and permitted* for this work to happen, then work with the PI to make sure the work happens.  If it can't be done by you, can he or someone else come into the lab and move things along with you directing them over the phone?",
