  "title:": "Dropped out of college with low GPA, desperately want to get back",
  "text": "I dropped out of college ~6 years ago with a 2.14 GPA and a lot of debt. I really want to finish my degree, but I\u2019m unsure as to how I could get accepted back into a university with my low GPA (low GPA and dropping out was due to mental health issues). I should also add I\u2019m more than 3/4 of the way of finishing, meaning all Gen Ed requirements are already done so going to a CC seems like a waste of money. Any advice would be tremendously appreciated.",

      "text": "You don't say if you want to go back to the same institution. If not, be aware that all of your classes might not transfer. If you went to a state system university, those credits might transfer to other sister institutions.\n\nOur university system also has an academic renewal for students who left at least 4 years ago but it also requires starting completely over--you can't keep some classes and drop others. You might check your original university and see what they say about repeating classes if you earned D or F grades in any of them. Some places will drop the lower grade from your needed graduation GPA and other places do not.\n\nAlso, you mention university and a lot of debt. You might well find that a state college would be much less expensive than a university.\n\nFor all of this, start with the catalog and see what it says. If anything isn't clear, contact the admissions office(s) of the institutions that you're considering.\n\nBy the way, in my first year as a professor in 1981 a student who had flunked out of our CC (twice!) came back and told me he was going to be successful this time. He essentially started over, earned a very high GPA at our CC, transferred to the most prestigious state university, went to an Ivy for his doctorate and then stayed there for his career as a research professor. So, you can certainly do this!",

For one, depending on what you were studying, 6 years is a long time to be away and it's possible they won't accept some or all of those credits. For two, CC isn't going to be a waste of money if it prepares you for actually going back to school again, and allows you to more accurately judge your own limits and skills, especially compared to potentially paying full price to jump with both feet directly into the final year of a program when you've been out of school for 6 years.",

Resist the urge to take on more debt to go to a for-profit.\n\nAlso, you don't say *why* you want to go back. \"Finishing a degree\" doesn't get you all that much, not what it did 30-50 years ago. (Coincidentally I was reading Ryan Craig's book on higher ed this afternoon.) You'll get much better ROI for your time and money if you have a clear career plan *before* you re-enroll.\n\nGood luck!",

Your prior university is likely to reaccept you, and if you go somewhere else, you should be fine at your average university since you're re-entering as a non-traditional student (but wouldn't get into a competitive program).\n\nAll universities operate in an 8 year cycle, however. You will likely need to work with an academic advisor to appeal your own university to reactivate your old catalog year (the year you started). Otherwise, or if you go elsewhere, you start with the most recent catalog where course requirements may be different. You'll likely be required to complete the final 30 credits in your major / degree at the university you plan to graduate from, regardless... that's relatively standard.",
