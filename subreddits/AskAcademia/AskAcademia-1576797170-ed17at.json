  "title:": "How to deal with students coming to me at the end of the semester to tell me they had mental health issues during the semester and would like some leniency in the grading?",
  "text": "I haven't taught undergrads in ages, and this semester I got a surprise when multiple underperforming students emailed at the end of the semester to say they had mental health problems over the semester. Of course, they aren't just telling me their personal business, they are hoping for some leniency in the grading. All of them missed a big assignment or two and had attendance issues. \n\nI feel like when someone tells me something like this, I should be (and am), really alarmed. Are they getting help? Should I call the counseling center? Their advisor? \n\nI don't know what to do about the leniency issue. I remember being an undergrad and at least 50% of us were a total mess - sleep deprivation, junk-food diets, and social dramas left us all only barely functional and able to concentrate most of the time. Should I throw them a bone?\n\nWhy are so many undergrads talking to me about their mental health issues?\n\nEDIT: I should add that I say explicitly in my syllabus and on the first day of class that I am open to helping students with any sort of \"special case\" I say explicitly that anything that has do do with mental or physical health (or any family issues) qualified and they should come to be as soon as they become aware that it is (or even might be) an issue for class. I am happy to work something out that will make things easier for them, but I can't change grades retroactively or move deadlines when they have already passed.",

      "text": "Does your college have a system in place for documenting such things and vetting accommodations? If they do, then refer your students to that. Doing it case-by-case based on what the students tell you is inviting a whole lot of convincing fiction, which will tragically blend in with some genuine need. But even the ones in genuine need have to learn to seek out resources and advocate for themselves in an appropriate way.\n\nWhy are they talking to you about it? Because they've been told that the stigma is outdated and foolish, and they should be comfortable talking about it and asking others for help. There's some truth to that, but they're young and a bit clumsy, and haven't yet pinned down the ways to fit such talk into an appropriate request, so it comes across as over-sharing. That's true for my students, anyway. Sometimes all they want me to do is listen, and I'm happy to do that. But if they want a break on anything in the class, they document it with the appropriate office or no dice.",

I have a delayed sense of stress, which makes it hard to acknowledge that my mental health was not where it should have been a month ago. I think compassion is really important, especially when students are dealing with all the things OP listed, in addition to some of them actually being neurodivergent. But I also think compassion looks like a lot of different things, and retroactively changing a grade isn't necessarily one of them.\n\nIs it possible to change these students' grade (if already submitted) to incompletes and giving them an opportunity to achieve half-credit on a make up assignment or something like that?",

It may be that they haven't gotten to a place like me where they know how to advocate, but it also may be the case that they are using what are real problems for people as manipulation. It sucks because it means those of us who really do have these issues are taken less seriously sometimes. To me, this is bullshit to do at the very end. In saying all of that, students are more stressed than every for several reasons which may account for the increase. This is well documented. I just don't think it means they should get their grade bumped. It's not fair to the other students in the class.",

      "text": "As an undergrad with anxiety disorder and panic disorder, this sort of irks me. \n\nI dealt with these issues myself for the first couple of terms of uni, but it became so bad for me that in my third term, I wasn't able to sit through any classes or exams without getting panic attacks, so I sought the advice of a doctor. At the time, we didn't know I was having panic attacks, but at the very least, it was documented. For that term, I was given an official withdrawal from my classes (after going through the appropriate channels).\n\nIt took me some time to find someone that could actually diagnose me (a psychiatrist) as my symptoms were just physical. Still, I was in seeing the doctors and following their advice. I didn't like doing this, but I knew I had to in order to be taken seriously, and to have a paper trail.\n\nOnce I was given my diagnosis, I went through the process of registering with the disability centre, where I was given accommodations to suit my needs. My professors are made aware of this at the beginning of each term, and I visit them to touch base.\n\nAdditionally, I was granted a retroactive withdrawal from my university (with the help of my psychiatrist and doctors) which means that I can \"withdraw\" from my second term of classes (which is almost 3 years ago now) because while I didn't see doctors until term 3, they agree I would have been suffering the same issues in term 2. \n\nIf these students that e-mail you truly have mental health issues, these are the paths they can take. They need to start by seeking help at a university medical clinic. If it comes out that they do indeed have a condition that prevented them from doing well in your class, the school will take care of it for you. \n\nIt seems nowadays everyone has \"mental health issues\" when it suits them. It does a disservice to all those who do suffer, as we are taken less seriously. Obviously I can't know the condition of the students that e-mail you, but directing them down the medical route helps everyone, and keeps grading fair.",

But I have an incredibly hard time pulling off advocating for myself when I have issues that aren't simple like testing in a diffrent location. The support offices at my school say it is my responsibility to negotiate with faculty individually for any issues I'm having in class. I don't really know what to tell my faculty without giving explicit details about why I'm struggling, and I don't really know what I can ask/suggest for reasonable support. Whenever I ask these offices for help, I get bounced around to diffrent places before someone tells me it's my responsibility to figure it out independently with the professor. I really don't have a problem solving issues myself, I just don't really know what to do.",

              "text": "For me, my panic attacks seem to be triggered by sitting in or near a group of people. Naturally, that means attending class and sitting through exams are difficult. My accommodations at the disability centre are essentially 1) having the opportunity to take my tests and exams at the centre, in a room by myself; 2) opportunity to move my participation mark into the exams marks (if my class has participation marks). These two things are what my disability centre advisor and I agree to. Anything else is between the prof and myself. \n\n\"Reasonable,\" in my view, means any accommodation that puts me on a level playing field as other students. I don't need extra time or breaks, so I don't ask for them. \n\nAttending class is something the disability centre can't quite help with, so I tend to use the required textbooks, readings, online sources, and see the prof at their regular office hours. Communication with your professor is key to your success (with a disability and without). Most students don't attend office hours so you'll have their attention and their one on one time is invaluable.\n\nAs for \"sudden symptoms,\" I have not dealt with this since being with the disability centre, as I'm fine taking exams there. If I try to go to class but can't manage it, I just don't go. However, if you are taking your exams at a Centre and experience an onset of symptoms that make it difficult for you to perform on your test, I'm sure they have options for you. I've seen other students have panic during exams, and in some cases, are sent to the nurse before returning to their exams. Is that what you meant by sudden symptoms? Correct me if I'm wrong, please. I think having these discussions with your professor will also help. \n\nAlso, if you do have an advisor at your disability centre, they are supposed to be your advocate for the centre, too. \n\nFinally, you are never required to disclose any details of your disability if you are uncomfortable with that (except to your doctor). With that in mind, try focusing on what is affected by your disability instead of your disability itself. For example, instead of saying \"I get panic attacks when sitting with other people in class,\" you can say \"The nature of my disability makes it difficult for me to sit with large groups/Being able to sit by myself to write my exam will help me perform optimally.\" Believe it or not, most profs want to see you do your best. Don't be afraid of reaching out to them, because the worst thing that can happen is they say no.\n\nIf they do say no, and you've made a reasonable request, I would then pay a visit to your advisor at the disability centre, where you would find a solution that works for everyone. The advisor would then send an e-mail to your prof, asking them to agree to the terms set out in said e-mail.\n\nWorking with your disability centre and your professor is key. It does take a bit of running around, but it's essential. \n\nLet me know if I missed anything; I hope that's helpful! If my own issues are very different from yours and you still aren't sure how to negotiate accommodations, feel free to DM me and I can try to help there, too.",

It is 100% appropriate to justify a bad grade to future employers/universities due to mental health issues. But it is an *entirely different* matter to ask for a better grade because of it at the last minute. Especially when they did not seek to talk about these big missed assignments at an earlier time. Hell, even a week ago would've been better. Instead a whole bunch of them waited till the very end where the least amount of effort (typing up an email with a impactful phrase) nets the largest return.\n\nMost universities bombard inboxes with Mental Health Seminars, Walk-ins, contact info, reading material, etc on a weekly basis. There are posters everywhere along with events/gatherings etc talking about mental health. I am assuming you are teaching at such an institution. These students have no excuse to email you for leniency. I think the best course of action would be to talk to these students one-on-one, refer them to the University's Counseling and Psychological Services and tell them that you will grade them as you would grade any other student.

                      "text": "I decided a long time ago that, when it comes to teaching, I would vastly prefer being known as a professor who has compassion and is occasionally taken for a ride by an unscrupulous student, than as a hardass who demanded to see grandma\u2019s death certificate or hospital discharge papers.\n\nI have had a student disappear for several weeks because her husband kicked the shit out of her and she was in the hospital. I worked with her and gave her extensions on everything she\u2019d missed, I sat with my arm around her shoulder while she sobbed, I helped her find domestic violence resources and counseling for herself and her son, who she brought to my lectures on occasion for the rest of the semester. She earned an A.\n\nI had one student who struggled all semester with tardiness and absence and, I suspected, addiction issues. I supported him as best as I was able, coached him during office hours, encouraged him to seek counseling, and offered him extensions on the final when he didn\u2019t show up to take it. I sent emails repeatedly to give him extra chances to not fail. I eventually was forced to give him an F, and several months later during a concerned \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay\u201d Google search, I discovered that he\u2019d been murdered in a parking lot a day or so after the final exam where he no-showed.\n\nA lot of shit can happen to your students. Students are human beings, young adults learning to manage their lives for the first times, and they don\u2019t always have their shit entirely together. Circumstance, and particularly mental illness, can rob them of their ability to be timely in recognizing that they can\u2019t manage to chew that which they\u2019ve bitten off.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult balance, being equal parts demanding professor insisting upon academic standards tempered against accommodating the fickle bullshittery flung by life towards young people dealing with their initial forays into complete adult independence, but there\u2019s definitely virtue in showing mercy and teaching them about the coursework AND life.",

              "text": "Point 1: You're assuming people will judge them for going to a mental health center. Maybe it depends on the region but going in for mental health is seen as a sign of personal strength and wisdom where I'm from. Even if it is, that is not always a strong reason as to why someone didn't seek out support in the first place. How is everyone supposed to know you went to the mental health center? This isn't high school, people are not concerned about social standings, and medical records are kept private for a reason. \n\nPoint 2: It's a desperate attempt to salvage their performance because it's at the last minute. NO ONE would be talking about ethics if they had reached out anytime before or near their issues with the course. It seems desperate because if they had mental health issues and took responsibility, asking for help wouldn't come at December 20th, way after they can do anything to fix their grades. Take a look at the replies in this thread and you'll see people who have struggled with serious mental health issues and still support the professor directing them to mental health services but not automatically giving them a passing grade. The university has grades so that people who do well are recognized as doing well by the standards the university sets. Diminishing that standard reduces the hard work that students have gone through to achieve good grades and leads me to my third point.\n\nPoint 3: You claim that \"it's not like these are Oxford scientists or Yale Law students and so giving undeserved grades is ok. If college is not \"the Olympics\" as you have pointed out, then why is it so big a deal to give them a failing grade? If college is what I think it is, a 4 year experience whose value lasts for about as long as your first 1 or 2 full-time jobs, then getting an F and redoing the course later is not a big deal either by your same logic. Also are people who are in high stakes environments less deserving of empathy because of how prestigious their university is?\n\nPoint 4: You keep citing the most terrible examples of mental health that people experience in our society. That is somewhat fair, as these issues do exist and it is not possible for most of us to even comprehend what these people have gone through. This is not a strong point however because it is completely speculative. IF these students suffered terrible things, then they should get a pass, is not a strong argument. Then you also must ask, how terrible must the situation be in order to deem it worthy of an excuse? Then someone has to judge the situation, which comes all the way back to where we are now, which is to direct people to mental health resources and have someone recommend if a student should receive leniency or not. Saying \"I have mental health problems\" should not become an end-all argument as people will start to have problems with that logic and the issues surrounding mental health will take on the negative idea of \"this is an excuse\". Just yesterday I saw someone trying to con the professor into giving them a passing grade because of several illegitimate reasons but passed them off in an emotionally charged way. Also I know that it's is not fair for people who have mental health issues to suffer more than everyone else because of things they can't control. That's why we have and are developing a mental health system to try and level the playing field. I say develop because I'm certain that colleges can improve their process. \n\nPoint 5: Saying \"get a grip\" is undeniably rude. Calling someone's ego \"fragile\" is undeniably rude. Maybe you like the burn factor a little much but if you really want to defend your opinion and your take on mental health, be more rational so that people on the other side of the argument take you seriously. I'm sure it works great for people who agree with you and want to get fired up but it is in no way a good idea for settling a disagreement. Why do you think the OP feels like replying is pointless? Because the tone of your argument suggests you're not willing to settle or compromise. \n\nPoint 6: A lot of what's being said in this thread is tied to people relating their own similar mental health experiences. I have had similar experiences to this topic and others who agree with me have had similar experiences to this topic. Just out of curiosity and without needing to elaborate, have you?",

It did and still does mean the world to me that all of my professors responded with understanding and compassion and were willing to work with me so that I would not be put on academic suspension. But it was very much the case that they went out of their way to *not fail me*, not to give me an A I hadn't earned.\n\nThose same professors were also honest and direct about the fact that I had in various ways failed to meet the expectations of the class, and that my final grade needed to reflect that. Just as much as I appreciated how kindly they responded when I reached out to them, I also genuinely appreciated and respected the fact that, while they were happy to bend where they could in order to help me, they weren't willing to throw their grading standards out the window just because I had been struggling. I had to withdraw from several classes and earned a C for the first time in my life, which really freaked me out; but also helped drive it home that I had brought this upon myself, *not* for having mental health issues in the first place, but for failing to reach out for the support I needed as soon as I realized that I was struggling. That was an important lesson for me to learn.\n\nIn terms of practical solutions, my professors dealt with this in different ways \u2013\u00a0some allowed me to take an incomplete and turn in all of the assignments I had missed over the summer, with a hit to my participation grade for the class time I had missed; some gave me a zero on the assignments I had failed to turn in, but were willing to weight the assignments I *had* turned in more heavily so that I could pass the class; some offered to switch me to pass/fail grading as long as I completed all of the work I had missed; some allowed me to withdraw from the class after the deadline to do so had already passed, to avoid having an F on my transcript.\n\nBut, again, in all of these cases I worked *very hard* to make up the work I had missed and then some, and even with all of that hard work, my transcript really suffered during those semesters. I was just relieved that I hadn't been suspended. I wouldn't have expected or frankly wanted full leniency when I knew full well that I had seriously messed up by not making arrangements with my professors from the get-go. If your students don't already feel that way, I do think that that's an important thing for them to understand. \n\n(In terms of reaching out to somebody with concern about these students: at my university, professors were expected to report concerns to the student's academic advisor, who would then trigger appropriate responses from student counseling/university housing/etc. Obviously the policy might not be the same everywhere, but that might not be a bad place to start.)",

      "text": "I encourage you to treat mental health like physical health or illness. If, for example, a student had the flu or sustained an injury, you'd likely take that into consideration and work with them on adjusted deadlines, etc. The same is good when a student is experiencing challenges with their mental health. And, at the same time, that doesn't mean that you have to give a student any leniency that they ask for. If a student had the flu in October, didn't turn in a major assignment, and they come to you in December asking to turn it in for full credit, you might not be inclined to do so; the same applies here.\n\nOne of the challenges, to be sure, about mental health concerns is that they may last throughout much of a semester or longer, whereas being sick is shorter. And many of the symptoms may play directly into the challenges students are having with academics (e.g., depression makes it difficult to motivate oneself to do coursework).\n\nYou ask what's different now vs. when you were an undergrad. Ultimately, there is less of a stigma about mental health concerns now than in the past, and students are more likely to talk about their mental concerns. That's a good thing! It's also good to not just accept years of sleep deprivation and junk food diets as the way college ought to be--I want my students to thrive both academically and personally. (Also at play: thanks to more access to psychological services and medications for the K-12 population, more students with mental health concerns who would not have made it to college in past generations are college students now. Again, a good thing, but it factors into things here.)\n\nI don't think you need to call the college counseling center (but I would offer to walk a student over there if a student was experiencing an acute mental health crisis). I do think it may be worth having a conversation with students about available campus resources and encouraging them to go to the counseling center or seek out other psychological resources if they are not already doing so.\n\nUltimately, what this boils down to for me is a few things. 1) Have empathy and compassion for these students. They are struggling personally and, because they are struggling personally, they are struggling academically, which feels bad, too. 2) As I said before, I think it's good to work with students who are experiencing mental health challenges in the same way you would accommodate for students who experienced medical challenges. And 3) Just because a student experiences a mental health challenge during a semester does not mean you have to be lenient and adjust their grade at the end of the semester. They still need to earn their grade (including turning in all major assignments) and communicate about challenges related to the course in a timely fashion. If there is a small something you can do (e.g., accept this missing assignment later than you otherwise would have) that will help a student to pass, you might consider it. But ultimately, you can be empathetic and kind and help to connect these students with resources while also giving them the grade they have earned in the class.",

Then follow with a disclaimer that basically says \"these are the people you should talk to when you have problems, they will notify me if there is an official need for accomodation or other response.\"\n\nIt's good practice in general (in case a student isn't aware of said services) but it also prevents students from showing up during finals claiming they've had some issue they just haven't gotten around to telling you about or getting documented.",

              "text": "I largely agree with your advice here, including providing information about counseling services on campus and how you'll go about accommodations. I do want to note that it's not quite so straightforward as the counseling center notifying a professor that a student needs accommodations, though:\n\n1. Therapists in the counseling center are required to keep almost all client information confidential. They won't just call up the student's professor.\n\n2. It can take time to come to a diagnosis. It can often take a student a couple of weeks to get a first appointment (university counseling centers are often booked out that far in advance), and a student might see their therapist every other week. So it could take a month or longer to get things into action when a student is in distress but not in imminent crisis.\n\n3. After going to a counselor, there are really two avenues for a student to get accommodations. First is through the Dean of Students Office. This is typically for concerns that are more situational in nature. For example, if a student experienced the loss of a loved one in the middle of the semester, they may be experiencing substantial grief and be struggling academically. The Dean of Students Office can inform professors of the student's general situation (or confirm the details from a more official source) and encourage faculty to take the student's circumstances into consideration. The second is the college's accessibility services. A student typically needs a formal diagnosis for this, which takes time to get if they don't already have one. The system works alright for, say, a student with ADHD who needs extra time for exams, they've received the diagnosis prior to the semester, and they can seek out this accommodation from the beginning of the semester. For a student who experiences a mental health concern in the middle of the semester, it can take a almost whole semester to go through all the hoops to get accommodations.\n\nI say this all because, while it's great for students to go to the counseling center and seek support, I also think it's important to recognize that getting access to enough counseling that it begins to help (e.g., a few sessions), medication, or academic accommodations can be a long and confusing process for students, and they may be struggling academically in the meantime.",

But it can also take a couple of days: if a student presents to our counseling center with a problem and gives permission for her professors to be notified, we receive an email almost immediately that says basically \"Student X is receiving services from the counseling center.\" That alone is enough for me to automatically extend whatever support seems appropriate-- which is more than I can do on my own when I get an email from a student saying \"I have anxiety\" or whatever.",

I was an undergrad registered with disability services and had made my accommodations official with the university. All this meant was that I could send this document and the professor just had to follow what has been agreed upon in the event that I need a little help. \n\nBeyond that we are allowed to apply through the university student services for consideration but documentation is necessary. Usually you would want to apply for an extension before it even gets to asking for leniency. \n\nDocumentation is a fraught and tedious process. I spent 3 years with no diagnosis and documentation and failed everything, spiralled and nearly ended it all. When I finally got out there and had that record of psychologist visits, medication, doctors notes behind me, advocating for myself became easier. These students should have some of that, even if its hard. And \"leniency\" shouldn't be the goal in the event of something going wrong.",

Also note that this still doesn't mean leniency in grading in most if not all cases.\n\nI would remove that section in your syllabus and instead revise it to point them towards these resources so they don't think you are open to changing grades based on their stories and/or make it clear that any intervention must be done before the assignment deadlines.",

(That is of course if they have something like seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in which depression is periodic and one can plan for it.) I've been in this situation before when I was an undergraduate while I was discovering my SAD and thankfully my professor helped me file a medical withdrawal. Years later, I've just now completed my PhD and am grateful for that professor that helped me in this capacity.   \n\n\nI had a conversation with a department head about this very same issue one day during a pickup basketball game. He asked me why I thought \\~20% of his students weren't turning in assignments, attending lectures, or taking exams. During our conversation, he then had the epiphany that his 20% of students might be a sample of the overall reported \\~%20 of undergraduate students dealing with depression. He planned to personally reached out to each of them before the end of the semester to ask them if they were dealing with any mental health issues.  \n\n\nIt's a tricky situation, but as others have suggested, I would err on the side of caution and help them try and get a medical withdrawal. Good luck!",

      "text": "For the current semester you'll probably have to make some decisions on a case by case basis. I'd make them turn in all their missing work before I'd even consider being lenient about my grading policy, but it also would depend on what effort the individual student has made over the entire semester. Mental health issues suck, but there are plenty of people living with severe mental health disorders who do turn in their homework on time. For next semester, you should find out of your institution has a disability support services (DSS) office (or something similar) and ask them what would be appropriate to put on the syllabus. My institution has specific phrasing for syllabi that communicates that the DSS office is the point of contact for any student that may require accommodation for a physical or mental health issue. You don't have to be \"disabled\", but they will coordinate things like having extra test time for students with dyslexia or severe test anxiety or being allowed to take an incomplete and make up missed work if they had an unexpected physical or mental health issue during the semester. Students who would like any academic accommodation need to register with DSS and fill out a form that says how the impairment impacts their ability to learn/work and what accommodations they are requesting. DSS reviews the form and then confirms what, if any, accommodations are appropriate. Some cases require a doctor to confirm diagnosis, some cases get approved but have conditions attached (extra exam time, but exam must be taken same day as the rest of the class; have longer deadlines for writing assignments, but must get tutoring at university writing center and have them sign off on assignments for them to be accepted late). It is the student's responsibility to give their professor(s) a copy of their approved accommodations, if they want to. They can get approved and NOT request accommodations, but the professor isn't required to give them any special consideration unless/until they are made aware of the approved accommodations. Professor has the discretion to decide whether they will allow retroactive accommodations for a student who didn't notify them until after the fact. Students are not obligated to disclose the nature of their \"disability\" to their professors and that info is not listed on the accommodation approval confirmation letter.\nMight not be a bad idea to put the contact info for student health or student counseling on the syllabus and make a point of telling students that if they are having a medical or mental health issue during the semester (regardless of if they're registered for accommodations) that impacts their ability to complete an assignment, it is their responsibility to request an extension no later than the assignment due date and requests will be handled at your discretion on a case by case basis.",

If these students are clinically depressed they will have doctors notes. I would assume most of the students who use \"depression\" as a crutch are not depressed at all, clinically or otherwise. I found it nothing less than insulting when the lazy students used to to help their shit grades, as did other members of my class. I imagine many people would. Especially since students are friends, and you know that x student isn't depressed, he's been sitting on his hole all year smoking weed and playing video games while everyone else was working.",

Most. Most students will suffer from depression at some point in their 4 years at college. How many of them use it as an excuse not to work? Very few. And inn their cases, it's obviously justified.
