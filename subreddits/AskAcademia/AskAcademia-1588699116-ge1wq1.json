      "text": "Hey !\n\nI work in Research after having competed my studies a short while ago. I had the **exact. same**. **problem**.\n\nI loved reading. In high school, I used to sometimes just hunker down for a day, just me and a book. But after uni and my job in research, I've had a lot of trouble.\n\nThere are two methods that I've tried that work for me.\n\n1. If it is about **reading for your own pleasure**: start with easy-to-read stuff, I started with things I enjoyed reading, like comics/manga. It'll help you slow down, enjoy the drawings, and take your time. Privilege calm ones. Then move on to short novels. Completing a novel will help you feel like you achieved something. Then, take it to the next level, try bigger ones, still easy-to-read. Try to find your own pace again. I recently read a history trilogy by Ken Follett, and it was easy while being really thrilling.\n2. If it is about **scientific/article/administrative reading**: I'd privilege **reading out loud**. As you have to make complete sentences when you read out loud, you focus on the content and next few words, that's it. Progressively lower you voice, but at your own rhythm, as you get comfortable. Get to a whisper, and soon, it'll be gone.\n\nI also read poems sometimes, I started reading Leaves of Grass (I'm not really familiar with american classical literature), and pronouncing the sounds felt really good. I felt like I was eloquently spoken.",

          "text": "I would agree with your point about reading out loud. I have the opposite problem- I have never learned to skim read  effectively. When I read I hear every word \"out loud\" in my head, and that seems to be incompatible with skimming.\n\nWhen I have to read something more deeply, like a text in another language or a difficult part of an academic article, I tend to actually read it out loud and it usually helps.",

      "text": "Hey I currently teach research methods and here are the strategies I recommend to my students.\n\nBefore you Read -\nIs this a paper that you need to read in depth or is skimming the important pieces enough? For most papers you don\u2019t need (or have the time) to do an in depth dive.\n\n1.\tStep one is to identify when you have the mental resources available for a cognitively demanding task. (You don\u2019t want to do this kind of reading when you are tired from a days work)\n\n2.\tThe goal above anything else is to engage with the material in a meaningful manner i.e. beyond surface details (cognitive psychology refers to this as deep processing vs shallow processing)\n\nThe following is my strategy for beginning a deep dive\n\n-\tread the abstract and the conclusion section first - this gives you a roadmap for the important aspects of the paper. (Goal is to figure out what the author wants you to understand about their research)\n-\tafter that i look at the relevant figures and see how they fit in.\n-\tlook to the discussion section to clarify the points made in the conclusion.\n-\tif there are any outlying questions that require more detail i dive into the methodology\n-\t(obviously these steps can vary but that\u2019s the gist)\n\nYou can accomplish step two in several ways. *deep processing*\n\n-\tYou want to think about how the information in this paper fits within your existing knowledge. (e.g. Venn diagrams, how is this study similar/diff to *x* paper you read, how is this an example of *y*)\n-\tyou can create a question(s) you have about the paragraph/section (e.g. why did they select the participants in this way, or why did they choose this particular method) (AND THEN ANSWER THAT QUESTION)\n\nHere are common strategies to **avoid** since they are low effort/low return *shallow processing*\n\n-\thighlighting\n-\twriting down word for word summaries of key points \n-\trereading\n\n\n\n\n**TLDR- Above anything else is the fact that you need to engage with the material, if you simply read it and don\u2019t reflect you aren\u2019t learning.**",

          "text": "There is this famous paper on how to read papers [1] which agrees with what your say, and my own personal experience.\n\nI personally highlight a lot (use Okular to do that), find it helps when you return to the thing some time later and try to find key points.  I also have a notes file where I put short notes pointing to especially interesting bits.\n\nOne useful pattern of highligting is, at least in my experience, to use many colours (I use five) to break up a complex definition/axiom/... Sometimes it becomes too complex to hold both the words and the concepts in your head, so making one of them apparent on the paper itself through highlighting helps me comprehend better at times.\n\n[1] Keshav, S.

      "text": "I don\u2019t have data to support this, but I have noticed that with increased use of Reddit (and also hitting middle age - not sure if either of those have a causal link), I have more difficulty focusing on hard reading.  So, focusing on mindfulness and attention training helps in the background.  In general, some deep breathing and relaxation helps me get in the mood and focus better.\n\nI\u2019ve also found that if I use my E Reader and switch to open dyslexic, it is substantially easier to pay attention and follow.  \n\nI have used rulers in the past, particularly while reading philosophy and some art criticism.  It was the only way I could absorb certain textbooks and longer articles.  (Covering text and revealing it only as I am ready). Often times forcing myself to translate what I just read in my head is a challenge and helps with understanding.  Not with speed and I am rather impatient with myself - I have to really want to understand and absorb the material to wrestle myself into slowing down.\n\nA previous poster summarized how I attack articles from more research oriented publications:  abstract, conclusions, figures, then the rest of it.\n\nI\u2019ve never really highlighted anything unless there are key ideas I wanted to bring into a paper I was writing.  It did nothing for me.\n\nI absolutely read aloud, or read to my spouse and then talk about what I just read ; or read a paragraph together.  Study buddies are super useful if you are a social person.",

I do believe that it has a lot to do with how fast technology has developed and how much digital media/technologies have been integrated into our lives.
