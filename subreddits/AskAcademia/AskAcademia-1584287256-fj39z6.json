  "text": "I've been part of Food Not Bombs at various locations since last June. It's become a large part of my life, and I feel that it's contributed significantly to my personal and political growth. And I'm proud of what we do. But of course the politics of FNB run counter to the norm, and other volunteers have gotten into clashes with the authorities in the past. On the one hand, that connotation might scare recruiters off. On the other, though, I feel that omitting it would provide an incomplete summary of myself, my life, and my accomplishments. For what it's worth, I'm in linguistics/computational linguistics.",

As someone who was involved with my local chapter in the mid-2000s, I was deeply unimpressed with the organizational model, it\u2019s baked in inefficiencies, and it\u2019s ideological inflexibility. OPs group might have their shit together more and be less rigid since a part of the organization model is the total autonomy of local groups, but the characters I met at the time I wouldn\u2019t depend on to work well within the organizational structure that most NPs/charities need to have. There is a really great food redistribution charity in my city, but I know some FNB people who shit all over it despite it\u2019s success *because* it is a charity not a form of political praxis, and because they redistribute meat/dairy products. The relationship between FNB and charity orgs is not a harmonious one as far as I can tell. \n\nAnyway, OP, unless you know Chomsky himself is going to be on the hiring committee, I\u2019d leave it off. It doesn\u2019t signal anything related to your research, and the things it does signal to the hiring committee might not be what you think/want.",

A CV is a way for you to highlight your expertise for the role you are applying for.  I edit my CV all of the time.  I do not submit the same CV to a granting agency that I give to my chair each year for annual review.  My CV looks different if I apply for a job.  I have a different CV that is uploaded on my faculty webpage.  For me, this means including or excluding certain sections, or including or excluding items under sections.  Do they really need to know I have served on two dozen search committees?  Do they need information on my former trainees?  Do I need to include conference presentations when I was an undergrad in a different discipline?  Do I include works in progress or under review?  Each of these things (and more) depend on what the CV is for. \n\nSo, my answer is that it depends.  If you are applying to a left-leaning think tank or a non-profit/charity, then maybe that demonstrates your world view and that would be important.  If you are applying to a cooperate or governmental institution, maybe not.  Academics could be up in the air, you would just need to do a little research (for example, at my school our openly social justice oriented social work faculty would embrace you with open arms, while our exercise science faulty that are very religious and conservative would probably burn your application; not that you would apply to either, just an example that academics is not uniform).",

Charities and the academy may be more open to that, but I doubt that NGOs, think tanks and other politics-adjacent orgs would be too happy with it.
