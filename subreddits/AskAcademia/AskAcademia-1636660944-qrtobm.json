  "text": "I have just applied for a position for a phd. I know that phds are highly competitive and that he probably has a pile of applications in front of him. Should I try to find his number and call him about my application to ask if he received it and have a quick chat ? This would allow me to stand out. What do you think ? How would one go about finding the contact person's phone number ?\n\nOther tips to increase the chances of being taken for a position by standing out from the other applicants ?\n\nThanks in advance.",

We know when someone is just speaking to us to impress us. I for one feel that's just a waste of my time . You're not interested in what the PI has to say, you just want to be noticed and they're going to notice that. \n\nIt's also weird to put in an application and then contact them to say you want to learn about the job. It suggests you've applied for a job without having done your research.\n\nLastly, email not phone. Ask if you can call someone and then arrange a time. If it was me you'd either get me in a middle of a meeting or you'd get me in one of the few breaks from meetings I get during the day. Either way I wouldn't want to talk to you, blunt as that sounds. This kind of conversation needs dedicated time, not 5 minutes without warning.",
