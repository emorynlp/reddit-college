  "text": "Thanks all for the many conversations over the years. This sub forum has really given me a place to learn a lot from other people and their stories. You can all make it! I learned a lot about academic toxic cultures and dealing with narcissists (literally someone told me my field is unimportant and shouldn\u2019t be happy that I submitted. This was on the day of my submission! Can you believe it?). In any case, just remember that your success is yours and that you need to stay positive and remember that your work does matter! Be careful out there. You are important. You will make it! \n\nCheers guys.\n\nEdit: phd in humanities",
