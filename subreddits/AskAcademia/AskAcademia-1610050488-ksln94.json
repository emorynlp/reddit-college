  "title:": "Can you just hire academics for research contracts and such? Is that considered reasonable or rude?",
  "text": "I work as an assistant for a wealthy tech guy who often goes on weird tangents. He spends a lot of money satisfying his curiosity on various things, whether it be books (or shelves for the books), courses, or consultants for the things you can get consultants in. He recently saw a video on food fraud, read a label on a box in a restaurant for a fish he couldn't find on the menu, and now wants to go find someone at the local university to go run DNA tests on one of each dish from that restaurant as he wants to see if he is right. He has a slate of other things he is curious about but I have convinced him to hold off on those for now. \n\nI know that the news people did it, but are professors and academics ok with random citizens trying to hire them for these kinds of tests? He isn't a cheapskate or anything and is willing to spend thousands on this question, I am just not sure if they want to be distracted from their research with these kinds of proposals.",

This is not a project that can be easily done by standard contract labs. This is a molecular systematics project. A knowledgeable person would have to design the right strategy for PCR cloning appropriate genes and depending on the species, this might be quite difficult. For some common species there is enough genome information to do this, but, highly unlikely it would exist for everything on the dishes.\n2. Depending on the species, this could be say a few days of work and \\~$2,000 of reagents or if we have to design, optimize primers, etc, could be a 1-2 months of work. \n3. Having said that no lab would take this kind of work on for money. Yes, professors do consulting. But, when I do consulting, it is for using my expert knowledge and something I can do outside of the lab. If I use my lab and lab personnel, it has to go through the university as a research contract. There is no \"profit\" for anybody and the size of the project would not merit diverting resources from other projects.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is two possibilities. (1) a project could be created as an educational experience for an undergrad or high school student. The professor would have to be pretty willing to do it for education. (2) you find a fish molecular systematics specialist for whom the project would be kind of a hobby activity and they already have similar projects going on. If you DM me where you are located, I could possibly see if there are such people nearby,",

And you're clearly not aware that this kind of thing has actually been done before (testing products from Japanese dealers to look for protected whale species is the study that comes to mind).\n\nIt absolutely would not be strange for someone to pay for work. They could be a crazy individual but that's not a lot different than a foundation, frankly. You have to worry about whether it looks like your results are influenced by your source of funding, but that's something to work around, not a stop.\n\nI mentioned in a different post, many labs (esp. smaller ones) may collaborate with smaller state govt agencies or other partners to do various tests on samples, ranging from water to genetics or hormones, as a way to turn a bit of a profit and fund their work. This is the perfect kind of thing for someone at a small SLAC if they have an experienced undergrad and could use a few grand to fund some more work.",

Not really your PET rat, but if you're a pharma company and you need to have your lab rats monitored you're welcome! And we actually have months long waiting lists. Most of the \"clients\" are labs of the university, but we're open to anyone from outside! You can actually contract an experiment and data analysis from something as silly as an experiment that takes not even a day!\n\nSimilarly a friend of mine works in a microscale materials facility in another university, where most of the \"clients\" are labs of the university. But companies (even big ones, including Huawei) ask them to build things, when they need prototypes (that are too small for the volumes with which they work in general). \n\nUniversities that have high sensitivity nuclear detectors are often contracted to analyze samples!\n\nInstead, if one wants to contract \"serious\" research (projects that take years and actual research thinking, not just using the machineries of the labs), most universities are open for that. It's a long project, you need to discuss with a professor what it will take (how many people, which equipment) and then you provide a grant to the university. And 99% of the time they'll be super glad to do it! Unless it's something so wacky that it's not going to be good on a researcher CV",
