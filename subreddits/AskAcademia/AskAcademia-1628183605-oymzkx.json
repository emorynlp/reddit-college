  "text": "I'm curious whether it is almost always the case that academia is superior to industry for intellectual stimulation/growth, as I've read that a significant portion of your job is bureaucracy/applying for grants/politics/\"careerist\"-centric.\n\nAnecdotally, I do see that, in old age, academics seem to retain their cognitive functions for a longer period, and I wonder if this is due to the life-long intellectual stimulation, and not simply that they were always impressive.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been in academia (I did a post-doc) and I left and am currently in industry. I\u2019m a microbiologist by education.\n\nI miss talking about the science. I miss getting to explore my own ideas. But part of why I left was that research funding wasn\u2019t based on good/novel/interesting ideas - it was based on obvious potential impact, how senior you were and if you were lucky with your competition and evaluators during the grant cycle. Academic research lost the purity that something is worth researching because you *don\u2019t* know the answer and so you cannot know the *value* the answer may have.\n\nIn my industry position I am removed from doing the science, but I get to participate in the application and trials that result from research. My challenges are more varied and I have more space to progress and challenge myself differently as I grow. All careers have an aspect of repetition, the difference is whether I want to design a cloning vector for the 1000th time or figure out how to get a client to accept a massive change order so their study can continue.\n\nAside from the subject matter in academia, I found research and industry scratch the same itch. I love problem solving, critical thinking, time management, application of analysis. I get to do this both places but the application is more varied in industry and my job security is much more based on my merit and my ability to apply these skills well than it ever was as a research academic.",

Your question is really only suited for someone who has extensive experience working in both. \n\nHowever, I can say from my personal POV that intellectual stimulation is not a reason I chose to remain in academia. I happen to know that many of my counterparts (applied math) working in industry are working on things that are just as cool as anything I'm working on. The real difference is I get to choose my own project. Well even this is only partially true but I have a lot more control and flexibility than my industry counterparts. \n\nThe tradeoff is they are all making approximately 1 swimming pool full of money more than I am.",

Both job types have bureaucracy. I love academia because I love teaching, and I love working creatively with students (like, not having to only work towards concrete company goals). But both can be completely intellectually stimulating, if you choose to approach them that way. My impression is that it's slightly easier to settle for a less intellectual, more button-pushing or paper-pushing role in industry, so you have to actively choose intellectual engagement. But if you do, it's there.",

      "text": "Academia gave me more freedom to pursuit some intellectual interests, particularly if I could combine them with the classes I taught. But honestly, I didn't really have the time to pursue much independently (I was teaching faculty, not research faculty). It certainly seemed that the research faculty I knew would spend a lot of time with bureaucratic issues and summers would be the major time for their own work. \n\nIndustry has been mixed in that regard. I can work with all sorts of applied concepts but it is more isolated to the tasks I'm assigned. With some flexibility in how I approach them. The biggest difference is that I actually have time to pursue things that interest me or just watch interdimensional cable. \n\nMy own experience would say academia is marginally more intellectually stimulating as required by the job. Industry leaves you more time for intellectual stimulation, which can be more than academia, but has to be self-driven and independent of university resources. \n\nI realize I should probably mention my field is computer science. I would not be surprised if this is very different in other fields.",

While it is just a bachelors, they train you to become research scientists. It burnt me out, it burnt out many of my fellow students and in general made me quite miserable. I\u2019m extremely thankful to be where I am today, and while I concur it\u2019s intellectually stimulating, graduating in the midst of a pandemic made it all just too much. I think a lot of it is based on the personality of the individual. I had peers that LOVED being in the labs all day, while i just couldn\u2019t wait to leave regardless of how much I enjoy scientific writing and reading. \n\nTL;DR, I chose a research degree instead of a medical one based on a last minute decision that was ultimately the wrong one. It was very stimulating and has made me (I hope...) a bright young man, however I also developed some extremely terrible coping mechanisms to deal with the stress that I wish I never did. Again, this is entirely based on an individuals interests and work ethic. For me, the clinics are just as intellectually stimulating but I get to talk and socialise with people which works just fine for me.",
