  "text": "I received my master about a year ago and currently I am between gigs (research and some other stuff) until I get a better opportunity. I have research interest in a couple of fields that I plan to focus on for a future PhD. However I don't have relevant groups/peers in this field, and no institutional affiliation too.\n\nI struggle in keeping myself updated. I have subscribed to a few major journals of my interest. I have made sure to check several author's Google Scholar once a while. I also follow them on Twitter and follow other relevant accounts too (conferences, accounts, and so on). I'm still struggling though.\n\nWhat do you use to keep yourself updated? Maybe RSS feed? Mailing list? Or some other sort of subscription?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBtw I'm in anthropology/media studies/STS",

      "text": "Twitter is good. Not just following, but engaging, too -- participating in discussion (if you feel able), signal boosting, etc. I am personally terrible at this but it's pretty essential in many fields for your career so it's good to get in the habit now. STS especially I think it may be important to be seen engaging with both professionals and lay audiences.\n\nWhile a lot of things about covid are terrible, the increase in digital conferences means you can easily attend conferences in your field of interest, which will keep you up to date as well as get your name out in front of people you will potentially be contacting later for a phd. Unfortunately attending conferences isn't free, but it is much cheaper and easier to do than in-person.\n\nIn my field, LinguistList and LanguageLog are both resources people should keep an eye on. The former is an information hub for job postings, upcoming conferences, book reviews, etc. The latter is more general and focused at a lay audience but, because of that, often brings up some of the field-internal discussions (read: drama lol) that are happening, plus it's usually pretty interesting.\n\nI don't know if there are equivalents to those two in your field?",
