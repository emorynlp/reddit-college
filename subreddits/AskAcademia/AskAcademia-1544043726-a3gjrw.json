  "text": "So I taught our department\u2019s most basic, introductory-level course for the first time this semester and was a little blown away.  I have taught other lower level courses before, but they were mostly to sophomores, not to kids that were in their very first week of school.  I spent so much time explaining things that I thought were very fundamental \u201chow to function in college\u201d sorts of things, that when I teach the course again, I\u2019m going to give a \u201cTen No Bullshit Facts about College\u201d talk on the first day.  Things I plan to include:\n\n\u201cWhy I don\u2019t like to be called Miss\u201d\n\n\u201cI judge you by your emails\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really is in the syllabus\u201d\n\n\u201cResearch: what my university actually cares about\u201d\n\n\u201cStudent Evals: How to use the power you have for good\u201d\n\n\nWhat other things would you include?  What shocks you that they don\u2019t know?\n",

There is no simple set of rules for what counts as cheating and what doesn't, especially since individual instructors actually disagree (at least in speech) about these rules and instructors often have students do lots of group work.\n\nSo, strangely, I have students who think they are not allowed to ask me questions but think they are allowed to borrow work done by their peers.  This is frustrating, but it's not surprising - especially since students aren't sure which questions to ask.  Students end up with all kinds of weird habits because of the often highly regulated environments of their high schools, wherein rules were more explicit, rigid, and emphasized.",

              "text": "This is an interesting perspective and I think true in the majority of cases, and particularly in the case of students that put in the requisite work. I think it's particularly true that grade culture shouldn't be tethered to the value of university degrees: the *value* of what people learn (i.e. the degrees they earn) and how people are graded are less and less correlated. The value of a degree is in part a function of market realities and supply and demand of degree-holders, but it is also true that degrees themselves are no longer sufficient as straightforward markers of value given that it is hard to distinguish between a person with a 2.7 and a 3.6 GPA. This means people differentiate themselves based  on extracurriculars, internships, etc., rather than the mere possession of a degree much less GPA.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that grade inflation lowering the value of a university degree doesn't need to be considered a bad thing overall--we should *want* grades to inflate as a sign that more students are doing better and society is becoming more educated, so long as our standards aren't drastically lowering, but this does make degrees as standalone credentials naturally less valuable since they're no longer the bottleneck. Whether or not this is fair to a student is complicated because the only way to prevent it would be to enact measures that limit degrees awarded given that we can't just magically call degrees just as valuable as before if a larger and larger proportion of people are earning them (even if done so legitimately). Grade deflation is bullshit and we can't inflate degree value on paper, so adding value has to come in the form of intangibles such as prestige or cultivating greater societal respect for education.",

Some of the sections I teach/mark now are in a flipped format, and I just know that I would have quit physics and university entirely if I'd had to deal with that bullshit. Not all teaching methods suit all people, unfortunately. I'm lucky I got through when I did. \n\nI think it can work if you introduce it to first-years because they've never experienced the lecture style. But try to introduce it after that and you'll see resistance. Every time you change things students have to adapt their learning style, so you may as well only do it once at the beginning rather than twice and end up screwing students over. ",

The science professors who I know who do the things you describe redesign their whole course so as to totally rewrite the norms of the class.  For instance, a really flipped classroom doesn't involve just pre-reading, but also pre-lecturing (usually micro-lecturing), so you don't lose the listening part.  Further, they usually involve different sorts of assessments which tell the students that the pre-work matters, so you could refuse to do the prework, but this ends up being true about any model of teaching.  \n\nThe chemistry department at my school got really invested in this process, and year-over-year data from their students show that students who come to class generally do much better in these systems than in traditional environments.  Average grades for those students go up, and it tracks attendance - so attendance matters and is a greater driver of your grade.",

If you've had no contact with tertiary education before then you won't know the difference between smaller certificates, a Bachelors degree, a Masters degree, and a PhD, or which one comes after the other. \n\nEven a single degree like a BSc has such a convoluted structure that you have to write it out to keep track of it. There are always rules associated with majors, minors, gen-eds, and whatever other course groupings your university has (we have breadth units, major electives, degree electives, and components too). Get the rules wrong and you can't graduate. I had to drop an entire major because I got a rule wrong, and it wasn't even my fault because I was admitted to an old degree structure where the rule didn't exist. If I hadn't overheard someone talking about breadth units, I wouldn't have known there was a problem until I tried to graduate. ",

Ours includes the obvious things (academic expectations, how to interact with faculty, what campus resource exist to help you succeed), the mundane (where do I get the books? do I need to bring paper and pen to class? will we do the homework in class?), and somewhat more challenging things like interest inventories, personality batteries, and how to intelligently explore major options. Later in the fall we get into development things like using the career center, networking, metacognition, and academic planning. Even with a required *course* on this stuff we see differential outcomes that often reflect differences in class, parental educational attainment, and preparation.\n\nTrying to address all of the shortcomings of students who are struggling with transition to college as an aside in one class with no support is tough. But if your school isn't doing it in a focused, intentional way, then you deserve kudos for trying.\n\n\"How to interact with a professor\" is probably one of the most important lessons for first years. Explain how to address a professor, how to email, how to interact during office hours, how to ask for a recommendation, how to ask for assistance, etc. That's the primary worry I see among my first years year after year-- they (mostly) know we aren't high school teachers, but they don't know what that means beyond \"different.\"",

All that is just masturbatory and it holds the rest of us back, professors included. This means the students who should be participating are paradoxically those who are *unsure*. And that's okay! I love to help unsure students find their footing and help them develop their thoughts and speaking  skills. And those who are \"sure\" should do what they can to push the line and try to nuance points and add new perspectives where useful. The types of things they need to work on are different, and they should think about how they could fail and then use the classroom to practice in that arena.\n\n2) **I don't give a shit about grades. I'll give you whatever grade you want if you're annoying or persistent enough. But unless you earn my respect, you'll have failed me and I will feel that I've failed you.** College has become transactional in many places. If you're performing just like the next widget on the assembly line, then I'll stamp you with a passing mark and ship you off into the world. But if that's the only outcome, both of us should consider it a waste of time. I do what I can to give students something unique that not many people get access to, so put your bullshit phone away, do the fucking reading, and meet me in the middle. Pretend I'm one of the smartest people you'll ever meet and I'll pretend you're one of the smartest students I'll ever have, and if we both play our parts, maybe we'll have to reconsider whether calling it \"pretend\" is even accurate.\n\n3) **Your diploma is nothing more than a receipt.** You've got two paths: work for an education or pay for a credential. If you put in the work, the cost will be a footnote in the amazing life ahead of you. If you pay for a credential, you're going to spend the rest of your life bitching about how school didn't teach you anything and you'll never figure out that you're hamstrung by your own half-fulfilled potential. Truth is, I weep for you if you're just here going through the motions. Why? Because you're a sucker. You're just here just like people used to be in high school until they became 18 and could get the easiest job available to them. But you're even sadder because you're already 18+ and paying $45k a year for the same slacker privilege. Nah, I'd rather you get thrown out into the real world and find something that moves you rather than have you bore yourself to death in my class and drag the rest of us down with you. Learn or get out. And not for my sake: in the long run, if you're not gonna learn anyway, you'd be better off out than in. \n\n4) **I will make any dream come true for my students if they're serious.** You want to be a children's book writer? A stock broker? A horse breeder? A media professor? A property rights lawyer? Let's make it fucking happen. These dreams aren't just free-floating starry-eyed wishes: they're real careers with real pathways that take real work that is done by real students led by real professors. Which means that it's all possible, but it also takes real dedication and real hours and real long nights and real time management and real practice and real sacrifice. But if you're not committed and just want me to shit you a golden egg, then I recommend you find a different professor, probably one with golden feathers who lives in a pot of unicorn tears at the end of a rainbow.\n\n",

Less important to me are just that I worked for seven years to get a piece of paper and that work should probably be acknowledged by calling me \"doctor\" or as least \"professor.\"  Also, \"Miss\" (as opposed to \"Ms.\") implies something about my marriage status, which is annoying since the male equivalent of \"Mr.\" does not.\n\nBut honestly, it's the sexism of it that actually bothers me.  There have been studies ([like this one](https://www.newsweek.com/women-medicine-female-physicians-called-doctor-less-male-colleagues-615023)) and loads of anecdotal evidence indicating that people use formal titles less with women than with men, and that bothers me.  Also, because I am relatively young and female, I don't have automatic authority with my students in the way that white-haired men do, and I think enforcing the title doctor helps with that.  Titles/words do matter.  \n\nLastly, [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6khozcWkAA40MV.jpg) is a little poem on the topic that I have always found thought provoking.  ",

This all averages out by the time you graduate (i.e., your final GPA), but it can sometimes be a factor for any given individual test.\n\n\\- in the long run (after you graduate and are actually working), some of these things matter more than others...  knowledge/skill in the course content (probably) does matter, study skills matter a little bit (not because you have to study, but because you need to work independently, learn new things, be disciplined and not procrastinate, etc.), and being good at taking tests probably doesn't matter very much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are the takeaways?\n\n1. \"study skills\" and \"test taking skills\" are worth working on developing...  also, don't assume that study skills that worked for you in high school will still be adequate in college - what we expect you to know and *how* we expect you to know it and demonstrate that knowledge is different, so you may need to adapt\n2. Recognize when your test performance was within your control (didn't know the material, didn't study enough, or waited until the last minute to study) and when it wasn't (luck, or you're just not good at taking tests - which you can work on in the long run, but probably wasn't going to miraculously change in just the past week) - recognize how to improve next time in the former case, and don't beat yourself up in the latter case\n   1. Related: Learn to self-assess well so you don't overestimate your own abilities.  (This could be a whole post of its own, but I'll leave it at this for now...)\n3. Reflect on your actual learning, not your test scores...  Grades *do* matter, but they are not the most important thing.  (I've had some really capable B students who just aren't good at tests because of the stress & time pressure, and some A students whose skills are just \"okay\" but are really good at test taking.)\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "Not an additional topic to add, but I would ask that before you give the talk, make sure it doesn't engage in student-shaming. I've seen articles online before that are pitched in this direction and they take a decidedly condescending, even insulting tone to students -- sort of came off as \"Since you people are too dumb to know what the truth is, let me tell you.\" I don't have any reason to suspect this would happen in your case since I don't know you or your situation but I do know that it's easy for anybody to slip into student-shaming mode at any time. And I am a little worried by the one about \"I judge you by your emails\" -- maybe this is true, but putting it that way might exacerbate a power differential that students are already concerned about. I'd change that to \"How to present yourself in the best possible light when you email\".\n\nCome from the direction of \"I want you to succeed in college and so here is some important information that will help you\" rather than \"I'm shocked that you don't know the following\". What you really want is to build trust and a good working relationship with students -- otherwise they're not going to listen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Just to emphasize that I think generally it's a good idea to address these \"hidden curriculum\" concepts directly in your class. It might make even more impact if you spread them out over the semester rather than all of them on the first day (which some students may not even attend because they're still getting their schedules worked out).
