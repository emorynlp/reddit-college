  "text": "I am at loss. My co-supervisor is not an expert in the proposed project field. For example, he is a chemist and the research field in Bioinformatics. \n\nInitially, at the start of the project, the co-supervisor asked me to collect molecule data from the databases to apply some machine learning models for future drug discovery prediction. But when I started reading I was Overwhelmed and was unable to find the data which would be worthwhile for publishable.\n\nNow I feel I am at loss. Co-supervisor is pushing me without any specific suggestion. I am perfectly proficient in machine learning but unable to find proper data is hampering my research.",
