  "title:": "Taking over a paper: Toxic or Deserving?",
  "text": "Background: Assigned a really good topic for review literature in mid 2021. This was originally assigned to the undergrad since no physical work could be done. I was brought in to guide and coauthor few days later.\n\nProblem: They took a month to provide updates each time. So far we havent even written a word together, much less compiled any data at all.\n\nCurrent situation: After last month, I decided to write bit-by-bit while waiting for his contribution. I'm also working on thesis, another paper, conference, and running experiments. This was like a downtime while maintaining productivity. Surprisingly, I completed a draft last week with references and illustration. I would say its 90% ready for publication - based on my experience.\n\nI havent brought it up since we're having a meeting soon. They have been busy with graduating and applying for postgrad position. Although this paper was not their priority, it doesnt justify me taking authority over it. \n\nI was going to at least, share with my prof but I fear he may request to use mine immediately. In that scenario I too, will claim full authorship over the initial equal contribution with the other student. However, if i let it go, it may extend up to an additional 3-6 months. \n\nOpen to advise & criticism :)",

          "text": "Absolutely agree with you. No, that student will not be with us. We've come to a consensus that we will proceed with the paper considering the timeline. I told my prof we can discard my paper or recycle it, but he was grateful for a backup paper. I'm assigned to another ug, and he encouraged me to guide them more thorougly now. I appreciate your honesty as I was so busy trying to defend myself. Will do better, thanks \ud83d\ude4f",

      "text": "Well, I'd say that the best way to handle would have been a considerably earlier conversation -- when their progress was unacceptably slow, there should have been a conversation that if they didn't contribute more, they would lose authorship. If this started in mid 2021, it's been at most 2-3 months, which frankly is a really short time for an undergrad to get into an area and understand enough to produce a literature review. I do think its a failure of communication and mentorship that resulted in this position to begin with. \n\nThat said, you're now in this position where there's a paper you wrote and they didn't contribute to. Equal authorship certainly isn't warranted and there's no use throwing out work or waiting for unneeded contributions from an undergrad. That said, I'd say talk to your prof before you tell the undergrad anything and let them make a judgement call of how to proceed.",

          "text": "Thanks, I spoke to my Prof and he was aware the student could not commit the time. I did tell him I was absent from urging/pressuring the ug to make progress. I've never mentored anyone before, always the mentee. So, I apologized and but my prof said that he is thankful for a backup since the ug is no longer associated with our institution and would be difficult to communicate. Also surprised since I have so much more important assignments. \n\nLastly, he assigned me to another ug and was much more inclined to let them have their own topic. \n\nI appreciate your honesty. I'll do better next time \ud83d\udcaa Cheers\n\nedit: the new/other ug was supposed to come in and help us with the paper. Prof assumed we needed the helpz",

      "text": "My personal opinion is you snooze you lose. It\u2019s a harsh lesson to the undergrad  to basically get scooped by a colleague but that\u2019s how it is. You don\u2019t get to call dibs on a research area and stop others from working on it whilst you wait until you feel like working on it.\n\nEdit: if you were supposed to be guiding them it might not be a great look for you to have dropped the ball there. Only you know what your role was supposed to be.",

          "text": "Noted, I got lucky with my Prof. If it was any other, perhaps I'll get screwed for not properly guiding, not so much flack on writing a backup paper. For that, he complimented me since we could always recycle the content/narrative. Hes aware I was bz too and the ug had no time to commit either. But I wasnt informed of the ug, yet I just assumed and waited which is the source of my guilt. Appreciate your comments, will do better with the next one. Cheers \ud83d\ude4f",
