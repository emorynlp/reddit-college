  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently in the process of deciding between two graduate school programs - Holy Names University and Marymount University. Both are dual degree programs - counseling and forensic psychology. HNU is in CA and is accredited by the Board of Behavioral Sciences while MU is in VA and is CACREP accredited. How much does CACREP accreditation really matter?\n\nI don't want to choose a program just because of CACREP accreditation, but if going to a program in CA might cause me issues if I were to move to another state, then would it be a smarter choice? I will most likely move to NY and on the NY office of professions website, it's stated that an evaluation will be conducted if you have a counseling degree from a non-CACREP accredited program, but it doesn't say much about additional requirements. I want to avoid taking additional courses. I've also heard that Virginia, specifically, has a CACREP accreditation requirement, so if I wanted to work in VA after graduating, that would never be possible if I go with the CA school.\n\nOn the other hand, if I ever decided I wanted to go work in CA, I'm not sure what that process would be like since I heard CA has the strictest licensing requirements. (I guess this beats impossible since no CACREP means not being able to work in VA).\n\nI want to go with the program that will give me the most mobility in regards to transferring my license. Any insight or advice would be appreciated!",

      "text": "You should go for the CACREP accredited one. I mean, it seems pretty obvious from your post that the CACREP accreditation will give you the best mobility, and there's no way to be sure that NY's evaluation won't require you to take (possibly several) more courses.",
