  "title:": "Should I have a custom email signature as an undergrad?",
  "text": "I am in my 4th year of my undergrad, and going to be graduating with a bachelors in social work and communication studies. I\u2019ve been noticing multiple students with custom email signatures, which I have never thought of doing until now. \nI\u2019ve read that putting your bachelors degree in an email signature is unprofessional - but I have no idea what the proper signature would be. \nAn example of one of my peers\u2019 signatures I\u2019ve seen would be: \n\nJane Doe (she, her, hers)\nBachelor of Social Work (BSW)\nUniversity of Blank Class of 2022\nStudent Representative | Blank Association \njanedoe@blankuniversity.com\n\nIs this an acceptable signature to use? Should I even have a customized signature? I am going to be applying for internships and grad school soon, so I would love some feedback on this for insight in my future emails! Also, if it is proper to add your degree in a signature, how would I go about listing my BSW and BA? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "There is some personal preference element to this, but in my mind the only reason to use a signature is if you are using your account to represent your organisation. FOr example, I have my signature turned on for when emailing outside of the university in a professional context, and I flipit on when emailing internally to admin / more senior levels when I feel the need to add a little more formality. Most of the time I just sign off with my name.\n\nADding a signature as an undergrad is totally unnecessary, and - for many - would look pretty odd.\n\nFinally, as a note, when applying for things like jobs and grad school the accepted correct form is to do so using a personal email address, not your school/work one.\n\nTHose are just my views, and I'm sure there are some national/social/cultural norms that differ from this.",

      "text": "I've seen it on undergrad emails and it neither impresses me nor offends me. So, my view is that it's a personal preference. If you choose to do it, following the style of your example seems fine, to me.\n\nOne note-the pronoun preference is maybe the only thing in your example that would raise eyebrows and whether it's a positive or negative raising depends on the recipient. If you're using it to apply to MSW programs I'd think it's a net positive to have it. If you're going to apply to an internship at the Hoover Institution at Stanford (viewed as a conservative organization) I'd think it's a net negative to indicate preferred pronouns.",

      "text": "I really like seing students adopt a professional style in their emails, and that kind of signature could be a nice cherry on top. Some professors may feel like you're overreaching, but if you're a serious students, this could be a nice little touch. I have had a couple of students use custom signatures (one of the with the university logo) and they weren't strong at all, which made their fancy signatures look pretentious.",

      "text": "I think a short email signature indicating your degree, graduation year, and other leadership positions (if relevant) is fine for emails specifically related to job applications/networking.\n\nBut please do not list every little club you\u2019ve been a part of in college in your email signature. Ive seen students do this many times and it just looks juvenile. And do not list sports teams (unless it\u2019s a legit university team AND you are emailing someone about applying to a job related to athletics). Basically, keep the email signature short (3 lines, maybe 4 max) and only include information that is relevant to the person you are communicating with. Your potential employer does not need to know you played club ultimate frisbee or were the treasurer for the minecraft club. \n\nFinally, never include a reference to Greek life in your email signature. Some people, including potential employers, have strong feelings about Greek life and it could reflect poorly on you. In my experience, the students who list all of their frat/sorority positions and accolades in their email signatures are usually not great students and also likely to make my life difficult by constantly fighting me about grades and asking for special accommodations. It has gotten to the point where I cringe and expect complaining whenever I get an email from a student who lists Greek life in their email signature. Others might have similar experiences and feel the same way, resulting in a bad first impression.",
