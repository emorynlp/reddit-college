  "text": "I'd read several times on here that the best way to gain access to most papers is to ask the author directly. I tried it yesterday and it worked. Not only was the author happy to send me her paper, she also sent me another related paper of hers and offered to send me more of her research if I wanted it. The papers are fascinating, it's exactly what I needed for my current research project (writing a high-school textbook), and on top of that, the author is a lovely person. So thank you, AskAcademia, for helping me dare to do something I would never have done otherwise.",

Some dishonest folks, usually traders and merchants who had a lot of coins come and go, would literally chisel slivers off the end of the coins they would trade in; most people wouldn\u2019t notice the little bits of missing metal, but the chiseler could amass enough to melt down and make new coins, or something else they can sell/trade. \n\nI understand that textbook companies need to make their money, but something rubs me wrong about withholding access to information.",
