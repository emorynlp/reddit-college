      "text": "Can't tell you how you can do your PhD. But i can give some tips on how to read Journal papers, reports, thesis or articles. \n\nDivide the reading into 3 phases \n\n1st, just read it fully, note the important points, if you stuck at some concepts or maths stuff, you can just skip it and completing the paper is the priority here. \n\n2nd, After reading it fully, look at the conclusions first, see if you understand it or not. Then have a look at nomenclature, see if all the terms are clear to you, if not then first try to understand them from external sources ( I use YouTube and wiki generally), remember that the nomenclature is important part. Then after that, try to understand methodology and results( at this point, if you understood conclusions and each term in nomenclature, most probably you won't stumble at any concept ).\n\n3rd, redo the calculations ( or method/Experiment itself, if possible), see what you can do on that, do simulation of that methodology or write a code for those calculations in any programming language you prefer. Write a quick review on that paper for future purposes using your own words. ( in most cases, redo part is skippable, but writing a quick review of that paper is very helpful )",

I had a degree in a slightly irrelevant field before starting, and jumping into 500-level courses with no prerequisite felt incredibly stressful. It was. My first two years were the hardest of my life. But I got used to it, and by the end of my program, I was fucking owning everything. It gets better, skill-wise, if you stick with it. But I also did start to develop depression/anxiety, and TMJ. I pushed through, but I think what would have helped early on was therapy. I didn't start doing it until the last two years in my program. It would have helped to have to push through a lot.",

I could probably get through it less than an hour now.",

      "text": "I had this same feeling when jumping into my Ph.D. program. Still remember moments sitting alone at my desk and totally lost. In the first month, I had no idea what all the math equations meant. I read a book that is supposed to be my major, I didn't understand the majority of it. One day, I was on the train to the university with the book in my hand, snowing heavily and beautiful outside, I read chapter 4, the 5th time, and something clicked. I started to understand the model, and also realized that I didn't get anything because my background by then was molecular biology, and my major was biophysics. My PI was a physical chemist, so this made things more complicated.\n\nLater on, besides going back to gather and remind me of some basic physics and math, I chose to read books on the same subject, which were written by biochemists. Things got easier, but I still needed to work 63 hours per week, for 3 years, I took off only 2 weeks for a vacation. Got my Ph.D. just 3 years 1 month after the first time I was exposed to those math equations. \n\nSo, you will be fine, in 3 years you'll be ready to defend your dissertation and ready for the real world! All the best!",

As others have said, that's no small feat and should reassure you that you've got the chops to handle this. That said, however, I'm not sure that I've ever heard of a PhD who claims they literally cannot understand any journal papers in their field. Presumably you had to read and interpret and respond to journal papers for your undergraduate degree and masters, no? Have you moved onto a massively different and more complicated topic for your PhD? Either way, I think that this is a problem that will go away. You were smart enough to get accepted onto the course, ergo you're probably smart enough to do the reading that comes with it. Good luck!",
