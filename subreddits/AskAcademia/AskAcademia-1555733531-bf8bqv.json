  "text": "Those who took their partner\u2019s last name, did you do it out of tradition or something else? I\u2019d be interested in knowing opinions about hyphenated last names or only keeping your maiden name. \n\nI am somewhat worried that changing my name completely will be confusing when it comes to (potential) publications before and after changing the last name. I personally like the idea of a double last name. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts/opinions on this?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect to get many responses to this post, thank you so much everyone!",

They used patronyms in Scandinavia for a VERY long time; Norway was the last of them and didn't require legal surnames until 1923. \"Modern\" Norwegian suffixes would be mostly -sen and -datter, Swedish ones would be -sson and -dotter. Icelandic are -son and -dottir. Even in contemporary Iceland, it's mostly still patronymic out of tradition. Incidentally, people who follow this practice do not use these names as surnames, since they change every generation. You are not \"Mr. Einarson,\" you are \"Jon\" or \"Jon Einarson,\" even in formal settings.",

This scared me so much and at the time I thought if people saw around a dozen publications with one name and others with another, I would never get a faculty job. \n\nFrom the experience, I have some gems like, married people live in this town, single here. Where would you live? That's a nice ring, where did you get it? My response was a jeweler in PA. Most often I got straight up inquiries and then, \"We only have one position\".\n\nI choose not to take any of the offers and take a post doc.

You have many options, one of which is legally changing your name (if you want) and going by your maiden name professionally. \n\nHonestly, it just comes down to what you want.

However, it was a personal decision and I don\u2019t think it makes you love your partner or children less if you keep your name. The only thing that matters is how *you* feel about it and *what will make you happiest*.

      "text": "My opinions: You do you!\n\nI got married at the beginning of my fourth year of my doctoral degree. I had a few publications and fellowships under my belt, so in my head it was easier professionally to keep my name. I've never liked my last name very much, but it's *mine* and my accomplishments to date had been achieved under that name. My fiance, at the time, didn't really care much and supported my decision to keep my name.\n\nLiterally on the way to the marriage license office he off-handedly mentioned that even though he supported my decision and that it was up to me, it would be nice to have the same last name. I thought about it and decided that it would, indeed, be nice, so I changed my mind and decided to change my last name legally, use it socially, but then use my original name professionally. What I did was add my last name to my middle name, so \"Jane Alicia Smith\" became \"Jane Alicia Smith Johnson,\" with \"Alicia Smith\" becoming my new middle name (obviously not my actual name).\n\nIt's worked out really well for me. I requested my PhD diploma still in my original name, so it says Jane Alicia Smith on it. At work, I go by Jane Smith. When I was in academia, I continued to publish under Jane Smith; now that I work in industry and my work gets some amount of press, I still go by Jane Smith. In our social/personal life, we're \"The Johnsons\" and I go by Jane Johnson. It almost never comes up. The only time I ever get confused is that usually I book hotels under my married name just to be safe from an ID perspective, but every now and then I forget - particularly on a work trip - and I get to the hotel and give them the wrong name. Even then, it's literally a 20-second correction, and since my ID has both names on it it's easy to prove should I have to.\n\nBut I have female friends who have taken their partner's last name in both contexts, or chose not to change their name in *any* context. I am acquainted with a few people who have hyphenated, although that doesn't seem to be as popular a choice anymore; and I don't know anyone who's created a new last name, although I liked the idea (in our case it didn't work at all, lol). I also don't know any women who's partner took their last name. But any of those can work and what I've learned is that people generally don't care, as long as they know what to call you.",
