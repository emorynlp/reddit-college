  "text": "I have a ton of questions regarding becoming a professor. I am wondering just how difficult overall it is. \n\nI have heard that it is difficult because there are a lack of jobs and for one position there may be up to 400 applicants. \n\nI have heard that only the top students at top schools get these positions. I am not a bad student, I just know I'm not the best. \n\nI am 30 years old and looking to go to grad school within the next 2-3 years but don't know how old I can realistically be to apply for professorship. Speculating I will be doing so in my late to early 40's. \n\nI live in Canada and have heard there are less opportunities in Canada and therefore competition is that much more tough. I have a stable unionized job that I cannot leave here in Canada. \n\n\\--\n\nIf there is space and time, are there any ways to make yourself stand out as a candidate. Does specializing in a narrow sub field help?",

      "text": "I always want to encourage people to pursue their goals. At the same time, as a young professor, I feel ethically obligated to agree with and reaffirm what /u/sdcouple10 and /u/phenomenologist83  have written. And the long aftermath of COVID-19 will just continue to decimate academic job markets that barely existed before. (A few disciplines, like nursing, are exceptions. Computer science also does pretty well.)\n\nI'm chiming in to add that while top students at top schools get some jobs, ***the vast majority of them also never attain a tenure-track position.***\n\nTo answer your direct question: **specializing in a narrow sub-field does not help.** That makes things harder: most jobs are at poorly resourced, teaching-heavy institutions. You can research whatever you're interested in, but you must *always* discuss its significance for the broader field(s), because you will basically never teach classes in your area of specialty. There will never be enough demand. (At well-funded R1s and elite SLACs, faculty have more flexibility.)\n\n**Almost 80% of faculty jobs are non-tenure track.** If contingent faculty were treated well and paid fairly, this might be okay. But adjuncts are treated horrifically and exploited without consequence. They might teach five classes a semester (spread across multiple universities), get paid anywhere from $1000-3000 per class, and are often denied health benefits due to the  length of their contracts.\n\nI have a feeling this isn't what you imagined what being a professor looks like.\n\nIf you choose to pursue graduate school, I'm ***not*** saying don't work hard or hope for the best. I'm saying learn as much as possible about the realities of being contingent faculty and assume you will not be the exception.\n\n**Then ask yourself:** if you knew there would be no permanent academic position at the end of the tunnel, would you still want to spend 6-7 years back in school?\n\nI'm sorry this sounds so discouraging. But I think what matters most is that you're informed, no matter what decision you make. Best of luck!",

              "text": "I started the path towards my doctoral studies while working full time and co-adjuncting on evenings, taking a half-day off my day job once a week. I did that for a year before quitting my job to adjunct and later enroll in a PhD. \n\nI had been invited to adjunct, though it helped that I had been volunteering once a month or so with different professors the year prior. Sometimes being familiar, accessible, and reliable is better than being the \u2018best student\u2019. \n\nWas it worth it?\n\nFor me, probably. The simple answer is that whatever path you lay out for yourself, it will likely change. Like life in general, academic opportunities and circumstances can take unexpected detours. Do know that it will likely be very financially difficult. But if it fulfills your own personal Ikigai, then it may be worth trying.\n\nJust know that if it doesn\u2019t work out, there are many other fulfilling ways to teach people, and being a professor does not automatically make someone a better teacher.",

I'm sorry but that's not going to work, your output is directly proportional to the time you put in, no way you can surpass even your classmates. Just stick to your job, unless you're doing this for intellectual satisfaction, and you'd do this even if you wouldn't get a professor position. Getting a TT position is difficult when you go all in; if you're doing it halfheartedly I really don't think it would work, and unless you produce world-class research I would also look unfavorably on you and not take you on as my student.",

You can have your whole heart in something and still need to pay to live, eat and have a place to sleep. Is being a professor only for the elite classes? Some people have very real situations that require them to work and go to school. That is not elitist, that is classism from this angle.",

In your early 20s I think it's ok to go for a PhD since everyone else is also just looking for their place in the world. When you're young, having a PhD usually gets you ahead a little bit in the real world too, people can hire you at a slightly higher level than the others without a PhD so it's not a complete waste of time even if you fail.\n\nIn contrast, people in their mid 30s will mostly have stable jobs and they'll have advanced enough in rank in their jobs, so you're looking at 5-6 years of living below poverty line while watching all your friends climb up in the society. Then it's not even guaranteed that you'll be a professor, and even a PhD is not enough to offset nearly a decade of experience that your non-phd friends have racked up in the real world, should you get a real job afterwards. Your managers will be 10 years younger than you and without a PhD, your friends will be even higher up, and I've seen some of my friends struggle with their pride because of this very reason.\n\nOf course, you *could* become a professor, but professor salaries aren't THAT high, and you may not have enough time to be eligible for a full pension. I just feel like you're taking a huge gamble with your life. I really hate seeing grad students in their 30s, it really pains me to think about the things they'll have to deal with in academia. I realize that it's your life and ultimately you'll make your own decisions, but if you were my younger brother, I'd try to really talk you out of it with lots of love.",

They teach me a lot, I'm not there to make friends, I'm there to learn and build a craft.\n\n\\#5 This is something I'd have to wait and see and experience I think.",

Things start to get complicated when you have a family... You meet family of your kids and realize that your kid is poor (or your kid does etc.)\n\nAnyway, you're not my brother, and if you can't face the reality with the 100+ comments given here, it's your life and I'm not stopping you. After all, I see so many of them every day already in my department and in my field. I can live with another one making this decision (so long as it's not my 30-year-old brother).",

This is an excellent point and the best point I think you have made. I have nieces and I can understand how at this age, priorities can change. (And probably more so later in life) People are getting married, getting houses and having children. It has crossed my mind.\n\nIf this place is a place to be candid, I won't have children and I'm not ready for any long term commitments relationship wise. I've tried, they weren't things I couldn't do I just don't want them, and not just because I want to go to school.

Even without children, you're also putting your loved one through your journey in academia, if you end up with one.

When I was a grad student, after rent I had about $400/mo left from my stipend and I was absolutely happy still to be in school. I think money was always lacking until I became TT, for 9 years total.

Not that anecdotes make for good evidence- or even a convincing argument. Still, as we so far operate primarily on that level we might as well speculate; if there is a difference where academia comes out on the unhealthy side it would not seem entirely implausible to me that the extreme competitiveness may serve to select for certain character traits - not all of them good.

But I strongly doubt it.\n\nThe point is that each career has attributes, some of which you like and some of which you don't. Even if it turns out that a particular career is the only one that has the right attributes for you, it is still worth reflecting on what the right attributes are. It will help you appreciate the jobs you do have, and recognise when it's time to move on. It will also help you avoid building your sense of self around your career path (which, trust me, is a very bad state of affairs). What you want and need from a job will change over the course of your life. If you don't reflect on what you want and need now, you will not notice those changes until it is too late.",

For example, being a Data scientist can bring you a lot of the things that being a professor might. But you don't actually need a PhD for that. And even if you did have a PhD the chance that your specific publication history is relevant is absolutely zero.\n\nEDIT: I said \"can be\" a stepping stone. But my broader point is that people tend to get onto fixed paths because they don't think about their career in the right way in my opinion. You need to figure out what you really want from life and make choices based on that reflection. \\*Not\\* doing a PhD is a valid choice. Actually I think a lot of people would be better off not doing a degree at all.",

(Though I don't think your age is one of them - I know many successful PhD students in their thirties.)\n\nBut I think that if you want it enough, and you're realistic about having other options post-PhD if you don't find an academic job, then you should go for it.  But make sure you think about your reasons for wanting it, because there are certainly a lot of bad ones. :)  (I recently did a thing about this:  [Should you get a Phd?](https://youtu.be/p4QiJNPSdWs))",

A lot of PIs only care for publications (coz the system promotes \u201cpublish or perish\u201d sadly). You may be able to pursue a project of your interest if you get your own funding (a highly competitive thing).\n\nI would say if you want specialised knowledge and research experience, you could get it with a masters degree too.

Reading this thread has been... disheartening to say the least. I know that I'm getting my PhD in a COVID-19 world, and I will be looking for the next thing in a (hopefully) post COVID-19 world. It sounds like I'll have to pivot what my dreams are in order to land something that's fulfilling but also will allow for me to afford rent. Maybe I'll have to work in industry for a while.",

My field (industrial/organizational psychology) is small, only about 75 PhD programs in the US, but the starting salary for a PhD in industry is about 30% higher than the starting salary in academia.\n\nEnd result: more unfilled academic jobs.  More people leaving academia randomly for double or triple pay. \n\nNothing is a guarantee of course, and you still need a fair bit of luck, but this is light years from the experience of applying for a TT job with an English degree.  \n\nLast hiring committee I was on for an assistant prof, we had maybe 4 applications that actually met the job ad requirements, and only a total of maybe 35 complete apps.",

I will tell you what I know though.\n\nSocial has a mixed reputation job-wise. On one hand, basically ever psych dept in the world needs a social psychologist. On the other hand, that popularity means there is a huge number of PhD programs and hundreds if not thousands of new socials graduating with PhDs every year. My impression is that their job market is rough, closer to that 100s of apps per opening situation you described.\n\nHealth psych is an interdisciplinary application area, so it's hard to predict. There is growing interest in hiring health psych people around the world, but different health programs focus on health in different ways. Someone hiring an occupational health person might have zero interest in an MRI-studying type of person, or vice-versa. So you might want to identify which kinds of health programs you're interested in, then look for new asst profs with that kind of degree, and ask them directly.",

Instead of choosing your own RQs, you study the organization you work for or work in a consultancy that studies other organizations.  \n\nWhereas an academic IO might choose to study leadership as a general concept, an industry IO will need to research their own org's leadership structure and make recommendations about it.
