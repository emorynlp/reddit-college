  "text": "I bought a self-published book on Amazon and recognize verbatim bits from a talk I gave a few years ago. The author lives in the same city of 180,000 where I gave the talk. The book doesn't include a single citation, and it contains material that is the fruit of research, not common knowledge. I suspect portions of text were lifted from journals or other books because the writing veers in and out of different styles. I'd like to furnish the publisher with proof. Any suggestions?",

If the author has an academic or business affiliation, you can pursue through their ethics/integrity office or whatever they have. If not, leave a scathing review and move on.",
