  "text": "Hi academics.\n\nSo I\u2019m currently an international student and I know that my chances of getting to med school\u2019s very slim and I don\u2019t want to be a medical doctor either. \n\nBut that seems to be the most common path to take for most people in this major.\n\nBut I chose this major (and minoring in neuroscience) to have a broad field of opportunities in my scientific career.\n\nI\u2019m in my second year (currently a 94 cumulative avg) and I\u2019d say money does matter to me especially as an immigrant and not having a lot of financial support.\n\nI\u2019m only in my second year. But idk what to pick for my masters to be both interesting and have a stable income. \n\nAre they any related fields you\u2019d recommend? Thanks!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have a masters but did do the med school thing. I didn\u2019t have a neuroscience undergraduate degree (wasn\u2019t really widespread when I trained) but took a neuroscience heavy courseload. There are quite a few folks I work with who have masters and doctoral degrees. While they don\u2019t practice clinical medicine, obviously, they are heavily involved with research and clinical trials. I\u2019ve also interviewed many prospective medical school candidates who had very positive experiences working in the private sector doing biomed research. We have several PhD neuroscience staff who absoutely love the research they do and are compensated well, though, as you may know, doctoral work can be a long and financially unrewarding path. Anecdotally, I see candidates and employees who finished masters level work and are quite happy being clinical research coordinators or are directly involved in benchtop research. Private jobs have a lot to offer in neuroscience and pharmaceutical research. My old college roommate did bioinformatics IT masters before med school. Some people are happy working on bioengineering software/AI applications. So many options! What interests you the most in the sciences?",

          "text": "Thank you for your response! \n\nI\u2019d say in terms of compensation, I don\u2019t have to necessarily make 6 figures. Put plainly, I just want a life without money problems. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in a neuro-scientific path and I\u2019d love to be involved in research. My worries are about the processes of getting involved in research alone. I find it very intimidating which might be due to my age and inexperience. \n\nAlso, pharmaceuticals are also an area of interest, as well as genetical studies. But I don\u2019t know how to be involved in research as a stable career. \n\nI would say that unfortunately, I\u2019m just not aware what my potentials are atm. \n\nI\u2019m going to book an appointment with my undergrad councillor. \n\nFor us science folks the path is definitely less straightforward than the engineer counterparts.\n\nThank you, again.",
