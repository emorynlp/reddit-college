  "text": "Of course, the ideal situation would be that my advisor has funding so that I can focus solely on my dissertation, but my advisor does not. There may be an opportunity for internal funding, but it\u2019s not being announced until the 30th. \n\nBackground info: Last summer, I interned with NOAA, I have the option to intern with NOAA/NESDIS this summer, but don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best option if I want to pursue academia further. My first paper got published in June. It\u2019s my only paper, though, and I know that\u2019s a main hiring criterion. By the time I graduate, I will have submitted three papers, and hopefully both the second and third are published as well.",

It\u2019s more of a program for introducing NYC to a satellite constellation planned for the future and less of a research role, if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve definitely asked others within the organization if there are other opportunities for me to branch out within NOAA, though.",

Ideally something where you can display technical skills in a  high paying field (tech, finance, etc) where you will be able to make 6 figures immediately.\n\nSince you seem to be in a science field, I would definitely be looking for something with a coding element.\n\nedit: that said, I dont really understand your situation, or why you dont have any funding for the final summer of your PhD. Surely your stipend covers the full year? How do you have time to take an internship without interrupting your studies?",

So I don\u2019t think industry is for me.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting the feeling that I\u2019m not cut out for academia based on my single publication and now I\u2019m starting to panic.

      "text": "If you find yourself in the academic job market, publications are the strongest signal of future research productivity. Most of the job search committee discussion is about research productivity and 'fit' in the department because if you don't publish, well, you know the drill.   \n\n\nKeeping your options open is probably a good bet, that is, an internship that lands you with industry skills. Practical experience + publications is great, especially if you can build research networks that you can leverage for future research streams. The added bonus is that it makes you attractive to industry and you may find that preferable to teaching/research or a non-TT position.\n\nTalk to your advisor and other members of the committee. Get a range of opinions here on those who know you best and your progress on your dissertation. Because you don't want an internship that ends up derailing progress on the dissertation.",
