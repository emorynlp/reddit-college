Often because they were simply too daft to leave (this is me). \n\nAre you asking whether someone can become a scientist without all the time consuming qualifications, or are you assuming all scientists are extraordinary people? Can assure you the latter isn't true. They're as mundane as any other group of humans. Except me, obviously. I'm awesome.",

It can be as simple as someone who researches the natural world, and you can absolutely do that on your own at home with the internet, or in the library. It doesn't mean you have to do something new, just new to you.\n\nNow if you want to be hired as a scientist, or publish research, then you need some skills in a science field. Some of these can get obtained online for free just by putting in some work or free online classes, others require labs and resources, so community college is a good place to start. People with all sorts of degrees work in labs, but the longer your degree took, the more freedom you tend to have to work on things that interest you personally.",

With a BSc the typical route is to get a PhD, which can then get you into the Postdoc>PI>Professor academia route, or you can go into industry for the Scientist>Senior Scientist>\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 route. \n\nHowever, if you don't want to go down the PhD route,  which let's be honest is pretty demanding, not just intellectually but more socially and economically, you can still stay in Science or science-adjacent jobs. There's lab technician/research assistant roles, which involve doing the day-to-day lab work but not necessarily the planning or data analysis aspects of a postdoc etc. I'm sure there are more graduate entry jobs in industry, but I don't have much experience in that area to be able to tell you. \nYou will hit a ceiling without a PhD at some point, but it really depends what you want out of life. If you want to be a high-powered Nobel prize winning scientist then you'll need a PhD, but if you just want a 9-5 that happens to involve some science then a BSc, or maybe a Masters, would be enough. Getting a PhD isn't about having good grades or being an intellectual, it's more about making sacrifices and being dedicated to the work.",

If you're interested in science I hope an environment like that helps you too. Some people find that in college. But know there are infinitely many questions out there that the scientific model can hope to understand. If you have a particular interest, go for it. Because likely you're one of the only people with that calling. Act on it. [:",

Recording that process would give you credence when claiming a new thing so that others may replicate the new thing and support your claim of a new thing and that you discovered it, thereby allowing you to claim it as your intellectual property.  By doing that people that try to steal your thing can be prosecuted and people that want to use your thing can buy it or pay you royalties for it.\n   A lot of things have already been invented purely by necessity but things are always popping up out of the blue and eccentric people get honorary university membership thing\u00eces for their groundbreaking work .
