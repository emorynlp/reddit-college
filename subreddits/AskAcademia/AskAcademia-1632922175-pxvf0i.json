  "text": "I've been really, really bad at taking advantage of points/membership/etc from airlines, hotel booking websites, cards that give you lounge access or cashback, etc when I've travelled. However I know some of my colleagues do a great job at getting lots of perks. We're not travelling these days because COVID of course, but what is your strategy for getting the most out of the perks of conference travel? Do you use certain cards, which airline reward points are worth it, are there certain hotel booking websites (e.g. booking.com I think when you're a member you get free upgrades) that are worth being a regular customer?",

Even had one friend pay the site , got confirmation but then the site didn\u2019t actually buy the ticket from the airline due to a tech problem, so they had no ticket and also no money.\n\nStaying at the conference hotel is nice but there are often cheaper, better options.  \u201cConference rate\u201d is sometimes HIGHER than the normal rate.  My next conference (fingers crossed it\u2019s still in person) I\u2019m staying at an AirBnB (whole apt) on the beach four blocks from the conference hotel for $100 less per night than the conference rate.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve found \u201cchurning\u201d points to not be worth it unless you\u2019re traveling a lot (last job was 30% travel).

I got some great deals and ended up in some sketchy-ass AirBnB situations. \n\nOne time a Houston Uber driver looked at me horrified when the app told him the ride was over - \u201cyou\u2019re staying *here*? Uh oh. Don\u2019t be walking at night.\u201d Didn\u2019t end up feeling like I was in danger, though it was shitty. No towels or soap in the bathroom, broken locks on the doors, a theater group downstairs literally *practicing their screams* for an hour. But it was like $45/night\u2026 \n\nIf it were just about bare-bones accommodations, I might still be doing that shit. Cheap is cheap. A bed is a bed. What sucks, though, is when at the end of a long conference day, you\u2019re talking with a colleague who proposes getting a nightcap at the conference hotel bar before they head back up to their room. But you know you\u2019ve got 45 mins of bus/train/rideshare back to your shitty closet, then will have to leave it again at 6:30 am to get back in time for the first session of the day. \n\nSo you miss out on the real personal connection-building time, get awful sleeps, and can\u2019t change shoes if you discover too late that your new pair is rubbing a blister. I feel lucky that my salary now lets me bite the conference hotel bullet.",

So much this. \n\nI was at a conference in Philadelphia and the conference hotel was adjacent to the convention center. It was far more per night than an AirBnB off Spruce Street that was *perfect*. I paid less, had more space and was able to enjoy bits of Philadelphia (which I love). \n\nThe biggest hack is that using third party sites and booking at the conference's preferred hotel is often more expensive and inflexible than doing a bit of the legwork on your own.

If you have a block grant, work for feds, etc, or otherwise have a \"we have unlimited amount of money\" situation then it's usually not best for the individual to look for cheap options. Many big hotel chains like Hilton have great perks, including free breakfast and/or other meals. The trick is that your hotel room can be reimbursed (even if the rate actually includes food, as long as it's not a separate line item) whereas meals are not reimbursed separately if you have a time-based per diem system. That is, you can stay in a good hotel and eat for free, and still get the federal per diem reimbursement which you can buy alcohol with, put in your IRA, or whatever. On top of that is of course earning bonus points with that hotel chain, which you can usually use later for personal travel.\n\nOf course if you are working on a tight grant then that may not be an option",

If you get to travel often, your miles add up pretty quickly and you can use that other perks, preferred boarding, booking vacations, traveling home and related stuff.\n\n2. Instead of staying at the conference venue, I prefer to stay at an Airbnb a small walk away. It's often a lot cheaper than the venue and allows me to travel and go around the city more.\n\n3. Don't use third party apps in general, they often charge more and are less accountable. It's easy to stay on top of these things yourself.\n\n4. Having a credit card that'll give you miles for regular purchases and airline travel also helps. A few of my friends had that and they were happy with it. But I personally prefer cash back cards instead.\n\n6. The conference restaurants can also be a bit expensive. Getting a meal or a drink with people somewhere near downtown or some other place helps. This also allows us to explore the city and try interesting cuisines if it's a new culture.",

You may get upgrades but there's also a lot of places for communication breakdown and tech issues, and if that happens the hotel or airline is under NO obligation to help you. When I book on the Delta app and Hilton app, my app confirms my booking with an email and I can use that at the hotel or airport to get help if I need it (I never have).\n\nAirbnbs are also a great option if your uni will reimburse them.",

You can also earn points, which you can then use towards free stays. The value is the enormity of the Hilton brand - lots of hotels will count towards points - but generally, you have to use them pretty frequently to get a free stay. Each dollar = 10 points; how many points you need varies by the location and type of hotel.\n\nFor example, there are 40 hotels in NYC that you could use points for; they vary in cost from 30K points to 717K points for *one* free night. Since each dollar = 10 points, to get to 30K points you'd need to spend $3,000 at Hilton to get one free night at the cheapest hotel in NYC. Assuming a conference rate of $300/night, and a stay of 3 days, that would be four conferences before you get one free night. It may take you 1-2 years to get one free night.\n\nHonestly, I found that most mileage and point systems are really made for very frequent business travelers: people who are probably traveling about once a month or so or more and are spending a lot of their company's money. The amounts of miles or stays you need to get into the upper tiers are really tied to that kind of travel: for example, even the level above basic (Silver) for Hilton Honors requires four stays a year (or 10 nights), and the level above that (Gold) requires 20 stays (or 40 nights).\n\nUnless you also travel pretty often for fun and always stay in a Hilton, many academics would likely struggle to hit Silver, and probably won't hit Gold. But there are some roles that basically have people living out of hotels M-R. Before the pandemic, my role had me traveling 1-2 times a month and I was like \"Ohhhh, THIS is how people get status.\" That doesn't mean you shouldn't join the program (they're free!) or try to book with a single airline or hotel chain if the prices aren't that different, but it does mean that all of the cool benefits they advertise may not be easily available to you, and you should definitely read through the terms.",

Some people get really advanced with using third party sites to buy points or applying for multiple cards per year but that's too much work for me.

          "text": "For non-work travel, we do exactly this. Right now Chase Sapphire Preferred is offering 100,000 points if you spend $4000 in the first 3 months after approval. We use those points to stay at Hyatt Place hotels. Those are typically 5-8000 points to stay in but the cost would typically be $150-$180. Last month we took a 4 day trip from Nashville down the Natchez Trace, to Natchez, to Memphis and back home. We stayed in Hyatt Place hotels along the way and spent 31,000 points for 5 nights. The hotels would have cost over $900. The credit card costs $100 a year. It is first-dollar insurance for auto rental insurance and has travel insurance (that's really only relevant for illness, not for \"any reason\" to cancel travel).\n\nWe also got Chase Southwest cards (business and personal--business if you ever make a dollar outside of a paycheck works). Those also required spending a certain amount in the first months after opening the account. With that we then made me a companion for my wife's card, so I fly free for 23 months. She earned so many points by opening up the card that she's been flying free since she opened up the card 2 years ago. Obviously COVID has impacted our travel, but we've taken 5 trips in the last 2 years, all on points that came from opening the card. We still have many points left. I cancelled her cards right before the first year was up so we didn't have to pay for the cards beyond that time. When we run out of her points, I'll open up the 2 cards for me and we'll rinse and repeat. Each of us can do that every 4 years so by alternating we'll have free flights pretty much forever, until we've seen everything that we care to see where Southwest flies.\n\nThe only other thing I do to build points is to have a very minimal amount of taxes withheld and instead make estimated payments using the Chase card. It costs right at 2% to do it but the payback is very good. If I pay $5000 in taxes, it costs $100 to do it but I can use the 5000 points to pay for a Hyatt Place hotel that would have cost $150-180.",
