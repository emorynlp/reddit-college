  "text": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. I contacted a professor at my local university for a summer undergrad research position. Everything went fine \u2013 we exchanged around 10-12 emails over the course of a couple of months but had not decided on the topic of the project yet. I had parallelly applied to a dream research internship I thought I would never get into (\\~1% acceptance rate). I didn't inform the professor about the other lab because I was extremely confident that I wouldn't get in. Turns out, I actually got accepted into this internship, and I'm in a tough spot. I decide to take the internship and immediately send a politely worded email to the professor indicating that I had chosen the other lab, and I sincerely apologized for the trouble. I also expressed my willingness to work with the prof immediately after I complete the internship.  A few hours later, I hear back from the professor and he told me that he would never work with me anymore and that I am a terrible student\\*. He also indicated that I had wasted his valuable time. I am literally shaking right now, and having anxiety issues doesn't help. I respect this professor very much, and have followed his work since I was in high school. What should I say, and how do I react to this?\n\n\\*EDIT: panic typed \"terrible person\" instead of \"terrible student\". ",

      "text": "A negative email from someone you look up to and who wields a position of power never feels good. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so anxious in response to the email.\n\nI honestly think you dodged a bit of a bullet. Considering that you had not yet formally agreed to take this summer research position, you did nothing wrong by backing out. A normal reaction would be a professor perhaps feeling a bit disappointed that the student selected another lab and then wishing them well and moving on. It does not call for personal attacks.\n\nThere is no scenario in which a professor calling a student \"a terrible person\" is acceptable. Period. This professor showed you his true colors, and be glad that you will not be working with him or relying on him for a future letter of recommendation.",

But when the tables are turned, this isn't how the game is played.\n\nPlease.",

I gotta be honest, even if I was really excited about working with someone, if a better opportunity comes along for them and they want to go work there, I'd be happy for them. I'd probably tell them that I'm interested in seeing what work they do, and while I might be a tad circumspect about collabing on ideas without locking down an agreement to work, I certainly would not get upset. Academia is a really tough world already. Along every step we're trying to maximize our CV value, because its the only way to eventually land a semblance of stable and well paying job later down the road.

Otherwise the PI should be happy that you received such a competitive internship, as having a successful track record will be really helpful for your long-term career. You can check how much NIH funding a PI has by using [reporter.nih.gov](https://reporter.nih.gov). I would recommend doing this before deciding on rotation labs once you get to grad school.",

Still frustrating when you spend a lot of time working with a student and they aren\u2019t honest about their commitment to it. \n\nFaculty don\u2019t take on undergraduate researchers because it helps them be more productive, they do so for the benefit of the students often at a cost to themselves.",

The stakes are even higher for graduate students, who need publishable ideas to move them forward.  I would save all my best ideas for students and often end up doing half (or more) of the work only to end up second author.  I did it because I saw training as valuable, not because I needed \u201chelp\u201d.  In most cases I could have done the project more efficiently on my own.

If you're truly doing it for the benefit of the student, and the student walks away for their own benefit, then you'll be happy for them.

There\u2019s not really a material benefit to me in training students. I don\u2019t get paid, it\u2019s not part of my contract, it doesn\u2019t count for tenure or promotion, and I don\u2019t work where there\u2019s a graduate program, so I\u2019m supplying other people with trained researchers and getting nothing material in return. Again, I do it because it\u2019s the right thing to do and it\u2019s something I find rewarding. Many of my colleagues choose not to do it at all because, again, it\u2019s not a direct benefit and comes at a significant cost, personally and professionally. \n\nBut since this thread is in response to someone saying the professor should be happy for \u201cfree labor\u201d and that\u2019s what I was responding to, I\u2019m not sure how this applies. \n\nThe professor absolutely did overreact, and what they did is not excusable.  But the balance to that is that the OP was also unprofessional. It doesn\u2019t excuse the professors reaction, but many of the replies here are going way too far towards the end of \u201cstudents are free labor\u201d and \u201cyou didn\u2019t have a signed contract\u201d and neglecting completely the very real cost of mentoring and training undergraduate researchers. Even at PUIs it\u2019s typically uncompensated and does not count towards tenure and promotion. \n\nSaying \u201cit\u2019s good for the future of science\u201d is really just another way of saying \u201cprofessors make the sacrifice of their time because it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d. But normalizing uncompensated work, whether it\u2019s the long hours worked by grad students or extra work expected of faculty outside of their contracts isn\u2019t healthy.",

And if you\u2019re lucky, you can have somewhat of a hierarchy of skills developed over time where the senior students help train the junior students. I\u2019ve only worked with undergrads so far, but that was the best model for all (also, the students seemed happiest this way). OP, a prof becoming visibly upset with you without you even starting the position, and as an undergrad, is a bad reflection on them. I would say, I have found honesty to be best in my scientific career. Next time, let them know if you have other opportunities in play (especially if it\u2019s your dream gig). Best to you!",

Don't reply, try to let it roll off your back.  Easier said than done, but the PI might just be an asshole, and that isn't worth space in your brain.\n\n2: if you committed to joining their lab and backed out, that's really bad form.  If this is what happened, just learn your lesson and try to move on -- reneging is frowned upon.  Still, don't reply to the professor -- if you committed and backed out, you burned that bridge and it likely isn't worth anyone's time to try and repair it.  And don't feel too bad about it -- you're an undergrad and have probably never been in this position.  Just learn from it.\n\nEven in #2, the professor is still a bit of an asshole, and you shouldn't want to work with an asshole, even if they do great work.  You got a good opportunity it sounds like.  It's too bad they didn't see this as a good thing.",

Hell, graduate students burn bridges during their PhDs and postdocs move from lab to lab sometimes. For all OP knows, they could end up in a different field by the time they graduate. No need to feel like they made some sort of longterm blunder.\n\nAnd I don't know about his research area, but in physics, for example, there are tons of wonderful projects, big and small. I made a move from a small project to a larger one and it's been a great learning experience. Having a bad experience at LHC doesn't mean you can't work at DUNE later on, for example, as long as you still have some professors and coworkers who can support you.  \n\n\nThis also makes me think about an experience I had like this. I interviewed for a postdoc with no big commitment, and at the interview the PI and I didn't hit it off. When I declined later she talked a bunch of shit and tried to cause drama for me, but most people didn't care. People look into jobs and go for interviews all the time and get rejected. It's also true that at most points (before the faculty stage) young research will be turning down job one opportunity to take another. It's totally normal.",

Obviously you\u2019re not a terrible student. Losing students and time is frustrating but it\u2019s part of the game. He should know better than to throw a tantrum. Best to just ignore it and take whatever lessons you can from this experience. \n\nTo provide some insight. If he was taking you on as a volunteer he spent extra time coming up with a project for you to help with. If it was paid, he lost valuable time he could have used to recruit a new student.  \n\nI\u2019ve had situations were as a grad student I accidentally burned bridges. It happens. I still landed a good job. I learned some lessons too. If you don\u2019t tell someone you\u2019ve applied for other opportunities you have to be prepared for the consequences. If you think about it, someone getting pissed about this isn\u2019t at all surprising. The best takeaway is next time wait if you can. Given that it was a summer position and if it was a volunteer position maybe having waited until closer to the summer to reach out to this prof would have worked out. Nothing you can do about this now, but keep that in mind for future opportunities. Another takeaway? Some profs are assholes with temper issues.",

In some cases it\u2019s really hard for profs to find replacements after some date due to funding/paperwork is completed. That would have also played out in your favor since you would have known this dude was an ass earlier and you could have avoided him *sooner*.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m disappointed my student isn\u2019t working with me since I thought we had a good rapport. They told me they were applying to work with the other prof, and I\u2019m happier for them they are doing something closer to their own field of interest and am happy to support them doing so. (I\u2019m more than a little annoyed they\u2019re working for a prof who\u2019s leaving at the end of the summer to work elsewhere and is still taking students at this school, but that has 0 to do with the students.)

      "text": "I must politely disagree with several of the people posting.\n\nIts immature to think about an internship only in terms of the benefits to you.  A good mentor wants to see a mentee succeed, but can only invest time/ effort if the professional relationship is mutually beneficial. Clearly the professor had an understanding you would do an internship and was working to make it happen.\n\nIt doesn't matter what, technically you told the professor. The professor clearly had a different impression.  Unlike in courtrooms, in relationships, its not the exact words that matter, but the message that was conveyed. It would have been easy enough to tell the professor that you had sent out another application. Then, the prof might be disappointed, but couldn't feel you'd been deceiptful. But you didnt.\n\nTaking an internship is not like taking or dropping a class. Students too often do not appreciate the time and effort required to bring a student onto the team. And remember,  faculty typically do not get compensated in any formal way for working with students outside the classroom. A research prof (such as myself) may not even get compensation for classroom teaching. On the other hand, research success is everything for many faculty - livelihoods depend upon it. \n\nWill it affect your career? Probably not. But a bridge has been burned. Whether you lit the match, or your professor did, is moot. You can only do that so many times. Clearly, you won't be asking this professor for a letter if rec. But remember, faculty talk to each other, just like students  talk about faculty. Take care to be respectful of others time in the future, so your bridge fire doesn't spread.\n\nOk too many analogies.\n\nAnyway, my 2 cents.",

Pursuing multiple opportunities is the norm, and sulking about it is weak, especially vis a vis an undergrad.  OP is a student.  If they knew how to navigate this stuff elegantly, we wouldn't have a job.  It was the original professor's professional obligation to help socialize the student into appropriate norms, and it does not appear as if they are modelling those.\n\nAnd, by the way, it's worth noting the unanimity against the professor's behavior, and remembering that if you treat the students around you this way, this is what your peers think of you.",

Unfortunately, it happens: many academics have done extremely interesting work but are also awful people you just never want to interact with. James Watson (of Watson & Crick fame) is an extreme racist who believes that he can use genetics to \"prove\" white people are superior to black people, for example. Famously, Craig Venter (private arm of human genome project guy) is a complete shit who literally nobody works with if they can possibly avoid it. \n\nYou're gonna have this happen, so all I can say is that I'm glad you're not relying on this guy for any kind of reference. You honestly don't need to ever talk to him again, especially if you're not planning on attending the university he works at, so I'm not sure you NEED to say anything. Though, if you're certain you won't go to the university he works at... might be worth dropping the university a line and letting them know that this professor is sabotaging potential students and driving them away. Universities may allow teaching staff to get away with a lot when it's directed at students, but if staff are directly cutting into their revenue stream then they're more inclined to care.\n\nGlad you avoided that!
