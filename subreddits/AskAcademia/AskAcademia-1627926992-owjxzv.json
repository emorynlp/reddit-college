      "text": ">Anybody who has gone through this, can you share what it was like?\n\nI think grad school is a good time to have a child (academic career-wise) because it doesn't really matter if your PhD took 6 years instead of 5. I had a baby right after finishing my thesis work, before starting my thesis. I then wrote my thesis while full time caring for my child in about 5 months.\n\n\n> How you feel it affected your PhD/relationships/career? \n\nIt limits where you can move. It limits how often you can travel for work. It limits how often you can be in the lab. I would say it makes it significantly harder to be one of the 'young stars in your field' type of academic. I have a wonderful partner who does half the care giving, but I still cant do all the traveling/working late I would need to do to be extra successful. If your only goal in life is to be a professor I would wait to have kids because it will make it much harder for you to jump through all the hoops that successful postdocs do.\n\n\n> What you wish you would have known or done, or what you're glad you knew or did? \n\nI do not regret my decision. As a professor I am currently pregnant with my second. It is much harder in this job than at grad school.\n\n> How the timing of kid(s) corresponded with and affected your PhD? \nI planned it towards the end in order to focus on thesis writing during maternity leave.\n\n> Anything else that I'm not even thinking to ask?\n\nSome people get pregnant the first month of trying and sometimes it takes 12 cycles. Buy a bbt thermometer and start tracking your ovulation before you start trying. Also, I had a totally normal/average pregnancy. So I worked until my due date, took two weeks off and then wrote a thesis.\n\nSome people get so sick that they stop working their whole pregnancies. Delivery complications could make your recovery last months. You cannot predict these things, but they will affect your phd timeline.",

      "text": "I had a child halfway through my PhD (while my husband was midway through a 4 year federal postdoc). I had already finished all of my coursework, field work, and lab work, and passed my comps, so I was ABD. We knew from observing many young faculty and friends in academia that our lives would never have the same level of flexibility again, so we decided to go for it before entering the TT job market. I stayed home with my child while working on my dissertation, which was sometimes pretty challenging but ultimately very much worth it. Luckily, it did not have a negative impact on my relationship with my advisor, who was very supportive and willing to accommodate my needs. It added about a year to my timeline, and I had to pay for tuition for those 2 extra semesters, but it was not very much since I only had to be registered for 3 hours each semester. I defended when my child was 18 months old. The end stretch was very difficult -- lots of very late nights, working on final data analyses and dissertation revisions into the wee hours of the morning while my kid was asleep. It was pretty exhausting and stressful for a few weeks, but...then it was over and I survived. Looking back, I fully believe we made the right decision, because if we had a baby right now (both at an R1, one as TT STEM faculty, one in high level research admin), we would be drowning. We see other early career faculty who have new babies or very young children, and most of them are struggling. Our child was 3 years old when we started at our university, so it was a bit easier to handle than taking on such a massive new job with a newborn.",

After seeing how overworked and chronically stressed out pretty much every academic I knew was, I had decided by the end of my first year of my PhD that I did not want to pursue a career as a professor. I decided that I would either pursue a career in federal research (also high workload and expectations, but without all the teaching and administration that comes with academia), or a position in research administration. My spouse got a TT position at a great university but there are really no research opportunities in my field on this side of the country (my background is in dryland/grassland ecology and we moved to the eastern US where everything is covered in crop fields or trees lol). I currently have a position in research admin at an R1 and I get to work with a bunch of amazing faculty doing fantastic research and help them be productive and successful, without all the time and stress of having to write grants, publish, teach, or graduate students myself. I get to go home at night and enjoy my child and free time! My professor husband, on the other hand, works 60 hours a week and is chronically sleep deprived. I knew having two academics would not be sustainable for our particular family, or allow for a reasonable work-life balance. Some people are able to make it work, though, so I guess it really depends on how driven you are to do research / be a professor.",

I had some teaching I still did, but most of my research was done and I was mostly writing once they were born.\n\nKids are more mobile after 1 year old and require a lot more attentive interaction to keep them happy and out of things. And I couldn't have handled the daycare costs while in grad school for many years.\n\nAnother thing to consider- my grad school insurance was AMAZING. $100 OOP max per year per person.

I am at the end of mine right now and would thus be more biased to the stress level being high. You can mitigate the damage of stress by being healthy in sleeping, eating and exercise and interrupting the stressful bits with calm bits, which you can even effectively fake to a large extent. \n\nPlease note that there is more to this and many other things play a role, your age, your weight, you fitness level. Even ethnicity plays a role. If you are managing fine and in it already, just make time to be calm too. All the best, I hope it's amazing and I am already jealous :) good luck!",

Most people struggle with balance, but acute stress combined with a good attitude has great effects. so you don't need to avoid it entirely, just make sure you've got the happy and calm in-between and you should be great. \n\nDisclaimer, I work on chronic stress, so I know about how bad it can be, and my phd has been rough, so for me, it's just not an option. I think if that weren't the case, I wouldn't be able to agree more that it's the best time for a pregnancy. You get to be at home a lot, flexible hours, all of that. I really hope you do great and you have a super fun pregnancy. Good luck!\n\nPS, good call on study leader, they make or break your postgraduate experience. \n\nPPS, the average PhD takes 7 years, so you always have the option to submit a bit later. The university loses money the later you submit, so don't let anyone bully you into a time frame you aren't comfortable with.",
