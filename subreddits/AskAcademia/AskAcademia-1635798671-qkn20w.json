  "text": "I have a postdoc (UK) interview next week and in need of some advice. This is my first postdoc interview and I am required to prepare a 5 min presentation, but unsure what exactly to include? Any suggestions would help. \n\nI am currently still writing up my thesis, hoping to submit before Christmas, but I'm worried I won't be able submit in time. What's the best thing to say if they ask when I will submit? \n\nWhat are some typical interview questions? I know this can be pretty open, but I haven't had an interview in years and my brain has melted from writing. \n\nWhat would be some useful questions could I ask them?",

      "text": "Do they provide any requests for the presentation? It might be worth emailing them to see if they have something specific in mind. Otherwise, as 5 mins is so short, a brief overview of your most interesting/relevant project/paper is probably what they are looking for. Make sure to discuss any relevant skill/techniques that will apply to the postdoc.\n\nIn my experience postdoc start times are quite flexible, so it\u2019s best to just be honest and say that you are intending to submit by the end of the year, with an extra month as back up in case of delays. It\u2019s worth double checking that you would be able to start before having got your PhD certificate as it will likely take a while for viva and admin.\n\nIm in physics (UK) and in my experience most places have some university rules that app questions must be applicable/asked to all candidates, so they are quite generic e.g what skills do you think you have for the role, talk about a time you faced difficulty and how you overcame it, we have xxx skill as being required, explain your experience with it. I was quite surprised by this but apparently it\u2019s for fairness/equality in the hiring process? Your mileage may vary here, but just expect questions based on your CV/the job posting.\n\nAs for questions, I would ask about the career progression opportunities, such as if the university supports/funds early career fellowship applications. Whether there is funding for conferences. What opportunities there are for collaborations between other groups etc. Make sure to also ask any questions about the project that you want to know. Things such as what are the key milestones, how much scope is there for side projects, what training will you get etc.\n\nHoped some of that helped, good luck!",

      "text": "My experience is with the life sciences\n\nThe job advertisement should have bullet points etc about requirements or desired skills experience etc. Make your presentation around those, address each point, using your experience during you phd. 5 minutes is not enough to go into detail about specific projects or papers\n\nRemember that almost everyone in this business has imposter syndrome so go in with confidence\n\nBe honest and upfront and your timescale. My most recent switch of post doc positions had a 2 month notice period to serve out before i could start so if you need time to finish your writing I'm sure that won't be a problem\n\nAsk about how long the funding is, if there is extra money to support your work and how much. If there are any parts of the applied for role that are unclear, ask.",
