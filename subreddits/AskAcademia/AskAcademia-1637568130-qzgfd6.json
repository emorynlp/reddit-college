  "text": "I am in my final year of my PhD (neuroscience) at an Australian university and have been given the opportunity to do a postdoc once i finish (89k a year, 17% super). I really dont fully understand the whole postdoc/academic career exactly and most have said it can be a dead end. However, I find it enticing since I would be able to work on some research I have always been fascinated in. \n\nCould anyone let me know how the postdoc/academic career works exactly in terms of grants and funding and gradually working your way up the academic ladder? Do you basically pay for yourself through grants or does the uni actually pay you? Is it supposed to be short term? And are there negatives to doing a postdoc?  \n\nSorry for the ignorant questions!",

I don't mean this in an unkind way at all, but you may not have been given much advice or mentoring so far. I suggest you prioritise this highly by asking lota of questions to colleagues and researching how the system works through blogs etc. All this informs your judgement which is critical for you to thrive is this sector.

      "text": "I am an Australian who finished a PhD in the past two years.\n\nA postdoc offer is nothing to sneeze at, but there are a few questions you should ask:\n\n* How secure is the funding? Your PI might be intending to hire you for 2-3 years, but may only have funding now to keep you for one year. Be clear about this going in.\n* At what point will you be expected to apply for your own grants/fellowships? The answer is likely, again, 'immediately' but it's worth making expectations clear. Related to point one, if you can't secure your own funding, does your PI have the funding to support you?\n* How well-funded is the lab? Will you have access to the reagents you need, be able to do expensive experiments, or is the lab running on a shoestring budget, even if salaries are secure?\n* The usual questions about research environment, lab culture, etc.\n\nYou also didn't say if the postdoc is in the same lab that you did your PhD in (it's unclear from your post it's the same lab, same university or different university). There's nothing wrong with doing a short (6-12 month) postdoc to tie up loose ends from your PhD, but that can easily turn into a 3-4 year postdoc in the same lab that you did your PhD in, which is usually frowned upon (and can make it very, very hard to get an independent grant or fellowship).\n\nMore generally, I'd get some career advice from trusted senior colleagues/your PhD supervisor/any others you know at a similar career stage to you or junior postdocs (do you know anyone who graduated in the past 2-3 years?). Australian academia is a mess at the moment, and as others have said it's important to be clear-eyed at this stage.\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few industry jobs in Australia so that isn't really an option for people if they need to stay in Australia. There are plenty more non-academic career opportunities available overseas (in the biopharmaceutical industry, in startups, in publishing, in consulting, as an MSL, etc) and doing a postdoc overseas is often a way to move into positions like this if you aren't interested in academia.",

Not just in terms of technical skills, but also work styles/culture, network etc. In other words, a continuation of the PhD, not a postdoc. \n\nIt could well be the right decision for a person to do a long postdoc in their PhD supervisor\u2019s lab, but one should be aware of way that other people will view it.",

And, as you will likely find through the answers in this thread, post-docs vary widely in their expectations and modes of funding, I did two post-docs, at 2 different schools in the same state in US, and even they were different, but holy cow, I loved being a post doc. \n\nMy post docs were largely schools paying me to do research in their name while I didn't have to teach anything, and no one was super concerned with how I was spending the hours of my day. It was FANTASTIC, seriously, the two best \"jobs\" I've ever had.  \n\nOther perks to doing a post-doc if you are staying in academia: \n\n - More time to find an academic job. I actually found my academic job during the first year of a two year post doc and easily negotiated a 1 year deferral of my job start to finish my postdoc.  I could have also left the postdoc a year early. \n\n - You will have a broader network of collaborators once you begin your academic job\n\n -  You will have a broader  pool of people to serve as letter writers. \n\n - You can spend postdoc time writing papers from your PhD, because let me tell you, you will not have much time to write them if you become a prof. \n\n - If you don't do an academic job, a postdoc still counts as professional job experience because you're not a student, so you can still use this as experience on an industry resume.  \n\nMaybe it varies from field to field, but I'm also in STEM.  I'd say ask a lot of questions from your potential Post doc supervisor and department to get the specifics.",

      "text": "So, I have no idea if Australia and the USA work the same ways, but I do have experience as an administrator at a Harvard University neuroscience lab and can tell you how things worked there: First, in the USA, postdocs are basically mandatory. It is very unlikely, maybe impossible, to get a tenure-track position if you don't complete a postdoc first. The postdocs vary quite a bit in length, but in our lab, they tended to last 2-5 years. Even then, getting a tenure-track job is no guarantee, since they are extremely competitive. At least one of our postdocs couldn't find an academic job and ended up in biotech research. As far as funding goes, postdocs occasionally secured their own grants, but most were funded by grants secured by the PI. (In the latter case, this meant that the money was given to the university, and then the university cut the paychecks.) Generally speaking, the university didn't really fund research at all. PI salaries were paid by the university, and each new PI received a one-time, lump-sum startup fund to set up their labs, but beyond that, research (including salaries for student and postdoc researchers) was funded entirely by grants obtained by the PIs.  Anyhow, like I said, I don't know how much of this translates to Australia, or even to less prestigious universities in the US, but there's my very particular neuroscience lab experience!",

In Aus if you have a PhD, publications and some experience you are looking at level B academic position (not sure what is the US equivalent). The salary at this level starts at about 100k but can go up to 120k. However, as someone noted above, seems like some unis are lowballing postdocs and offering lvl A - but even at level A under 90k is lower end imo",

I could have stayed on in academia but quite frankly where I did my post doc was a toxic environment and I left for better things :).",
