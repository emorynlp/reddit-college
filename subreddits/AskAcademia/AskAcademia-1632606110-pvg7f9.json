  "text": "Hi all! I have been working in higher education for 3 1/2 years and I recently transitioned to a new role. My prior experience has always been in a student-facing work environment. Any advice you can all share working directly with faculty and overall expectations? I would appreciate some feedback and personal experiences. Thanks a lot!",

      "text": "I'm a senior member of staff in a research institute and my advice for working with faculty is:\n\n- recognise they are extremely busy and under a lot of pressure, try to make everything as easy as possible for them\n- academia does not value people management skills (or project management) and academics can be truly dreadful at handling issues with people. It's often not intentional (not that that's an excuse) but do not underestimate their ability to mishandle a difficult situation. Make time to discuss exactly what they intend to do when issues arise and be prepared to \"coach\" them if needed. The good ones appreciate the support.\n- there's very little leverage you can exert over faculty, except maybe funder terms and conditions. Spend time building good relationships with them because when the time comes that you have to get them to do something you're going to have to largely do it by carrot rather than stick. Sometimes you do get a stick and that helps! \n- learn to manage upwards\n- if you have projects that require them to do something it helps of you can find a faculty member to champion it, so find out what issues they each care about.\n- make friends with all the PAs, administrators (and lab managers if it's STEM) they are the gatekeepers and they can make or break most things. They can also get shit done and know a lot of good stuff.",

      "text": "Most faculty don't want to deal with the nitty-gritty details of everyday work so they'll just ignore emails that requires some effort.  I try to make things dead simple for them - for example, rather than send an open-ended email like \"what color do you want for your new iPhone?\", I'll email them \"the iPhone 13 comes in pink, blue, red, Starlight (cream/off-white), and Midnight (almost black, w/ hint of navy blue) - which one do you want?\".\n\nIt may sound really stupid, and there are some people who will see it as spoiling the professors, but the alternative is that you send an open-ended email and the professor doesn't respond. Then weeks later, they say \"how come you didn't order my iPhone yet? I wanted gold\" and you have to explain that they a) never responded to your email so you couldn't order the phone yet and b) the iPhone 13 doesn't come in gold.\n\nI'd prefer doing a little extra work up front, so that we can get things done and off my plate :)",
