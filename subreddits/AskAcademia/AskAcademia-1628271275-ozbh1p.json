  "title:": "How to respond to reviewer feedback that is a little vague?",
  "text": "My first, first-author journal paper is currently under review and I have received feedback from one of the reviewers. The problem is, I don't understand what exactly they are trying to say. \n\nFor example, they say something along the lines of: \n\n\\- Results improperly exposed\n\n\\- Problem justification required \n\n\\- This is an excellent paper with great potential\n\nHow do I respond to the first two points? I have gone over my paper three times and cannot find what results are exposed improperly and feel that the problem statement has been justified in great depth. \n\nI am pretty lost at the moment, and am not sure how to proceed. Any advice/guidance would be very helpful. Thank you!",

      "text": "All texts need to be understandable via a quick read. Your reviewers have read your text more thoroughly than the average future reader will. If a reviewer gets stuck on things, chances are the rest of us will too.\n\n>\\- Results improperly exposed\n\nIf I gave this feedback, I may not be able to retell the main results to others after a single reading.\n\n>\\- Problem justification required\n\nThis is super common. To authors, it is often self-evident that a topic is important. Why else would they have spent years on it? To the reader, it isn't. Why should I read this? Why shouldn't I spend this time reading something else or call it a day? I need this information- upfront in the abstract and in the first couple of paragraphs.\n\nHow to respond? It's not really a debate. You need to revise your text -- or have very good reasons not to, reasons that you think will persuade the reviewers and make them change their minds.",

      "text": "Congrats on feedback as it suggests you\u2019re one step closer to having your paper published! I just went through a similar revision on a paper. Without knowing your subject, my best advice is to respond by making some modest revisions to your manuscript that show you have made an attempt to incorporate their feedback. This might include making a more explicit problem statement or presenting some of your results in another way. Ideally you also have some kind of response matrix that you can also elaborate positively to the editor on how you tried to incorporate the feedback. In my experience, the worst thing you can do is ignore the comments and do nothing. Good luck!",
