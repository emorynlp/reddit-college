  "title:": "Is RAship under a prof in a university without applying for masters or Ph.D. programs in that univ possible? If u have done plz share your experience.",
  "text": " hey let's take I don't want to do MS right after my BTech, maybe because I want a break from this system of lecture-hw/assignments-exams cycle, but I also don't want to do a job in some company analyzing data or some consultancy job, I am driven by the space industry and we don't have enough opportunities right here in my country, so can I just take up Research Assistantship under a prof for a year and see how things work out and meanwhile try to figure out how I want to go ahead with life? Like I might receive a stipend which might help me afford a place at the univ. Has anyone done that? so if u don't want to apply for masters or Ph.D. degree or get into a job that doesn't suit u but just for the sake of income right after your BTech/bs, can u just simply apply for a research assistantship under a prof ( for me a prof who might be doing some cool proj in space robotics lets say), if so how do I go about doing that? do profs agree? does the stipend help u survive? Eventually, do u apply for a job alongside the RAship. What do profs look for in u before they give you the RAship?",

      "text": "I am an international Ph.D. student studying in the US and working on space robotics. What you are trying to do is highly unlikely to happen, there are several reasons but here are a few: \n\n1)  RA positions are generally hard to come by even for grad students. So a professor hiring an international undergrad student (with no relevant coursework and experience) as an RA is next to impossible IMO.  \n\n>2)  so can I just take up Research Assistantship under a prof for a year and see how things work out and meanwhile try to figure out how I want to go ahead with life?\n\nTreating an RA position as an experiment while you figure out life is not a good attitude to have. The professors that hire RAs have project commitments to fulfill and they invest a lot of time training and working alongside their students to obtain good publishable results for their sponsors. (I am assuming you are enquiring about industry-sponsored RA positions since you cannot be hired as a university-sponsored TA without being enrolled). So treating an RA position as some sort of a trial gig might not sit well with the professor.  \n\n3)  After reading your post it seems like you want an RA position at a university outside your country. Without being enrolled in the university, you won't get a student (F1) visa, and obtaining a work visa as an undergrad (especially in the space industry) for a RA position is highly unlikely. Even international Ph.D. graduates struggle to get work visas. \n\nYour best bet is to go the traditional route, Master -> PhD -> Job in the space industry. Good luck.",

      "text": "No. Research Assistantships are available only to grad students. There are sometimes other kinds of positions available that you might be eligible for, but they are not usually research positions, as you would not be particularly qualified (nor would you be a student in training for research, like a grad student).",
