  "title:": "Getting a LOR from professors after the pandemic",
  "text": "So, hopefully, at this rate studying abroad should be available for the Spring 2022 semester.\n\nHowever, I will need a letter of recommendation in order to get into the program.\n\nHowever, my Sophomore year of college didn't quite go as planned given the pandemic.  Getting to know my professors beyond attending study hours and participating in class wasn't much of an option.  \n\nI have one professor from freshman year who's class I really participated in and who might remember me still.\n\nI have another professor from last semester who's class I participated in, but not much more beyond the usual discussions and TA sessions.\n\nAnd then there will be a professor who I have already had, and will have this coming semester.  His class I did participate in, but not to the extent of the previous two professors.  The study abroad forms will be due a month into the semester however, so I might be able to get to know this professor in that month, but I'd rather submit my study abroad application early, as I know they can be competitive. \n\nAny suggestions?",

      "text": "Ask your professors from last semester and in your request, give them details about 1) specific things you took away from their classes that you will use in the new setting and 2) specific things you did in the class that they can write about favorably. \n\nThis is tremendously helpful in crafting quality letters and the information will make them much more likely to agree to write. It also helps you because you can highlight the qualities you would like to be emphasized.",
