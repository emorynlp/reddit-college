  "title:": "What draws so many people to a PhD?",
  "text": "I ask this as someone whose parent has a PhD obtained during my lifetime, is a professor, and teaches PhD students.\n\nFrom everything I've seen, a PhD is an extremely niche thing that the vast majority of people, even masters students, have no business doing. Back in the early 1900's when it was likely you'd go your entire life without ever meeting a PhD unless you were at a university seems about right, those willing to dedicate their life to it did so in their isolated corners of the world and that was that.\n\nNowadays though, it seems like a solid 20% or more of college graduates have plans to pursue a doctorate one day, even knowing how extremely unlikely it is they'll ever be a professor or use it. I'm in grad school at a very large university, and I swear almost 100% of some departments like psychology, biology, history, English etc. for both undergrads and grads want to do a PhD or other doctorate. Even my department, business, has a really high amount of people interested in it.\n\nWhat happened? When did a PhD go from \"that thing only professors care about\" to a mainstream goal. It's pretty much never a good financial choice, requires extreme amounts of work for very little reward, and isn't really useful outside of one very specific area. So why is everyone so set on doing it?",

      "text": "1. An increasing number of positions outside of academia require or strongly prefer a PhD or professional doctorate holder, even if the job duties don't necessarily merit it. \n2. There's a big difference between being \"interested\" in pursuing a doctorate when you're at an earlier educational stage and actually going for it when the time comes.\n\n* Some people deliberately choose to pretend to be more into the academic track because they are under the impression (sadly, frequently a true one) that professors will be more invested in their success than if they were honest about their career goals.\n* Too many people view advanced degrees as a logical and respectable next step rather than pausing to consider what they actually want to do. So, wanting to pursue a PhD is really just a placeholder.\n* Some people genuinely think they'd like to pursue academia or some other path that requires a PhD, but then they later find that there's something more suitable for them.",

He never made a whole lot, but he had job security and freedom and I think he was generally happy with that. \n\nNowadays, he would not have even had a position. He was not the grant-getting type and he would not have lasted long in any academic position. I'm doing better than the majority of PhDs (financially speaking) because admin pays better than research. If you aren't willing/able to write grants and produce publications, you are on the chopping block. \n\nThe best course of action for most PhD is to go into industry. Sure, you'll be a cog in the corporate wheel and will be doing what you are told, but the benefits and job security are way better than academia. The only ones who will succeed in academia are the ones that REALLY want to write grants and publications. And have the abilities to make it happen.",

In my country of origin for example, graduate students are basically cheap labour, so I\u2019ve often seen professors encouraging students to continue. For us, usually you do not have to pay for the program and you receive a (not so good) scholarship; you often see many people who are unable to get a job after their bachelor\u2019s applying and joining a masters because, well, that\u2019s what they managed to get at that moment.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen in other countries I\u2019ve studied in that having PhDs graduate is seen as \u201cprestigious\u201d for the PI and even the university (to receive public funding), so basically PIs are constantly writing grants and recruiting PhD students as their \u201chands\u201d to work on these projects: they\u2019ll produce papers, graduate (brining merit to the PI) and also importantly, they are temporary positions - you don\u2019t need to deal with labour issues which can arise from permanent contracts. Also, most of these PhDs will graduate and work outside academia (lack of jobs) and probably in completely different fields - which is seen as normal here (perspective of an European country)",

Also I had never tried anything else than academia, so I was terrified from the world outside...\n\n4) Sunk cost fallacy - I had spend 5 years in the university, so how could I abandon it?\n\n5) Social pressure - My parents doesnt have any degree, so they were so proud of me being a student, and later being me an academic... also my friends did some pressure: \"Dont be stupid, it is one in the lifetime opportunity!\"\n\n6) \"Romance\" - I had that stup*d crush on one girl at the university, so I wanted to be near her... Obviously it was not ended as I was hoping.\n\n7) Time to make decision - there was no time!
