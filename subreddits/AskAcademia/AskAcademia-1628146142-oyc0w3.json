  "title:": "What would you do if you had a three year postdoc with a high salary, total autonomy and no teaching duties?",
  "text": "I am very lucky in that I have secured a postdoc with a very good salary, and my supervisor will allow me to do whatever I want and live wherever I want. My wife is also undertaking her PhD so I will be stuck in one place, but it is a country we have never been to that seems pretty cool, and that means she will have some flexibility too. Other than that I will have total autonomy. I want to stay in the academic profession but I already have a decent amount of publications so I am not totally under pressure to publish loads. I will also try to take on some teaching I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo i am just wondering what you would do if you were in this situation? Any ambitions or ways to divide your time etc.? travelling? learning other skills? Would it better to just use this opportunity to publish and teach only, and then get something better later on?",

For example, in continental Europe, postdocs are not only more independent, they also have more rights than in the Anglo-Saxon world; e.g. get your own grants. In CS is it common to apply with your research group leader, but in humanities it is normal to do so even without.\n\nRegardless where you are, I would still recommend you to try to gain some experience in writing grant applications. Even if you do not have teaching duties, ask for some.\n\nNow, if I had 3 uninterrupted years, I would probably start a long-term project that will give me both publications and the basis for my research plan for the next job.",

      "text": "I'm an Australian postdoc in a very similar position. My advice: \n\n1.) Publishing is your priority. Lead author preferable.\n\n2.) Try and get a semester or two of teaching work (tutorials/guest lecturing). This can usually be be done in addition to your 1.0 FTE gig through an application to HR. More experience, more money. It's worth keeping in mind that, particularly in places like Australia, research-only positions are going to become increasingly scarce. It's more cost effective for universities to hire split duty academics. A 40/40/20 (teaching/research/admin) role is becoming the norm.\n\n3.) If you can, get on a grant or two. This doesn't have to be as PI of course, but having some money attached to your name will heavily assist with the future job hunt.\n\n4.) Network. The more people you know, the more opportunities you'll have. \n\n5.) Try and keep your eye on long running projects in your field and take note of them. You either want to be on one of these in the future, or make your own. I'm working on an amazing project that has been running since the 90s, which provides seemingly rare job security, and in turn gives me breathing space to prioritise rounding out my skills rather than simply staying afloat. \n\n6.) Try and do a little bit of \"back scratching\" for your university. Things like siting on ethics committees, etc. If you wanna rise the academic ranks, it's important to show that you're willing to be a contributing member to not only your research 'bubble', but also the wider university. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd hey, congrats on the gig! It's a wonderful thing that very few people are fortunate enough to experience. Make the most of it.",

In education, so many studies are bookended around a semester.\n\n* An indepth ethnographic/immersion study/experience where you spend time in a community for an extended period of time collecting data, like what led to Tally's Corner or Black Picket Fences or Snow and Anderson's (1987) Identity Work Among the Homeless.\n\n* Extending dissertation research (perhaps you developed an anxiety instrument) across multiple populations or contexts.\n\nFor a post-doc like that, I'd expect to be in a position, by the end, where I am publishing multiple papers from data collected in years 1-2 well into my TT posiiton, and I would use it to set up a CAREER application and applicable grants. I'd also expect to have former 1-2 significant and productive research groups with both new and established scholars.",

If that's *not* the case (and you are open to CCs, SLACs, public comprehensives, etc.) you should seriously consider finding at least some teaching in the out year(s). At my SLAC we generally wouldn't consider an applicant who had been completely out of the classroom for three years as they'd be competing with candidates with extensive *current* experience.\n\nThe other issue, of course, might well be just keeping yourself motivated and productive.
