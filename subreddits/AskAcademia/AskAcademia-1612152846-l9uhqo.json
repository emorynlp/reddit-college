Personally when I go much beyond that my following day is less productive with lower focus overall. 5 maybe 6 hours is the maximum that I can do sustainably. I do think this is a research specific thing though. Reading technical literature for example is a task that requires a tremendous amount of focus. It\u2019s taxing to do for several hours. Not everyone can relate to that because many job tasks even technical ones are demanding in other ways that do not require quite as much targeted concentration. I used to have 10 hour teaching days and they felt like a break compared to the research intense days.",

It was just because I had gotten better at learning things from scratch. It sounds like your working as diligently as you can so be patient but strict with yourself.

On a great day I've certainly sat down and hammered out 8-10 hours of quality work, but those are once in a blue moon \"in-the-zone\" type days. Probably 1 or 2 of those a year. Definitely not sustainable. I think these kinds of days are easier to sustain where you have a set task in mind with a process in place and the ability to kind of zone into it. I sort of had that in the crunch writing period of my thesis. But when you're actually doing research, and trouble shooting, or balancing an academic load, it's just not achievable - partly because finding the time to zone into a single activity for more than about 4 hours at a time is a complete fantasy most of the time.",

      "text": "Yes! I do! This question was made for me.\n\n\nI have been tracking every minute since the start of my PhD two years ago. Note that my contract states 35 hours a week, and this means 35 hours sitting at my desk available to work. I also started off using the pomodoro technique, but even if I stuck to that religiously, I'd only actually work 5:50 a day. Then you factor in some longer bathroom breaks, chats with coworkers, waiting for meetings to start, etc. and my median work hours per day for the past two years are 4:25. Pretty bad. \n\n\nThat being said, look at my days without pomodoro and it's a pretty wide mix. There were days that I sat at my desk for 7 hours and did 2 hours of work because I was so unmotivated (I should also note that attendance is pretty strict here, otherwise I would have just taken that as a mental health day). There are of course some days that I worked longer. My record is 12:42 one day, doing actual work. That was during a 3-week period where I think I was pulling off 60-70 hours a week before a deadline. Obviously, I did not do pomodoro those weeks. \n\n\nThe bottom line is work the way that's best for you. Sure, pomodoro means that you'll work a little less. But working 4 hours a day with pomodoro is better than 2 hours a day without. Also, don't limit yourself to that system. If your alarm goes off and you don't feel like you need to take a break, do that.\n\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, everyone who doesn't track their time inflates their hours. I have a colleague who complains about working until 10pm or midnight every day. And I guarantee I work more than he does in my 7-hour shift. He might be physically at the office for 11 hours, but I see him at his desk maybe 2 hours before I go home. Some people need to move around a lot and take lots of long breaks, which is okay too, but know when you might need to fix that in order to be productive.\n\n\nEdit: I count everything in my numbers - meetings, grading, etc.",
