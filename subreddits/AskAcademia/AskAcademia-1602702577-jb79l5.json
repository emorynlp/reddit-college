  "title:": "Need help getting over a particularly nasty review :(",
  "text": "Hi there! Thanks in advance for reading my post.\n\nI submitted my first manuscript to a journal in my field sometime in July, and the editor recently got back to me with the decision to reject my paper without an invite to revise and resubmit. Reviewers 1 and 2 raised several points for clarification and very helpful suggestions to reframe the paper. Reviewer 3 was obviously triggered by the paper, and was acrimonious in tone and general attitude toward both myself and the paper..\n\nTo give some context, in my paper I challenged a very established paradigm in my field, that has inspired and continues to inspire many studies. Many researchers, the seasoned and  prominent ones as well as those still making their way up the ladder, are highly invested in this particular paradigm, and are known to react defensively when people challenge its validity. Reviewer 3 was obviously one of them. The cruelest part of their review said that I was \"anti-Science, ignorant, and prone to dishonesty,\" instead of requesting further information about the control conditions as the other two reviewers had (I have a reasonable explanation, and would be open to including the materials as supplementary info but Reviewer 3 jumped straight to the assumption that I was deliberately concealing something that would discredit an alternative model I proposed), and made several snide remarks about \"ignorant people without academic credentials who want to comment on real science\" and how they derived great pleasure in seeing such people shamed within their academic community on Facebook. This is rather frightening, because I wouldn't want to be negatively \"marked\" or maybe boycotted by fellow academics in my field.\n\nI fully acknowledge the limitations of my paper, and agree that the editor was justified in rejecting the paper on grounds of insufficient evidence. I am thankful to Reviewers 1 and 2 for their advice, and moving forward, I will make major changes and improvements to my paper. Yet it has been really hard to shake off Reviewer 3's nasty comments, and my confidence is entirely crushed to the extent that I have serious doubts as to whether I am fit for academia. Also, experiencing firsthand the \"political\" (pertaining to academic politics) nature of my paper and the strong reactions it could incite, I am starting to regret and feel really sorry for my 6 years of work on this topic, and there's also the fear and panic that I wouldn't be able to submit my thesis in time since everything needs reworking... sigh:(",

      "text": "I would suggest revising principally according to the comments from reviewers #1 and #2, and addressing any *substantive* points raised by reviewer #3. Broadly ignore the personal attacks, try to rework the paper to be as good as it can be, and submit it elsewhere.\n\nYou don't *need* to do anything regarding this reviewer, but it would not be out of place to send an email to the editor privately commenting on the abusive nature of Reviewer #3's comments and how poorly they reflect on that journal and the experience of submitting a paper to them. It might go nowhere, or depending on the editor that reviewer may not be invited to review for that journal in the future which hopefully will improve the quality of future reviews by that journal. It's not much, and it won't help you in the short term, but it might be worth doing out of altruism and/or a sense of catharsis if nothing else.\n\nUnfortunately, some people are shitty and academia is not immune to this phenomenon. Try to shrug it off, realize that this is not a unique \"political\" phenomenon to academia (you'll meet shitheads in every field, no exceptions), and keep chugging forward.",

THAT is the kind of behavior that should be \"shamed\" out of academia, politely but firmly. Bullies are not cool anywhere, but I'm always so disheartened to see them in our profession. Questioning an established theory, on the other hand, should always be encouraged. If the theory is right, the questioning will only provide more evidence for it, in the long run.  \n\nGood luck to you!",

Hopefully this motivates you to gather even stronger evidence. Although not everyone in your field will be rude about it, it *will* require a lot to change the field (possibly multiple papers).",

You bastards are wrong, let me show you the truth', it is more along the lines 'let's discuss this and possible implications of this data'. Nope. Similarly, I had two reviewers being supportive, but the third one raised hell. \n\nThe thing is that the area is really small and there are not many experts in this specific thing, so I strongly suspect reviewer 3 was one of the people I challenged in the paper (not personally, but their point of view). And I don't think they reacted like this because they felt challenged - they reacted like I am an amateur who doesn't know even the most basic things.\n\nI now want to submit to a different journal but I feat they'd send to the same person again. \n\nSorry for using your thread to essentially complain about my issues.",

My topic is cross-discipline and while Reviewer 2 has apparent knowledge of area A, he super hates area B, and also my general area and my face and the horse I rode in on. \n\nThe choice to turn tail and submit elsewhere is so tough. I actually submitted the 2nd revision today, fingers crossed.\n\nAnonymous peer review is great until it isn't. OP, these things happen, try not to take it personally.

I\u2019ve heard of people being brutal to the point that it\u2019s offensive in their peer reviews before, so unfortunately this isn\u2019t unheard of (though that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acceptable). If it helps, remember it\u2019s not personal \u2014 even though they levied some very personal accusations towards you. Reviewer #3 clearly had an axe to grind, and your article was submitted to them without your name attached. In no way were they commenting on you as a person or your background. Our work as scholars is very personal so I\u2019m not trying to downplay how much it stings. But try and remind yourself that reviewer 3\u2019s comments weren\u2019t about you. \n\nThe article I\u2019m trying to publish will be my 2nd publication (if it ever finds a home). In all the rejection I\u2019ve faced, I\u2019ve also encountered editors who were supportive and offered me good advice for revisions in turning me down, and sometimes even have recommended other journals to consider. So also try and remind yourself that this experience isn\u2019t indicative of the academy as a whole. There are assholes out there. There are big egos out there. But there\u2019s also supportive people who want to see you succeed as a young scholar. If there\u2019s a faculty member, like your advisor, who you\u2019re close with, you could maybe ask them for advice on revising your paper to make it publishable.\n\nOn the bright side, it sounds like you did get some good feedback from the first two reviewers",

I mean, all sympathy, I know what it's like to be shat on by a bad-faith reviewer, but really, your R#3 was \\*so\\* over-the-top that that will hopefully help you not to take it personally. As  [nuclearslurpee](https://www.reddit.com/user/nuclearslurpee/) said, take what's useful from the reviewers and resubmit. You don't have to rework it completely to suit everything every reviewer says, only reasonable things (otherwise you get these ugly by-committee papers).\n\nJust to drive it home: There are absolute monsters out there, including on \"Facebook academia\". Most people will think that their behaviour reflects on them, not their victims. They might have little hangers-on, but screw them, no?\n\nSomething to mention - I have no idea whether this is wise for you, but people sometimes put their papers on a preprint server. You can get acrimonious responses, sure, but the idea is out there already then, and it's got a dated DOI. Most journals don't consider it prior publication, in my field anyway. If a reviewer is motivated by suppressing that, they've already been bypassed to an extent, even though you want the peer-reviewed publication too of course.",

          "text": "Facebook academia is the worst. A leader in my field and a friend of theirs were making fun of something one of them had to review, very openly, once, suggesting that the person (a grad student) should be thrown out of the field for being white and trying to write about race. Let's imagine, for a moment, if you were that grad student... or even suspected you were. They then were saying how they should find out how to break anonymous peer review to call out this person.\n\nLook, I don't have anywhere near their power in my field, but I can tell you what I have done--I haven't recommended either for any journal since. Not as a reviewer, not as an editor, nothing. Even conferences, if I'm given a chance, receive a screenshot of that nonsense. It is so unprofessional and so awful. One journal I review for does not have blind peer review. Can you imagine if either of these people were allowed to review there? Nope, not happening. Sorry. \n\nIt is likely true that the grad student's take on whatever racial issue they were writing about was not at the depth it needed to be or could be. But quite honestly that is NOT a reason to destroy somebody's career. Jfc. Most of us just teach a lot anyway. If there WAS something so worrying in the paper that it deserved career ruining over (I'm thinking openly writing about abuse of students or something crazy like that) then it should be taken up with the editor of the journal, and then the editor should take it up with the grad program. Fuck Facebook.",

      "text": "This happened a few times with me as well. The first time, it wasn't a full blown article, but a letter, so it was shorter, had few figures, and didn't go much I to the theory. One of the reviewers said it was a waste of their time, the editor, and anyone else, and she was tired of reading things that read like lab reports. Then made some small but valid complaints, told me to read and cite a few papers (guess who was the main author in several of them?), which didn't really have much to do with what I was trying to say. Guess someone can't differentiate between a regular paper and a letter. Yes, I'm still salty. \n\nWell, I second guessed myself too, like you did, but rewrote it, then sent it to another journal. Still a short letter. This time, the first reviewer told me to expand a bit (which I can't really do, I was already way over the limit), but was accepting. But the second reviewer was special. Their review was a six word sentence, that told me to measure something irrelevant. I was quite surprised by *that*, and, mind you, this whole process took months. I emailed the editor responsible, told them I found the reviewer's conduct unprofessional, and requested a third reviewer. I mean, I already had a rejection. And they told me to get lost. At least I tried.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that, unfortunately, these things happen, and, over time, they will become stories to share with friends over coffee and laughter. The only thing we can do is to be better reviewers than them, and hope this attitude spreads.",

I cannot tell you justice will be served, but people\u2019s behavior sometimes comes back to bite them. I have seen discussions of such behavior around promotion meetings and grant reviews and, well, people get dinged to some extent for being assholes. Academia, along with society, is gradually shifting towards not tolerating bad behavior and it\u2019s starting to matter, up and down the ladder. \n\nRemember this feeling when you are writing reviews. I\u2019m not suggesting you would ever write anything so nasty, but the work you are about to logically dissect took someone years of effort. Be kind if you can.",

      "text": "There are dickhead reviewers out there. This also reeks of shit Editor who should never have allowed that review to get back to you.\n\nThis is something your supervisors should ahve given you more guidance on. When submitting a paper which challenges an established paradigm which many rely on you have to expect it to come in for a serious battering, because essentially the work is challenging everything they ahve done in X number of years.\n\nFor this reason it is imperative that such a paper:\n\na) has unquestionable data quality\n\nb) does not over-reach in its conclusions. Do not try to over-sell it. You want the paper to have the air of a cool, calm, dispassionate quiet confidence.\n\nc) You use the 'suggest reviewers' guidance on the journal submission carefully. As this is your first paper your supervisors should ahve given you a heads up here - who should and *should not* be approached for review. In the 15 years I've been publishing I have 2 people I always put on my \"do not send for review\" list, because they are old-guard emeritus who totally reject that any science done in the alst 20 years is any good, and still cling to paradigms and terminology from the 70's and 80's. Their reviews are always poor, and frequently hostile.\n\nPoints a and b above should be especially carefully adhered to if it's your first paper. If you've published a couple of things first and then challenge the paradigm, you at least have a bit of solid ground under your feet. Coming in to a field with no track record and trying to turn the worl upside down is rarely going to go well, unless you have a supervisor on your author list who has highly respected credentials in the field.\n\nFOr the future hold the following in mind. A method we have recently used with a PhD student whose work has turned around how we interpret something was a series of 4 papers over 3 years. Bring the community along with you: The first was a \"huh, look at this cool thing, I wonder why that happened\". THe second was a \"Wow, we've done this in a bunch of different ways. This thing Y seems to happens. This looks different to X that everybody thought was happening...\". Then \"paper 3 - \"Right, we've got this thing nailed down using a whole bunch of new techniques. THis thing Y is definitely happening and it looks like this and has these properties. It should have this effect in nature\", then a 4th paper that goes \"hey, look at all these things we found in the field that look just like this thing we saw. Also, here's all the data from publications across the last 40 years that also all fit our new model - we don't need model X any more\".\n\nBy using this approach every step along the way gets reviewed, and is subject to critique and improvement. Once you get to the final step you have several other peer reviewed works to support your final conclusions, and more likely than not other people will also have used your previous work to develop their own stuff. As a result our PhD student already has about 15 other authors who have published stuff going \"huh, Y looks useful\".",

In the end, you just have to feel sorry for them and be thankful that you have a broader world view.\n\nScience is supposed to be the process of challenging hypotheses, but unfortunately in reality it's easier to just go along with everyone else and copy the big names.\n\nHence, I still don't have a permanent job. I mean, I could literally cobble some data together, do some dodgy statistical analysis and get some famous co-authors on board to make a paper that would be Nature material, but I refuse to do it.",

It\u2019s a small group of people with only a small sample of your research and full of their own biases making a decision about your work in the 45 minutes before they have to catch their train home. \n\nThe nastiness of reviewers and their sometimes arbitrary decisions are a flaw of the process, not a feature!! Reviewers are unpaid and also given far too much power without any checks and balances. But that\u2019s how the game is set up and you have to play it as it\u2019s set forth.
