      "text": "It depends on the school.  I have taught everything form kindergarten to undergrad in Turkey, Canada, and the USA. \n\nTeaching undergrads at mediocre universities in the USA is like teaching high school in Canada or Turkey -- the university actually expects you to keep track of things like attendence, chase kids down if they haven't done assignments, and NEVER socialize with them as if they were adults (cuz in the USA young people can't even drink until they are 21).  I expect that is not the case at better universities in the USA. \n\n\nTeaching undergrads at a good school in Canada (SFU) and all the universities I taught at in Turkey, you just give them the information and assignments and let them handle it themselves -- they pass or fail given their intelligence or effort and the university doesn't expect you to baby them.",
