So while we should all be grateful and thankful for all the breakthroughs we have achieved because of her, we should also be ashamed by how she was treated. \n\nNot only that, it was not until recent years that we get to know about Henrietta Lacks, the woman behind the HeLa cells that every lab has probably used and handled.",

I think they do need consent to use for research, and they ruled the doctor was supposed to disclose his financial incentives. Thanks for sharing! I'll have to check out the book.",

Three books in my area of expertise I would recommend:\n\n*How Not to be Wrong: the Power of Mathematical Thinking* by Jordan Ellenberg. If your last interaction with mathematics was your high school teacher lying to you about how you\u2019ll use the quadratic equation in your day-to-day life, then I would go as far as to say that this book is a must-read. Mathematics is about thinking, not about numbers, and this book is about his you can think mathematically in everyday life.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read and enjoyed anything by Malcolm Gladwell, you should read *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. It\u2019s a conceptually similar book to much of Gladwells work, combining psychology, behavior science, and economics, but it\u2019s written by a world-renowned Nobel Laureate in economics instead of a journalist who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\n*Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* by Michael Lewis is about the birth of sabermetrics, the use of advanced statistics to make sports decisions. It focuses on the Oakland Athletics, a professional baseball team, who hired statisticians to Identify under-the-radar prospects that other teams were missing. Despite having the third lowest budget in the MLB (out of 30) and spending the 90s losing more games than they won, the Athletics put together a string of impressive seasons making the playoffs in 5 out of 7 seasons from 2000 to 2006.",

The way I understand Gladwell though (also from his later justifications) is not that he thinks that it's about bootstraps, but rather than conditions that allow people to put in that practice are so important (see the example of Bill Gates' early access to computers). The problem is that that part of the argument is easily forgotten about - and then you'll end up with chiding people for not having put in the work to achieve mastery.\n\nThat's not to say that hard work is futile - you're almost certainly bound to get better at whatever you are practising (although you are unlikely to make gains in other domains - skills do not tend to transfer). But you won't be guaranteed to reach mastery just because you put in 10,000 hours - and somebody else might make it in 3,000. And even with perfect social policies, there would be differences in what people can achieve.
