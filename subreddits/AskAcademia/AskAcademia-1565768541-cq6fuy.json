Having experienced the confusion and second guessing of being a student and trying to figure out what to call someone, I think it's actually important that those of us in positions of power are consistent on signing off messages as we want to be called. Otherwise, students are left playing a guessing game, trying to read between the lines of our whims ('oh, this signature means something for 4th years, but ignore it for 1st years, to use your example')... which isn't terribly fair.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Profs and staff need to be more consistent signing emails how they want to be called versus expecting students to divine it. In turn, it's reasonable to expect to be shown the respect of using the title you request... just not to force someone to guess it.",

                  "text": "I think there are two elements of \"fairness\" here, though I intentionally chose 'fair' over 'ethical' or 'moral,' because I'm not convinced it rises to those latter levels of significance.\n\nOne 'fairness' element is to do with hidden curriculum. As we increasingly attempt to reach students who don't have academic parents and/or social privilege, lots of etiquette can (either intentionally or accidentally) be exclusionary. How to address people is one of those things that we often take for granted, but is actually taught and requires lots of practice for it to be subconscious. As such, the fairness element emerges when privileged students already have this practice, but we expect it - without teaching it - from those with elite upbringings. In other words, I've seen lots of faculty get riled up because of students mis-honorificing them... but that annoyance almost always is disproportionately born by students who aren't malicious in their errors, it's just not second nature to them (as it was to me, growing up in an academic family).\n\nSo, actually, I do think of most etiquette as being inherently 'unfair,' because etiquette - by definition - is a social code known by insiders, used to determine who ought to get social status and acceptance (and who should not!). We ought to be breaking down those kinds of things, not enabling them, because they serve to reinforce privilege... even if in a tiny, minor way. And, in the cases where it serves a purpose (e.g., closing a menu to signal the wait staff we're ready to order, or addressing people with the pronouns or honorifics they request), we should eagerly help to /teach/ it to people, treating errors as learning opportunities rather than annoyances.\n\nThe other element of 'fairness' here is that there's /always/ a power dynamic between faculty and students. For a student that cares about such things, making an error to a professor is much more costly than a professor making an error to a student (i.e., we control their grades!). As such, students deserve clarity about what they're working towards. We give them rubrics on assignments, and it would be unfair to change those rubrics midway through the project. Similarly, if we want them to call us \"Dr. X,\" it's kind of misleading to then sign \"Jenny\" on a bunch of emails: it sends mixed messages, and some students will be really worried about getting this right.\n\nIn other words, I couldn't care less what any given professor wants to be called. Students have a responsibility to learn that, remember that, and execute that throughout the semester if they want to be respectful. But, saying one thing and then giving a different social cue is misleading... and, I'd argue, unfair because it disproportionately affects students who haven't had the advantage of being brought up learning and practicing this, and creates unneeded uncertainty in an asymmetric power relationship.\n\nNow, I do think this is all a pretty silly and tiny thing to get twisted up in knots about. It's not a \"huge\" unfairness in the way that biased grading would be. But, I care about making my classrooms as fair, trusted, egalitarian as I can, so trying to avoid misleading students in a way that might cause stress seems like a very small thing I can do to make their lives easier.",

I'm not suggesting to change your email signature - leave that one always saying Dr. Snowblind Albino, or whatever.\n\nBut, (a) I try to always sign my emails, and (b) there's no meaningful difference between the number of keystrokes or time spent in signing Dr. Kennedon, TRK, or Terry. And, if you really were concerned with that sort of thing, you could set up an autocorrect for each one with an identical number of keystrokes.\n\nThe cost of doing this seems to be about 0, but it saves so much debate, second guessing, and uncertainty for the undergrad who's eating themselves up thinking \"well, Dr. Albino asked to be called Dr. Albino, but now, in our third course together, keeps signing his personal emails to me as Snowblind only... does this mean our relationship has changed to the point where he's comfortable on a first-name basis?\"",

A few students still addressed me as professor, and I immediately insisted on my first name or at most Mr., because I hadn't remotely earned a title of professor or doctor. A few lecturers I've worked with who don't have Ph.D.'s ask to go by professor and I don't like it; meanwhile, some lecturers with Ph.D.'s but no appointment as professor prefer to be addressed as Dr.\n\nSo it boils down to that other comment: students should probably get used to asking, just as profs have been getting used to asking about students' preferred pronouns.",

Literally, professor derives from Latin as a \"person who professes\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.In most systems of academic ranks the word \"Professor\" only refers to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as \"full professor\".  In some countries or institutions, the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor; this is particularly the case in the United States, where the word professor is sometimes used colloquially to refer to anyone in an academic post.  This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among most other academic communities.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

I've never come across anyone in the UK that insisted that they should be referred to by students as Doctor or Professor. I don't like the idea of people trying to lord it over each other with their title. It really makes you seem snooty and unapproachable. Just call them by their first name if they sign off like that. It's their fault if it's 'wrong'.",
