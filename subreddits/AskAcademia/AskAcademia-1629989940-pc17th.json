  "text": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019ve been in touch with a prospective Phd advisor in California whom I seem to have great chemistry with, research wise and personally. \n\nI work in Ecology where you\u2019re often out doing field work close to rural communities. During my past stints as an intern I have had bad experiences working alone in the field in Europe(I\u2019m brown), this also seems to be a problem in the States at least to some extent where ethnic minorities have in instances been made to not feel welcomed in the rural communities they were working close to, or they straight up encountered racist graffiti. \n\nWould it be appropriate to ask him how he would make sure his grad students(of color) feel comfortable working alone in the field? \n\nHe seems like a very progressive and transparent person from our chat and I don\u2019t think he would avoid or think negatively of such a question but I was curious if there was any academic etiquette which would make such a question inappropriate?\n\nThank you",

Not only is this an entirely appropriate question to ask, it is a question that every single university SHOULD have already considered and have a current answer for. I know my graduate school had not considered this topic until a woman of color professor was hired and instituted her own safety protocol for her students in the field. However, it is now being considered by the entire department. Many adjunct-level professors are also required to explain how they would approach protecting students belonging to marginalized groups, including race, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc as part of their interview processes. Usually that would be within a classroom context but it feels appropriate to mention here as well.",

What resources are available to me at x university *when* I encounter this kind of environment in the field at y location. Have you had experience mentoring people who come from \\[insert your demographic\\] encountering this kind of issue and, if so, how did you address it?\" That is plenty for the first email.

          "text": ">What could he possibly do?\n\nPlenty! I firmly disagree that the supervisor has no control of the situation-- a student's safety is their responsibility, and it is reasonable to expect extensive planning and accommodation (\"moving the cosmos\") to ensure this. The topic of safety of marginalized folks during fieldwork has been a very active field of discussion in ecology in recent years, and the potential advisor's familiarity with the topic might be quite telling. For example, Demery and Pipkin (2021, [pdf link](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/media/documents/oexp-science/biological-science/Field-work-safety.pdf)) outline the following actions for supervisors to support vulnerable individuals in the field.\n\nExcerpts from the linked piece:\n\n>\"What can supervisors do to support at-risk individuals?\n\n1. Self-educate on the experience of your team member\u2019s identity, and the corresponding risk that they may encounter in the field...\n2. Contact relevant institutional offices... on how to best manage risk in the field\n3. Create a field risk management plan\n4. Provide materials to clearly identify researchers and their purpose\n5. Have a conversation with all research team members on the risks and preparations to minimize risk.\n6. Create a time and space to talk to research team members specifically about fieldwork safety concerns in advance of the field season, and touch base with them throughout the season\n7. Supervisors that do not share the same identity as their researchers... If researchers bring up potential or experienced risks, validate their experiences and assist in modifying the project so that they can safely continue conducting research.\n8. The scale of risk can increase dramatically in an international field site.\n9. At established field sites, introduce researchers (via e-mail or in-person) to the manager of those locations...\n10. When possible, introduce new researchers to established field locations...\n11. Assist researchers in establishing safe housing before arriving at the field location.\n12. Review and agree upon fieldwork and safety plans with the researcher before any fieldwork begins.\n13. Actively engage with researchers on how to reorganize fieldwork practices if and when there are restrictions on movement...",

The only supposedly actionable item might be preparing a material that will identify the researchers and communicate the purpose effectively. Even then, racists won\u2019t care if you\u2019re a researcher or not. So no, there is no set of safety measures that 100% prevents any foreseeable racial attack, let alone any physical assault. Again, it is not an easy undertaking to figure out whether an attack was racially motivated, so focusing on the racial aspect won\u2019t cut it. From my perspective, getting burglarized by impoverished homeless people is way more likely than getting attacked for being a person of color.\n\nCalifornia is huge and diverse. But even the most pernicious of racists likely won\u2019t have the audacity\u2014unless deranged or mentally ill\u2014to personally attack someone, especially if researchers move en masse. Your needs are best communicated when your advisor can clearly see that you\u2019ve thought about it yourself and when the request is specific. It\u2019s quite rude to ask to think about what they can do for you.",

                  "text": "While the most important aspect of safety to ensure might be safety from physical violence, many racist/exclusionary actions do not manifest as physical attacks but intimidation, use of slurs, microaggressions, exclusionary actions, etc. Establishing your formal role in a physical location (i.e., having a sign indicating that you belong there, and redirecting any queries towards a supervisor) legitimizes a researcher and reduces the chances that, e.g., a passing racist assumes ill intentions on the part of the researcher. There are also several  specific suggestions in the above list-- check out the paper for an unabbreviated version.\n\nI agree that, as in all things in an interview, the appropriate phrasing will go a long way. I do not agree that it is rude to ask, and would consider it a good sign of engagement from a potential student who is concerned about their safety and that of their peers. If a would-be advisor found it a rude question (\"what am \\*\\*I\\*\\* supposed to do to prevent someone from assaulting you?\") instead of a challenging question (\"well we follow the principles outlined in this NEE paper and seek to minimize risks\"), I would consider it a huge red flag. Also-- isn't an interview with a prospective advisor sort of about what they can do for you? A prospective student should come away from such an interaction with an in-depth understanding of the mutual expectations in an advisor-advisee relationship including funding, health insurance, mentorship style and engagements, support for x years, opportunities for collaborations, networking, etc.",

It would be understandable if the request was to ensure inclusivity and diversity in the department/lab/team because the advisor gets to set the tone or at least have a say in how *they* approach these matters. But a random person out on the street? No matter how you spin it, unfortunately not even the US President has the right or power to regulate their behaviors.\n\nEngaging the local police is a bit different. The point is that the request/query needs to be specific enough. Otherwise, it would only sound like a passive aggressive ask to root out all existing microaggressions\u2014which is inherently determined subjectively and therefore whose definition varies person to person. If the question is ill-defined, no advisor can solve it for you. If the question regards a broad range of human behaviors that don\u2019t necessarily escalate to physical altercation, then it can come off as asking the advisor to be a superhuman.

Most of them are about familiarizing the researcher with the field location (9-11). But it is basically impossible to do this in even a slightly comprehensive way unless you're doing fieldwork in an extremely isolated location, with perhaps a few dozen people you know quite well. I've known some people working in such a situation (small teams in the arctic), and perhaps that is the OP's situation, but it seems fairly rare.  \n\n\nI don't have any solutions myself. The OP's questions seems *extremely* hard to answer to me. I don't do work in smaller/isolated locations myself these days, but I certainly did when I was younger and certainly experienced some pretty explicit racism (including slurs several times and assault once, though strangely enough never graffiti). I didn't know how to stop it then, and I certainly don't know how to stop it at a remove for my students. I can't imagine how any of suggestions (9-11) would have made any difference.  \n\n\nI know it is easier to complain than to fix things, but I don't think it makes any sense to pretend that you can make much of a dent in these things with the resources that a typical PI commands. Damage mitigation seems like the best thing you can do, and I don't think these are terrible suggestions to that end. In particular, I like all of the suggestions along the lines of \"let people adjust their project when they run into something they dislike; make it easy for students to tell you, and don't assume that the student has misinterpreted actions that they see as hostile.\" Unfortunately, it is hard to actually do any of that until something at least a little bad has happened...",

Brown people aren\u2019t the major minority group in the US so we get a level of privilege that we do not get in European countries. If op was black that would be a different convo that I personally can\u2019t speak on but brown people do not live the black experience therefore racism towards black people cannot be equated/compared to brown people, even in red states. \n\nUK and France are probably the worst for brown people, but I\u2019ve had some  bad experiences in Belgium, Amsterdam, and Switzerland. Actual hate crimes are a concern in UK and France but in general, there is a lack of knowledge on implicit racism among European liberals that will expose OP to a bunch of micro aggressions and blatantly ignorant comments in the workplace specifically among colleagues who do not think they are racist. I suggest OP read up on what is occurring between the French government and UNEF (college student Union) because those articles perfectly sum up the outdated understanding of racism most Europeans (and white people in general) have. The idea of \u201cI\u2019m against racism therefore I can\u2019t possible be racist\u201d is extremely rampant (just as it is in the US) so you can have an issue in addressing hurtful comments but hopefully you have people in your corner to help you out.\n\nI know Americans get a bad rep in Europe but even if I speak a language fluently, I get treated better when I speak English and pull the American card, because that unfortunately gives me a level of privilege and an inch more of respect than people who are just from my country receive, so OP I suggest pulling the American card, especially in rural areas to get better treatment. \n \n@fouvleshmobile my message veered off towards OP, but thank you for replying. My reply was long since I\u2019m wordy, but I hope it didn\u2019t come off as combative and know that I am genuinely open to having a convo with you in the comments of you have any critiques!",
