  "text": "I'm 2 weeks away from my disso deadline after 6 months of patchy online supervision. I've never done literature based research before so I have no idea if I'm doing it right or not and my supervisor isn't a academic so the feedback I get is mainly results based rather than on my writing technique or study design. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a train wreck, I just have low self esteem! And if it was just something I needed to do to pass my masters I would be fine but he wants me to publish it once I'm finished bc it fills lots of gaps in current knowledge. I worry it's going to be the equivalent of a 10 year old wheeling in their baking soda volcano to a Nobel prize convention... \n\nThe thought of the eyes of the world (haha such hopes) on my amateur lil paper held together with sellotape makes me so nervous, what if I've made a huge study design error and I get blacklisted for being a Bad Researcher!?!?!\n\n(Fyi my disso is a literature analysis on whether classic vital signs like tracheal soot and carboxyhaemoglobin are valid in self immolation deaths compared to normal fire deaths)",

      "text": "If he thinks it's paper worthy then you're already ahead of the game. Couple of things though - focus on achieving what you want to achieve and there is no list of who's naughty and nice, you're not getting barred for a bad paper.\n\nYour supervisor wants a paper - that's what's good for them. It's good for you too potentially, if academia is where you see your career headed. However, it's not your priority. Your priority is your dissertation so focus on that and don't worry too much about writing the paper, that comes later.",

              "text": "You're underselling yourself. Working on a new area means breaking new ground and not having much to fall back on. Your findings may seem small or inconsequential but 99.99999% of papers are just incremental knowledge. \n\nIt's a master's dissertation. It's not meant to transform our entire understanding of the field. It's supposed to demonstrate your first almost baby steps into original research.\n\nI did biochemistry and a wise PI once said to me, biochemistry is 1% inspiration, 49% repetition and 50% washing up.",
