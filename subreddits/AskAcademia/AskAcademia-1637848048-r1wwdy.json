  "text": "Simply put: how did you know what you're interested in, and that you were *actually* interested in it? As in, it's not just a whim or a small interest that can change if your situation, or amount of knowledge changes? Especially before even starting grad school (I'm in my senior year right now and it's stressing me out so much more now). What made you all actually feel like you *want* to work in a particular niche part of your main subject area? \n\nI'm in math (particularly, applied), and there's so SO much I haven't even learned yet with regards to both pure and applied math and I'm scared that even if I supposedly like the areas that I'm looking at right now, I don't even know if other stuff that I've never even worked on or studied could be things that I'd like. And I feel like I'm more interested in subject areas of professors whose teaching/classes I liked more. And then after reading what they work on, I found myself gravitating towards those areas but I'm honestly not even sure if that's me actually liking those topics or if it's me just being impressed by my professors \ud83d\ude14",

      "text": "If you haven\u2019t started grad school or a career yet, you will have time to change your mind and follow your developing interests along the way moving forward.\n\nHere are three thoughts:\n\nSome people find it extremely useful to work at least 1-3 years between undergrad and grad school. (I took 10 in between those two degrees, but that\u2019s not for everyone). When you work and apply the things you\u2019ve learned you tend to know pretty quickly what you like, or at least what you don\u2019t like, and what you may want to become qualified to do.\n\nWhen you begin grad school you may have a different type of connection with your professors than you did in undergrad. assuming you went to the same sized school for both. (If you went to a small undergrad your closer connection may be more comparable.) Anyway, as you take more specialized courses, work on projects, read, write, etc., you\u2019ll likely find a true interest, or again eliminate more things you don\u2019t enjoy as much. Your professors can also serve as good sounding boards for your ideas and aspirations. (On that note, if you have two degree choices and you know one team is full of amazing and supportive people and the other is full of discouraging and unorganized people, I personally would go for working with/learning from the better team any day.)\n\nIf you make a decision you don\u2019t like, you can make another decision. It\u2019s okay. My degrees are in three different but \u201crelated\u201d areas, not because I changed my mind or didn\u2019t like the programs (mine were excellent), but because I continued to develop and grow and follow those interests. One of my colleagues stayed in her PhD program longer to add on an additional masters to fulfill her needs and interests. An extra year may have felt like a long time for her, but in the grand scheme of things, it isn\u2019t.  \n\nBest of luck as you enjoy the journey and discover what you love.",

          "text": "Thank you for this super detailed reply \ud83e\udd7a\n\nTaking a gap year would be ideal personally but my family's situation kind of makes me want/need to finish my master's at least in one go so that I can either go onto getting a job or decide to do a PhD right afterwards. Mostly the job but if I'm still interested in academia and research, maybe the PhD route. \n\nAlso yesss, I'm doing a research project and I've noticed that the level of conversation I have with that one professor is a LOT better, and closer than any connections I have with other professors I haven't worked directly with. I'm worried that I'm going down a rabbit hole of taking a lot of specialized courses in one area without exploring others tbh. An example is that I'm interested in differential equations, so until now, I've taken around 4 courses, and I'm taking another DE course next semester. However, that leaves me no space to take other fields and I don't even have the chance to now. I'm really hoping what you say is true. I guess I'll continue to wait and see where my classes and stuff take me, both right now and when I go for my masters at least. Also also yesss, I've heard a LOT about how important it is to have a supportive team to work with. Before, I honestly wouldn't have thought of what difference it made since imo you're just doing your own work but now, I'm genuinely realizing how important it must be. \n\nYour last paragraph is so encouraging, thank you. It definitely makes me feel better. I'm in a pretty competitive university in my country, so usually everyone just seems like they're so pur together and they have all their plans for the future set out by their junior years, and I'm nearing the end of my degree scared about what I'm even going to end up doing, or scared about how I might make a mistake by choosing too quickly. \n\nBut honestly, thank you so much for this, it's really helpful \ud83e\udd7a",

Grad school can be hard and unforgiving, but being intellectually engaging makes it worthwhile. \n\nSecond, if it is primarily the people, then it may be worthwhile to consider what conditions, either in terms of colleagues or in math, that are a good fit for you.

              "text": "Don't mind at all - for me, here's what attracted me to being on the faculty somewhere: making a difference through teaching (which I don't mean idealistically as over half my family has or works in education, ranging from K-20), a set community of colleagues, all with decent pay allowing for a relatively chill/quiet life-style. Research was always kind of interesting, but I always loved learning more. \n\nThroughout grad school , which was two masters in the humanities and one phd in social sciences, I saw more and more phds that were (a) miserable, (b) not getting jobs,  (c) high variance with regard to mentorship from older faculty, and (d) little to no control over where they lived. The market wasn't just tight for jobs, a lot of smart people failed to thrive because no one supports their chances. I got inspired for faculty as an undergrad because the faculty in the department of my major (religious studies) were 100% incredible. Loved each class, the materials, and just had a blast with lessons that I still draw meaning from even today a few decades later. \n\nI ultimately went the administrator route, though I've been able to consistently teach and produce some research. I respect a lot of my colleagues and chill lifestyle unlocked. That said, I now see I could've accomplished my goals in more ways - identifying fields where PhDs are more in demand therefore solving somewhat for b, c, & d above, or working beyond academia in intelligence, hospice, computer science (my original goal when entering college), etc... AKA jobs where you can make a difference with loads of opportunities to continue learning, have relative professional stability, and live a decent life. \n\nAfter I got my PhD, a number of us with doctorates were standing around and sharing war stories from our studies. One administrative support person, who did not have a doctorate, was nearby and asked us if we'd do it all over again if given the chance. A lot of us said, probably not for a variety of reasons. \n\nGiven your interest is in math, there's A LOT of possibilities to consider: the traditional academic route, digging into emergent tech like blockchain or the growing field of data science, exploring effective altruist charities like Give Directly that need mathematicians, etc... \n\nUnsolicited advice: highly recommended networking as much as possible (and people LOVE to talk about themselves, as evidence by my post above), and you'll be fine no matter what path you choose. If you're at a college/university, career centers can help. Alternatively, jump on LinkedIn or Google, research companies/faculty doing shit you find exciting, and cold contact someone. Time cost, minimal. Worst case scenario, no response. Reasonable case scenario, you get 20-30 minutes to chat with someone and learn more about what they are doing,",
