Well....Ok, I can show you lots of data that shows how when not fit correctly they don't perform to the rated standard. However, that doesn't mean they don't work to a degree.

But especially the historians bit. \n\nThe problem is, some people in the field share this misconception. Now, being able to read a wide range of primary sources is nice but it doesn't magically bestow the methodological skills of other disciplines on you. But then those people usually believe themselves to be working without \"theory\" or \"methods\" or any of that new-fangled stuff (the primary sources speak for themselves, you see, and methods are just fads), so this point is inevitably lost on them.\n\n(Latin Philology)",

I remember in my undergrad I read Tacitus\u2019s Germania for fun, and thought I learned so much, and then boy was I surprised when in our junior year methodology class Germania was the big project on the dangers of primary sources without proper methodology. Reading it without understanding methodology would give you a wildly different interpretation from the reality.",
