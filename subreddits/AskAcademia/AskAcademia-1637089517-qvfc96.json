  "text": "I know professors don\u2019t expect anything in return for writing recommendation letters, and a thank you is more than enough for them. But I am the type of person who insists on gifting people who really extended their arms for me, and these professors have done so much for me throughout this process. I am already writing sentimental thank you cards for them, but I want to gift them something too and I need ideas! I want to get them something that they\u2019d really appreciate, it could be something sentimental (again, need ideas) or something that they would really find useful. Can\u2019t be too expensive as I am doing this for 5 professors (2 of which didn\u2019t write letters for me but helped me in other ways). Any help is appreciated!\n\nEDIT: I am no longer a student at this university and they are no longer my professors. I am close with them and have personal relationships with them too.",

I\u2019d have much preferred a nice handwritten note, which doesn\u2019t come with any unintentional tit-for-tat feelings. Also, letters of rec are just part of the job, so profs don\u2019t expect gratuitous thanks for submitting them. If you are going to give a gift anyway, I\u2019d recommend choosing something that doesn\u2019t cost money (a handmade item or baked good, for example).",

Least favorite was lavender bath products (allergic to lavender).",

Also, if you give them a gift, you're risking them thinking that they didn't actually give genuine references and instead only recommended you as a favor.

No one is required to respond to every email they get, but to decide that you are exempt from responding to all emails would be unacceptable. \n\n\nTherefore, if there is something that is within the scope of your job, you should not get extra points or a gift just for doing it.\n\n\nI also think my later point is very relevant here, so I'm going to repeat it. If I gave someone a recommedation and they gave me a gift, I'd be having a conversation with them about why. Did they think that I actually didn't want to recommend them? Did they think I did it as a favor? I'd want to explore why they felt it was appropriate to reward me for something that professors and professionals are expected to do regularly.
