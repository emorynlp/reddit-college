  "title:": "My professor earned his PhD at a much more rigorous school than his current employer. He seems surprised about my class's lack of skills.",
  "text": "Hi, last year I took a machine learning class in my comp sci master's program.  The prof was a younger, fairly recent hire who earned his doctorate at a quite prestigious engineering school.  He is knowledgeable and a good prof, but I couldn't help but notice how deflated he got with our class's abilities.  He has talked many time about complex projects that he had to do as a grad student and then just assigns something much simpler to us.  In most classes, he asks what he thinks are basic questions about stats or linear algebra and is shocked when no one answers them.  When he is helping students with programming assignments, I can see how exasperated he sometimes gets and shocked at the basic problems students are having.  It honestly got depressing - because he clearly knows what level of rigor is needed to properly teach this class.  It also seems like he has to dumb down the material.  It makes me think I'm not getting an accurate picture what you need to know to understand ML.  I got an A and it wasn't very hard, but it also wasn't satisfying as I don't think I really proved anything to myself.\n\nIs this something that occurs often in grad school?  In undergrad, I imagine it occurs less because curricula for classic subjects like (like Calc or Intro Physics) is fairly standardized.  However, in grad school with subjects in fast evolving fields, I imagine the prof has a wide latitude and the quality of education you get will vary widely by institution.",

PhDs don\u2019t often get their first job at an institution as prestigious as the one where they did their degree. \n\nIn fact, because the number of grad programs in a  given field is so much lower than the number of schools where they can be hired to teach, I\u2019d venture to guess that most professors spend their whole careers teaching at schools one or more tiers below their alma mater. \n\nOn top of that, people who get PhDs tend to have been excellent students in undergrad as well, so their grasp of what average students can accomplish isn\u2019t so great to begin with. \n\nA good teacher will adapt to this over time and through experience get a better handle on what can be expected. But it can rough on the students for the first few years. And sometimes they just become bitter, condescending assholes, ie bad teachers.",

What was once a key concept becomes intuitive through years of rigorous studying that becomes second nature. \n\nWhich ultimately means that most phd's can't be expected to be good teachers because they are the outliers due to the way they process information itself.",

If the candidate has lots of teaching experience and evaluations to go off of, that makes it easier, but grad students who are already excellent teachers are few and far between. Usually teaching-oriented universities will ask for a teaching demo, to observe their performance, but a one-off with someone else\u2019s students doesn\u2019t tell you much, except at the far ends of the quality spectrum.\n\n2. It depends on what \u201cworth the money\u201d means to you. Prestigious research universities get students into contact with leaders in their fields and can get them far on name-recognition, etc. But prestigious research universities do not care much about a candidate\u2019s teaching ability\u2014they care about research potential, and those two things don\u2019t always go hand-in-hand. Good research and good teaching both take time to develop, so where you get hired tends to set your priorities. Researchers who don\u2019t care about teaching aren\u2019t bad people, or even bad teachers necessarily... they just spend their time working on publications, etc.",

The modern academic market (perhaps not in CS, but in most other fields) is such that people who want to teach are proactive about getting a lot of teaching experience. Thing is, having 15 IOR stints at Harvard says nothing about that individual's ability to teach at Community College - the average student at each institution is very different. Even people coming out of top programs today, who have a lot of teaching experience, mostly have experience teaching just one type of student - very intelligent and very motivated, and if not, monied and prepared enough that they're capable of a gentleman's C in a challenging course. If they're put in an environment where, say, the average student was a B student at the local public high school who wants the degree to get a generic office support job rather than go to grad school (which is hardly the most challenging student population), they need to heavily adjust both their expectations and their methods.",

Someone who got into a grad school that selects for extraordinary intellectual curiosity, drive, and achievement (I'm making some assumptions here), then internalizes the relevant subjects and their interesting aspects to conduct research and publish it nonstop to enter the academy as a professor, and then spends tens of hours to prepare lectures, with deep immersion in the material, may very well be disappointed with the attention and response of the average grad student with an average level of interest who has a variety of other things to worry about. Plus, it's easy to review problem solving and programming techniques that you're already thoroughly familiar with.\n\nFrom the perspective of the student, this is a good opportunity to stand out and make a fan.",

He had a reputation for being arrogant. And objectively, one couldn't really fault him too much for it. He was a computer science and statistics wiz, basically helped form a lot of techniques used today in a lot of \"big data\" fields. He was constantly disappointed at how little his students knew of coding and statistics.\n\nBut here's the thing: he came into this field of natural sciences AFTER learning all of the stats and comp science. MOST students did the opposite: they had a breadth of knowledge and background in the field that he did not have at that stage in his career, but they were just jumping into the comp side of it because they needed to.\n\nWhen that finally clicked with him, he became an incredibly kind, helpful, and mellow teacher and professor. He's still an objectively brilliant guy so he can now keep up with the other side of things just as well as anyone, but it's because he's had a careers worth of time to do it.

      "text": "TLDR: \nI think there's some validity to your professors high expectations that aren't related to the fact that he came from a rigorous program at a prestigeous school.  But I think he'll eventually adapt.  He certainly sounds like he cares. \n\nI \"tutor\" organic chemistry, chem focused biochem  and a bit of gen chem from time to time.  I struggled real hard with these classes myself, feeling always overwhelmed with the volume of information, all the new patterns I need to pick up and form into concepts, etc.  in fact, I failed organic chem the first year and had to take both parts again.  ironically, I came around to love organic, which is why I started to tutor.  \n\nsomething I noticed once I started tutoring gen chem though: there are a lot of students who really need to go back to algebra and understand algebraic equations and proportions in general.  a lot of gen chem is honestly founded in a solid understanding of that, and I think it horrible that somehow, students taking more advanced classes without getting their basics down. \n\nI'm not saying this is students' fault.  instead I think theres something wrong with the way we teach, or the system itself or something else entirely, such that students are taking classes they're not prepared for and they're clearly incentivized to do well on exams but not necessarily retain that knowledge a year or two later.  something's horribly wrong with our current education paradigm and I think that's what your fresh grad professor is deflated with.  \n\n(I say \"tutor\" here again and again but I really mean \"teach\". there are a lot of lecturers and professors who just can't teach and I basically end up doing this for them.)\n\nIm a strong believer that excellent scientists/researchers are not necessarily excellent teachers/lecturers.\n\nI think the skillsets that make one good at teaching (like some other commentators have mentioned) such as communicating about complex topics to the average student, identifying what students are struggling with, adapting to that, knowing how to motivate students and cultivate curiosity, etc. are not necessary skills for one to have earned a doctorates.  I think teaching and scientific communication are becoming more important than they used to be, but the number of people who are focused on it are only slowly increasing.\n\nI would also add that sometimes these straight a students or teachers pets might just be this way because their source of motivation was to not get beaten at home or to earn respect within their community or something we can't quite fathom.  but it's not always that they were just these perfect, motivated, intelligent beings that came out of the womb and everything was handed to them.",

          "text": "That is interesting.  Now that you mention this, I'm wondering if the prof was sort of settling on this kind of strategy for our class.  So, it was clear from what he said and the type of homeworks that he assigned, that he really wasn't able to teach the course at the level of rigor he believed was required for this particular subject.\n\nI'm wondering if he sort of settled on a solution where he tried to teach to two different audiences.  He made the assignments simple enough so that the average student who would put the work in could get an A and at least get some introductory level of knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn the lectures and reading, he would go into much more technical detail (and I know from talking to most students that they didn't completely understand it.)  However, he had no exams or quizzes, so there was no requirement to demonstrate your understanding at this level.  There were a couple of quite qualified students that did understand the more technical detail and participated more during the lectures.\n\nThen, for the second half of the course, most of our time was spent on a machine learning project of our choosing.  He was very lenient in the type of project we chose.  Some students chose some very technical deep learning projects and some chose much simpler projects.  We were not graded in comparison to other students.  The grade was more relative to whether we met the expectations we set for ourselves when choosing the project.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this strategy though.  I wish he had demanded more from the class.  I know I could have handled harder assignments and it would have helped me know if I were really competent enough to study this field further.  I think there were a bunch of issues beyond his control also.  The class size was too big for the amount of hands on work it would have required had he assigned more complex assignments.  His TA was completely unqualified to assist in ML projects (she had a hard time grading our projects it seems) and was not knowledgeable about the material when I talked to her.  I also think ML is a particularly difficult course to teach.  It requires backgrounds in Linear Alg., Stats, and programming.  The comp sci department didn't have all of those as pre-reqs to the master's program.  So, its just a messy situation all round.",

Generally, they described it as, on average, a bit more skilled overall, but not as good as they expected (more that the increase in reputation didn't match increase in talent).\n\nAs an Australian currently in Oxbridge, I'd say that's laughably wrong.\n\nThere are some differences. In Australia we do much more research intensive degrees and the Masters *thesis* done at Oxbridge is like a child's project at only 50 pages (compared to our 100-150 page monster). But the coursework they have to do alongside that project is so much harder than anything taught in Australia, or even the US. It's taught above the level of what is even typically *available*, with our graduate classes being taught in 3rd year at Oxbridge. My peers can recite mathematical concepts from memory and are generally far more technically adept than I am.\n\nHaving taught Oxbridge students now, I can say that the undergraduates are also a class above anything seen on the Australian continent. Despite precisely **none** of their coursework actually being worth anything in terms of grade, they consistently study for it many hours each day, submit their work on time, and then seek out additional work and tutoring. I was considered the top of my class and the top of my university over at least 20 years, and yet 100% of the students I have now are more talented and knowledgeable than I am.\n\nOf course, they're like any student and there are some who struggle with illness or family problems, and they don't know everything and will get things wrong. But if you expect Oxbridge students to be mature geniuses who never make a single mistake, then you're placing an unrealistic expectation on 19yos. Compared to the general population of undergraduate students, they are harder working than anything I've seen before.\n\nI'm somewhat doubtful about the bullying professors claim because classes here are structured differently and the professors actually don't interact with students. That goes to supervisors/tutors. The professor literally just lectures to the class and that's it. There is no in-semester grading, no office hours.",

While it is normal, acceptable, and good to study full time here since jobs aren't really allowed, that isn't true at most universities, so new arrivals think they're stupid for having to study 5 hours a day.

I'm currently at Oxbridge, and during the first term of my PhD I decided to \"retake\" a course I'd already taken during my ~Masters at a very non-Oxbridge uni (I'm Australian, to counter the above comment). Despite passing that original class with a near 100% (on the UK scale), I wasn't confident and decided to take the **lowest** version of the course possible, which was taught to 3rd years, so not even a graduate version.\n\n... I couldn't do it. I was completely lost within the first lecture at Oxbridge because the mathematical rigour was so far above anything I'd seen before, even in my math major (and this was not a math class, it was physics).\n\nThe problem with Oxbridge is that they steamroll ahead early on. First year there is doing stuff that second or third years attempt at other universities, so by the time you get to their Masters level coursework, it's above even the level of many research scientists. So much so that top US applicants to the Masters here often struggle to *pass*, and almost never excel like some of the Oxbridge students can, because they're behind before they even get here.",

I had a bit of a shock to my system when I moved from the US (where I did all my higher education) back to the UK, even though I taught at a Russell Group uni. Because the terms here are generally shorter, and the students take fewer classes in only three years, something has to go.\n\nSo the gen eds (arts, humanities, social sciences) are the first to go of course. My own view is that they were some of my favourite classes, and did bring a new perspective that helped to round me out (and even led to future research projects). If I were to change something in the US, I would make the ungraded as the workloads shouldn't distract from your main subject.\n\nBut more importantly, in my engineering courses at least, the students really missed out on the mathematical foundations that they would get in the US. Yes, the A-Level (high school) maths/further maths curricula are more rigorous, but linear algebra, PDEs, etc are just not covered in the depth necessary. Additionally, assuming the students have learned these in school is detrimental to international students or students from poorer schools who haven't had the quality of education coming in. There are also physics, chemistry, etc. courses that are missed out.\n\nEventually, I partially reconciled myself as I remembered all the students who struggled through those classes (with great cost) after 5 or 7 tries. Not really. Thinking about it, I haven't really come to terms with it and I'm glad I'm out. I think we're churning out engineers who are missing some basic knowledge and the UK is worse for it.",

      "text": "I remember receiving very similar feedback from students when I became a teaching assistant for the first time. I came from a top engineering school in my undergrad to a good school though not a top one, so my perception of what the average student was capable of, was somewhat different. I no longer receive such feedback on teaching, so I like to think that I adapted my teaching (or my skills came into equilibrium with the standard around me, oops).",

One thing I do is have tons of low value extra credit.  The super motivated students do really difficult problems worth 1-2 points that really go in depth, but the students just there to check a box ignore them and don't complain.",
