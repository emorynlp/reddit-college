  "title:": "Is it a faux pas to email more than one professor in the same department to see if they're taking graduate students? (Liberal Arts)",
  "text": "I decided to post this here and not in r/gradadmissions because it deals with establishing a working relationship in the department. I'm applying to PhD programs in American Studies. At a few of the schools on my list, there is more than one person in the department whose research would be a good fit for my own. Is it okay to email them both and ask if they're taking grad students? Should I email one and then the other after I get a response from the first? Or do I need to just pick one person to contact regardless of the answer I get?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "These general emails will likely get you no responses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProfessors get lots of emails from prospective students, many of whom are just looking for any open position and it shows. I did not email any professors prior to doing applications myself, but I only applied to programs with rotations (molecular biology field). Currently as a professor at a university that only does direct admits, I really look to make sure the student has taken the time to get to know my research a bit, and at least asks an intelligent question about the information that is listed publicly about me. I study genome evolution so pretty much no students will understand the details of my research, but if they show excitement about the broader subject of genetics, especially about any of the species I study, that dramatically increases the likelihood that I'll reply to set up a talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to personalize the messages to each professor in order to show you've read their research summary, and maybe looked at papers (or books in a field like American Studies), and are excited for a potential opportunity to work for them. You can email multiple professors, but do not send the same email to both, this looks bad and it can't contain the personalization aspect I mentioned earlier.",

          "text": "I guess liberal arts is a bit different, because I've had about an 80% success rate in getting responses. (It could be that I'm only writing to people whose work is familiar to me.) That's a good suggestion to make sure the wording isn't identical if I'm reaching out to two people in the same department. Thanks!",
