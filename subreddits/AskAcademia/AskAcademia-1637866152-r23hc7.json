  "text": "I was lucky enough to land a research job straight out of my CS undergrad (2017) and have worked at the same MNC (based out of Japan) since. \n\nInitially I was placed in the team working on algorithms for recommendation systems (mostly machine learning), but my long term interests in health informatics drove me to convince my manager to switch themes. Two strong publications and one company merger later, I was chosen for a transfer to the healthcare/pharma wing of the business last year. Here I gained exposure to some solid, grounded science working with a team of physicists, chemists and biologists on a fairly niche DNA sequencing and cancer diagnosis project.\n\nI have a total of \\~10 publications, all in renowned conferences/journals with 2 as first author (both health informatics), 5 in Recsys (second/third author) and the remainder as third+ author. \n\nIn the last year I got exposed to the kind of project I really want to work in, interdisciplinary and with lots of collaboration. But I do not have any published results in this domain. While my profile clearly displays a long-term interest in healthcare applications of ML, I feel this is too broad and my publications are scattered across 3 somewhat different areas. \n\nI am unsure how this (unconventional?) kind of experience might be viewed by academia, especially in the US, for future PhD positions. In addition, should I present my long-term interests as health informatics which is supported by my publication record or the more recent experience in BioInfo which I think is more promising, but where my skills are unproven?",

      "text": "Just to be sure I understand, you do not have a Ph.D. yet and are thinking of going to grad school now to earn it?\n\nFirst off, if your publication record is like you describe, any grad school would be happy to have you, if they honestly believe they can support the kind of work you want to do.\n\nAs you go into grad school, the kind of research you did in the past doesn\u2019t need to limit what you do in grad school.  You can do whatever you want, if you can get accepted and find a PI to advise you.  And it will probably be easier to make a big switch starting your Ph.D. program than after you finish it.  So I would definitely look to do the thing that you long-term want to do.\n\nOn that note, when you state your research interests, say what you want to do and/or are currently doing, not what you\u2019ve done in the past (if you aren\u2019t interested in continuing to do more of that).\n\nSince what you want to do sounds both very specific, interdisciplinary, and collaborative, be sure you find schools that can support that kind of research. This is a case where a good school that can support your kind of research well would be a better fit than a great, too-ranked school that can\u2019t support you.  So see if they have faculty working in the area or closely related areas, faculty in different departments (whichever are interdisciplinarily relevant) working on related things, and a collaborative research culture (faculty and labs work together and/or work with researchers outside the institution).\n\nThat said, it sounds like you may have some contacts in relevant areas already, so you can and should leverage those for resources, internship opportunities, research collaboration, etc.\n\nAnd when thinking about a research advisor, consider which aspect of your work you\u2019re weakest in or need to still learn the most about - someone who can help you learn and strengthen that side might be a good match (especially considering the experience you already have in certain areas).\n\nAll that said, this is just one person\u2019s opinion, and reading of your situation.  I\u2019ll be as rather as you to hear what others think\u2026. ;)\n\nBest luck!",

          "text": ">ComputerSystemsProf\n\nThank you for taking the time out to write such a detailed response! \n\nYes, I am considering getting a PhD. One of the issues I am worried about is that having worked in Japan all my adult life, my network is limited to just Japanese universities. I did a year of studying abroad at MIT (from my tier-3 Indian undergrad institute) but the professor I worked with sadly passed away two years ago. Then I attended my first conference in late 2019 where I started to form my own network and was excited to continue doing so, but then covid put a stop to those plans. \n\nEssentially I want to return to studying in the West, but am somewhat cutoff from western academic circles.",
