  "text": "A committee member asked me in my Master's defense to confirm whether I brew beer (I did, and it was unrelated to my research), then I had them over a few months later to observe a brewing session.\n\nNot sure if the question was supposed to help me feel relaxed. Up until that point I had been grilled pretty hard and led to a conclusion that my work was meaningless. Still passed, though, so maybe the brewing saved me in the end!",
