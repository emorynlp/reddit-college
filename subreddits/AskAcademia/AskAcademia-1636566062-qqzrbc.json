  "title:": "Many questions... Give me some hope... or crush my dreams, but I need an answer.",
  "text": "I will probably write a long wall of text, so here are some keywords that you can read and see if you will be able to provide me an answer without reading my wall of text: letter of recommandation, research associate, \"bad student\", phd dream, resume, cv, what to do ?.\n\nSo, I recently finished my master's degree in the humanities field, my master's thesis went well and I obtained a \"very good\" mark. I also finished with a \"good\" GPA. My university does not award honours title but with my grade, i would have the most basic one (cum laude ?)... I had started another master's degree prior to that but never finished it even though I obtained 60 ECTS. And prior to that I made my bachelor's degree (in another university). \n\nDuring all this time, and for almost all my life, I was a very lazy, depressed (never in public though), unmotivated individual. I never made anything in highschool, during my bachelor and during my masters in the sense that I did not try really hard to get good grades until the last year of my master's degree where I woke up. During this period of time, I also had side jobs, this means that I finished my Bachelor + Master in quite a long period of time... (7-8 years...) I think I was (and am probably still) suffering from depression, but I used drugs to help me be in a good mood and not think about my lack of motivation for anything (I like A LOT of things, am passionate with almost any subjects but am just not motivated in practicing those things, it is weird). The drug made me very lazy, and I was already lazy but it helped with my mental health so I don't believe that it was that bad. It is bad in the sense that it made me miss a lot of classes in my master's degree, which means that there is only one teacher with whom I built some kind of a \"relationship\" (and by that I mean that he would recognize me in the street and probably stop to talk to me, but we did never speak a lot). He is my master's thesis supervisor, he encouraged me to pursue a phd. \n\nOther than him, I do not know any teachers, and have what I would call a kinda \"bad\" relationships with the teachers I followed many courses with (I was never at their class, never participated, but did my presentation correctly and in a good way). I think one of those teachers could potentially be used as a reference.\n\nI have asked another teacher, and he answered that I could use him, but that he would not have much to say about me since I only went to one seminar with him (it was a seminar with phd's only, i felt shy to participate and didnt do it). But my attitude during my studies led to the fact that I miss a lot of things to be a succesful phd applicants. I do not have a single publication to my name, I do not have any conference, I was not in any of the student associations of my faculty. I was a real lone wolf, that was not aware of the fact that an academic career must be prepared as early as possible.\n\nBut I still want to pursue a phd because I believe that I am made for this, no regular job is interesting for me, I don't want to have to do an unpaid internship with the hopes of it leading me to a job in which I don't like what I do. I feel like a phd is the best for myself and my mental health (and i say this unironically), that I have the abilities to do it as I was able to get a master's even though I did not work a lot for it and missed more classes than I attended. This is not something I'm proud of and the phd would be the occasion for me to enable my full potential and to finally be proud of myself for giving everything I have for a goal. I do not care about the money, the fact that the salary will be shite. I can live a simple life, in a small space, with hobbies that are not too expensive. I also come from a wealthy background, I probably will never have to worry about fulfilling my basic needs, I am from a wealthy country too, in which I could easily get a job just to feed myself. This means that choosing the PHD way does not put me at risk financially. \n\n So here are my many questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Should I still use that teacher that said that he would not have much to write about me as a reference ?\n\n2) When I apply to phd positions and others, should I also use one of my reference from a professional experience ? \n\n3) I saw an ad about a \"research associate\" position that I'm extremely interested to apply for, it said that a phd was a \"plus\" but applicants with only a master were invited too. So questions:\n\n3a) A research associate does not write a thesis, but from my understanding, he participates in research and write papers, can get published, can maybe participate in conferences. This could be an excellent step before applying for phds, am I right ? I believe it could replace all the things I did not do during my master's and would definitely increase my chances to be selected for a phd against other candidates that \"only\" holds a master's degree ?\n\n3b) The deadline is very short, there is 6 days betweeen the day the ad was posted and the deadline, do you think this increases my chances a lot to be taken ? They seem to be in a hurry to find someone.\n\n3c) If anyone has ever been a research associate by holding only a master's, can you tell us a little bit about how it helped you in your later career ?\n\n4) I have a family member who is very succesful in his area in academia. He is the best in my country in his domain. His domain is kinda related to mine. Should I ask him if he is down that I write a paper about the philosophy of \\*his domain\\* (you guessed it, I'm a philosophy student)  ? Maybe he could co-sign it and get me my first publication. We do not share the same family name so no one would notice that I got carried for this publication. His domain is the one I specialize myself within too. \n\n5) Do you guys have some general tips to increase the chances of landing an interview for a phd ? Should we only look at phd vacancies or is it also possible to contact some professors in the area that we plan to work in to see if he would be able to supervise our thesis ?\n\n6) Now that you have read about me, do you believe that pursuing a phd is a good idea for me ? Or should I just try to find a boring job ?\n\nThanks in advance for all your answers, and sorry for the huge text.",

Mine is quite good rated in my domain.\n\nWhat kind of things are the people deciding to hire you looking for in your CV ? How do they decide when they are trying to pick someone with a master since a lot of us dont have anything to input in the many fields of an academic cv ? Is it better to just send a less formal resume that includes a lot of stuff about us ?",

      "text": "Guessing your field and your location from your other posts. My impression is that there are Ph.D. opportunities all over Europe that are looking for people with a particular area of research, and it is kind of hard to predict who will get them. It's not like in the US where 100 people apply for an English Ph.D. at Harvard and a committee accepts the bets all around. Rather, depending on the position specified, there could just be a few applicants that really \"fit\". So in the regard, it might be worth a shot. \n\nAlso, at least at some places / some professors will give a LOT of weight to a writing sample. That can really outweigh recommendations, which in some cases just aren't that helpful. I've sometimes seen Ph.D. applications where the letters were talking mostly about the writing sample, and frankly it did not seem that weird. If you have good grades and did a good thesis, and the prof's only worry is that they don't know you well, I think it is ok. \n\nFor the Humanities, I think Uni. where you got your MA is not so important as long as it is decent. Every decent Uni. will have some good students and even very good Unis have mediocre students.\n\nWhat I would really worry about though is: \n\n1) are *you* prepared to be an academic? Being lazy, etc. makes it very difficult to succeed, since there are way too many people doing Ph.D.'s in the Humanities ein Europe. Unless you are confident that you are in a much better position now that in your BA/MA, I would not do it.\n\n2) What kinds of grades do you have? \"Cum Laude\" doesn't sound like your grades are excellent. I am not sure where you are, but I would not suggest doing a Ph.D. unless you have at least and A- average in your MA (or good reasons why you did not achieve that).\n\nFinally, it would really help to know what country you are in.",

          "text": "Thanks for your answer, so the importance of the criterias to be admitted are different in each university. I will just hope that they give high importance to the thesis. And I agree with you about the specialization part, here the phd's are sometimes very accurate and only a few candidates fits, I hope it is that way and I hope to be able to be taken at the research associate position I'm gonna apply to. \n\nThis would allow me to answer your first question by experimenting what it looks like to work for a phd. I honestly think that I would be motivated and working good. It is a paid position, which changes everything from me because I was always working on the side of my studies. Here, my only job would be to focus on the phd.\n\nFor your second question, my Thesis got the equivalent of a low A and my gpa is a bit under A- (it goes from 0 to 6 here and 5.25 to 5.50 are A-, I have around 5.19).\n\nI think that I really need to provide an outstanding writing sample, because it might be something that is given a lot of weight in my field. They often ask for 4-5 pages. What do you guys advice to do ? Should I write a specific paper of 4-5 pages and use it as a sample or should I just take a part of my thesis and focus on improving the writing to make it outstanding ?",

In the thesis, I developped a positive, original argument helping to solve a problem that I described. I thought about using that as I think they put a lot of value on being able to provide original positive content (by that I mean that it is important for an academic to be able to detect a problem but also to solve it by developing our own theory).  But this argument is taking a bit too much room. I think I will use it and try to make it fit within 5 pages.\n\nDo you know by any chance if it is needed to add a bibliography to the writing sample ? Or is quoting in the footnotes sufficient ?",
