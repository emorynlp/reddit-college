  "text": "I\u2019m a doc student and am planning to attend a fun activity hosted by a department committee at a fair. Those in my cohort (who I have become fast friends with) are going to attend. My husband is lonely after moving thousands of miles to be here with me. We are all meeting at the fairground. Is it \u201cweird\u201d or annoying to bring him along to hang out with my cohort and I? I would of course ask my cohort if it\u2019s okay, but I\u2019m sure they would say \u201cyes\u201d just to be polite.",

Your spouse has made a big sacrifice to support you on this move, do take care to demonstrate your gratitude and support for him too.",

At least the departments I worked at would always ask us for any +1 on Christmas parties and other outgoing activities.

If no, then it is usually not something you should bring a significant other to unless explicitly told that they are welcome. \n\nSo fun outing at the fairground sounds like a yes. Especially if it is a grad-student exclusive event. Whereas \"wine mixer with the Provost in the building atrium\" is a no. \"Department holiday party at the end of the day\" is a \"maybe, unless they explicitly say they are welcome\" (which usually is the case for ours).",
