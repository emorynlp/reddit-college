  "text": "I am about 1 year into a TT position in chemical engineering and I feel so bad about myself. How does anyone have the resilience to stay in this job?\n\nOf course I was rejected by every grant I applied for (5), but it\u2019s more than that. Nothing good happened, EVER. It was incredibly isolating, I worked 24/7, I GAINED 50 lbs (wtf!), one time I didn\u2019t even set foot outside my house for nearly a month, and still nothing but negative feedback. Pretty much only hear bad news, from students and from grants. I don\u2019t understand how other people find within themselves the will to keep working (or to even keep living - seriously). \n\nIt just seems unyieldingly terrible. Everyday I have some experience solidifying what a worthless piece of shit I am, and never does anything good happen.",

I have no advice for you, but know you're not alone in your struggles. \n\nIt's ok to leave your position, especially in your field - industry I would imagine in chem engineering is booming and you'll probably double your salary.\n\nBrighter days ahead, semester's almost over!

If you stay in your position and things eventually go back to normal, the misery or working alone like this will subside as we all get back to actually doing our jobs how we're meant to.

Professors really should prepare phds for a fulfilling carreer in industry, but of course there are plenty of professors who got tenure a couple of decades ago when it was way easier than it is nowadays, and that can't fathom why anyone would want to do anything else.",

      "text": "Dude. I just resigned from my TT position after having a mental meltdown and, frankly, embarrassing myself through it all. I've forgiven myself because there are a lot of resources you can find where people talk all about their misery in academia. \"Academia is Killing My Friends\" tumblr comes to mind. \n\nYou're not alone, but know that its okay to quit if you are not happy. Ultimately, you should be devoting yourself to finding your balance and happiness where you can because that comes first. Academia is inherently miserable, if its not your passion. The general consensus seems to be that when you have a PhD, you pretty much have a number of competitive and transferrable skills to get you into an industry position where you A) make more money, B) have time for work-life balance, and C) aren't slogging through negative BS from every angle. \n\nYour post really resonates with me because I've experienced a lot of what you have. My mental meltdown, and eventual resignation, was a surefire sign that this is not for me and I need to get out. No one will give a fuck if you quit because at the end of the day, its a job. \n\nGo find what works for you and get out if you're miserable. Don't suffer needlessly.",

              "text": "I started my first TT position in Sept 2019. The University offered me a non-negotiable two-month salary advance (~$10,000) that they said I had to pay back over six months, because I couldn't afford to relocate on my own money (no wealth, blah blah, the whole academic shindig). I suffered through that because where this position was, rent was high -- one of the highest in the country, and my wife was struggling to find work. \n\nSix months later, after having my wages cut for that long I couldn't pay off my loans, my credit card, anything and I was trying to file for bankruptcy, and was struggling emotionally. Literally as I was finished paying down this bullshit debt, then the pandemic hit, and my wife lost her job. Stress from that point on is an understatement. \n\nI could keep up with the rent payments, and she could keep up with the bills, but that was about it. Food? On my own. Streaming services? On my own. Yaddah yaddah. Then I got word that I was awarded an NIH LRP, which would have payed down my student loan debt by like half of what I owe ($78k, so divide that by two). Stress, stress, stress. \n\nEventually, we said \"fuck it\" sold all of our biggest items and left and returned to CA where our family was (we were on the east coast) and I was teaching online anyway, so no harm. I planned to resign this year because of all of this loss. I notified my colleague, who then notified the Dean. The Dean was very nice at first and tried her best to get me to come back, but they were essentially offering me the same relocation package that I was given before, more or less. I kept explaining to them that I wasn't sure if I could because of the logistics of it all, and they kept pressuring me to decide whether to stay or quit. \n\nZing! Mental meltdown. I didn't scream at anyone, and I didn't use profanity or anything; but I did \"unprofessionally\" tell this Dean how I felt about the stress I had been put through and that it was basically impossible for me to return. The exchange was heated. Not disrespectful, just heated. She tried including the provost on the e-mail as if to suggest that if I said anything else, I would be fired. But I tendered my resignation and will not be faculty beyond the end of the academic year. \n\nBecause my pay was spread across 12 months instead of 9, I'm expecting a nice 3-month payout at the end of the academic year, and I'm already tailoring my resume on LinkedIn to network for potential jobs where I know I can make more money and be happier that I can have a work life balance, and eventually be able to save up for a home for my wife and quarantine-baby daughter. \n\nMy meltdown was embarrassing, I'll admit, but I said what I needed to -- still don't think they fully grasped where I was coming from; but I needed to just speak that into the universe, even if it fell on deaf ears. I'm confident they don't like me anymore, but IDGAF because I'm not touching academia for the rest of my life. \n\nI'd rather be broke than broken. But I know that I am strongly qualified for some high-paying industry jobs with my skillset. All PhDs are. I feel stupid for having slaved through academia the way I did, but I'm back home and I'm focused on the future.",

The flexibility of this career is great and overall I like each task I do, but there are too many of them, and in an under resourced dept, we are all taking on way too much such that everything is devoid of joy. The salary is peanuts and the rewards are perverse. Just because you got here doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it long term unless things get dramatically better in the next 2 years.

You\u2019re not alone and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Take care of yourself and know it\u2019s okay to leave for a healthier life. The academy will never love us back.

It wasn't until year 4 that proposal traction was gained and landed a CAREER.  \n\nI'm happy to have a distanced coffee chat to maybe vent or strategize some good habits! Feel free to reach out",

              "text": "Right now I expect things to improve substantially in terms of COVID in *most* places but I'm concerned that red-state craziness (dropping mask mandates, not requiring vaccinations, anti-vax populations, etc. etc.) may mean variants continue to spread and the COVID threat will be with us for years in some hot spots. Those will of course spill over as well, and vaccine exhaustion could set in if people are required to get boosters every 6-12 months. Plus none of the vaccines are 100% effective at *preventing* COVID, so we could see students/faculty/staff sidelined by infection for years to come even if it isn't something that requires hospitalization.\n\nCOVID aside, the demographic cliff is looming as well, and the past three semesters have been a sort of economic trial-by-fire for most schools. Five years from now there were undoubtedly be fewer colleges/universities in the US...and ten years from now the losses will be quite significant. If we manage to avoid more years of COVID disruptions most schools should substantially recover but a significant minority will not be able to weather the enrollment downturns and funding challenges to come. \n\nWhat remains to be seen is what lessons admins and boards have learned this past year. I suspect it will be something about \"nimbleness,\" which is code for \"being able to fire faculty at will to balance the budget.\" As a result we're likely to see further erosion of tenure and even more reliance on contingent faculty at all levels. Likely widespread efforts to eliminate \"underperforming\" programs and department as well. But I'd say tenure-track faculty in large or growing departments at most schools will be safe for a couple of decades yet.\n\nIn the short term fall should be a turnaround at most places. Students will be back in person, we'll be teaching normally (mostly), the social aspects of campus like that make the job pleasant will return, etc. There will be some improvements as a result of this experience; already my school is debating what role Zoom will play in future faculty meetings (for example), how we'll handle student/faculty illnesses, and what pedagogies might look like if we keep the best of what we've done this year (like bringing in guest speakers from far away). But the financial impacts of COVID are going to continue to rock many schools...raises will be small, budgets will continue to be cut, and most of us will go on \"doing more with less\" for the foreseeable future.",

      "text": "Im a third year TT, so let me do some big brotherly talk here: you are the most important thing in your career. You must understand that now. You must change your habits, change your ideas, change your approaches, whatever it takes to make things better for you. Nothing is ever worth risking your helth, your happiness and wasting your time. So it is URGENT that you make whatever necessary changes. Perhaps, start with your expectations of the profession. Being a TT assistant professor is a shit position. Compete shit. The balancing act of teaching,  researching,  splitting for grants,  publishing,  getting your lab off the ground, getting good student evaluations,  and having a frikken life is just NOT possible. So do your best. It's good enough.  \n\nThings ive done to live a more plentuful life (Im in a R1, soc sciences, state university):\n\nMy students are the least of my priorities. I teach, grade and hold office hours. I gave slightly higher grades than they deserve to keep them quiet. I have created videos and podcasts so that I can cut my meeting times by half. A lot of the semester is done creating one project so that THEY do the job. They even grade other projects and I only oversee. Make it work for YOU. Oh..also...once every semester cancel class. Let me say it louder CANCEL CLASS. Use that day to catch up. Ask them to read and synthesize, do a video blog or whatever, but CANCEL CLASS. If you have TAs use them. Give them the busy work. Dont exploit them, but use them.\n\nLearn to say \" that sounds like a very interesting opportunity but at the moment I'm working on a few research projects that really are taking up a lot of my time. Since I'm a junior faculty, I'll pass on serving as a member of the soup kitchen committee this time and really get my research if the ground\". Also, \"thanks but I cant commit to that right now\" works. UsE iT!!! \n\nBe strategic w service to the profession. Choose your battles.\n\nWrite.  Write a hell of a lot. Write every day,  three times a week or whatever works for you. Knowing that you're publishing is the best feeling. Join a writing group on campus ir online. Have a plan to publish according to your institution's expectations. If you have grad students, use them. Lit reviews, description of mathods sections, recruiting participants, doing references. Use them.\n\nRegarding grant writing: ask for help. Campus resources, colleagues around the US...if you can, team up and co-write grants. Look around campus.\n\nFinally, back to my first idea: TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Dont get to the point where you dont life yourself physically, professionally or mentally. Exercise, hike, walk, play an instrument, learn something you love, get smashed off your face wvery omce in a while, keep in touch with those who mayter and TALK ABOUT MUNDANE THINGS. Remive your email from your phone. Avoid social media.\n\nOn a much more positive note: life as a TT is SO MUCH BETTER WHEN THERES NO PANDEMIC. you did a good job this last year just by surviving. You're strong for withstanding. Give yourself some credit.",

It's tough, high stress work, and basically my entire cohort for the last few  years has bolted to industry because the working conditions of new academics is simply put, unreasonable.   \nNot sure what the solution is here for you, I'm in no position to give advice, but remember that you're most likely not the problem, the system you're trying to succeed in is.",

If you're struggling with the will to even keep living, please get help.\n\nHave you read [this old article about reconsidering how you consider your time as TT faculty](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/) ? If you're not enjoying the lifestyle and feel like it's consuming your identity, step back and reframe how you treat the job. Even if you \"fail\" to get tenure, you were strong enough to find a TT offer in the first place, so you very likely have an avenue to get a well paying job in industry.",

Sure there are some institutions that do, but its not consistent throughout academia. \n\nIts real cut throat, and a place of privilege. College got closed down, and faculty and admin were trying to cut each other to be apart of a Grad School of Ed. The community came together and pressured the University not too. Now the faculty and admins act as if nothing happened.  \n  \nIMO and experience, Full faculty are the worst. You have some pull and leeway to make an argument, but don't. Just sit by and watch. /rant  \n\nSorry that you're going through that. Higher Ed needs a restructuring.",

The staff were abused (literally) but they stayed and worked incredibly hard 24/7 for shitty pay because working with big cats was their life's dream.\n\nDream jobs often turn into licences to exploit staff, because there are 100 people desperate to take your place. The admins - who are under their own pressures - demand a little bit more from us and give back a little bit less every year, and they do this because we give it. We do that because our subject area is what we live for.\n\nVideo game development is another example. A macho culture has developed there where they're proud of overworking. If you can't put in 80 and 100 hour weeks, if you want to spend time with family, if you start to feel the effects of burn out, then you just weren't meant to be a video game developer. You weren't tough enough for that world. \n\nI think I often see the same sort of attitude in academia. Can I afford to slow down? I'm competing for grants with people for whom their research is their life's purpose. I often see admiration for teachers who burn themselves out for the sake of their students, contempt for teachers who refuse to make personal sacrifices for the job. This can easily turn into blaming teachers for inadequate institutional support.\n\nIt's your decision. If there is some research that you want to bring into the world for the public good and which would not make profit for somebody, then this is still pretty much the only option. But the days of sipping port in ivory towers are long gone.",
