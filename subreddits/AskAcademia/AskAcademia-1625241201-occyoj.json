  "title:": "How important are journal publications, really?",
  "text": "Disclaimer: not trying to come across as arrogant or entitled, just trying to work out where I'm going wrong.\n\nPhD candidate in English lit here (university in the US), I have a question about how much journal articles actually count these days. So here's my issue: I have 3 articles in top journals, and they're decent ones at that - all received glowing reviewers reports, all accepted for publication (though not coming out until late 2021/2022). Nevertheless, when I went on the job market for the first time last year, I had zero success: rejections from every job/postdoc/fellowship, no interviews/requests for more material.\n\nI was kind of surprized by this -- everyone tells me that just one publication is enough to go on the job market with a \"good\" chance of success; one of my peers recently got an R1 job with just 1 article in a top journal. I'm in my 6th year and I have more publications than many junior faculty -- I wasn't expecting a job, but I thought I would at least get some interest (so did my advisor). Obviously I was wrong, but I'd be grateful if anyone has any thoughts on what the situation re publications actually is.\n\nIs it that publications are subject to the law of diminishing returns, ie. you need one but any more after that aren't adding anything? Or does this indicate  that there is something seriously flawed with my dissertation project/how I come across in my application? Or is this simply what a massively over-supplied job market looks like from the ground and I just need to keep plugging away at it? Would getting even more publications help, or should I focus my energies elsewhere?\n\nAny thoughts would be really appreciated.\n\nTO CLARIFY: I'm currently ABD, but when I applied for jobs starting Fall 2021, I said that I would defend by April 2021 (I could have done this, but since I didn't get a job I pushed it forward a year to keep my funding/visa)\n\nUPDATE: I want to say how much I appreciate the responses to this post. I've seen some really vicious anonymous comments on the academic jobs wiki but everyone here has been amazingly kind and helpful. TBH it's restored some of my faith in academia (the people if not the system).",

And, as another poster noted, COVID has made this pool even more ridiculous.\n\nThat said, it may also be worth mentioning that not all institutions have the same mission, and if--for example--your job materials suggest you want a research-focused position, you may not seem as competitive for a teaching-heavy position at a SLAC or CC or the like.\n\nsource: tenured faculty in an English dept.",

      "text": "> I have 3 publications in top journals, and they're decent ones at that - all \"accepted with minor revisions\", glowing reports from reviewers. \n\nThe wording here is confusing. They don't actually count as publications until they are 100% unconditionally accepted. Were all three articles actually accepted when you went on the market?\n\nOther factors regarding the publications:\n\n* How good are the journals? One top-tier publication could be valued more highly than three third-tier publications.\n\n* How similar are your three articles? If they're highly similar, articles 2+ on the same topic have diminishing returns. But if they're *completely* different, your research agenda looks incoherent.\n\n* How hot is your topic? Ceterus paribus, an article on a trendy topic beats one on a boring topic. Also, is your topic controversial? It can hurt you if your topic is too boring *or* too cutting-edge/counter-intuitive/politically-charged.\n\nAre you still ABD? Many schools strongly prefer candidates with degree-in-hand, so your chances improve substantially just by defending. I know this means you have to scramble to keep a roof over your head your first year out...I've been there, and it fucking sucks, but it's definitely a thing. One trick is to defend in December or January, late enough that you miss the deadline for Fall semester graduation (meaning you keep your stipend for the Spring) but early enough to reassure search committees in the Spring that you have defended and it's just a matter of filing the paperwork.\n\nAre you getting interviews? If so, it's probably just bad luck. If not, have a mentor look at your application materials to make sure you're not sabatoging yourself somehow and keep gunning for that top-tier pub.\n\nThere's a thousand other factors, but the bottom line is that the market is capricious and last year's market was especially a dumpster fire. If you're ticking all the boxes but not getting offers, you're not alone and it's not your fault. Actually, if you are doing something wrong, that's the best case scenario, because you can fix it...but it's probably a structural economic problem, not a personal failing.",

You also don't mention teaching experience, which is a red flag. Even R1 schools need faculty who can teach well at many levels: they don't hire on publications alone.\n\nFor context, I've been on a LOT of search committees, and 90% of the time we hired people who had been out 1-5 years, had good teaching experience and a ton of publications, plus something extra (like digital or other skills), AND their research was a great fit for program considerations that weren't in the ad. To give you an idea of the relative benchmark: at my R1 this year a related humanities department hired a very recent PhD, who had defended just a year earlier. They had a CV that looked like a tenured faculty member: 5+ peer-reviewed publications already out, 1 in the top journal in the field, plus dozens of op-eds and other public-facing work, a well-developed digital portfolio of outreach and public projects, and their diss book plus an edited volume under contract and another book underway. And teaching experience everywhere from a state university to a local CC.\n\nBut usually the standards to get a first-round interview aren't nearly as high. Which makes me think this may have been a big barrier for you in the 2020-21 hiring cycle:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm ABD - was planning to defend in April 2022 \n\nMany, many job openings will NOT look at candidates who will still be ABD when the job starts. In my department, if someone is ABD we only consider them as a candidate if their adviser's LOR assures us they will defend within a few months (usually by April of that year, if the job begins the following August.)  Otherwise they are automatically cut from the pool.",

      "text": "To address the latter question, if you are going into a job market in the humanities with three top-journal pubs, you have certainly checked the \"publications\" checkbox that a reviewer is going to be looking for. That doesn't mean more pubs can't help (or would hurt), but it is likely that this is not the part of your overall application that is either weakest or could be radically strengthened through continued effort. I'd focus your energies on other things, things that will separate you out from the herd even more in the next round. What that is for you, I have no idea, but you want differentiators that will make your applications really stand out from the hundreds of others \u2014 stuff that says to a reviewer, \"this person is a unique catch.\"\n\nThings that can be differentiators (just to be a little more helpful) if done very well:\n\n* Unique teaching experiences (create a very innovative course, for example \u2014 something that doesn't look like a standard seminar or lecture)\n\n* Unique publication experiences (outside of academia, for example, but still scholarly-enough)\n\n* Collaborations with other scholars (esp. in other disciplines \u2014 got any friends who are artists, computer programmers, etc., who are willing to do something weird at the intersections of your interests?)\n\n* Unusual research projects/directions (you can afford take risks if you have the baseline covered)\n\nAKA, stuff that makes you look different, and will raise questions in a reviewer or interviewer's mind that they might want to ask you about. This kind of stuff works best if your \"traditional\" academic record is already strong (which it sounds like it is), and can really make you stand out from other people who are also strong in traditional ways.\n\nWhen I was on the market, I would look at my resume and think: what is the place where a bit of effort (e.g., six months-worth of work, not a year or a decade) will make the biggest impact? Another publication, added to an already strong publication list, isn't going to do that, esp. given the time scales it takes to write, submit, review, etc. an academic publication in the humanities. Whatever you do doesn't have to make you famous or anything, but reviewers WILL note if you are \"the person with the podcast\" or \"the person with that cool research website\" or \"the person who is doing that interesting collaboration with the computer scientist and artist\" and so on.",

Don't forget that you (we) are competing with people who have been on the market for many years and have published the whole way.\n\nThere was a TT job in my area last year that was filled with someone who had 10 journal articles, and they were only a couple of years out (I think this person did extensive grad work or even a Ph.D. outside the U.S. and then a Ph.D. in the U.S., so not sure about their timeline). I've also seen positions filled by someone with one or two journal articles but several book reviews in journals and then a few op-eds and book reviews in magazines/newspapers.\n\nMost of those with good postdocs have a few pubs and a very active research agenda. Sometimes those are related to research themes or just luck.\n\nAlso, these things may be important: do you have a five year research plan? A book contract? A second book project in the works? Do you have articles currently under review that show post-Ph.D. independent success with scholarship and an active and progressing research agenda?\n\nThis year was really difficult as I'm sure you know, and you can never really know what sets people apart for certain positions.\n\nAlso, anything that gets over 150 applications will always be a lottery.\n\nGood luck, and I feel your pain.",

If you only have talked about your scholarship and they are expecting you to also teach or mentor at any level, then you won't be seen as a good \"fit\" for the job. Some places are allergic to research snobbishness and some require it, so you may need two application packets and a good guess as to which to send.\n\nAnother way you might not be a good \"fit\" is if you are doing scholarship in the wrong area for that department. Your adviser needs to be hustling on your behalf, contacting colleagues at the institutions you are applying.\n\nYour publication record is outstanding, and I think it is perfectly reasonable to contact one of your rejecting institutions and ask for feedback. Your adviser could help with that as well.\n\nYou are obviously talented and I wish you the best in your searches. Godspeed",

If you don't know how to frame your record and present yourself to a search committee, you will not get a job. \n\nYou must get your materials read by someone who (a) has gotten a TT job in your field in the last 5 years or served on a search committee in your field in the last 5 years, and (b) who will give honest and brutal feedback.\n\nI recommend the Professor is In book -- while some of the fine details are a questionable, I found the overall message very helpful and I learned a lot from it. (I can't vouch for the paid service she provides, and I think her site/blog/etc has turned much more towards criticizing the system than helping people get jobs, which is why I am specifically recommending the book. It was written when she was still fresh out of academia.)\n\nIt's true that there is luck involved, but you need to be sending out materials that can bring you to a point where that luck even matters.",

Or is this simply what a massively over-supplied job market looks like from the ground and I just need to keep plugging away at it?\n\nWithout seeing your applications and how you present yourself, I can't say if you should be doing something different, but it's not a surprise that good candidates struggle to find jobs in the current job market. Rejections for fellowships/jobs are much more common than successes even for highly competitive folk, so it's entirely possible that you're not doing anything wrong and you just need to keep plugging away.  \nOn the issue of publications - I would say there are diminishing returns, but I wouldn't expect it so much when you're talking 1-3 publications. The difference between 1 & 3 at your stage to me is notable, the difference between 29 & 30 at a later stage isn't so much. One thing to bear in mind is that hiring committees will be evaluating what you can contribute to their department (future publications, grants, fit with teaching etc.). They don't gain much from work you've already published at a different institution, so I wouldn't rely on them too much. Previous publications are evidence that you can do high quality work, which is important, but so are your future plans. I've seen candidates hired that didn't have the longest publication list (they weren't the shortest either, mind), but they had grant applications that were well developed and were judged to have a good chance of success.",

I got almost zero response and eventually had to leave academia.\n\nIt's sad to say, but the job market for the humanities has gotten so bad that having a great cv and record of accomplishment isn't enough. It comes down to luck of the draw, being regarded as the right \"fit\" according to the idiosyncrasies of this or that committee.\n\nIf you're just about done w grad school, the best thing you can do is probably just making sure that your application materials match up to the requirements of the job ad as much as possible. This is a buyer's market for labor, and so committees can make very esoteric demands and expect to find someone to fit the bill exactly. You can often find creative ways in your CV / cover letter to demonstrate that you can do and have done whatever the hell they're looking for.",
