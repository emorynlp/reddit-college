  "text": "Just curious how many papers (peer-reviewed journal article) you all finished your PhD with especially from those in neuroscience or the life sciences since it seems to vary so much by field. How many firsts? How many 2nds? Mids? What would you say is a solid number and what number for those students that became PI's? Just trying to figure out a reasonable reach and stretch target for productivity (despite what people say about best-laid plans). Thanks!",

      "text": "I had zero (primate neurobiology in Germany) which isn't uncommon since the deadline our gradschool imposes on us and the time it takes to train two monkeys in our tasks doesn't match up.  \nIn other fields, where experiments usually go faster, that would be more unusual.\n\nI was told by multiple PIs that in their experience it's not necessarily a problem but you should expect to publish a bit more during your postdoc(s) and might be stuck in that phase for a bit longer. This disadvantage even gets a bit smaller if you manage to publish your \"PhD papers\" after you graduated.  \n\nThat said, the process to advance is anyways highly unpredictive and based on luck, so I wouldn't sweat the exact number too much.   \nSome people get lucky and have a lower publication count but get \"that one\" famous paper they can profit on, others outpublish their peers but still never manage to land a position. And some people aren't really above average but still manage to apply to the right position at the right time to become a group leader. After all, you only need to be the best candidate in that single application period to get a job, not outperform anyone who didn't apply. \n\n\nAlso don't forget that similar to \"the one\" paper (which usually isn't the one you thought would take off and their hard to influence) overall quality still can beat quantity. We love to cite \"publish it perish\" as if our career would *only* depend on the exact number but fewer publications of a higher quality still often help more than pushing out a lot of absurd mediocre papers (most obvious if you think in impact factor or citations). It also helps to get people to talk about your work, which is an important factor to be acknowledged by search committees (other than having an amazing pedigree).  \nI even know one postdoc who's interested in many questions and amazing at collaborating that got told by one committee (obviously unofficially) that him publishing in many unrelated fields about many questions shows a lack of commitment and was therefore seen as a negative... It's such an absurd process, where it feels like it's easy to do things wrong and very hard to get everything just exactly right.",

I don't consider non-first author papers so much because in a lot of cases it depends on the size of the lab more than anything else.",

However, at the same time you can study therapist behaviors and other mediating factors, another paper.

I don't do any in-vivo work (just human brain imaging) and my first paper was based off existing data from a cohort study that my supervisor leads. My 2nd author publication is from my honours year research that someone else wrote up because I wasn't that intersted in the topic. My 1st author paper under review was an online study intended as a pilot study for an intervention, but it became clear that the project I was going to use it for wasn't feasible so I got a larger sample and published that alone. Covid just made the original plan impossible.\n\nAll the other papers I'll submit in the new year are using the cohort study data. We still collect data for that study but most of what's being worked on now is using data previous students collected. The biggest pro is not having to wait for data collection to finish. The downside is that the methods aren't necessarily what I would choose but I still have to justify them. I found it much easier to write up the paper for the study I designed because I fully understood why I made the methodological decisions I made (even if in hindsight it could be better). Also the stats was a bitch so my first year felt like a DIY statistics course.",

                      "text": "This differs by field so if you're not in Psychology/Neuroscience this might not apply to you. But in my field first author means you've contributed the most work to the paper. Second author would contribute the second-largest amount of work, etc. The last author in my field is also the senior author, meaning they're usually the head of the lab or project even if they didn't write the paper. \n\nBecause the author order relates to the amount of work contributed, it definitely affects your likelihood of getting into academia. Having first author papers would mean that you're able to do the bulk of the work on the paper. On my 5th-author paper I did not contribute very much. I was involved in the project but any of the other authors easily could have done what I did - so that paper won't mean too much for me in terms of moving forward. \n\nThat said, there's no straightforward points system. If you have a very good paper (high impact factor, lots of citations) that you aren't first author on, that might still give hiring committees a higher view of you compared to other candidates that don't have any papers at that level. But if your first author papers for instance are reliably in lower impact journals than the work that you co-author on, then maybe that will be interpreted negatively because it's probably not your contribution specifically that has made those other papers good. But it's also easier to just count the number of papers than to consider impact, author position, what the papers were about, etc. So I think there would still be a bias towards people with more papers regardless of author position. For grants they might have a scoring system but I don't know what that system is.",

As the other commenter has suggested, you can find much more trustworthy and relevant data yourself by looking at the CVs of recent hires in your field, in the genres of institutions that interest you.  You should do this anyways, if you want to apply for faculty jobs.\n\nOf course, number of papers are only one piece of the puzzle.  Networking and communication skills are vital, but hard to quantify.  A history of achieving (even small) funding is ideal if you want to be competitive.  You'll need to do a postdoc, and that should be in a group/position where you can publish high-impact work while demonstrating a high level of independence and complementing/expanding your existing skills and knowledge.  Teaching experience will probably be necessary, but the expected amount/level really depends on what country you end up applying in.",

      "text": "Experimental Psych PhD - finished with 0 publications, did a terminal Master's and followed with a PhD 3 years later. I worked with two advisors that were on their way out the door, the first retiring and the second moving onto administration. I literally wiped an inch of dust of the lab for the latter during my two years on campus. \n\nFirst publication was sole-author, published independently three months post-graduation. I now have four, total, and two under review. I have mostly spent the last several years ramping up recruitment for my own lab and working on forming solid collaborations and contacts in the state. I have an \"alternate\" research position at a major state university, rather than faculty, and legitimately don't know that I would even be considered for a faculty position anywhere for at least another 3-4 years, since I really need to advance my publication record and grant-writing work. Given all of that, I have had the luck of incredible collaborators and overall positive experiences in work-life balance. Faculty seems out of reach, but also not terribly appealing, given the workload and the likely loss in pay/job security. I think that the expectations for psych faculty are ridiculously high, and have been on several search committees where folks expect 5-6 publications immediately out of grad school. Personally, I don't think that publications should be the sole gatekeeper in determining whether or not someone will make a good faculty member or research contributor, but rather their mentorship record and ability to make connections that are beneficial to the university. Others feel very differently, however.",

I honestly find it confusing to try and understand what is considered \"good enough\" and what isnt, and I think we'd be a little more saner if we stopped thinking too hard about it.\n\nIn my case, my phd was something like computational neuroscience and neuroengineering, with some applied machine learning (I have a mixed background). I had 7 papers when I graduated (6 first author, and usually only 2-3 authors per paper), then 3 first author the next year, 4 papers the year after (one first author, one last author),  etc. etc. I think I'm on track for a faculty position in a few years, but it's honestly too hard to tell.\n\nI'm finding I'm putting out fewer first author papers and more second and last author papers now, but I need to work on some more first authored stuff now to stay competitive. I've just been having more fun solving modeling problems and applying stats and machine learning lately, and haven't been inspired to pursue very original ideas until about a month ago.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing just fine.

If they have fewer publications, they are probably not applying for faculty positions and if they have more, they are probably appilying for more research intensive positions than my university.  But unless you (or the lab) are a machine or data collection is very quick for what you do, getting more than about 3 first authors out during a PhD is a tall order.  How many middle authors you pick up is more of a function of how active a lab you are in and how many other grad students and post-docs you can assist.",

I was tired of the treadmill, so I took one of the Masters level job offers.  In retrospect, another pub or two would have pushed me solid into R1, and I likely should have taken the Postdoc.  But I was tired, my personal life had suffered from a single minded pursuit to the PhD and research, and I was worried I would burn out before I made it. I wanted to have a life.\n\nEdit- if I had waited, I also got a job offer at an R1, but in an undesirable part of the country.  I had already taken a job, so I decided the honorable thing to do was to turn it down, and I really did not want to live in Starkville MS anyway.",
