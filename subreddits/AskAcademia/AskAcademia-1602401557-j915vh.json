  "text": "This is just a rant.\n\nI just received the first round of review for this paper that I submitted to a journal. My paper is about delinquency and the first time around when I submitted it, I got rejected but one of the reviews said that I should include this theory that would enhance my argument. Then, I resubmitted it, and this time, the review said, please get rid of the theory as it is pointless.\n\nI am this close to stating in my \"Response to Reviewers\" that I do not want to listen to you (i.e., the current reviewer) because I took my time to write a thoughtful part of my paper to include the theory BECAUSE of a review from the past and now I need to delete it?\n\nObviously I won't write that in my response. I think I'll just delete it. Hope this paper is published this time around.",

I find it impossible to get in the head of the people writing these reviews sometimes. \n\nJust to be clear to OP, it seems random because it is.\n\nThe initial reviewer probably didn't accept the invitation the second time so a new reviewer was called up. Technically the editor can step in but they may have overlooked the contradictory advice and/or is leaving it up to you to decide. You can certainly say \"a previous reviewer recommended this and I (agree with this recommendation so plan to keep it / agree with the new recommendation to remove it /etc.). I suspect most reviewers don't have an appetite to disagree with each other.",

In my field it takes me about at least 20, and more realistically 30 hours of \"sitting down and doing the work\" to PR a paper. I don't just read them and offer advice, I copy-edit them and offer extensive input.

These continue to cash their massive cheques but rarely teach and are 30 years behind on the literature. They do a tonne of PR (as \"service\") and it is often worthless, unhelpful work. The answer to \"hire more professors\" will not happen, so what's the plan?",

If they're contradictory, that doesn't mean one is right and the other is wrong; it just means that they represent readers from different specialisations, schools of thought, or personal preferences.  It's your job, as a writer, to find a way to balance between them, or pick one and justify your choice.  Think of it like teaching a course with two different student populations in the same room.\n\nIf anything, it's good to get some mixed messages and varying perspectives in your reviews.  It can help you to realize how your paper is being read by different subsets of your audience.  It's better to find that out in review than to publish it as-is and inadvertently alienate an important chunk of your readership because you wrote in a way that didn't serve their needs.",

      "text": "I remember one of the papers I submitted to conference had a situation similar to this. It had received 5 or 6 reviews, and all but one of them were positive with some suggestions on wording/phrasing. The one negative review was like yours, reject with a recommendation that I cite some other piece of work. \n\nWhen I investigated the other work, it was pretty non-relevant to my paper's content. When I checked with my PhD supervisors I was told that this sort of thing happens fairly often, and they had a very strong suspicion as to who the negative reviewer was as they were semi-notorious in our field for doing that sort of thing. As the other reviews were positive they told me to ignore it, so I did, and my paper was later accepted to conference with minor changes to clarify some meanings. \n\nWhile I've been out of academia for a few years now I've got a few questions. The theory that was suggested, was it relevant? Did adding it make sense to your paper? Do you think adding it enhanced your argument? \n\nIf the answer to those questions is no, then you don't need to add it and your response to reviewers section is where you articulate why you feel like it does not need to be added. On the reverse, if you feel like adding it did strengthen your work, then this is also where the response to reviewers section is useful as you can state how you believe adding this theory strengthens your work.",

This theory, that was later added, was related, and adding it helps understand the data from another perspective, but at the same time, the main theory is more than enough to explain the data. \n\nAfter thinking this through, I think I'll delete it.
