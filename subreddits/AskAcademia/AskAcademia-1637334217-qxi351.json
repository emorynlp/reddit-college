  "title:": "AITA for not sharing my pre-published data?",
  "text": "Some backstory. I started a side project my 3rd year in grad school. Now five years later and I'm well into my postdoc and have finally submitted the project (and then submitted some minor revisions). It is back with the editors and awaiting publication. As part of this project, I collected a large amount of data that was partially collected by a citizen science project that I started. This aspect of the project got some minor press coverage about 6 months ago. I am publishing the database as a supplemental file in the article and plan to publish it online as well.\n\nFive days ago, I got an email from an undergrad at a different institution that I have never met or interacted with previously. He asked for the database citing a need for his own research, but there were multiple grammatical errors so it was hard to understand exactly what we wanted. I wrote back a few hours later saying that I was excited he was interested, told him that he could access it with publication, and even offered to send him an email once it is live. \n\nHe didn't like this. He wrote me an email saying that my timeline was unacceptable and he needed it for his work (I assume a class project, given that it is late November) and asked when he would receive it. He cc-ed my department chair as well as another random professor (not my postdoc supervisor). I ignored it - students get angry when they are stressed, and neither professor discussed it with me, so I figured they felt the same. Then he sent a follow-up email addressed to the department chair about my lack of response, which the department chair forwarded to me with a '?'. \n\nThe journal is pretty strict about their own policies so I don't know if I can share it before publication anyway. I also don't think that with holding data until publication from a random stranger is particularly strange or unethical. I'm now super stressed about this situation. Am I in the wrong here or is this a student not respecting boundaries? If so, is it time for an email laying out appropriate tone and expectations when collaborating with a stranger? Or should I just continue to ignore?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the advice. I just spoke to the chair after a lunch presentation. He was assuming I knew the student and was very angry to hear that it was from a random stranger. Since the student emailed him, he has decided to respond and CC me. I feel supported, even if this has taken too much time out of my day.",

It will look better than if you try to lecture them via e-mail and they forward that to others.",

If that random prof isn't at their university, email either their dept chair, or their undergraduate programme lead, etc. This should be easy to identify from the dept website.\n\nStudents behaving like that need to have it explained to them how inappropriate their demands are, and how to communciate professionally. That is a job for their academic staff to pick up.",
