  "title:": "Am I Being Realistic in My Reasons for Pursing a PhD?",
  "text": "I am a librarian in the U.S. with a Masters of Library and Info Science. I love everything about librarianship, and with ten years of experience in the field, I am thinking seriously about pursuing my PhD. I want to pursue it in library science (technically communications and information science with  a focus on library and information science) not to work as an academic. I want to go for it because I love this field and I want to learn more about it and share what I've learned through publishing. I'm not doing it because I think I will make more money. I want to hone my research skills - I work with researchers, and I would enjoy knowing more about the high-level research they do that leads to publishing, which I hope I would get in my grad classes. \n\nAm I being realistic or am I looking at a doctoral degree and the years of crazy work through rose-colored glasses?",

I've mostly enjoyed my PhD experience, too, and am pleased with the doors it's opened up for further career options, but I definitely got into it more for personal interest than professional gain.  If you have the time, interest, and $$, why not?\n\nETA: I did my PhD while working full time, first at a role in my content area, but not related to my studies, and second as a researcher at my university in a tangentially-related area. Both offered tuition reimbursement and waivers, so the financial hit wasn't too large.  I was offered a fellowship and funding, but making the decision to take such a large financial hit gets harder the more established in life you are.",

I'll be able to support myself and my family on the stipend plus 4% withdrawal from the money I have invested. Plus my wife wants to continue working, so we won't even have to use our investments. Financially, it won't be a big deal at all. \nThe part that makes it hard is moving my family across the country for 6 years. My wife doesn't want to leave this area but is willing to. I love the city we live in but there are no PhD options here. My top choice program is in California and we really don't want to live there and have our kids go to school in LA. I wish I could be happy not doing a PhD; I would just work for 5 more years and retire at 35. I just can't see myself feeling fulfilled without making unique contributions to science. It is going to be a rough path, but I feel that I must take it.",

I've met the crazy self motivated learners and they don't believe in formal education. For mere mortals, we can subject ourselves to the niche of academia to get better, but I personally don't see how the grit can be sustained without a significant concrete carrot at the end, or, it being a ticket to getting out of a crappy situation you may be in. People will disagree on that last point, but for some people, goi g back to school is the best way for them to step back from wherever they've found themselves in life and reset their trajectory",

My orientation is more on the theoretical/research aspects of the field, but in my experience of the field your situation and interest is very common and encouraged. \n\nI find that it tends to be a vocational field that attracts people with really diverse interests and backgrounds (information being honestly an overwhelmingly vast concept lol) who still have a fundamentally ethical component to their interest, in that they believe access to information to be a human right and even civic responsibility. LIS faculties tend to be quite professionally oriented, and I know quite a few librarians who have pursued their PhD alongside their work, often enriching their professional and personal experience of this vocation. \n\nSo I absolutely encourage you to explore your options, and while academia always has drawsides and no doubt you'll face some challenges inherent to pursuing a PhD, I think you'll find it to be very much worth it! :) If you'd like to discuss further feel free to message me here.",

The fact that you\u2019re not looking to go on the academic market will actually give you some more freedom. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll continue to work while doing the degree. Keep in mind that some programs expect you to be full-time while a student. So you\u2019ll need to find a program that lets you work while taking classes and dissertating. If you\u2019re looking at unfunded programs\u2014which I think you said you were\u2014they almost certainly won\u2019t care. So the biggest issue for you is going to be making sure that you *can* do the work while also holding down a job. It\u2019ll be a few years of classes, then exams, then your dissertation project. I\u2019ve known people to complete a PhD while working on the side. But it\u2019s difficult. And you really need to have self-discipline. If you think that\u2019s you, then go for it.",

      "text": "So in physics what I've heard over and over, and what my experience as a finishing PhD student agrees on, is:\n\nThe years of PhD will be low pay and high intensity and stress. It almost never makes sense financially speaking, so you should only enter it if you're genuinely interested in the research and are willing to sacrifice more financial stability for it. So from your description, I'd say this is pretty much a hit---you should just consider the magnitude of the financial cost this will have on you.\n\nIn the social sciencies I guess things can be a bit different, since \"low pay\" typically means \"no pay\". So you definitely want to give some thought to:\n\n\\- if your passion will make having high stress coupled with either a student loan or a side-job worthwhile (5 years is a long time!)\n\n\\- what job possibilities you'd have at the end of the PhD. How easy would it be for you to reenter the job market afterwards? (This is typically not discussed much in physics, but might be more relevant to your situation.)\n\n\\- if you were to have to drop out (financial trouble, or just too high pressure, mental health, etc), what would your job outlook be like? (Considering that you'd have been out of the job market for a couple of years.) In the physical sciences I know that this isn't a huge problem, but for us too it's something worth considering in the decision.\n\nSo in summary: I think your reasons are perfect reasons for doing a PhD, but you should consider the stress and the financial sides to it. The professional satisfaction you'll get from research will come at a price, and it's a matter of gauging what that price is for your case and if it's a worthwhile price for you.",

You can do this without the pressure of assignments, comprehensive exams, writing a dissertation, etc.\n\nIf you have broad interests within Lib & Info Sci, then a Ph.D. makes less sense because you'll be forced to narrow your idea down to that one small topic you are to become an \"expert\" in and write your dissertation on.\n\nUnless you are in a job that needs a Ph.D., or unless you want to be an \"academic\" and either teach and do research full time, I think based on what you've said here a Ph.D. might not be for you.\n\nAgain, you can gain the knowledge you see by sending out some friendly emails to the right people, and doing the reading, without all the loneliness and stress that comes with a Ph.D.\n\nThis is, of course, my $.02 and YMMV.\n\nOh yeah, ANYONE thinking about graduate school really should [read this excellent book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-Students/dp/0374524777/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=getting+what+you+came+for&qid=1636479100&qsid=144-6141152-8891114&sr=8-1&sres=0374524777%2CB0821RH9D6%2CB0086P28OW%2C0374523614%2CB07HNMJV57%2C1250223180%2C1250310539%2C0998904147%2CB01EYBGW4S%2C1609580834%2C1612680178%2CB01H2I1N80%2C0143127748%2C0735211299%2C0999676180%2C1401301304&srpt=ABIS_BOOK).  It will help you think about why and where to go (if that is your path).",

          "text": "It\u2019s so interesting to read this response. In my experience on the humanities end, there tends to be a lot of rhetoric about passion and love of the research and the discipline as the \u201cpoint\u201d of the Ph.D., because emphasizing academia as career/vocation isn\u2019t going to work when there are so few jobs to be had, and so few positions that need the credential (a Ph.D. in the humanities) otherwise. I have a lot of ambivalent feelings about that, but just wanted to point to that break in academia\u2019s logic.\n\nAnd yes, one could do the reading and learning on their own, but advisement and guidance from a faculty member could certainly help build a project and help open avenues in other ways. And while a faculty member could do it out of the goodness of their heart and love of research, they will be more inclined if it is part of their documented service load.",

Do your research on the options and doors opened that aren't just going back to the same job function you have now. Stay flexible of course, but especially going into this as a mature student, this exercise will also help you to shape your PhD experience for the best fit, have you seek out the right opportunities and skills, and improve your odds of considering it worthwhile.",
