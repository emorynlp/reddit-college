  "title:": "I feel burnt out but I am scared to quit my job.",
  "text": "I finished my PhD in the summer of 2020, smack dab in the middle of the pandemic. My PhD journey was an extremely stressful one where I was put on sick leave for a burnout twice, got recommended by my doctor to quit, and during which I spent several years in therapy because of a combination of personal and professional issues. Following this I spent six months in limbo as I waited for the wall of paperwork to be cleared on my new research position, all the while worried about making ends meet due to my unemployment benefits being backed up (again, because of the pandemic). In short, I haven\u2019t truly relaxed since 2015. \n\nMy new position started in December and it\u2019s been one disaster after the next. Not only are none of my experiments working, leading me to lose interest and motivation, on a personal level me and my family have been plagued by issues since the fall. I have trouble going to sleep at night but then stay in bed until 10. I am struggling to work up the motivation to go to the lab, do the same experiment for the millionth time without results, and having no idea why it doesn\u2019t work.  Simple tasks are now difficult and require a lot of effort on my part. I\u2019m supposed to be the senior researcher but to me it seems like the PhD students get way more results. I feel like I\u2019m disappointing my boss, I feel stupid and useless and incompetent, and all I want is to take a sabbatical to get away from research and everything that comes with it. However, while we could financially do it, I am terrified of being without a job, even one that I hate.\n\nI would love some perspective or insight. Has anybody made the decision to \u2018get out\u2019 for a while? Was it hard to get back in? What if you were tired of your field and wanted to do something completely different?\n\nINFO : I moved to a different country where I didn\u2019t know anybody or spoke the language for my PhD. I\u2019ve also been extremely isolated for the first couple of years, making it hard to connect with people and make friends. That problem has been solved, though the sense of isolation persists due to my lab situation.\n\nEDIT : Okay, so I made this post and thought I\u2019d get maybe one or two replies... Holy moly, this blew up! A big, heartfelt, COVID - proof thank you to everyone who commented, upvoted, and even awarded, it\u2019s a relief to see I\u2019m not alone with these feelings and to read so much helpful advice. I\u2019m slowly working my way through all the comments, but know that I am super grateful to you all!",

I've been worse financially and worse in health as well. What I realised being down in my luck is nothing matters as long as I got my own internal sense of happiness. Life always goes on unless I'm too stressed to let it. I'm really trying to tell you to separate your work stress, life stress, and your own happiness. Because if you can't, you'll not be successful in overcoming what you just described. Figure out a way to be happy in your current situation so you can get out.",

              "text": "I think you need to figure out what you want and go from there. Preferred location, preferred 40-hour energy+action commitment(aka what *kind* of work do you even like doing? I have a preference for a mix of complex work and repetitive work that requires forward-facing people interaction and deep-diving research/puzzle work.), preferred amount of social-bonding at work, how to social bond outside of work.\n\nGranted I figured this out at a job I am now leaving because WHEW it was definitely a huge hit to my health. So take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm having to re-figure out some of my life too as my partner has a location-anchor that has a very unforgiving commute limit(i.e. their family bitches if we are farther than 10 miles and absolutely will not visit or go to a future wedding if its an hour away), whereas my family is cool with an hour but not three. But our families are two hours apart with no traffic. Which means one of us is losing our regular interactions with our family.  \nSO, sorry, off-topic, but I'm really hoping both you and I focus on what works for us! There's so many new things! New ways to live your life that you'll one day not even recognize this strange unhappy part of your life because you'll have trailblazed a new one! The world is your oyster! So do not feel limits as whatever makes you happy is what is meant to be!",

Then, when the pandemic hit, everything was crazy at first and we all stumbled along.  When fall 2020 rolled around, things were just normalized, Zoom classes, Zoom meetings, working from home, empty campuses, virtual conferences. All of it has made the job I used to love quite loathsome. I am thinking of an exit ramp myself, but I'm also reminding myself that we are in the middle of an insane situation. Once this is over and things *actually* normalize, only then can I truly know if the job does actually suck or working in the pandemic just sucks. I had the taste of pre-pandemic position, you did not, so you might think about what things will look like after that... if you can press on.",

      "text": "First of all, congratulations on completing your PhD. It is an incredible feat considering everything you\u2019ve described. \nI\u2019ve been in a similar situation and I ended up quitting my PhD program after 2 years and left with my MS degree. I was severely depressed and isolated and at that time I felt it was not worth it to continue. I was also living in a foreign country with different cultural norms that I found hard to navigate. I took a leave of absence and spent a few months with family recovering from illness, and then decided to try something different. I went to therapy and really worked on myself. \nSeeing as you\u2019ve already taken time off and it hasn\u2019t helped (I did this too), it seems like you really need a change of environment because returning to the same stressors is not working out. \nI\u2019ve been working in biotech industry and public health since. Having a 9-5 job has does absolute wonders for my physical and mental health and has given me time to get back on my feet and chase more ambitious projects and positions. I am now planning to go back to academia and get my PhD again. \nMy opinion is that if your life is making you so miserable and unhappy, it\u2019s worth exploring other options and opportunities.\nIt\u2019s a bit of hard work yes, you will have to apply, give interviews etc. Even if it\u2019s not a job you love initially, having a job with regular hours, where you can relax when you leave work, can give you the time to think about your next steps. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to take some time off to evaluate, even better. Go to therapy and work on yourself,it can help identify the underlying issues and address them.",

That\u2019s historically how we view science, the lone wolf researcher. But nowadays that\u2019s not the case, being a scientist is just a job too. You don\u2019t have to feel negative every time your experiments fail. Imagine a world where you don\u2019t, would you still be in science? Then that\u2019s your cue to work through the insecurity. Because guess what you take your psychie with you any job you have. But if it really is the work causing this; then leave and find work that is meaningful to you.",

I favor industry simply because my academic experience sucked and my industry experience has been really positive, could have been the opposite just by chance but at least in industry you make more money. If the science doesn't get you out of bed more than 5 days out of 10, don't feel guilty trying something else. You've got stellar creds that could get you a great job somewhere",

      "text": "It sounds like you not only hate your job, but doing your job makes you feel self-doubt and \u201cuseless\u201d as a person. Those are 2 separate and very different things. When people talk about staying in a job they hate, they\u2019re not usually also talking about taking a hit to their self-worth.\n\nWhat about this job depletes your energy and self esteem? Is it that you have to be continuously self-motivated and self-directed (and maybe you\u2019re not so good at that?) Is it that you don\u2019t feel comfortable depending on your colleagues for advice (even though you\u2019re a senior researcher, you\u2019re still junior faculty - if your experiment isn\u2019t working surely there is someone on campus who can help brainstorm that problem with you - that\u2019s the biggest benefit to working at a university)? Maybe the department culture is so toxic, you can\u2019t rely on more experienced faculty for guidance... or maybe you don\u2019t feel confident enough to ask for help. I think these are the types of questions that might tell you whether you\u2019re in the wrong career or the wrong setting. I\u2019d also really think about what drove your anxiety during your degree. Use that experience - which was invaluable - and see what you can learn from it.\n\nI left a job I absolutely loved because of burnout, and came to research. I was a medical social worker. Now I\u2019m doing my PhD and also have a research job full-time. Am I disappointed in myself that I couldn\u2019t make it in the field past a decade?Yes,  I\u2019ve been doing my job for 2 years and I still feel like a sell-out coming to academia.

      "text": "Thanks for sharing this. It's comfortable to know that others are struggling with research life. If there's any indication that we're not alone, it's the sheer number of upvotes.\n\nI am a perfectionist and I often exert unrealistic expectations on myself. These expectations originate from my own thoughts, my advisor, my peers, and my parents, whether these people actually intend to overwhelm me or not. This is how I've been my whole life. I am just now starting to grasp how deeply this affects me physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. \n\nI feel alone at many times because most of my community doesn't understand what I'm going through. Though I know they can still encourage me, I often subconsciously choose to shut them out, because I'm used to independently overcoming my problems.\n\nThe only issue is that now my problems cannot be overcome through my own sheer willpower. The amount of failure in research has left me debilitated by the bondage of legalism and perfectionism.\n\nTo cut to the chase, my faith and community have saved me from going over the edge, so to speak. And it's hard to prioritize those things when it seems like you never have time for anything outside of research. However, having a healthy work-life balance will make you more satisfied and motivated as an individual. Like the age-old saying: work smarter, not harder.\n\nAlso, maintain your vision. Anything that's worth doing is usually hard (or seemingly impossible). See your end goal, and condemn any negative emotions that stand in the way. They are just distractions. You're going to fall down, but you only fail when you stay down. And even when you fail, each day is a new day!\n\nMy last piece of advice (preaching to myself on this one) is to prioritize community. The world is not about me... my life is just part of the bigger picture. When I give up on being the center of the world, like everything hinges on my accomplishments, then that huge burden goes away. This is where my faith has really helped me, which we can get into more if anyone wants.\n\nGood luck and I pray you find peace in your circumstances!",

      "text": "I've been there. I hope this explanation can help. \n\n1. Research intrinsically is on the cusp of novel technology. The reason why your mac book works so well is because it's been redeveloped over and over and refined for decades. However, the research your doing, is the first of its kind, that's why it is extremely fragile. If its robust and its common and works everytime then i'ts not publishable, its not novel. \n2. Lots of publications are biased, trying to replicate something someone else did, with hundreds of the same stars being in alignment is near impossible. I had to do a Western blot once where the postdoc had left 5 years ago and the antibody, wasn't available or in stock anymore. So I had to do test a 6x6 matrix of antibodies, and positive controls for 6 months to get it working again, and found a new antibody that bound to the target, (it costed more than 20K worth of antibodies).   \n3. Even in project management (office management), only 40% of projects are successful. , the research system is based on a Darwinian evolution model, the best results from the best projects win, the poor result poor projects are cut from any funding. Your professor might have this strategy in the back of their mind, but not actually tell people, (no one wants to be stuck with the crappy project). You must therefore have more than one project, to derisk your career risk which is intrinsically attached to it. \n4. If you ever work with IT computers, or in pathology clinics, there are standards, and things call GMP manufacturing codes. These standards are extremely long documents that state and detail all the perfectionist details to make something replicable in a factory (also why all USB devices work in all USB sockets for example). In many research labs, there is no such standards, this is because of point 3. darwininan competition model, they don't care and its too much admin for a single small project. Thus research experiments are in a constant flux of poor documentation, change, new reagents, soft skills, magic potions, magic brands, not to mention dodgy experimental reagents, that are sold as working Quality passed, however they're not actually.   \n\n5. **Solutions:  1. Make huge changes not minor incremental changes to your protocol, minor tweaks don't help.**   \n**2. Invent and complete low risk, rapid turn around projects, where you can quickly determine if the experiment works or not. Publish this work, and boost your ego a little. This can also include small tag along experiments with other peoples projects.**    \n**3. Work on data that can be retrieved and published rather than wetlab worked on. Data analysis, patient data info, bioinformatics etc.** \n\n**I hope this all helps I understand the struggle, read a few books from prominent , scientists (Richard feyman/ Loon shots Safi bacahl etc). Taking a few weeks off. This will help you think clearly and get your head out of tunnel vision.**",

          "text": "Hi! Lots of things have been going on in my personal life. I\u2019m still hanging in there with this job, but I have realised it\u2019s not working for me and I\u2019m taking courses on the side to go down a different path. I have three months left on my contract, they have offered me an extension but while I initially said yes, I am now strongly considering declining to take a few months to myself and deal with some of the non - job related issues, such as my anxiety and frequent panic attacks.\n\nMostly I worry that I F\u2019d up my career or any future job prospects in this area because of this one bad experience, but I try to remain positive and keep telling myself that plenty of people start jobs that turn out to be wrong for them, and they change directions. I think once I actually tell my boss I\u2019m quitting I will feel better. Just got to bite the bullet I think. Thank you for checking in!",
