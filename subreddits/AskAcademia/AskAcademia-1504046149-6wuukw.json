  "text": "Just stop. No one cares, and this ridiculous dick measuring that goes on with people starting their post this way is getting really irritating.\n\nI've seen maybe two posts here where knowing the ranking of a program or university of a poster actually mattered.\n\nOtherwise, it's just pointless.\n\nPractically every poster feels the need to include that he or she is at a top something or other program. You're not all at top programs. If you are-- based on some of the questions you're asking-- I can assume that your top programs are doing a shit job of preparing you for actual positions.\n\nStop.\n\n(**Edit:** to clarify, I'm not saying program and university rankings don't matter at all. They can and do. But I'm saying that the problems detailed in the posts here for the most part in no way are dependent on university rankings.)",

I know that not everyone at ASU has agreed with Crow's specific policies or methods, but I think he's right on about that general sentiment. I am not even sure Harvard is the place you'd want to ape these days; they've got a strong brand, to be sure, and a lot of money, but there are a lot of negatives associated with how they do things as well.)",

The downside of that is fairly obvious. The upside is less obvious: universities (unlike, say, private corporations) are expected to last for centuries, and that creates a different sort of risk profile. The average age of a Fortune 500 company today is something like 15 years, by comparison. The amount of prestige and age of the university in my experience correlates with their conservatism \u2014 the top Ivies are absolutely the hardest ships to change, because they have centuries of \"tradition\" that has, in a broad sense, paid off for them. \n\n(Whereas a place that sees itself as up-and-coming, like where I'm at now, is willing to try just about anything if it thinks it will pay off in the short term.)",

New funding initiatives courtesy Mellon, Ford, or some other big foundation? Yeah, check out which institutions get it. New exploratory collaboration across some universities for some hot new research thingy? Check out which institutions get it.\n\n\"Quality of research, quality of bullshit\" = ALL of this depends on MATERIAL resources. Resources that some universities and departments happen to have more than others. \"Quality of relationships\" = It sure doesn't hurt when half your department is on the editorial boards of half the top journals in the field! Or when they've supervised the dissertations of basically every leading member of the field!\n\nThe nicest, most passionate advisor in a bottom 10 program isn't going to get shit done when it comes to it.\n\nPrestige matters as much as we can all wish it doesn't. Suggesting otherwise is indulging in fanciful denial, which we can ill-afford.\n\n>You have to be honest with yourself.\n\nIndeed.",

Even the library access matters less these days than it used to, because of the internet (although it's still important, it's a lot easier to go to your librarian and be like 'I need this book' and they can get it for you in some form, even at small schools).

It isnt about how good the school is, it is about how good you are at that school that will matter.

My classmates were, simply put, ignorant. I am in reading heavy field (manuscript studies) and there is nothing that can make up for not having read enough background material. I also met some people who were there full time from my country and they admitted getting into that program because, in their words \"it's a lot more expensive, but a lot easier, and I don't want to risk not graduating\" (my country has a 70% dropout rate at uni). \n\nNow when anybody mentions studying at a \"top whatever\" institution, I am very skeptical and sometimes assume they literally bought their degree.
