  "text": "Do you think there are issues with a prof who is leaving a university serving on a search committee to hire someone who they will never work with? It seems like it would be more appropriate if someone who will continue to work at that uni has a say in terms of who is hired, no? And might it give the false impression that applicants might work with them? \n\nWhat do you think? Just wondering if I'm off on my thinking about this.",

      "text": "We had an outgoing faculty member serve in a search committee a few years ago. I genuinely don't understand why this was allowed - everyone knew this person was applying and actively attempting to leave. A search committee can really only be so big, I don't understand giving up a seat to someone who will never work with the new faculty.\n\nIn our case, the person still gave good feedback and carried out all their responsibilities well. There was no bad blood; they were looking to move back to an area where they had more family, and they did it. They were outside the discipline, so it's not like the candidate was going to be looking to collaborate with them and then moved here to find them gone. But I still would rather have had a final member who was actually going to work with the new faculty member.\n\nYou can easily imagine a scenario, though, where an outgoing faculty is seen by the candidate as a potential core collaborator, or the outgoing faculty shared dirty laundry. I wouldn't risk it.",

      "text": "When I was in graduate school or retiring professor sat on the search committee to find a new incoming professor. The whole thing became a disaster because the retiring professor would not accept any applicants that were not a direct replica of his specific research agenda and his theoretical perspective. People who were the most qualified applicants were rejected based on this criteria.",
