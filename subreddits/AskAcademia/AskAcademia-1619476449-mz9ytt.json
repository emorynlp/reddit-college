  "title:": "How to tell if academia is or isn\u2019t for you?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in the first semester of a thesis Master\u2019s in Mechanical Engineering that I started because I struggled to land a job during the pandemic (May 2020 grad). I had no research experience and I think came in with an idealized view of grad school, thinking it\u2019d be manageable because I was successful in undergrad. \n\nNeedless to say I struggled a lot this first semester. Did well in my courses and progressed in the research but I\u2019m extremely unhappy and my mental health has suffered quite a bit because of the stress, uncertainty about career goals, and some personal things as well. I don\u2019t enjoy the research work at all, it seems like torture after taking all the time to stay on top of courses. I\u2019m definitely not that passionate about engineering, I think it\u2019s mainly a career for me rather than a calling. I\u2019m hanging in but everyday is a struggle and I\u2019ve never been this level of anxious/depressed before.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about quitting and doubling my efforts to land a job as things reopen at the tail end of the pandemic to work for awhile to figure out what I do/don\u2019t like. I\u2019m unsure how much of this is just first semester growing pains, and how much is my gut telling me that this isn\u2019t what I want to do right now. I suspect it\u2019s a little of both. Anyone have any similar experiences? I feel like I started grad school with no goals or passion as a backup plan and I\u2019m starting to think it may have been a mistake. Any insight is welcome!",

      "text": "Plenty of good advice in this thread already, some of this is a little redundant but adding my story just in case:\n\n* Job search/job market wise, getting a master's degree is probably worth it. I assume it's a 2-year program? So you're already 25% of the way there. If you definitely hate academia/research then you absolutely do not want to go on for a PhD, but the master's degree will make you more competitive in the job search and give you a starting salary boost. \n* If you're really not passionate about your research project, then you need to have that conversation sooner rather than later to see if you can switch projects/advisors. It might still be possible in your first semester. If you try to switch after a full year in then it might be too late to do without delaying your graduation. These are guesses on my part, you should talk to the relevant people at your school. This is all assuming (as you mentioned in other comments) you want to keep your funding and not drop research altogether.\n* Don't feel bad about it being hard. Grad school hit me in the face like a brick. I thought I was smart as an undergrad because I was good at taking tests. I got to grad school and found out I could not approach open-ended problems on my own. It was hard. I dropped a class for the first time in my life because I had no idea what was going on. I adjusted though, and I think you can too in your second semester, if you take the points above into account. \n* Mechanical engineering is an incredibly versatile degree. Plenty of people get engineering degrees and then go into business/consulting/law etc. You're good at math and solving problems. So if you aren't actually that passionate about the engineering and don't want to design cars/airplanes/robots/whatever, you still have a ton of options.\n\nHope that helps!",

Some people do it out of some intrinsic sense, because they love research or a challenge, some out of an extrinsic goal, e.g. because they want to work in academia or a PhD is a good resume boost for them in industry. Probably most people have a mix of these reasons. And imo it's hard to say anything but \"when you know you know\". I think, as long as you're not doing it because you don't know what else to do or out of some unhealthy notion (like that your mom won't love you if you don't get a PhD), it's fine. Also, not being sure that you want the degree is definitely a red flag and a sign that you should take time to figure out what you want. You can always come back - academia will always be there!",

The first semester is usually one of the hardest for everyone and would be especially so if you didn't know what to expect. Of course it is up to you, but it will probably be a bit easier next term so you may want to stay and see! I don't think a master's in mechanical engineering would ever hurt your career. \n\nHowever if you are going into debt for this and aren't sure then I suggest stepping back for a while until you know what you want.",

      "text": "Start applying for jobs ASAP. If you find a good job, leave. If not, consider sticking it out so that you can a) explain what you were doing for a good chunk of time, and b) become more employable. I wouldn't leave without a job; you have an overall great situation since you are not going into debt and are also gaining a useful degree. You can also consider telling your advisor you hate your research and seeing if there's anything else you can do; many of us have dropped research projects b/c we didn't like them or weren't interested in them and that's nothing to be ashamed of if there's something else you can start working on instead that will still be productive but less torturous.\n\nIf engineering is already a career and not a calling then I don't see how this will be *that* different than a job. It's totally valid to work for work's sake and find your passions out of work\u2014but if that's the case, then you really will have to make your peace with struggling through some aspects of it because they're expected of you. To me it doesn't seem like it matters too much if that aspect is research, or other boring components of an industry job that you may not relish. Grad school is also a good time and place to figure out how to maintain work/life balance. This can vary if your PI is awful, but if they're a nice normal person then this is a good time to learn how to balance your work (which you may not always love) with your life (which may provide you more fulfillment). That is a skill you can take with you beyond your degree. If you're spending too much of your time working this may explain why you are miserable\u2014I'd do my best to stick to 40 hrs a week including both classes and research. If you're doing more, that's probably part of the problem (because you're not getting to do all the other fun things in life!) Of course I'm not in your shoes and don't know just how much you dislike the research vs. boring components of other jobs. But I wouldn't leave without something else lined up.\n\nAs you mention in comments, you are correct\u2014the earlier you leave the better for everyone. So ideally you can secure a job now and dip out. And as others are saying, the first year ANYWHERE new is really tough from a lot of angles. So part of what you are experiencing is probably totally normal and I hazard a guess that if you talk to others in your program you will hear very similar things (at least, that is what always happened when I talked to other students in my program\u2014we were all struggling with pretty much the same thing). That's not to say you should stay, but at least a small portion of it might just be getting used to your new context. I'd guess that most grad students think seriously about quitting at least once in their first year...most of them, probably more than once. And probably also beyond their first year.",

I personally fall in this category.\n\n(c) Graduate with Masters and focus on your engineering career in the industry. \n\nFor context, I entered a Math PhD program initially wanting to pursue research in number theory. I soon realized that I didn\u2019t really enjoy creating theorems in the field and I enjoyed more applied maths, so I tried to approach my suggestion for (a) not (b). After learning that none of my faculty interests aligned with mine, I left my PhD with my Masters and pursued data science.\n\nNow being pretty stable with my career in data science, I am being extra cautious and aware of any research opportunities I find in the industry to feel very rewarding via my ability to contribute. You can find these research opportunities if you ever want to explore the PhD in the future (I am still dabbling but will not commit unless I find a topic that I absolutely love hence why I\u2019m in (b) but not (c) category).

(I am in CS, not sure how your field sees it.) My experience with industry is that the pro of hiring academics is they are smart, but the con is they are motivated by long-term, low output projects instead of doing profitable things for the company. \"Some grad school\" can actually be a sweet spot -- you're smart enough for grad school but have a temperament for \"real\" work. Again, this experience is all through the lens of CS, ymmv.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you're unhappy and your mental health is wrecked, look for something else. It's a big world, and even in shitty COVID times there are opportunities to be had doing other things. The only mistake you can make is to wreck yourself out of \"how will other people think of me\" fears (which you are probably mostly inventing anyway).",

I actually dislike my grad courses entirely but I LOVE research and engaging with my scientific community but I'm set on academia (and my mentors have said I'd do well in it/I remind them of themselves).\n\nSort of in response to the other commenter, I absolutely love my neuroscience and I relish being able to think about it every second of the day and also surround myself with neuroscientist friends. I don't want nor do I expect a normal life or normal working hours; I mostly just want to do whatever it takes to stay in research within reasonable bounds (which may be unreasonable by another person's measure).

I want to fight, because I know I want something big. I'm ready to go bankrupt for an idea, and I'll still be the happiest man ever. The truth is, everything is uncomfortable. Do you really think that the next guy with the 100 patents and a Nobel prize was comfortable during his work? \n\n\nIf you leave academia and go into an organisation where business is the heart, and you have performance goals and points to promote, or an organisation with the model upward or out, you'll suffer, and you'll probably cry yourself to sleep every night. Now, this is for some people and not all. And it sucks being the type of person that wants success more than life. However, an ordinary job with a medium salary will stress you far less and give you room to live. The key word is a medium salary and an ordinary job. Because you can't have both.\n\n\nEven if you're a singer, or a video game streamer(you really have fun doing what you do). If you want to be big in what you do, you'll have to do it enough to the point where you no longer love it. \n\nMy advice is to align your expectations before you act on them.",

      "text": "Honestly, I am still not sure if academia is or isn't for me.\nI am a little bit like you (a perfectionist who struggle). It will be a long one.\n\n I have a M.A. in linguistics and do vividly remember that until March 2020, I loved my field and sort of appreciate my M.A. but my result (of my research) were not what I expected (I actually hate my M.A thesis today, have been hating it since May 2020). I partially blame the Pandemic (I loved the girls from my lab) and my P.A. (She pulled my MA in a way I hate). \n\nI was sure that once I got into my PhD program, I would be happy. And yet, here I am. In two weeks, I will be a drop-out of a PhD in linguistics, because the actual learning experience (we are full on zoom class) is having its toll on me. I am still at the beginning (a year in) and I already hate how my subject has been hijacked by one of my P.A (two directors). I also hate the uncertainty of my field (1 in 2 PhD find a job at the end in linguistics : lower in my specialized field of research because who cares about morphology). So even if I still love my original subject (conceptualizing derivational morphology in a theorical approach), I have left academia. But I still blame in part the pandemic (being stuck in my room has been awful for my mental health), the lab (I had difficulty fitting in), and the university (it wasn't my first time at this specific uni, and everytime, I hated the attitude of student and teachers)\n\nI am still not sure if I am leaving academia for good. I still have an idea for another PhD (related field, in something I have always loved) but right now (well, in September) I am doing a M.A. in a related field to give me access to a job. I am 28, I want to work and be useful to society. My only trick to know will be to take time to evaluate what does not suit you and if it is research itself, there is no wrong in quiting.",

      "text": "I'm not sure if someone else already said this in the pervious comments,  but one of my professors gave me one of the best pieces of advice I have ever received regarding this. And it helped me decide when I was asking the same question. He said to me: Would you talk about your research with your friends at a beer? And would you be excited about sharing it? \n\nThe thing was, I was so frustrated with the whole institution of academia at the time and with the birocracy and the lack of integrity here and there. But even so, I loved what I was researching and I was always enthusiastic to talk about it when someone gave me the chance. \n\nHope this helps a little. And if you don't feel like you're place is there that's alright. I'm sure you'll find that thing that makes you talk for hours, annoying the hell out of people at dinner parties:))) (if you already found that it's wonderful!)",

      "text": "I don\u02bbt think academia is for you. I say this because you said you\u02bbre not that passionate about engineering. Academia tends to be the kind of thing where you\u02bbre always thinking about your research topic or field -- and it energizes you! And that\u02bbs not to say there aren\u02bbt moments (many moments) where you are fed up with or even begin to dislike your research, or feel very overwhelmed and stressed by it. At the end of the day, though, there are people who love it. I\u02bbm a bit of an anomaly though. I\u02bbm in the sixth year of my Ph.D and I\u02bbve had way fewer moments where I\u02bbve wanted to just give up than most people. \n\nThe take away you should take from that is, don\u02bbt do a Ph.D. You don\u02bbt mention you are. I would actually bet that\u02bbs the last thing you want to do right now. Sometimes, though, people think a Ph.D will be different, and it\u02bbs really more of the same -- just more of it.\n\nWhat I can say is that academia not being for you doesn\u02bbt mean that you should drop out of your program. Education isn\u02bbt a waste. I\u02bbm not an engineer, so I don\u02bbt know exactly how valuable a masters degree is in your field, but you do. If you think it will have value and you can tough it out, I\u02bbd say it\u02bbs worth finishing. But if it\u02bbs not going to help at all with finding a job or advancement, and something better comes your way, there is no shame in not finishing your degree.\n\nEven though I said I\u02bbve had fewer moments where I\u02bbve w anted to just give up, I can say I\u02bbve had more moments of wanting to give up on, well, *everything,* if you know what I mean. I\u02bbve really struggled with my mental well being at times. Taking care of yourself is very important. Before I started my Ph.D, I had a job for about half a year after I graduated from my masters that I didn\u02bbt like and felt like was taking absolutely everything out of me. I was so depressed and miserable. If your masters is making you feel that way, where it\u02bbs actually hurting you (I cried so hard in the bathroom at work once I bruised my face), then it isn\u02bbt worth it.",

              "text": "Well, I know one thing for sure: they say not to make a big decision when you're depressed. I would say, don't force yourself to make a decision right away. You're starting to think about it, and have gotten some good responses. It's ok to let them sink in and coagulate and take some time making your decision.\n\nNot related to academia per say other than the fact many academics are in therapy, and you need an advanced degree to be a therapist, but if you aren't seeing a therapist, I'd urge you to strongly considerate. You deserve to be happier than you are now, and they can help.\n\nIf you're being cooped up indoors with no social interaction... that can play a big part in how you're feeling too. Be sure to open your curtains every day so you get sunlight and are at least exposed to that natural cycle of sunrise and sunset. Try and get outdoors every day for a walk. And make sure you're connecting with people. Discord helped me a lot. And when I say that, I don't even mean like, reaching out to people for help per say (though do do that). Personally, I've had bad luck with mental health/wellness discords. So I literally just mean do something where you're interacting with other people for the sake of being social so you're not just alone in your head. This is especially important if you live alone and are single.\n\nDoing things to take care of yourself and elevate your mood and decrease anxiety can seem like it takes up a lot of time that you don't have, but, you actually end up being more productive if you're in good health, and everything else can fall in to place and start to make sense when you do. Especially with getting enough sleep. Sometimes you just wake up and have the answers.",
