  "title:": "Just saw that the research paper I have been working on for a year is published by someone else. Whats should I do?",
  "text": "I have been told to post on this subreddit. Looking for advice on what should be the best course of action and if any one ever faced this issue I would like to learn from their experience.\n\nI have been working on a project and hoping to publish a paper for more then a year. I have been often asking about advice regarding it on a fee subreddits because my uni professors did not had expertise in this field. As a result I made mistake of asking stranger in internet if they could go over my paper and review it since I could not get it reviewed from my uni. I shared the paper with 2 people via email but they are the not the one to publish.\n\nToday I saw someone has it published on Hindawi.com\n\nI am shocked and heartbroken. The paper contains images of my home. It mentions a custom dataset that I never made public and only reside with me. I have pushed this paper to a private github repo before it was submitted here. I also own the overleaf doc on which it was written and it contains history of it. I have also have history of conversation with a researcher on whose method it was inspired from. \n\nI planned to submit my paper to upcoming CVPR. What would be the best course of action for me to take it down and claim ownership? Thank you",

I had my work stolen as well by two separate Chinese labs that came by and took pictures of my poster without my permission and ran away. (Because they forged new data I couldn't do anything about it, the idea was so abstract that literally nobody else in the world should have been working on it, it had never been done before and really off the charts, they somehow did the exact same thing in the same way using the same obscure outcomes, but claimed much larger effects).\n\nStep 2. This might actually be a legal thing that your university might want to step in on. It's going to open a shit storm on you though so be prepared with your good original, date and time stamped notes and history. I would start with your institution, they probably have some designated department for dealing with academic fraud and dishonesty, who would know better what to do.\n\nEdit: hate on me all you want people, China makes up literally about 90-95% of all scientific paper retractions and that's only the ones that get caught. Out of the 7 Chinese papers I have reviewed, literally all of them had forged data, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty. And yes, after finding and pointing these out to the editor they all agreed and rejected the papers. Science is not a game and there is no place for political correctness in this industry.

The bad ones are usually transparent though, because they tout large effects with no variability in a field where the rest of the world has small effects and large variability. I won't back down on my statements. \n\nThe work from Chinese institutions is simply not reproducible in my field. I have learned this the hard way several times. Maybe it's different in other areas, but from where I stand it's a plague in biomedical research. Not to mention that all but 1 time that my institutions have fired people for misconduct it has been Chinese PIs. You can't expect people to ignore these things when it happens so often that we see it with our own eyes.\n\n I for one, am very upset with a country that does little to nothing to stop the academic dishonesty, theft of intellectual property, or prolific cheating across every aspect of life. It doesn't make me hate people of Chinese ethnicity, only a country that allows it's people to negatively affect everyone else.",
