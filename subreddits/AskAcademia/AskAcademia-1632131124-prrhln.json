  "text": " I'm a master student in history, so this year I have to write my master's thesis. I am a bit worried because this is the first major writing assignment (+30.000 words). I have difficulties remembering or organising all the literature I read or find a good note taking system.\n\nFor the thesis, it's the first time I'll have to deal with a lot of primary source material. Since it isn't an easy handwriting (14th century gothic handwriting), transcribing all the records seems almost impossible...\n\nHow do you keep track of all the literature? How do you keep overview of all the information you read and remember which book/article says what for when the writing process starts? How do you deal with a huge amount of primary source material?",

      "text": "I'm an old guy, so when I was in grad school I used 5x7 note cards with key words at the top, then the reference and then notes about the reference below. I card per reference. I kept those in a metal file box.\n\nBut, I'm not a luddite so I keep up with current(ish) technology. I now use Evernote. It's designed for note taking and does a good job of indexing and allowing searches. It does everything you might need it to do, including using handwritten notes, scanned materials and so on. It's cross platform and works well. The version that's not free cost something like $8-9 a month. It's well worth it, in my opinion.\n\nThere are free options, as well. Look at Apple Notes (if you're a Mac person, stop there!), Microsoft OneNote, and Google Keep. Any of those might well meet your needs.",

          "text": "Thanks for your answer! I use Zotero to keep track of my references, but that isn't ideal to take notes in. Especially because my notes can get quite extensive... The system with cards actually doesn't sound bad to me. It would force me to keep my notes practical and easier to use when I write in comparison to a bunch of Word files with a whole summary of the book...",
