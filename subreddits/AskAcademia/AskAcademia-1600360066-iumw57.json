  "text": "Between undergraduate electives and studying energy in graduate school, I've taken 4 different lower/upper level geology courses. Every professor I've had in that subject area has been incredibly nice, cool, and genuine. What's up with this? Is \"being a nice person\" part of the requirements on Geology PhD applications?",

If you are a top cancer researcher or physicist, people get a sense that you are some sort of super genius. Scientists who do care about that glory, even a little, will end up drawn to those fields. However if you are an expert at rocks, nobody is going to look at you like some sort of powerful einstein-like figure. People who are into geology are aware of this but it does not bother them. I believe they are motivated by the sheer joy of rocks. They are not tainted by the evil energy of the other sciences so they can remain completely good.",

Sure, you'll have some professors focused on pure science, but you'll also have some who pretty much exclusively collaborate with industry. Some professors will even run their own startup comanies that spin off from their research. Most will probably fall somewhere in between the extremes, having a mixture of industry collaborations along with more \"pure\" science projects.\n\nI mean, there's clear motivation for it. If you can find an industrial application for the research you want to do, it's typically easier to get funding.

I'm also not \"motivated by the sheer joy of rocks\" and can confirm that we don't get to avoid the other sciences by any means as we have to incorporate aspects of physics, biology, chemistry (and the calculus for each) into our work.  \n\nSure, no one thinks I'm automatically some kind of genius (to be fair, I'm not) because I'm a geologist, but I also don't think people truly think those things about doctors or physicists either.",

But there are some people who *really like* that, and select physics or math as their field solely on the basis that it will make them look like a super genius to non-academics.

They are immersed in the Left versus Right debates and badgered by freshmen who want to know the ultimate truths.  \n\nSome science fields are also also contentious; anything pertaining to climate change has its experts stressed almost daily, seeing the California fires, the melting Greenland ice sheets, and Trump's denials.  Geology is a nice sedate field, it's professors are mostly untroubled by the worries of the world.",

      "text": "OK, UK geology lecturer here.\n\nFirstly, this isn't entirely true - I know a couple of right arseholes. \n\n*However*, on the whole my experience has been that working in a variety of geology departments there is far less drama in the geol depts than others. Geology staff are almost universally helpful toward other geology staff , and issues with things get resolved quickly with little fuss. Very notable is that most of us really enjoy the teaching element too - something which is not often the case in other depts.\n\nI think this stems from a few things:\n\n1. Geology is a field subject. Going out in the field with your students for 20-30 days every year means that you get to know them much better than in most other programmes. YOu also get to know the other staff very well, and you are put into a wider range of challenging scenarios that you have to work together to make work.\n\n2. Geology is a subject that attracts people who like variety. You need a bit of maths, chem, bio, physics, geography, etc to be an effective geologists, so we are very good at being interested in things a bit outside of our normal research niches. Striking up a conversation with another geologist is easy, because there'll be *something* to link you. Try this in other fields and it's much harder.\n\n3. As a whole we are a very collaborative subject - I can't remember the last time I saw a single author paper from a geologist, and frequently working in groups across departments, universities, and countries. Funding for much of geology is a struggle to get, so we also tend to be supportive of each other, helping the community out, and doing what we can to support good science across the spectrum. As an example, after one of my postdocs I was invited by a senior professor I had met once to take part in a workshop they were running. My work was tangentially related, and I was unemployed at the time, so said I had to decline. He said no problem, stumped up the fee, the flights, the accomodation, had me involved in a related paper, and for the next several years I'd get occaisional mesages and interactions seeing how things were going. Just last week I've been able to offer a colleague at another institution free lab access and support to get some work done that they haven't got a grant to pay for. This kind of thing is happening across geology departments ALL THE TIME.",

They probably look for candidates that are academically qualified then screen for \u201cfit\u201d within the department. Nice profs look for more nice profs bc nice profs don\u2019t want to work with assholes. We are especially careful in this because of tenure - I don\u2019t want to hire someone who is a jerk because once they\u2019re tenured, I\u2019ll spend the rest of my career with them.",
