  "title:": "Any tips for young academics on how to make sure I'm not making arguments that are already well established in the field?",
  "text": "I cannot know everything, I am a young academic in the humanities, I from time to time have some ideas that I think are crisp enough to stand on their own as decent contributions. However, I always overthink that I may not be the first person to say this, and even worse, it may not only have been said by another young academic elsewhere but it may be well established fact in the field. I never know how to make sure I'm not saying anything old, and I always find it interesting when people make big claims in their papers like \"no one has done this before, so I'm doing this\" - what are some tips to rule out these possibilities and get past my anxieties about saying something repetitive?",

At some point, you've just got to go for it and wait for Reviewer #2 to point out the 50-page long German article from the 70s that made your point in a footnote. Then, you revise your article to say: \"In this paper, I renew the argument for an often-forgotten conclusion first established by Schmidt.\"",

      "text": "Three things:\n\n1.There are also different ways of making such an argument. Personally I would never ever say \"no-one has done X before\", because most likely, someone somewhere has. Instead I would say \"most studies to date have done Y\" or \"the dominant focus in the field has been Y\". \n\n2. Related to the first point: when I review manuscripts it really bugs me if academics make overstated claims of novelty. Be precise about your novelty, but explain how your novel insights in a sub-sub-field are relevant to a much wider field. \n\n3. Writing with senior professors has taught me they also overstate their novelty, are unaware of (especially recent) literature, and get scathing comments from reviewers in return :). To some extent it's part and parcel of being an academic.",

Just saw a paper in a big journal in my field totally reinventing the wheel. Like in an amateur way. How did it pass through peer review  - no one knows. A colleague of mine also published a paper in a very high impact journal in my field again reinventing the wheel. This guy is really nice and I didn't point it out to him, I'm sure others have, but I'm sure he read widely. Thing is, you can't bullet proof yourself. You can only minimise the risk. When it happens, be apologetic. But don't overwork yourself to the point that you can't publish in fear that someone else has done this work before.",
