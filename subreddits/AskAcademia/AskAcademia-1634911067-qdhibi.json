      "text": "I don't know this particular organisation but there's two parts to the answer. Are they academic? No. They're a think tank/policy unit. Are they reliable? Well it depends what you mean. Like all such organisations they have a certain view/position on the world and they are seeking to influence policy makers and other decision makers so they will advocate towards that position. However, that doesn't mean their work isn't based on solid research and their views aren't evidence based. There is a lot of highly impactful research coming from organisations like this and a lot of the work is done by people with academic backgrounds, or still in academia. It's difficult to judge work from there but you tend to get familiar with the better think tanks in your field and think tanks that are transparency about their funding and board members etc are more trustworthy than the ones that don't.",
