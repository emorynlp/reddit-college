  "text": "I mean impostor in the sense that they say they have credential X, but it turns out that it is astronomically unlikely that they actually do. \n\nConcrete example: https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/4/26/mit-admissions-dean-resigns-after-fake/\n\n\nI'm asking because I think I've run into such a person. I have no intention do anything about it because, I'm not 100% sure, I feel like it is none of my business and I have too many deadlines and unanswered emails to voluntarily get involved in anything.\n\nIs this a once in a decade event or does this type of thing happen all the time?",

This other guy who came on after me was hired on as a contractor and had his masters. \n\nAfter several months of working, he was going to get converted fulltime as a senior associate because of his masters. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, most pharma companies will hire you on as a contractor to \"test\" you out and if they like you they'll hire you full time with benefits, holidays, etc. But when they convert you, you basically have to reapply for the position and go through a background check.\n\nWell one day I came into work and he was gone... thought he was out sick or something. I asked a coworker if he was sick, and apparently he was immediately fired. Turns out during the background check that he actually didn't have his masters, he went to grad school, but I guess something was pending on his transcript.\n\n\nMoral of the story: don't lie on your resume",

      "text": "This is not exactly what you have in mind, but in grad school I knew a guy who was an imposter. Archaeology program on east coast, mind you, but he would wear three piece suits with topcoats and drink wine during his office hours. He  was uber critical of other students' work and was a jerk TA. Anyways, he ended up failing his comps and getting kicked out. So, my point is that I don't think these people last too long. And even if they do get their PhD, they won't be able to get positions. You have to do too much to succeed in academia, imo.\n\nOne thing I'd note about imposter syndrome and imposters though, is to not mix the two. It's completely normal to struggle with imposter syndrome, and very few who do are actually imposters. I argue that imposter syndrome is a symptom of caring and a drive to do better - a quality that imposters lack. When my students or colleagues talk to me about imposter syndrome, I first think \"good! - this person really wants to do better\". But of course it stems from being hyper critical of your self, and that is something we must all keep a grip on. It's important to be competitive with yourself (not others), but not at the detriment of your success or health, which are usually one in the same.",

                              "text": "> I can't imagine a person who thinks of themselves as an awkward nerd genius and enjoys that show.\n\nI believe the opposite (knowing some fans of the show in person). What follows is a rant that turned out much longer than anticipated: \n\n---\n\nBBT defines its \"Nerds\" in two ways:\n\n* Their \"condition\" is entirely innate and they can't be blamed for anything. While some of the things they do and say are technically pathetic, the show makes it clear that every character who calls them out is *actually* pathetic because they lack insight into their unique perception, which is 100% rational. To dislike a nerd is the same as ableism towards the autistic stereotype. \n\n* They are victims of their condition and the non-nerds (blonde women, jocks) are their oppressors. In the BBT universe, nerds are outsiders and insiders are not nerds (as in, not smart and 100% rational, which is why the blonde woman next door who very much has a social life must be very stupid). \n\nThe nerd-identity that BBT provides absolves the nerds of all failure. You under-achieve, because you have no support system and are misunderstood, and you are so misunderstood  because you are such a nerd. \n\nThe problem is that in real life, occupations and skills that make you a \"nerd\" are well paid and prestigious. Popular culture dictates that Nerds are underdogs who are shoved into american-highshool type lockers, but in real life people are jealous of people percieved as nerds and people who want to be nerds, but are not, are on the look out for \"fake nerds\".\n\nThis is the duality of the \"awkward nerd genius\" trope. On one hand, nerds are supposed to be unfuckable underdogs that nobody associates with, but on the other hand, ... \n\nIf somebody who is not qualified to be a nerd (like a blonde woman) befriends them, it must be a charade serving some ulterior motive. \n\nIf somebody who is not qualified to be a nerd (like a blonde woman) is interested, even quite skilled at one of the official nerd activities, it must be a charade in order seduce them. \n\nBecause if the nerd-dialectic is not true, the \"nerd\" is suddenly no longer the underdog, he (or the girl who is r/notliketheothergirls) suddenly regains responsibility. \n\n> [...] And you are going to go through life thinking girls don't like you cause, you're a nerd. And want you to know from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because, you're an asshole.\n\n(Quote from \"The social network\")\n\n\nConversely, if the nerd-dialectic is not true, somebody who is an asshole may have to concede to themselves that they are maybe not as clever as they think they are. This brings us right back to the comment thread we were responding to. This is also the reason why the /r/slatestarcodex / capital-R Rationalist types are so crazy bad at math beyond the highschool level. \n\n\n----\n\n\"Oh wow it so rare to see a woman who is *actually* a nerd\"\n\n\"I'm not a nerd\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean nerd in a negative way, I mean like, you are ...\"\n\n\n\"There are no nerds, $Sheldon. I'm good at what I do because I am passionate about it and put real effort in it.\"\n\n\"Sure, but the Normies wouldn't care for ...\"\n\n\"The are no Normies $Sheldon. Everybody has interests, and which interests are getting *the Nerd treatment* is a flimsy social construct that [we should question.](https://www.scribd.com/document/60200751/The-Sexual-Politics-of-Genius)\" \n\n\n\"You sound like some SJW, I didn't expect that from *you*\".\n\n\"That's because being a woman with some stereotypically masculine interests has *made me* a bit of an SJW. They say 'science advances one funeral at a time', but if all scientists were held to the same standard as women with opinions, we wouln't need a fucking funeral. If acievement in STEM were not so tied to masculinity, the String-Theory / Multiverse folks could practice some epistemic humility without loosing face. If being a \"nerd\" (i.e. a dude with highbrow dude interest) were not so tied to authority, the people who lambast scocial sciences as 'weak and female' but believe in evo psych would have an easier time practicing selft awarenss. Quit being an self-diagnosed autist, failed /r/aftergifted , /r/iamverysmart dude , and put some fucking work into your arguments. Read the fucking syllabus. You do not impress a female TA by assuming she is stupid. Fuck you.\"   \n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. I just tried to make a compliment. Thank you for helping me with this assignment. Sorry. \"\n\n\"You don't need to apologize because this is not about you. This is some 15 years of anger and frustration that I've accumulated by hearing how uniquely *gifted* and *opressed* so-called nerds are, and at the same time experiencing the truth.\"",

Universities publish criteria for what you need to do get a PhD but they are so general that they are essentially useless. The bottom line is, that whether a student passes these things or not is largely based on a few professors subjective opinion. Even within departments, professors' expectations of their students will differ. One professor/committee might expect expertise or output on a totally different level than another. Just within the department I did my PhD in (well known R1 school), there were some professors who were known to be complete hard asses and would scrutinize students work down to the tiniest details and then there were some who were known to be push overs, like they would give passing grades without even reading the work. \n\nWhere's the line between imposter syndrome and imposter?",

The thing is, higher education due, IMHO, a culture and practice that can conflate personality with ability. I see this a lot in education, which can often be so personality based due to climate of profession and the fact that the profession itself leans a lot on personalities for personal and group motivation. As such, it's not a problem of impostors as it is attracting grifters. The edu-celebrity that talks in buzzwords in short spurts but in longer discussion, and with push back, quickly becomes clear they have little experience and a lack of expertise. In corporate backed ed reform, you see this with the think tank and astroturf orgs where the folks have more blog posts and op eds in their cv than anything else. I've seen this in the grad school area as well for those that can't make the transition from twitter, blog posts, and round tables to the higher rigors of research, publications, TA, and the like. In the past, these folks didn't last too long. They certainly don't in more traditional grad settings, but there are more programs catering to the them, largely funded by the big foundations (Eli Broad with Yale or University of Arkansas with the Walton Foundation.)",

She basically memorizes whatever information is thrown at her, and repeats it to the best of her ability. I've personally told her that her work is at the level of a high school student before a projet meeting, and she went on presenting her slides as if nothing ever happened. She's confident beyond reason. It's simultaneously disheartening and impressive.\n\nSo, yeah. And she's not the first ive seen like this either.",

              "text": "I know.. It's a long answer. In the EU you can't just fire a student/worker. You can submit a negative yearly evaluation of the students progress, which will be reviewed by a committee in charge of following up on PhD students. In that event, they would propose every possible changes to the program to accommodate any shortcomings, including increasing supervisor/student interactions, specific training sessions, including changing topics if possible etc. Thing is, these committees were initially devised to protect the students against bogus phd programs, or terrible supervisors; not the other way around. They will do everything within thwir means to help the student complete the phd. \n\nAlso, there are 3 co supervisors main one opposes drastic measures, so he blocked my attempts to submit a negative review and bring it to the committee. Why? Because he knows it's politically smarter to play pretend than to be labeled \"a problem\" and possibly hurt his changes to get future funding. Also, is desperate cases, students may feel tempted to tarn the reputation of the supervisor, as in fabricating harassment stories, or professional misconduct, etc. I've seen this happen after a student presented a 30 page phd manuscript to the University, in her 3rd extra year after the regular 3 years. She proceeded to claim her supervisor harassed her and somehow convinced a national embassador from her home country to attend her defense and make sure she had a fair evaluation. Other claims include that xenophobia, racism, etc. The potential for scandal is high. And European countries in general have protective workers laws that when abused, can put a halt to any procedure and keep everything in stasis, which doesn't benefit anyone. The big wigs tend to frown upon scandals, and the hammer may drop on the supervisors, regardless of fair or not.\n\nSo there you go. Im in a position outside mainstream academia where i'm mostly protected from shitty politics, and I'll have my say at her defense. But then there's all the rest.",

I didn't get too invested but I thought something along the lines of \"good for them, time is really up for this type of asshole\". \n\nSome two years or so later I was more interested in becoming an academic myself and read [this three-piece expose](https://www.republik.ch/2019/03/27/systematic-failure) which is clearly taking Carollos side, but also *really compelling*. I thought I was beyond skimming over headlines and believing them. In retrospect I couldn't think of a single outrageous news story that didn't get a good bit more believable and less outrageous after some time passing. So this particular story was my first serious come-to-jesus moment about the effect constantly being up-to-date and reading the news. I can read the news once a month and miss nothing.",

The students who join the program are mostly inclined towards getting their degrees and have no regards for the research element which has 50% contribution towards their degree. Some of them were so dumb and stubborn that we couldn't put them to use even for basic tasks.",

      "text": "I've had thousands of students, so have seen the entire range of ability. Most students that make it to the upper level of undergraduate coursework are very capable, and as others have said tend to be most critical of themselves. That is the core of imposter syndrome, and we all have it to some degree. I have to constantly remind students that they wouldn't be where they are without real ability and good decision-making. I'd say this high-achieving group constitutes about two-thirds of my students (not that they are always high-achieving in every single course, but overall in the degree they are generally successful).\n\nThere's also a group that doesn't do well overall in the degree, but they are usually accepting of the reasons as to why. They aren't faking anything, they just aren't working hard enough, are in the wrong major, have struggles outside of school that semester, etc. They may blame the professor, the University, themselves, or life, but no matter what they're at least understanding that there is a problem they need to address. This is probably a third of my students. This group in my opinion may be in denial, but they are not imposters.\n\nThere's a very tiny fraction, maybe 1%, that could talk their way into anything, convince everyone they're very knowledgeable, and really can fake it. If you were in a class with them, you'd think they were the top student because of how they speak, when they're often in the bottom 25%. But in their mind they aren't faking anything and they don't even recognize the issue, they really know everything and are at the top of the field. They are very personable, get along with faculty, contribute in lecture, lead clubs, have \"ideas\" (typically ideas that are quite out there). But academically they're typically in the C or D range. Now maybe these students will one day become the next great thinkers of our time, but I've not seen it yet. I would say I see about one student like this a semester.\n\nHonestly I don't see how this group could fake their way into a Medical, Masters, or PhD program where there is real rigor. I've personally not seen anyone in my field I would consider an actual imposter. Some less capable than others, for sure, but to get where we are you have to have some reflection and ability. And these \"imposters\" probably find some similar work related to the field, and end up doing pretty well as they can talk their way through most issues. I'd say many would do very well in business, but not academia.",

For better and for worse, academia is not an exception to the \"fake it till you make it\" strategy. These types are also going to become more common, since there has been a huge proliferation of course-based master's programs aimed at people who probably aren't capable of handling higher-level education, but want the credential as a resume builder.\n\nFrankly, I won't make a primary reply to this question since I'm not really an \"academic\" per se and haven't been around long enough to give a definitive answer, but I think this entire thread is very wrong. The average grad student is not nearly as smart as they think they are, and is it unfortunate that is has become popular to play off incompetence and lack of common sense as \"impostor syndrome\" in professional fields. Occasionally being confused or requiring help is necessary in any intellectually challenging field, and recognizing when you're out-of-your-league and need assistance is a valuable trait, instead of sloughing off confusion and uncertainty as \"impostor syndrome\" (as in a fluke occurrence that you are able to handle because you passed a prerequisite course).",

They act a little too secure in their expertise, and tend to be condescending or even to make fun of people who don't have their Big Brains, refusing to explain concepts. This is a cover for their own lack of knowledge. \n\nThese people don't generally make it too far before they wash out, IME. Sure, occasionally one will make it through grad school, but that's usually because they get their reality checked and learn to knuckle down and work.\n\nPeople tend to hear about someone getting caught faking their credentials, and think \"Oh, but how many out there didn't get caught?\" as if it's a tip-of-the-iceberg situation. IMO, it's not that easy to get away with pretending you know what you're doing at higher levels of academia. I think most or all of them get caught.",

Replication studies can alert us to invalid results, though in most cases the false results are more likely to result from a weird sample or random chance rather than fraud. Data transparency policies help by making faking your data more time-consuming, though they have drawbacks (e.g. privacy, doesn't work very well for qualitative research). At the end of the day, if someone is willing to make up data by hand for a thousand fake survey respondents, then idk how anyone else would be able to catch that...but at that point, why bother putting all that effort into faking data when it would be less work to do the research for real?",

See: all of the Brian Wansink story. This one can be fixed by fixing the broken incentives. \n\n* To support motivated reasoning. If you research something that is political, the results of that research is relevant to politics. So if you support a particular flavor of politics,  you have a vested interest in a particular kind of result.\n\nFinally, you could also have a real result and embellish its significance by lying about your sample size.",

A year or two later, when I had moved on to a different company, he showed up there, too.  I said something about him to a colleague and he reported the same past experience.  I took it to the chief scientist and the guy was escorted out that same day.",

My insane, crazy, believes humans were created by aliens to mine gold aunt.\n\nSo after the alarm bells went off in my head, I did some Googling on this woman and found out that roughly ten years before I started working for her she was punished by the state for having lied about having her Master's degree. She was found to have bought a degree from a well-known diploma mill.\n\nShe had me write up a business biography for her while I was working there. She said she had a Doctorate. But... she listed her Master's degree graduation date as the same date she did when she was first punished for lying about having a Master's degree.\n\nSo that means she either received an actual, real Master's degree the same year that she bought her diploma mill degree. Or she was continuing to lie about having a Master's degree, and thus a doctorate. \n\nShe continues to work and make a comfortable living. I told everyone I could though, and even got her kicked out of a job fair thing after she fired me because I didn't want to work for free. Lol",

So yea, an \u201cactual\u201d imposter is somewhat tricky when you don\u2019t know that person\u2019s full story. \n\nAnd I hate to be the one to address the elephant in the room. But academia is still construct dominated by white, straight, and abled people.

I didn't always have test anxiety but I developed it as an undergrad.  In high school, I had no issues with exams.  I got a perfect 1600 on the SAT, for example.  But as an undergrad wanting to go to grad school (where I needed as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible), I started getting irrationally anxious about exams.  By the time I was a senior at university, I started having full-blown panic attacks, complete with hyperventilation and chest tightness _during_ exams, and started taking Ativan (prescribed) just so I could breathe adequately during tests.  My exam scores suffered.\n\nMy test anxiety was no better in grad school.  Interestingly, when I was able to chill out sans meds, I did okay.  During an impossible final exam for the hardest class I've ever taken in my life, the panic disappeared. The test was so freakishly difficult that I knew there was no way I would pass, and my brain shifted from panic to \"Fuck it.  I have nothing to lose.\"   I started writing whatever I could that made even remote sense.  Out of 30+ students in that class, I ended up with one of the 3 As that were awarded (the final class average was a B-).\n\nTest anxiety is real, and it really sucks.",
