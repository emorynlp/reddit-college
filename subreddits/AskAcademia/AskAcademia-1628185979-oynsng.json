  "text": "After a year of graduating Master's in Genetics, working for free in a prestigious research institute and looking for opportunities as research assistant. I failed to find one.\n\n As many of the positions were less paid or unpaid ones which were not sustainable to me. Even PhD positions won't pay properly anymore in my country. \n\nFew months back I randomly applied for a contract research organisation (CRO) on clinical research a human data science company. Then the same company offered me a job and I accepted it.\nNow I'm really missing research in lab and conservation genetics area which I really want to pursue.\n\nI'm kind of lost and working in corporate is very much new to me. \n\nI still don't know if I can pursue research and be in academia in future.\n\nCan anyone suggest me if I can switch back to academia?",

      "text": "At the masters stage? Hell yes you\u2019ll be a very attractive phd candidate because you have experience outside the academic setting and having actively chosen that route knowing what the world looks like you\u2019ll nail it. All the best academics I know have left crusty academia and come back but whilst remaining in technical roles.\n\nMy only advice is: don\u2019t restrict yourself geographically. Think of a project you are passionate about, and go for it. Apply in multiple countries and multiple universities and give it a good shot. Being an international student is a great way to hedge your bets: change your mind about the terrible decision to pursue a highly precarious low paid job steeped in insecurity? You had a wonderful life experience and expanded your horizons, and possibly learned a new language. Finished international PhD and want more of that tasty academic grind? In your PhD you\u2019ve demonstrated a high level of independence, and also as someone with a masters if you don\u2019t do it in USA you can get it over in probably about 3-4 years.\n\nGooood luck!",

You don't do lab research per se, but you do really keep up with the research literature. Of course, it demands that you really have the temperament to consider a counseling-life career.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not unheard of, while I think usually the flow tends to go out of academia there are some that find their way back. But without further details it\u2019s hard to tell you more beside it\u2019s possible but you need to be at the right place at the right time to take advantage of an opportunity arises. Generally I would believe working in industry will make you less competitive and where I am from the need for research assistants is much higher in industry than academia simply because in academia there is no money for assistance so PhD and Postdocs do most of their work on their own. That said if the time comes try it and you will see",

You know these careers are different and have individual pros and cons.  \n\n\nThe only to do, keep going to study at job or academia which you loved one. Good Luck ;)",
