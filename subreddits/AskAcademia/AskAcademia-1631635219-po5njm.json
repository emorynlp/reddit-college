  "title:": "Recovering after a slump in motivation",
  "text": "I've had a good phd and got a very nice postdoc afterwards. However, at the end of the phd / start of the postdoc I started suffering mentally and practicaly lost several months of my life. This was in the middle of the pandemics, so I'm sure I'm not special in this way.\n\nI have got my mental health under control, but now I cannot bring back the high level of motivation that allowed me to finish a good phd and land a very nice post doc. I find it incredibly hard to work at all. I used to enjoy the work and was looking forward to an academic career. Now I cannot focus at all to solve problems or to work on new ideas or to develop code. I feel quite disconnected from my work. I don't understand how I haven't been fired yet, perhaps that's an upside of a two-year postdoc contract. I'm really wondering if it would be the best course of action to keep working on recovering interest in academic work, or try some other job. Perhaps I got lazy. Even if it is as simple as that, I'd really like to know how to find motivation again. Each work day is terrible and empty.\n\nAnyone in a similar situation? How did you manage to recover, if you did?",

      "text": "Hey I am in a similar situation (4th year post-doc), but unfortunately I cannot offer a solution. I guess periods of slump are in some part normal, but if they continue maybe they are a symptom of something else. Problem is this something else is highly subjective and it's up to you to find it. Maybe your work topic does not interest you anymore, maybe your life priorities changed or it could be even something physical (like not sleeping well).\n\nOnly advice I can give is don't be harsh to yourself. I know this is easier said than done, especially for academics where competition is fierce and you tend to compare yourself to your most visible (hence successful) peers. If today was terrible, it's okay, tomorrow you will try to do better, and if tomorrow is worse, that's okay too. If you beat yourself up, it will only worsen the situation. Try setting small reachable goals each day, like read 1 paper or write 10 lines of code, sometimes it's just a matter of starting.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you want to talk :)",

      "text": "I had a similar thing happen at the end of my PhD. I was tying up experiments and writing my thesis and i was so sick of the whole thing that I just wanted to walk out or crash my car into a tree (thankfully I didn't do that). What helped me is I just decided one day that I was no longer going to bring work home with me. I worked a 9-5 job, and extra of course where needed, but when i left the lab I was done for the day. No reading, no writing, nothing. It helped me be more productive while at the lab. You just need to get over the guilt.",
