Got to the campus interview and realized there was not appropriate administrative support/backing for faculty in my field. I turned it down, reasoning that if I got an offer before I could probably get one again. Imagine *just how much* I shit my pants this past year during covid.\n\nJust signed a tenure-track offer during this year's search. Fit is important. The phone interview is them getting to know you. The campus stage is just as much you getting to know *them*. At that point it's their job to show you why you want to come there, and it's totally fair to realize it isn't a good fit.",

My advisors all told me that I would be successful as an academic, and that I would have little trouble finding academic jobs, and it's hard to resist that kind of souping up when academic jobs are also positioned as the pinnacle of accomplishment for a PhD student.\n\nIt took a postdoc and - yes - applying to a few assistant professor positions for me to recognize that no, this really wasn't what I wanted. And having left academia, I know many others who had similar experiences (and a few who had experiences in the opposite direction as well). I know people who actually *accepted* academic jobs with some trepidation and doubt and realized slowly that they didn't want to be professors then, either (they've applied and interviewed at my current place).\n\nEveryone comes to realization at their own pace and through their own process.",

                      "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts u/roseofjuly. I'll reply in-line for fluidity. I hope this discourse is taken all good faith (I know that sometimes the lack of internet tone indication can leave too much room for negative interpretation). We're really trying to build something that confers career stability for researching scientists around the world. All this feedback is extremely useful to that end - so, again, thank you very much. Incoming wall of text!\n\n>Why would experienced scientists 'bid' their review services? Journal article reviewers usually don't get paid for their service; it's volunteer.\n\nRight, and the value of that volunteerism, where scientists are obliged to curate other scientists work for a journal's publication, is being converted to publishers' profits in exchange for reputation. There are many scientists around the world, i.e. those researching in developing countries, where reputation isn't enough and need additional streams of financial support to keep their labs and/or families operating. In our marketplace, those that want to volunteer can still bid their review services for free and those that want to extract something more from their services can also do so. Our marketplace gives you a choice. Imagine being able to offset the time it takes to write grants by supplementing your lab with income from your peer review services. Less writing, more research.\n\n>Is the vision that people would pay for a manuscript review by a scientific expert? If so, why would anyone use this service rather than asking colleagues in their department (which is the traditional method) or just submitting to the journal?\n\nThe vision is that \"submitters\" would pay (this includes both editors and individual scientists) to get their manuscripts curated by peer review from the corpus of global experts. Our rigorous peer review aims to endow the same, if not more, credibility and trustworthiness as a top journal's peer review process, something you can't get just from a local colleague's review.\n\n>Your 'learn more' seems to position this as an alternative to peer review in journals, but even if someone engaged this service, they'd still have to submit to the journal and go through the lengthy process anyway.\n\nOnce the work is curated, you can 1) actively submit it along with its history of peer review to partnered journals that will accept it as reviewed and fast-tracked for publication or 2) let journal editors browse reviewed works ready to be published on our platform and request the authors to submit to them. \n\nYears ago, if you came across a post or a comment about someone trying to build the first ever preprint repository, I'm sure they'd get a similar reaction. \"Why would you post your work online and not through a traditional journal? Wouldn't you get scooped? Don't you have to eventually publish it anyway? What's the point?\" On a high level, preprint repositories are *scientists publishing for scientists* \\- they plant their intellectual flag in the landscape of research, letting other scientist know what they're working on and share early information with the community to broadly accelerate research. We like that scientists publish for themselves. Now, we want to enable *scientists to peer review for scientists* as well.",
