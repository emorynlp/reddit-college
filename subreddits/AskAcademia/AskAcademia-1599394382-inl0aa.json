      "text": "I always targeted industrial RnD roles right from the get go when I started my PhD so that\u2019s the perspective my answer is coming from. My experience has been that if you want a job in a hard science (like chemistry, biochemistry, genetics etc. as you say) you basically need a PhD in order to have any meaningful career progression, at least in large companies.\n\nBS and to a lesser extent MS holders do not get promoted into management and have much lower salaries (like 50% of PhD holders). It\u2019s not fair, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s looked like to me from the inside.\n\nYou basically need a PhD to do my job (physical chemistry RnD) but not every job. You can definitely get there and be competent at my and other jobs where the employee has a PhD but it\u2019s a lot easier to start with a PhD since you have a lot of background to understand what you\u2019re doing and more importantly design and analyze your experiments in any meaningful way. Most industrial RnD (in chemistry) is largely streamlined anyway with most cutting edge stuff being acquired or assimilated through industry-academic collaborations (which again a PhD is helpful for).",

I regret not taking more classes in Python because I probably could do more with that\n- Also, this is a bit more wild, knowledge and comfort of handling dry ice safely. We wanted to get some footage of something small and have smoke/fog in the shot so we used dry ice and water. My bosses probably could have done it without me, but also 100% would have used more ice than they needed and burned their hands on it multiple times because laypeople are silly sometimes",

Additionally if you want to transition into a technical sales or marketing role a MS may work, but a PhD will always be preferred.

They formally aren't computer scientists but handling TBs of monkey brain recordings helped them to get into that occupation.\n\nAdditionally you can find other skills that every employer likes to see, such as the ability to pick up new skills quickly, a general interest in learning new things, collaborative skills and more.",
