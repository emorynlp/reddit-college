  "title:": "How do you reconcile yourself with harsh feedback?",
  "text": "Background: I am currently experiencing severe depression and am very suicidal, but I have to complete my mission in the world by publishing three more papers that are already ongoing.\n\nStory: Last week I was asked to do a presentation on our paper that won a Best Paper Honorable Mention in a top conference. Today I did the presentation on behalf of my collaborators and it went well. But in the Q&A Session I looked like a complete imposter because I only gave very brief answers to audiences' questions and asked them to check out our paper to find more detailed answers. At the end of the Q&A Session my PI told me in front of all audiences: \"In the future you should directly tell people what's on the paper instead of telling people to check out the paper because no one is likely to read the paper.\" This makes me feel so bad. (This is my first time presenting a paper btw.) I know it's important to have a growth mindset but I just can't get rid of the perfection mindset and I feel like a complete imposter because I don't remember all the details on the paper. I feel so bad that because of my poor performance in the Q&A Session, people would feel disappointed about the paper that won a Best Paper Honorable Mention. I even think about ending my life because I can't take harsh feedback, because I know in academia we are supposed to take the feedback that makes us feel uncomfortable because that's how we grow.\n\nSo, how do you reconcile yourself with harsh feedback?",

      "text": "First ask yourself, why do you feel so harshly about this? I would reccomend seeking a therapist to talk through things like this, because being suicidal is not a normal reaction to what is a very minor comment from your PI.\n\nYour PIs comment is in the milder end of things I have heard advisor's tell their students.\n\n\nSecond, during your defense your ideas will be attacked from thr very core. You will need to answer those questions and it will be extremely tough. You should work with someone to take criticism better.",

I'm a senior member of staff at a research institute. I've fucked up my fair share of talks and had various technical disasters over the years. I'm pretty thick-skinned about presentations these days, but if my boss came up and said something like that I'd be crushed. Time and place. \n\nI would not be happy if I saw one of our faculty do that to a student.",

In my opinion he is right in his criticism also because telling \u201cgo read paper xy\u201dimplies that you indeed have no idea about the work done in your group.\nDon\u2019t take it personally and move on. Next time for the Qand A give more detailed information and pride yourself in how much you know and how many cool\nThings your group had found out.",

I try to not do Q&As wherever possible, rarely feel they have much value to anyone.\n\nBut don't worry about that now, find someone you can talk to.",

      "text": "I second (or third or fourth) the comments that you should speak to a professional about your feelings. That\u2019s absolutely the first thing to do. \n\nI would also realize that your PIs comments weren\u2019t really harsh at all. He/she told you no one is likely to read the paper. But that has nothing to do with your paper; it\u2019s true of all of them. We\u2019re all busy, and we rarely have time to read much of anything. I\u2019ve been to many job talks, and 90%+ of the audience is relying exclusively on the talk itself to inform them. They haven\u2019t read the paper and they probably won\u2019t. Again, not a reflection the author. \n\nRemember that you *will* get harsh feedback both as you progress through your program and definitely once you start publishing. Reviewers tend to be very critical. It\u2019s important to (a) realize that these critiques are often idiosyncratic and (b) separate yourself from that work. They\u2019re criticizing what you\u2019ve written (because that\u2019s their job). They aren\u2019t criticizing *you.*\n\nAcademia isn\u2019t for everyone. So you might consider whether it\u2019s something you really want or not. If it is, then work with a professional to address the imposter syndrome issues and learn to accept criticism. \n\nPersonally, I just ignore a lot of it and complain to coauthors/friends. But that doesn\u2019t work for everyone.",

      "text": "Firstly, you need to focus on yourself and your health. I urge you to seek help for your depression and suicidal thoughts and feelings. You don't have to publish three papers right now and nothing is worth your life. \n\nSecondly, gently, this feedback wasn't so much harsh as it was delivered badly. It sounds like your talk was a roaring success. You won an award and people asked lots of questions. Your supervisor made one comment, and I have to say it wasn't a bad comment in as much as it was specific and actionable. It also didn't denigrate your achievement but rather was a suggestion of how to build and grow. However, it was totally inappropriate to say it in front of everyone else and no matter how good the comment, that makes your PI an arsehole. And when people behave badly that's on them, not on you. You could have delivered the worst talk in the history of talks and it still wouldn't be appropriate to give feedback publicly. Nothing you did warranted your PI's arsehole behaviour. I'm a senior manager at a research institute and I would be very unhappy if I witnessed something like this. \n\nYou've painted this entire thing as a disaster and it's heartbreaking that you can't see the achievement here. It's not easy giving research talks and it takes practice, and I really mean that, people need practice. They need to present regularly and we've all given terrible presentations. The upside is they make for great stories with friends. I gave a virtual talk recently where I was plagued by technical issues so someone else was running my slides. The platform we were using was awful so I had a copy of my slides up on my second screen. I gave the entire talk before realising that I'd been flicking through my copy of the slides and had totally forgotten to ask the AV people to move my slides on. So the audience literally only saw the first slide of my entire 30min presentation. I spent the evening on WhatsApp recounting the disaster to friends and then had a drink and regaled my boss with the story in the morning. I laughed it off, even though I had almost been in tears at the time I was so stressed and frustrated.\n\nPlease, seek out help. You are catastrophising and I'm worried you're so vulnerable right now that you don't have the resilience to withstand even slight knockbacks. There is nothing shameful about having mental health issues and taking time to care for yourself. I have taken time off work before because of stress. You aren't alone and you're not the only one. You will come back stronger and a better researcher and mentor for it.",

Many students (and it sounds like you are one) are what she calls \"fragile perfects,\" who are so used to achieving perfection (usually in the form of a perfect GPA) that they are shattered when they cannot achieve perfection in some area or another (usually their first mark lower than an A).\n\nFirst, seek therapy.  That will help you a lot.\n\nBut also check out her Ted Talk or her book, which is also called *Grit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance.*",

      "text": "Firstly like others have said, this is very mild feedback, I'd even go as far as say this is neutral feedback. You should talk to a professional because if this can cause you issues, then actually harsh feedback will leave you in shambles.\n\nSecondly, there is harsh feedback and there is *harsh feedback*. Constructive feedback, however negative, is always good to take, but it should be given in private and if not gently, at least in a neutral way. Actual harsh feedback meant to make someone feel bad does happen, but the consolation here is that it reflects a lot more poorly on the person giving it than on the person receiving it. I think we've all been at a conference when someone asks an obviously trick question to the presenter to make themselves feel good at the detriment of the poor grad student on the podium and thought \"wow what a shithead\".",

      "text": "I think you were given feedback but it was neither punitive nor personal - maybe corrective. I am not sure it was appropriate to do it publicly, but that is not on you but on your PI\u2019s social ineptness (it is rampant). It might take some conscious effort to battle unproductive thoughts you might be haunted by. Pursuing the quest for resolving your conflict is important - in order to publish, for example, you will face peer reviews, and those are unlikely to be totally non-triggering. In fact, after decades of this, my colleagues and I still describe each experience as potentially soul-crushing (people do sound evaluative and mean). You might want to ask your PI to prepare you for that or walk you through the experience.",
