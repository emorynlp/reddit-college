  "title:": "Is it plagiarism to repeat an old study?",
  "text": "So, I had what I thought was a good research idea in mind. I went to the ever-useful Google Scholar, and I found a study from about 15 years ago that answered the question that I'd hoped to answer. \n\nHowever, it used data from a national survey from 20 years ago. \n\nIs it plagiarism to essentially repeat the entire paper, but with data from a recent edition of the same national survey? If not, how do I acknowledge that I am essentially doing a repeat of the old paper?",

      "text": "You would need to cite the old paper and reference it in your background as prior foundational work, but no \u2014repeating old studies is not plagiarism it\u2019s good science\n\nYou do need to acknowledge the old study though. Pretending like it doesn\u2019t exist, or writing as if your work is totally novel would be  misconduct. It\u2019s your responsibility as a communicating researcher to lay the theoretical foundations of the question and outline prior work for your audience.",

You have to write your own paper, of course. You can\u2019t just copy their words and fill in new data\u2014that would definitely be plagiarism.",
