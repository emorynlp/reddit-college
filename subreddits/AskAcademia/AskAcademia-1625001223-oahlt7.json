  "title:": "How on earth do you write a PhD research proposal? (Humanities)",
  "text": "I apologise for the melodrama - but I literally have no idea. Currently, I'm trying to put together an 1000-word proposal to apply for grad school, stating the research aims, significance, structure etc. for my prospective PhD. On the face of it, this shouldn't be too hard. And I've done well in research tasks before. But I am struggling. There are several issues I'm dealing with, but the chief one is I just don't see how I can write a good proposal without having actually read all the works I propose to examine. Surely, if I had done all the reading already then all I would really be doing in my PhD would be writing it up? The impression I'm rapidly getting is that to write a really killer proposal you need to have basically done a year's worth of reading towards it - minimum - so, effectively a third of the PhD in advance. I just don't see how you can come up with an original idea of sufficient scope with less than that. And, unfortunately, I only have 4 or 5 months until my application needs to be in...\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how best to use my remaining time to fix these issues and complete a strong proposal? How should I be spending my time? What are the most efficient ways to find a suitable topic? So far, I've managed to identify small gaps in scholarship but my ideas aren't really 'big' enough to justify a full PhD. Should I prioritise primary texts or secondary texts etc.?\n\nEDIT: Specific area of the humanities, if it helps, is English Literature.",

      "text": "Broadly, the proposal needs to indicate that you're able to 'ring-fence' a topic, select a methodology, and conceptualise outcomes that can be completed in the 3 to 4 years that you have for your PhD. That said, your approach will change (i.e. become more fine-tuned) by the time you get to your qualifying exams stage. So don't worry too much about having to commit to everything in your proposal.\n\nYou don't need to have read everything but you'd need to recognise which are the key texts/authors within your topic or area of work, and the significant points they've raised about your topic. So if you haven't done so, you should have an outline of these.\n\nWould you need to identify a supervisor/advisor as part of your proposal? If so, talk to them.\n\nIn a sense, as a PhD, you'll be contributing to a conversation about your topic so you'll need to know what's been covered so far. Your work will need to be a significant contribution to that 'conversation', so your proposal should indicate (broadly) the 'gaps in the conversation' that your contribution will be addressing.\n\nI'm in my 3rd year now doing interdisciplinary research in art and contemporary writing. I also supervise BA and MA students in research methods and writing for my field. I'm happy to share other suggestions via DM if you like.",

I would really recommend running your ideas by some academic contacts, whether that\u2019s from your Masters, undergrad or prospective supervisors. The latter are particularly important. They\u2019ll all have read more widely and will give you an idea of whether it\u2019s feasible. Sometimes they\u2019ll even give you ideas for a direction to go in.\n\nThe way I went about it (for a Masters proposal) was to start with a topic I had enjoyed studying at undergrad but found that the literature was lacking or that my professors weren\u2019t that familiar with it. I repeated the same for MA to PhD. I\u2019m in a more niche field though where I imagine more things are unstudied vs English. For English, perhaps you could look into emerging theories or historical approaches if you aren\u2019t doing modern lit? \n\nIt\u2019s a difficult task to get done but if you\u2019d like to continue in academia you\u2019ll end up doing it again for postdocs, fellowships, grants, etc. And of course it\u2019s not the be all end all, projects often end up changing later on down the line.",

      "text": "I don't think you need a whole year's worth of reading but you should have a handful or really crucial citations under your belt that accurately outline the \"hole\" your research is meant to fill.  The idea behind it isn't that you actually have to stick to what's there, or that's you've done it, just that you have enough of a grounding in your subject to know the school isn't wasting its time. Presumably you've already done an undergrad and potentially masters that led you to apply to the phd, so it's not like you're meant to be pulling it completely out of thin air.\n\nSomething else you might find useful is having a read through of published successful grant proposals. If you google around for successful SSHRC, Marsden/Fast Start, etc grants, and read through, you'll get an idea of what's possible in the amount of space and the kind of beats you should be hitting. To be honest, looking like you've already done \"too much\" can hurt your chances too. (You don't want to make it look like you've already finished the thing, or there's no reason to accept/fund you).\n\nMy program (in NZ, linguistics) didn't require a formal research proposal for the phd (though the doctoral scholarship I applied for - and won - did). At the six month mark (of a three-year program) you were expected to have a timeline, beefy proposal, and supervisor relationship set up, though, so having that initial proposal as a starting point helped.\n\nThe purpose of it isn't actually to dictate your entire program trajectory, but to show, in 1k words, that you have an idea of what you want to do, how to do it, why you're a good fit for the school, and why the school is a good fit for you, too. The lit/background is a relatively small part of that whole package and one of the least important, tbh. As long as you demonstrate you know the foundational/most important texts for the question you're interested in, and cite at least one of your potential supervisors-to-be in a relevant way, you'll be fine. (or at least, it won't be the lack of background reading in your proposal that makes your application fall over).",

Yes, students today are expected to know more than was the case decades ago, and to be better prepared to home in on dissertation topics and disciplinary specialties. But students still vary with regard to the maturity of their intentions and goals and many/most either do not know the exact topic of their future dissertation, or change it after starting a program. In exceptional cases, students that apply to programs in order to work with a specific professor are sometimes more specific. But in the social sciences and humanities it is still most important to articulate the big questions and approaches that interest you and why. Having everything \"baked in\" before you even start a PhD program seems to undermine much of the purpose. Are you in a STEM field?",

I examined his work using posthumanist theory and what is sometimes called critical animal studies. My advice is to choose an area that has been analyzed so that you have texts to work with but not so much that the topic is well-worn terrain. Narrow the topic of your project as much as possible. Skim some texts you can use to analyze it. When you write, explain what you\u2019ve found and how you will further the research. Name drop. Don\u2019t be afraid to be critical but not overly critical. When you finish writing, summarize everything you\u2019ve argued in or two sentences and then make that your thesis statement.\n\nI revised my thesis and published it as a book. I then returned to the US where I now work an insulting job because I did not want to continue working as a part-time adjunct faculty member and grocery store clerk to make ends meet. I applied for several full-time positions. I was offered three interviews and was never offered full-time work. I hope the situation is better there, but in the US, if you hold a PhD in a Humanities and have published an academic text, you will probably not find full-time work, even if you are more qualified than the full-time faculty. American academia is a mess, everyone knows it, and nothing will be done about it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be discouraging, but I think everyone should pursue their PhD because they are interested in the thesis, not because they want to work in academe.",

For those who are not trying to make a career in academia or who perform other high-paying positions and teach only \u201con the side,\u201d this is not a problem. But many adjuncts spend years not knowing how many classes they will teach each semester (1-3), so they never have a secure income. Also, they do not receive health insurance or many other benefits. Even with a PhD and publication, it is extremely difficult to get a full-time teaching position. Adjuncts often have to work a second job just to make enough income. I taught for five years as an adjunct at two separate colleges before deciding to pursue a PhD. After receiving my PhD and publishing a book, I still could not get a full-time position. I worked another as adjunct faculty while also working at a grocery store. Many of the higher-level administrators at many universities are interested more in numbers than students. They claim to support the arts but will not do anything to support such programs in higher education. At many universities, sexism is still rampant. Some of these problems are not solely American higher education problems, but others I believe are. I am not saying don\u2019t go to an American university. I am just saying do your research and know what you\u2019re getting into beforehand.",

My advice is to find an under-studied text and make an argument for why it is imperative that you study it. Remember, all research starts with a \"problem\" or question. Often, the problem is that no one talks about this work. That way, you can focus on the primary texts rather than secondary ones.\n\nAnd a proposal doesn't have to have a very specific thesis or argument. It's a proposal, you propose to study something and your thesis is \"this is important.\" It will absolutely change as you progress (and should!), but this will allow you wiggle room once you do start your in-depth research. \n\nDo you know anyone from whom you can borrow their proposal?

The prod to focus on an understudied text seems sound, and is, in fact, a strategy that has worked for me before - for example, in my undergraduate dissertation. The difficult is stringing that out for 100,000 words. Focusing on just one or even a few texts for a project of that length would be tricky, no?\n\nIt's the matter of importance I'm actually struggling with. I have an idea, although it does track quite closely to some extant literature, but is original. The trouble I have is articulating the wider significance of the project beyond just 'this is a new reading of these texts that's interesting and challenges the traditional view of how this bit of literature developed'.
