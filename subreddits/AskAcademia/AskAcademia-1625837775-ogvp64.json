There are a lot of low quality papers that I've read that felt like they were just being written because the author wanted to churn out publications, and I'm not sure the real value of these is really all that much. You also have papers proposing theories that are simply fundamentally wrong, and again I don't know how much value these hold.",

The \"real\" impact is harder to quantify, because even if a finding (say a compound, to follow your example) ends up not having an application, the knowledge gained to reach that point still accumulates.",

There are a multitude of issues from reproducibility to IP that must be navigated before a pharmaceutical company would even start to be interested. If an academic isn't willing or able to go to the next step of commercialisation odds are that result will simply go into the body of knowledge. Maybe someone else will use it to validate their own work which does get commercialised. \n\nTo get all the way from that initial result in a paper to a utilisable product or process requires some combination the things I mentioned before, plus lawyers, regulatory support staff, business development specialists, administrators, project managers and more.",

While not all, there are many professors who publish completely useless or irrelevant research, and are awarded tenure, not because of the merit of the work, but because of the number of publications they have. While I could go on and on, what I feel like I saw in academia was a form of \"natural selection\" (if you will) where all of the ones who have the most useful or relevant research skills are either pushed out through some systemic or institutional limitation (as I was), or leave because they feel that research in academia will make little to no relevant contribution. Them leaving creates a \"brain drain\" where the ones who are willing to sell their souls for pittance, and the ones who genuinely want to be there, are left. They move up the ranks, artificially rewarded by a system they have little interest in changing or challenging, because it worked for them; while they hypocritically complain about wanting systemic change and wanting to revolutionize their clearly limited institutions. Meanwhile, the ones with all of the relevant skillsets have moved on to industry or government, where their skills have practical and influential application, and they are earning far more money and are overall more satisfied with their careers. \n\nI only say this because I recently left an institution where everyone was screaming Black Lives Matter, but awarded tenure to a guy with a widely known racist history of behavior whose research focus was partly centered on how Black people are genetically predisposed to [insert negative attribute here]. Completely irrelevant to the liberation of Black people, Black bodies, and making no beneficial contribution to cultivating inclusion and diversity anywhere, or in any space; he was awarded tenure, simply because he published.",

But the more compounds assayed on high throughput screening, the more likely that 0.1% will be found and a target compound goes on to pre clinical testing. Just to watch it fail to gain approval for phase 1. Or fail phase 2 clinical. Or achieve marginally significant results to approve a phase 3 trial and fail there. Modern pharmaceutical development is just a minefield of failures. The profitability of small molecule drug development is unsustainable and is rapidly becoming a source of financial loss for for drug companies due to the number of failures. They have expanded to the point where research cannot keep up with their demand for new target compounds.",

My undergrad background is ecology/evobio and I absolutely love the field & it has definitely contributed to society, but couldn't overcome the doubts about the \"value\" and application of my work (and therefore job prospects) in myself. Definitely somewhat irrational, as all the people I worked with went on to do/finish PhDs and find careers, but those doubts led me to the field I did postgrad in and am absolutely in love with that does have clear and obvious \"value\" (spatial science/GIS). Guess I suffered from academic insecurity, but it led me somewhat I'm very happy with.",

The correct answer is really just \"because fuck the issues that society has\". Probably most of them aren't as important as the average person thinks anyway. Besides, one of society's main issues is that people lack the intellectual curiosity to appreciate understanding for its own sake. Theres more to life than technology/happiness/comfort, and gaining insight into reality is valuable (and benefits those who study it) in a way that cannot be reduced to\"building better toasters\" or whatever.",
