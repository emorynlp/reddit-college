  "title:": "What should I do about a professor at my medical school who spends a large part of our class time spreading misinformation.",
  "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is the right thread but I want to get a neutral party to weigh in on this. \nOne of my professors who teaches human anatomy and function starts off their lectures every class by mentioning something they disagree with regarding covid or a political issue, which would be fine except that they spend roughly 30 minutes of our hour and 20 minute lecture that we have twice a week lecturing us about things he disagrees with. Keep in mind our college exclusively teaches medicine and is apart of a functioning hospital. \nThis professor will inject remarks about Dr.Fauci having a mental impairment, or mention how Dr.Fauci is so short due to him lacking calcium during his childhood when they were lecturing about disorders of the nervous system and skeletal system. Their most recent remark was regarding the Covid vaccine and how ineffective it is and lectured about how ivermectin and aspirin as well as how hydroxychloroquine are all effective covid cures and the vaccine is not needed if we have those cures. They also routinely bring up masks and how they are ineffective and are stunting the worlds immune system.\nI was wondering if I should just ignore them when they start lecturing about topics like that like we have all been doing or if it is worth bringing up to the chair of the department.\nThank you so much for reading all that, \nTLDR: My anatomy prof routinely spends a large part of our classes lecture time spreading misinformation about covid, masks and other things and I wanted to get a neutral party\u2019s opinion on if it is worth bringing up to the chair of the department.",

This way, you can bring up that the issue is one of improper teaching and not a \"difference of opinion\". \n\nI say this as a current department chair of a science department. Information brought to me solely based on science vs misinformation is actionable, while differences in ideology would result in me having to reply that I can only ask the professor to spend class time effectively instead of potentially bringing this issue up the chain for some form of disciplinary hearing.",

      "text": "From a faculty view, students complain a lot about any discussion, whether on topic or off topic. And from my experience if something happens at level 2 out of 10 they present as level 9 out of 10, in other words they greatly exaggerate.  Also, I find students often want things to align with their view only (they think they are right) and they complain vehemently when things do not do so.  \n\nProfessors often mention or discuss topical events, and they often have an opinion, just as students do. They may do so because they want discussion, even on controversial topics, or they may just be ramblers.  If you are progressing toward stated learner outcomes and getting the content consider this is an, heh, added bonus.   If your university has a policy supporting free speech and/or viewpoint diversity you may not get far by complaining.  Academic freedom means the professor has a lot of leeway in how the class goes, so long as students are progressing toward stated learner outcomes, via content, homework etc. And in any one class there are always students who grump about how things go, with any set of methods. \n\nYou will find there are some profs you love, others you don't agree with, either because of their emphases, tones, methods, etc.  There may be students in your class who think this prof is the very best of all. I say suffer it out, learn to the best of your ability the content of the course and move on, knowing that both in education and in the working world you'll have to deal with people who do things differently and who hold views different from your own. \n\nYou're going to have a very tough time \"proving\" your claims, even though you think you're on the right side of the controversial issues. And, I doubt it's a legal issue at all. From a Dean's perspective, they know some profs ramble or rant a bit.  It's part and parcel of having profs.  I don't see much here, beyond the interjection of a prof's opinions that would trigger any disciplinary action.  It's not worth their time because it would then get legal between the prof and the Dean or school very fast and the Dean or school would probably lose. \n\nFinally,  a students job, in part, is to use their critical analytical skills to separate the wheat from the chaff and not to take everything as incontrovertible fact.  Your job is to consider it all -- to identify the junk and let it slide away while also identifying the best and retaining it.  Even students in discussions can often mis-present evidence or offer opinions that go uncorrected.  Or a prof might mis quote something from the text in error. Nobody's perfect. This identifying what's important or true for you, or more generally, is something that must reside with the student because, as you point out, one cannot always trust everything someone else says, even in a formal classroom setting.",
