  "text": "I'm in a sticky situation right now. I joined a PhD program last year (Fall) in the US. But I haven't been able to find an advisor yet. It is a rotation-based program. Two of my rotations went unmatched and none of the other labs seem to have funding because of COVID. So, further rotations don't seem possible. I already have a masters and I've used my OPT period (International student). But I'm not sure what I should do right now since I want to apply again for other PhD programs (maybe for next year). Should I drop-out and explain why I did so or should I try to master-out within a year (as I apply for other programs)? I'd greatly appreciate any insights that you can provide. Thanks!",

      "text": "I'm slightly horrified by this. I'm not in the US but we have rotation programs and a student would never be left without a lab. If the rotations went really badly a conversation might be had about them mastering out or leaving, but a student would never be left in limbo like this. I'm shocked. Have you spoken to the program coordinator? Are there other students in the same position? \n\nI know the other commentor said don't leave with nothing but I'm not sure I agree. You could spend a significant amount of time getting a master's when it's possible you could already have started a new PhD. If your program can't get its shit together, I would contact a few programs at other universities and see what they say about applying.",

      "text": "From what I understand transfers are actually possible although rare. Maybe if you have a supportive director and a good idea of which school and labs you'd rather be in, you can establish relationships with those goal PIs and make sure they have space and funding for you. Then your director can facilitate the transfer. It's a long shot but if it works you'd lose the least of the energy you've put in so far. Good luck!",

      "text": "If ideally you\u2019d stay in the PhD program, then I\u2019d advise:\n- Contact the department right now. Isn\u2019t there a graduate student office? They will help.\n- Also contact the graduate student association, both the university\u2019s and your department\u2019s, and explain your predicament. They will help as well.\n- Look into alternative funding options: teaching assistantships\u2026?\n\nIf you want to leave:\n- Contact the international student office or whatever your university has in place to help international students navigate the us system. Explain the situation. You will be given possible strategies to make this work. \n- If appropriate contact your department and explain what is going on and why, and what you would need from them.\n\n\nIdeally there should be a way to have you stay in your current program on a reduced tuition for a short time - enough for you to find another program. But ultimately if the law says you should leave before you can come back, then you should leave.",
