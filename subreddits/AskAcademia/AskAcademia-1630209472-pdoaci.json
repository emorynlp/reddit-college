  "title:": "Received email from Chair asking for student comments on Advisor\u2019s Performance",
  "text": "Wasn\u2019t really sure what flair to use, sorry!\n\nHi, I just received an email from my department chair that reads as following: \n\n\u201cThe Department of YYY solicits letters from students commenting on the performance of Dr. XXX for consideration in retention of Dr. XXX\u201d \n\nI\u2019m a brand new grad student (MS) at the university and my advisor is the Professor they want letters about. I am in one of their classes, but we\u2019ve only had a week of classes. I have been working closely with them over the summer, applying for grants etc so it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t built a relationship with them yet. \n\nSounds like it\u2019s for tenure review, but he just got the TT job a year ago, so isn\u2019t it a little soon for this? And should I mention to my advisor that I received this email?",

If you have questions, you should ask your chair.\n\nAt my school, faculty up for evaluation send a name of potential students to the department, and the department selects other students random.",
