  "title:": "I had a mild brain injury during my PhD program ... Now unsure about my future",
  "text": "My fiance suggested I create this account to talk about this issue, new to this community and just hoping to get some thoughts and perspective... \n\nSo, a little background.... As I was going through my masters (and even before that) I felt like I would be really happy going the academic job route. There were a lot of things that I liked about it, so I decided to pursue a PhD (in natural resources/fisheries/ecology). All was going well enough, and I was preparing myself to one day enter the academic job market. About 3.5 years in to my program, and after passing my comprehensive exams, I got a concussion from a mild injury. Most people the symptoms pass within a few weeks, but unfortunately I became one of about 30% of people that get post concussion syndrome. I continued to deal with headaches, dizziness, extreme fatigue, etc.... Had to take some time off for an unofficial medical leave, and then came back to finish my degree. I continued with my concussion rehab for the past almost 2 years while writing my thesis, and I'm proud to say that I made it through all of this and will be defending in a few weeks.\n\nThat brings me to the point of this post.... Prior to my injury, I was preparing myself for an academic position. It's all I've considered for so long, but with my current health status and the outlook for improvements, I no longer think it's the right path for me. I just can't realistically push my brain and body for 50-60 hour weeks to get through the application process and getting tenure. \n\nWhich leaves me thinking .... what kind of career paths could I consider ? How could I use the skills I learned during graduate school in fisheries ? Has anyone else gone through a career change after their PhD? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "The selection process can be a bit tough but you can look at positions related to your field in government at USAjobs.gov.  You would qualify at the GS-11 level and be eligible for the \"recent graduate\" filter and \"pathways\" programs. You could find work in research or more policy/administrative/regulatory capacities.\n\nThe work/life balance in government is much better than academia. But the work is stable, career growth is fairly structured and to my knowledge,  government employees are somewhat discouraged from working more than 40 hr/week unless necessary. I believe that the general trend for research roles is that you have a much better work life balance but less autonomy over what you are researching (You study what your job details and supervisor/management request).\n\nYou can look at the US Forest Service, state departments of fish and wildlife, departments of natural resources, the EPA, USGS, etc.",

My PhD happens to be on dizziness in post-concussion syndrome, and as a physician I see a number of patients completely distraught by not being able to get help. You are most certainly not alone, because this is far more common than most realize. My experience is that almost everyone can see improvements with the right rehabilitation, but the issue is reaching that first clinical contact who recognizes the phenomenon. Kenneth Ciuffreda has published several papers on how rehabilitation can look, if the dizziness or light sensitivity is your main concern. Most of my patients get some help from +1 glasses with +2 inward-prisms, possibly some coloured filter as well, to ease symptoms to start visual rehabilitation therapy. \nI have seen this work on so many patients, and while I dont know you, dont give up! There is help to get!",

It doesnt always work, but when it does it can be quite remarkable in relieving some of the hypersensitivity to visual stimuli many experience. Optometry exams are generally based on 20th century working conditions, and today we have so much more near-distance work that those parameters are obsolete. We often see what we call a \"forced head tilt\" with a trochlear palsy, to adjust for the eye position. I'm venturing a guess that you may experience some double vision after reading for a bit, which prisms may relieve by forcing the eyes together. I would certainly recommend seeing an optometrist and asking to test some out.",

Her GP thinks she has some depth perception issues. \n\nShe went from top of her class to a C student. She developed chronic headaches, depression, anxiety, and ADD. The fatigue and dizziness were there, too. She went to a bunch of different doctors, including neurologists, and all she got were meds for pain management. \n\nI can\u2019t offer insight into your situation, but your post is such a comfort to read because it makes me feel a bit less alone. No one at her university, including some of her friends, seemed to take her situation seriously. It got laughed off because she just hit her head on a door\u2014not like she was a football player, right? She kept getting written off as lazy by both her peers and preceptors. This went on during three years of pharmacy school, and it\u2019s been two years since graduation. She\u2019s still dealing with symptoms. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to say that I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you. She went through a whole identity crisis given that, like you, she had to reevaluate her goals. She barely made it through school, and she knew she\u2019d never be able to do a residency. Luckily, she ended up with a good job that hasn\u2019t exacerbated her health issues too much. I hope your situation has a better outlook than hers, but even she\u2019s flourishing\u2014just not in the way we planned. I also hope that our story helps you feel less alone with such an insidious injury.",

At my current institution, one publication a year is enough for tenure, and at a previous liberal arts college, one publication every two years was fine.  Both were 3/3 teaching loads.  You do not need 50-60 hours weeks to do that.  In fact, to be honest about my present place, unless they are teaching a night class, you never see any faculty member in their office late and probably only 25% show up on Fridays.

The principal of \"forever wild\" is actually part of our state constitution.

About 5 years ago I had a TIA that causes me to totally lose hearing in one ear and gave me crazy vertigo for a long time. Months of vestibular therapy. That's a big reason why I left the workforce and started my PhD.

I personally know 1 tenured prof, 1 assistant prof, 1 lecturer, 1 private sector former grad student and 2 current grad students who had concussions of various sorts, at least two of whom had prolonged post-concussive syndrome - and I'm sure it was underreported.\n\nIf you've been in rehab for two years, you already know the drill. Things can take years to resolve themselves. They may still continue to improve (though I don't want to give false hope in case they don't). But regardless, the timing might not work out with the timelines expected in academia (academia doesn't usually look well upon career gaps).\n\nMaybe consider lecturing, if you like it? Lecturing is at least somewhat flexible, and it does not have as demanding an application process. Community college teaching? SLAC?\n\nOr, I highly agree with the other poster that recommended government. Government is strictly 35-40 hours a week - and often less if you can get away with it (long lunch breaks... but of course it depends where you work).\n\nBest of luck.",

Frankly, many government jobs do really really well when it comes to accommodations for just about anything (within reason). \n\nI know the forest service and our state (and I assume others) both have a wide variety of fish related jobs.",

If you want to push yourself and go for this then do it. There is still a chance of success. If you think it is too much for you and you having doubts if you want to do it then maybe it is not a good idea. The chances of success are maybe just too small.",
