  "title:": "Want to report a PI from five years ago for past sexual harassment, what's the process?",
  "text": "[Long story](https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/grwps5/exlab_rat_is_it_cool_if_i_rant_about_the_bs/) short, several years ago I worked as an RA in a lab where my PI eventually held my job hostage in exchange for having an on-going sexual relationship with her. I never reported it, but now I'm seriously considering doing so. I know nothing about going about it though so I've got some questions:\n\n1. Can I even still report this if I haven't worked there in over five years? I should note that she kept contacting me since then for years, and I had to get a restraining order awhile back. Her most recent attempt to contact me was less than a year ago.\n2. Who would I report it to? The title IX coordinator? HR?\n3. I have no clue about the process, what I need, or what to expect. What should I know and where can I go to find out more about this?",

This abuse of power should NEVER happen, though it is unfortunately common given the enduring hierarchy in the academy. Title IX is an option, but keep in mind that it is built solely to protect the university, not students or victims.\n\nAnother option could potentially be to report to the department head. If you feel that they would be supportive.\n\nThe most important thing as that you feel safe! Speak with a lawyer as others have mentioned, but also talk to a therapist if you are able to.",

                  "text": "I wish I saw the same thing. I have seen the turnover rates of Title IX coordinators at multiple institutions. Best case scenario in my anecdotal experience is that a well intentioned director can only do so much to protect victims when the office itself is there to protect federal dollars.\n\nI\u2019ve also been to multiple Title IX training seminars held by well intentioned people trying their best to protect students, but are required to teach faculty to not encourage sexual violence disclosure unless they are committed to reporting to Title IX. This perpetuates silence and protects people in power.\n\nTo the OP. Title IX is an option. Look into the office at your institution to decide if that is right for you. If you do report through them, have an advocate with you.",

The fact that the federal government mandates it\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t undermine the important mission it serves, nor the university\u2019s commitment to it.\n\nI have seen turnover in those jobs as well, and discussed it with our Title IX Director.  It is a high-stress job, not because of pressure from above, but because of the nature of the work itself.",

I wish I could promise you'll have a positive experience with your university's specific Title IX coordinator, but obviously I can't; but I can say that they're absolutely going to be the most informed about your potential options (and will be able to answer #1 and #3 better than anyone here can) and hopefully will be as wonderful and helpful as the Title IX coordinator I've been able to work with is.",
