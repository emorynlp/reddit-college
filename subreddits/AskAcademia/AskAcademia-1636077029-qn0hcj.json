      "text": "I have!  Get yourself an old school agenda and use it! Never leave assignments until the last minute!  Prioritize sleep!  Set boundaries at work with picking up OT.  If you have group projects, within the first few weeks of class- figure out when you\u2019re going to get together to work on it!  Use microsoft teams/ word on onedrive/ google drive to do assignments! You can do a video/ audio call while you all work on the same document/ powerpoint in real time.",

      "text": "Learn to schedule and prioritize your commitments! No more leaving assignments last minute. Get ahead of the game right when you have them assigned. But be sure to give yourself time off! For me, I would take one vacation day off work and school and just focus on me as a mental health day. With that kind of schedule it can be exhausting and draining and the risk of burnout is there. Be kind to yourself and let yourself have breaks.",

      "text": "Honestly, I'd recommend trying to do one of those part time. I did a full time master's and a part time job working at the same university as I was doing my masters with a very flexible boss, so I was working between classes and had no travel time. I was still in the library at 7am and leaving campus at 10pm every weekday and studying 8-10h each day on the weekend. I had an absolute ball, loved my time doing that but I couldn't have sustained it much longer and I can't even imagine doing a full time job. \n\nIf you can't afford to go part time at work I'd have a think about doing the masters part time. No shame in that.",

      "text": "I worked in research full time during my first year of grad school I was doing 12 credits/semester and genuinely struggled. I would not recommend. My mental and physical health plummeted and didn\u2019t perform as good as I needed. Tbh I would highly advise working part time on a low stakes position. Prioritize yourself and your studies.
