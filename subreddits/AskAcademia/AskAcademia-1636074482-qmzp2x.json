  "title:": "Would a bad program director ruin my grad experience?",
  "text": "I got admitted into a Master's program at a prestigious school. During my first advising meeting with the program director, I've sensed a few red flags that got me worried about working with the director:\n\n1.) During that meeting, I've asked if I could substitute a pre-approved class because the original course is not being offered in the upcoming semester. The director proposed a course that was not relevant to the pre-approved course, so I asked if there were other options that I could take that were more related to the topic. The director then told me, \"This program is tailored to study field A; if you wanted to study a different field, you should look into other programs.\"\n\n2.) I also asked the director if I could take fewer courses in the first semester as I'm still trying to find the best workload for me. The director told me \"you're here to study, not here to \"hang out\" with other students...and wanted me to \"immersive\" myself in academia the first semester. Then recommended not to take fewer credit hours.\n\nI felt terrible after meeting the director. While some of the person's words make sense to me, I felt unwelcome and started to wonder if I should continue with the program.\n\nLater, I found out the director is also a harsh grader who gives students Cs, and Ds on assignments. That got me worried about if spending the next two years with this program director would potentially ruin my time at grad school.",

To provide more context, my program is pretty flexible and allows us to take 2 -4 courses each semester, and I was hoping to take 2 courses instead of 4, which still fulfills the program's course requirements. What concerns me the most is that the director makes a judgemental call regarding my intention and assumes I do not value education in our first advising meeting.",

If there's a conflict, their job is to defend the rigor of the educational program rather than your ease of getting through it.\n\nNow, it does sound like the director is perhaps a bit unnecessarily rough and impatient, for which I'm sorry about your experience. Ideally, they could have explained the reasoning a bit further in the first scenario and offered to connect you with some helpful resources in the latter. But, fundamentally, the director did their job; I'd hardly call that a red flag.",

(This is how my department works, but I also know there are programs where the director is the academic advisor for the entire program and that was how I read your post.) \n\nIf you theoretically can have a different academic advisor, I would highly encourage getting re-assigned if you can. Because the roles of program director and academic advisor (i.e., advocating for your advisee's best educational outcome) can conflict, I think it always sucks for students when they get assigned to the program director as academic advisor. It's nuts that the program director is even in the pool of options for that. \n\nUnfortunately, this would require finding a faculty member willing to take you on and contriving a not-offensive reason for the switch. I'm not sure if that's entirely feasible, but putting out a few feelers is a good idea.",

This, for example:\n\n>, \"This program is tailored to study field A; if you wanted to study a different field, you should look into other programs.\"\n\nIs absolutely true. Grad school isn't like college, where you can take classes just because you're interested in them. You're there to fulfill a specific course of study. There's a reason those classes aren't pre-approved. You can audit or sit in on other classes, but a grad school program is a very focused thing, and the director's statements here are correct.\n\n>The director told me \"you're here to study, not here to \"hang out\" with other students...and wanted me to \"immersive\" myself in academia the first semester. Then recommended not to take fewer credit hours.\n\nThis is also true, and good advice. Your workload is what the workload is; you don't really get to tailor it based on what suits you, unless you want to switch to a part-time degree.\n\nI'm genuinely confused by this post. Nothing here is out of line or surprising. I think your expectations about grad school are inaccurate.",

You don't have the option, here or in any program, to take just courses that interest you - even if they are somewhat related to approved courses. This is an issue arising from misconceptions on your end.",

      "text": "It may be that your Director doesn't have a great communication style, but as others have already said, these answers are not red flags in and of themselves.\n\nI have a fair bit of experience as Course Director of a Master's, so I feel like I have some possible insight into the rationale on both issues:\n\n>During that meeting, I've asked if I could substitute a pre-approved elective course with other courses that were not on the pre-approved list since the pre-approved course is not being offered every year. The director proposed a course that was not relevant to the pre-approved course, so I asked if there was another course that I could take that was more related to the topic. The director then told me, \"This program is tailored to study field A; if you wanted to study a different field, you should look into other programs.\"\n\nThere's often a lot of work that goes into curriculum planning each year, and the classes that have been put onto the course syllabus as pre-approved options are very carefully thought through. Obviously, they are selected because of fit with the programme's aims. But there are other factors at play in many instances, especially if they are cross-listed from other Master's courses.  Sometimes Master's courses will not allow students from other programmes to take their classes at all due to concerns about class sizes or worries that outsiders will not possess unofficial prerequisites; at other times, there are *very complex* behind-the-scenes negotiations that have happened between departments (e.g. 'You can cross-list class A for your students only if we can cross-list class B for ours'). In my experience, negotiations with other Course Directors about cross-listing particular classes often come down to issues of resourcing and class size, as well as how territorial individual programmes are about restricting certain things to only their own cohort of students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I also asked the director if I could take fewer courses in the first semester as I'm still trying to find the best workload for me. The director told me \"you're here to study, not here to \"hang out\" with other students...and wanted me to \"immersive\" myself in academia the first semester. Then recommended not to take fewer credit hours.\n\nThis sounds like it may have been poorly phrased/communicated, but I have had similar conversations with Master's students who wanted to split their courses into a 2-4 (or, less commonly, 4-2) across academic semesters instead of a balanced 3 classes in first semester and 3 in second. My experience is that imbalance always leads to trouble. Taking 4/3 of a full-time Master's programme simply isn't realistic for most students and leads to high levels of stress, poor marks, and regrets. So I quickly stopped allowing this altogether and started telling Master's students they had to evenly balance their workload of taught classes across semesters. I'm going to guess that your Course Director is using similar reasoning based on experience of past students' outcomes.",

I understand how a nicer tone or a nicer phrasing would have made it all sound better and perhaps more compelling,but programs are what they are and flexibility is often not our strongsuit, even if we try. A grad program needs structure and rigour, and a 1st year MA student is in no position to determine what is too much. 2 graduate courses a semester sound like 1 too few, 4 like 1 too many, even if those options are 'allowed.\" Regarding that professor's grading: be careful. Most grad programs (the ones ive been to either as a student or as faculty) have struct policies and falling below certain grade (maybe a B) may impact your funding or TAship. Good luck.",
