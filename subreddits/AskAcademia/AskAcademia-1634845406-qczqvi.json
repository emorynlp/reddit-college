  "text": "Someone I know is a finalist for the [R&D100 Award](https://rd100awards.com/), which supposedly recognizes the most promising new products, processes, materials, or software developed throughout the world and introduced to the market the previous year. \n\nApparently, awards are based on each achievement's technical significance, uniqueness, and usefulness, and selection committee claims it's \"the most prestigious innovation awards program for the past 58 years, honoring great R&D pioneers and their revolutionary ideas in science and technology.\"\n\nHas anyone heard of this award and is it really a big deal, or just marketing?",
