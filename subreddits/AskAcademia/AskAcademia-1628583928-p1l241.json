  "title:": "Personal statement for 1-yr US postdoc \u2013 advice needed, please",
  "text": "Hi everyone,  \n\n\nI'm due to finish a 3-yr Humanities postdoc in the UK soon and have no experience with US academia, so I'd be really grateful for your insights. I'm applying for a one-year research-focused postdoc and along with the usual material (proposal, writing sample, etc.), they ask for a personal statement (max. one page, double-spaced). The exact phrasing is: **\"Please provide a short personal statement describing how your life experiences and background have influenced your journey/intellectual trajectory as a scholar.\"** \n\n  \nI've never had to write anything even remotely like this since applying for undergrad nearly 20 yrs ago (and what I wrote then was mega-cringey). I have some vague ideas of what to write but I'm not exactly sure what they want, or where to start. I'm also not sure of how 'personal' to get, if that makes sense. Any tips or constructive advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks.",

      "text": "The personal statement is a story in which the inevitable conclusion the reader should take away is that you are someone they want for their position. \n\nYou're basically answering the question, \"Why are you even doing this ridiculous line of work, anyway? Who _are_ you?\" You want them to come away thinking, \"this person not only has a great CV, but is exactly the kind of person we need to have more of around here.\"\n\nThis is also a place where you might bring up anything contextual that might be missing from your application materials (like \"why there is a 1-year gap in my CV: because I was caring for my sick parents\"). \n\nThis is absolutely part of the application materials and you need to take it seriously. You can get as personal as you want, but treat it as an official part of your application. They will possibly read it carefully, and these sorts of things can make the difference if you and another top candidate are essentially the same \"on paper.\"\n\nBe selective about what you share, and feel free to spin things (within the reach of honestly and ethics) in a way that (again) works towards the inevitable conclusion of them accepting you. \"I decided to go into academia because I hated working a desk job at a company -> Even though I was great at my desk job at a company, I felt the pull for something more intellectual...\"\n\nIt can also be a place where you indicate any (legitimate) diversity you bring to the field. But if you aren't diverse, don't turn it into a faux diversity narrative; those are easy to smell coming, and they are _very common_ at the moment in American applications (there is a lot of \"I am doing this under adverse circumstances, I am a victim and a survivor\" from people who are really not doing it under any more adverse circumstances than the average person \u2014 if you really have had adverse circumstances that explain who you are and why you do what you do, bring them up, but if not, don't go there). \n\nIf it is only one page and double-spaced, they want you to be _very_ selective about what you share. So keep it punchy and specific. Every sentence should count. Don't duplicate what is already in your other materials, but you can personalize them in a way you might not do in, say, a research statement (\"I was led to this topic because of X and Y personal experiences...\").",

Pretty unusual for a postdoc.\n\nIt might be helpful to start with the second part of the question and work backwards. What is your scholarly focus? What are your scholarly goals? What is on your research wish-list? ...and *why* is that your focus, and goals, and wish-list? What is the narrative that got you to those things? The narrative doesn't have to be of a personal focus. You can write it around the story of your work/concepts, and probably enough personal info/background will leave its imprint on that.",
