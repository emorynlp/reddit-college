  "title:": "It really grinds my gears when companies don\u2019t reference studies they\u2019ve used in publicly available reports. Would you tell your fellow academics in the field?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been working on my PhD for the past 3.5 years (UK), where the end result of my thesis was to provide practical recommendations to governmental bodies, private bodies and local clubs, through the research I\u2019ve done (nearly there, very close to submission!). I\u2019ve been working my fingers to the bone, really trying to connect with lay audiences to do outreach over the last couple of years, and over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been getting some positive feedback from a few people about the work - so something\u2019s working.\n\nOne national governing body whom I\u2019ve approached in the past but they haven\u2019t been so cooperative, have just put out a report in the last week, in the area. They\u2019ve got a whole page in the report on \u201cstudies have shown that participation in [activity] reduces hypertension, etc...\u201d. Yet nowhere in the paper, anywhere, have they cited or referenced the studies they are referring to. It\u2019s a small field, so I know which papers they are referring to. To be honest, I can\u2019t even tell for sure if they\u2019ve used my work specifically, but I know for a fact that they\u2019ve used studies from other fellow researchers in the field and they haven\u2019t received the recognition they deserve.\n\nMan, it really grinds my gears that companies are allowed to do this and not cite or reference any papers, when we\u2019ve worked so hard on research. If we did that in academia we would get so much hate thrown at us - why aren\u2019t private companies held to account either? \n\nWould you make a point of telling the other academics whose work it\u2019s using, or just leave it?\n\nTL;DR - private company uses loads of studies to make their point in a report, but doesn\u2019t cite or reference any of the papers in the report. Would you notify the other academics?",
