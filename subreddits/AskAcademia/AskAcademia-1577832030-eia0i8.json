I also use Evernote for notes, thoughts, saving entire webpages, and even for keeping my handwritten notes - Evernote has a scan function that you use with your phone camera. Both Evernote and Bookends integrate with Scrivener. \n\nScrivener alone is even useful for keeping track of information and sources as it has an index card system (that looks like index cards), and you can add entire articles as PDFs, webpages, and so on. If you then use its split-screen feature you can have an article in one screen and your note taking in the other. Scrivener also has over 1,000,000 YouTube video tutorials, and the community is very supportive so any problems you run into are usually easily and quickly solved :)",

Scribbling on and flipping through cards are strangely satisfying.\n\nI can't say I have a perfect system but I dedicate one card to each text I read, putting the author, year, and short title on the upper right-hand corner. I write down paraphrases (or direct quotes that I'm certain about using) in the main body, page numbers on the left margin, and author/date of works cited in that text on the right margin, so I can quickly reference who quoted who and keep track of my bibliographical searches (well not all the time, but it really helps when I commit to it). My cards are somewhat colour-coded by topics, despite it getting fuzzy as it progresses.\n\nWhen it comes to write-up, I organise the cards into the order I find flowing, and transfer the paraphrases/quotes/bullet points onto the screen and transform them into regular prose. I work best alternating between pen/paper and computer so it might not be for you, but that's how I keep my sanity when cooking up my literature review.",

I think other methods often create just an extra layer of steps to get through. I always suggest to cite-as-you-go in Zotero or Endnote but don't use those programs' notes section, preferring to put the notes into the text directly.",

      "text": "I think this depends a lot on the field and design of the dissertation. There's a huge range out there, and a dramatic difference between a dissertation in math vs. one in history. Are you saving a hundred sources and a few hundred quotations? Or working with thousands of each? Doing content analysis, or focusing on a single formula?\n\nIn history-- my field --many dissertations will have thousands of sources and potentially quotes or at least notes from a high percentage of those.  Any bibliographic management software should work for that-- zotero, refworks, endnote, whatever you have access to.\n\nOr you can create a database of your own. Or use a document (or series of documents) to do that. Or if you're doing content analysis link the software you're using for that to your bib manager.\n\nMy diss had about 4K total sources (lots of newspaper work) and I managed that with a now-defunct software called Papyrus (that originated as a DOS product!) It worked a lot like Endnote. Ultimately any searchable database that will link your citations and your notes/quotes should do the trick.  Figuring out your keywords will be an important element of the work-- and can help with indexing should you turn it into a book someday.",

I have a folder there for the dissertation (I converted it all into Endnote when revising for publication years ago) and that has almost 6K sources in it. My complete Endnote is about 10K references. They are often struggling to keep track of 20-30 sources for a paper but assume they can do it in a Word file...which is fine for a single project, but I can quickly show them the value of starting with Endnote (or similar) their first year in college and building their personal reference database as they go through their major.  Some of my senior research students have 1K+ sources in theirs, which I also use as examples in class.\n\nNone-the-less I do end up with foolish students who occasionally try the \"I'll fill in the sources later\" style of drafting, which always leads to disaster.     Despite the fact that I tell them I will not read drafts that lack proper notes, I still get one or two each year...which I promptly return unread.",
