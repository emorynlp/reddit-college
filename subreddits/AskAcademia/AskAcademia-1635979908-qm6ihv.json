  "title:": "Paying a university for research and only getting a license for the IP, not ownership",
  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI work with a startup who are paying universities to assist with development of a particular product. I'm  working with a few uni's in my home country which allocate the payer  the IP developed. I am now in talks with a foreign university who are an  expert in a very important particular part we require. The only problem is that the  foreign university keeps the IP developed and a license agreement is  agreed upon for us to use the IP.\n\nThat has turned me  off a little, however, I wonder if my expectations and experiences are  backwards - is my home country's universities giving the payer the IP the unusual situation?\n\nEither  way, I had thought of taking the research to one of my home country's  universities and seeing if they can achieve the mild improvements we're  after in the research and getting to keep the IP ourselves. Problem is  the home country's universities are not experts in this particular  field.\n\nI know it looks better to  future investors if we own the IP instead of licensing it however I'm  concerned about the foreign uni (who holds the expertise) working  with another competitor in the future giving them licenses to more  advanced tech. Thoughts?",

My understanding is that it is pretty normal for peer institutions.\n\nHard to give thoughts without more information, but I would suggest exploring the local institution if you think there is a shot at making progress. Many many different factors, however.",

      "text": "It would be really unusual at my US institution for the university not to retain ownership of the IP. I'm not sure we even *can* agree to that legally without endangering our tax exempt status.  Various types of licensing are available including exclusive commercial licensing, which sponsors may choose to pay for to ensure no other third party gets a crack at the IP. But it would still be owned by the institution and could be used by the institution for research purposes. And typically an exclusive license has terms attached to it where the IP could revert back to the university if the company doesn't meet its obligations.\n\nConceptually, as a university, the research work we do should never be work for hire, solely benefitting a company or other sponsor. It's essential that it always have a basic research underpinning that we can publish and continue to research for the general good of public knowledge. There are some exceptions around classified projects but generally, the perception that we were just doing work at a company's behest that would be only for the company's benefit would get us in a lot of trouble and is to be avoided.\n\nOther countries may not have the same set of legal and tax issues at play, but that may give you some sense of why you're seeing this, if you're working with the US or a country with similar laws.",

          "text": "Thanks for this, very helpful. Yes I thought I should check in to global norms and understanding the complexities before going and trying to persuade them to allocate us the IP. I'll still give it a go but can understand both sides of the argument ie research should principally be for future generations to build upon rather than private entities to profit from. Much appreciated.",

      "text": "If the work requires the experts' knowledge but doesn't explicitly require university resources (like laboratory space and equipment controlled by the university), you may be better off contacting researchers and negotiating a consulting arrangement instead. Universities typically have rules that researchers have to abide by in these arrangements to avoid conflicts of interest, but you could set whatever IP controls you want in a consulting contract.",

      "text": "So we generally don't do service provision with a couple of strategic exceptions but if you paid us to do the research the research it would be your IP. If we're doing the research in collaboration then it's our IP and we'd license it to you. Obviously the difference can be subjective but if we're investing research time and driving the intellectual input we'd say it was a collaboration and our IP.",
