  "text": "Hi all,\nCurrently having a dilemma and need some advice. So a job was recently posted for a lab coordinator/manager position at a university that I was planning on reaching out/applying to for my Ph.D. next year (starting in Fall 2022). I am currently working a similar job, but this one would potentially offer higher pay, amongst a few other things.\n\nSo my question is, is it worth applying to this job and potentially screwing up my ability to do my Ph.D. at this school if I get rejected? Or should I just stick with my current job and apply to the Ph.D. program like I had planned on (as if this new job never existed)? I just don't want to miss out on a good job if the school doesn't have Ph.D. funding. Should I reach out about the Ph.D. funding first and depending on that decide on applying for the job?\n\nAny advice is appreciated! Thank you!",

I know a handful of people that have done masters degrees part-time while working at the uni (for example, in digihum labs), and had those jobs subsidize the tuition (as well as often accommodate the timing - allowing 4-day work weeks, for example).",
