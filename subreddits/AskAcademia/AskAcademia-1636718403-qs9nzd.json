  "text": "Hi! I'm a PhD student and I'm currently questioning whether the academic lifestyle is appropriate for me or not.\n\nI have been working in my current lab since the beginning of my Master's (2017). After my personal experience and from what I've observed, there's this equation in my head that I really dislike: *being in academia=having to work (or thinking about work) in the evenings and on the weekends.* I really envy my friends who shut down their PC while leaving the office and almost never think about any work-related thing until the next work day. \n\nI would like to think that my experience has been like this because of my poor time management and boundary-setting skills. If there are some academics who say \"I almost never work outside work hours and I'm doing completely fine\", then I will believe that I can change this situation and I will be more motivated to work on myself.\n\nWhat are your experiences?\n\nThanks so much in advance.",

      "text": "How you manage your work life balance is up to you.\n\nPersonally, 95% of the time I can leave work alone when I get home. I haven't worked an evening or over a weekend for months. There are crunch times when it can get messy - either big piles of marking, or grant deadlines looming. Sometimes I need to stay a bit later in the office so I can have the rest of the evening to myself. But how you manage that is on you. Yes, this means I have turned down some things, and decided not to try and get X done in a given time frame. But this is a case of prioritisation - choose to do the tasks that have maximum return on effort. Write the important paper, let the messy and uninteresting project sit on the sidelines until you want to go back to it. Work on the committee you're interested and engaged in, don't sign up for things you can't guarantee you have time for. Schedule everything and keep to it. If you have 1 hour allocated for a meeting, don't let it over-run. There are so many things you can do to manage your time.\n\nAcademia will eat up as much times as you let it. I could easily work 80 hours a week and still find more to do. Once you realise that, then working out what amount of time you are willing to sacrifice is a personal choice.\n\nAnyone saying you can't be a successful academic AND have a healthy work-life balance is just perpetuating toxic nonsense. I suspect they were the same lab-martyrs who spent 80 hours a week on their PhD in the lab, with 50% of that time spent telling everyone how much they were working, and the other 50% working at 1/2 of the pace of anyone else because they were exhausted and burnt out.",

Very happy for you that you have a good work life balance.\n\nI just have to ask one more thing, I should've asked this in my main question. Were you always like that? When you were a grad student for example? Or did you learn to find the good balance as time passed by in academic life?",

      "text": "For me, graduate school was the thick of things. 5 years of overtime. Year 1, 95-105 hour weeks on average. Years 2-3, 80 hours on average. Years 4-5, 60. Now closer to 50-55 and sustained for the past 4 years.\n\nTbh, there isn't much difference in QOL between 40 and 55. That is essentially just showing up at 7 instead of 9, and tinkering around with literature or figure making for a few hours on the weekend. But, that extra time adds 2x the productivity. In a world where career advancement is based on competition, any added benefit to your CV goes a long way, and the standards for success are quite high.\n\nThat being said, if you are genuinely good at time management, you can accomplish a ton in 9-5. You have to just learn how and keep every minute purposeful. That is sufficient time to succeed, but you can't waist time, ever.\n\nAlternatively if you are ok being a scientist for life and never a faculty member, a chill 9-5 filled with down time as you wait for someone to tell you what to do is perfectly acceptable. Just don't expect to advance past that career stage.\n\nIn short, it's doable but you need to have the skills to do it.\n\nEdit: and to the other guys point, yes I talk about how much time I put into graduate school so you know the barometer of what people put in. And it was pretty filled with active time. The difference between now and then really just comes down to learning how to be efficient with time and knowing how to do things proficiently. It takes a ton of repetition to get things down in my field and the only way to get better is through high throughput failure.",
