  "title:": "Editor pulled book from award consideration, failed to tell contributors that she had written a book that was nominated in the same category",
  "text": "I'm a few years out of my graduate program, but I still feel like I'm figuring out the unwritten rules of academia. I have a unique situation here that I was hoping others could comment on. \n\nAbout two years ago, I was invited to submit a short piece (1,000 words) to an anthology of topics in my field. Over 50 of us had pieces included in the book. We were not paid (which we were all told upfront,) nor were the 20 or so people who edited our entries. This was a somewhat unusual situation where the person originally putting together the anthology passed away suddenly. A colleague of his (\"Dr. Smith\") took over the project and recruited all of the writers/editors. \n\nThe book did fairly well and was even nominated for an award from a well-known association in our field. Dr. Smith emailed us all with the news that the book had been nominated, but explained she was pulling it from consideration for the award. Her reasoning was that because so many of us contributed, we would unfairly skew the voting. (Association members can all vote, non-members can also vote but their votes are counted as 1/2 a vote each.) \n\nThis seemed a little weird to me, but I was going to let it go until another contributor to the book emailed all of the contributors and said that they had discovered that Dr. Smith had written a book which was nominated for the same award in the same category as our anthology. (There are only 10 nominees per category.) Dr. Smith failed to disclose this information to us in her email explaining that she was removing our anthology from consideration. The contributor who flagged this also said they had reached out to the association hosting the award and they were told that it is not a conflict of interest and Dr. Smith was within her right to pull the anthology. This contributor didn't suggest any course of action, just said they thought everyone deserved to know. \n\nWhat would you do if you found yourself in this situation? On the one hand, the anthology is technically Dr. Smith's. The cover lists her as the editor. On the other hand, she was clear in her emails as the book was being put together that she did not have much time to devote to the project, so editors and authors were encouraged to communicate directly with each other. This makes me uncomfortable about the idea that the book is \"hers,\" even though her name is the one on the cover. I'm hesitant to contact her or the award association because she is a BIG fish in our little pond. I'm also hesitant to express my concerns to the award association for the same reason, and I'm wondering if this was why the contributor who flagged this was stonewalled. \n\nThanks for sticking with my saga. Thoughts?",

And it sounds like that will only possibly hurt your career and make her and the organization mad. \n\nYou have a publication from it, and the book has been well received. That's a huge accomplishment already given how little academic publications are read. \n\nFocus your energy on your work since it sounds like this situation has progressed as far as it can.",

I\u2019ve been burnt by standing up to a former advisor - big wig type person at my Uni and beyond who was abusive/toxic, etc. And it nearly led to me having to leave my program... There are SOOO many battles to choose from  - especially when it comes to transparency, equity, and power. \n\nBut, try and let this go - sometimes easier said than done. I agree it\u2019s a odd move. But focus on the positives - you got a pub AND were initially nominated for an award. That\u2019s still pretty awesome! And remember this if you\u2019re ever in Dr. Smith\u2019s shoes in the future (and do not replicate her behavior).",

People in academia are also well... people, some nice and honest, some not so much... And thus such not-so-pleasing occasions are fairly common, and the best way to deal with them is to prevent them in the first place (which to be honest wouldn't be so easy with your particular situation).",
