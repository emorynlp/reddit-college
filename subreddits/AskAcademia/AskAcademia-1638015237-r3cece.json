  "title:": "How many times can I cold email a professor before it becomes rude/annoying?",
  "text": "I\u2019m looking into summer placements and many require approval from a potential supervisor before submitting an application. I\u2019ve shortlisted several professors and have been cold emailing them with my research interests and experience. I\u2019m focusing on quality over quantity and tailoring my emails to particular researchers that I\u2019m really interested in. None of them have replied yet, possibly due to the fact that they\u2019re incredibly busy or didn\u2019t see the email. \n\nMy question is, can I email the same professor twice, assuming I am polite and I don\u2019t push it after that? I don\u2019t want to spam people or bother professors that have no obligation to respond to me, but I obviously want a reply at some point\n\nMy field is neuroscience and I\u2019m based in the U.K. but I am emailing researchers in Europe as well.",

      "text": "> I\u2019m focusing on quality over quantity \n\nJust wanted to comment on this bit -- I know it's frustrating but if you really want a position like this over the summer you need to be doing BOTH quality and quantity. Like, I would be surprised if you get one email response for 10 professors you email, and most of those responses will be 'sorry but I can't take you as a student'. Many professors who know this isn't the kind of thing they do will just delete your email. You can't be counting on one of just a few cold-emails turning into a summer job!",

Definitely go for funded studentship programmes and make sure the potential supervisors know that you plan to apply for funding with a body they are affiliated with. For example, if the supervisor is a member of the BBSRC then you will be eligible for a BBSRC summer studentship grant. Which grants you are eligible for depends on the supervisors affiliations usually.",

If someone consistently not responding, you may be avoiding a bad situation. But some folks are just busy, and I\u2019d probably stop at three if spaced apart. If they run a lab, could also see if there is a postdoc or phd student that you could chat with virtually just to make the connection. It can help to have someone in the lab nudging the professor to respond.",
