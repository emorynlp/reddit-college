  "text": "Recently reviewed a paper and couldn't help but give it a very critical review with a recommendation to the editor to reject. I gave a very detailed review with both specific and general comments, and tried to write something constructive.\n\nI can't help but empathize with the writer. Probably a PhD student trying to get published, worked hard and did what his advisor suggested and likely poured his guts in to it.\n\nI couldn't suggest to accept it but I can't help feeling guilty for \"being mean\" to the authors and ruining their day/week/month.\n\nAnyone else feel this? How do you deal with it?",

Constructive reviews, even if they're very critical of my work, don't hurt. Often I feel thankful for their time and effort to read my paper. I understand how you feel, and I guess you feel it because you're a kind person in general, but at the end of the day you're helping the entire community not only the authors.",

I\u2019ve edited at 4 journals now for a cumulative 20+ years; I would have been livid were I to have read callous or mean comments that were meant to be no more than an effort to drag someone down. My first submitted paper was very much like what OP described and it was because of the patient hand-holding of the reviewers and editor that it was published. Now it\u2019s a highly cited paper. I look on that experience and it shapes my behavior to this day. Science is not made better by us dragging each other down.

The reviewer included sarcastic questions (and equally sarcastic answers to their own questions), a condescending tone, and overall included very few constructive comments. I was shocked the editor let these comments even reach us. My co-author was upset and confused by this reviewer, particularly as the other reviews were overall positive.  I have thick skin and can handle these types of reviewers, but am disappointed that this journal (which regularly receives submissions from students and early career researchers) would let this reviewer be so nasty. \n\nAs an editor, do you have any recommendations for these situations (in regards to authors communicating their experiences to editors)?",

I tried empathizing w her hurt feelings (which were totally legitimate) and also reframing things a bit (you know: this person representsone possible audience; we wouldn'thave gotten an r-and-r if the editor didn't see merit to the piece; etc.), w/out much success. The paper was her lead, and not really important for me agenda-wise, so I stopped pressing her on it after a few communications, and we never ended up resubmitting.

I will be very surprised if it is not accepted. \n\nI'm not sure what else I would have done in your situation, tbh.

The project wasn't good so I gave it a mediocre, but not horrible, score. I knew that means the researcher won't get the grant, I know it was the right thing to do, but I regret it all the same. That is just empathy I guess, and it is a good thing to have. I have received many reviews without an iota of empathy, being quite mean, condescending, or simply aggressive.

Failure of a paper to be published in a given submission cycle is typically due to a mismatch between journal and manuscript, and the manuscript will be okay, often with minimal revision, once it finds the right journal. Very few papers (<10%) are so bad that they require substantial overhauls. Those really bad papers are bad for only a handful of reasons. The biggest reason is insufficient communication and feedback between the authors; either the trainee is not taking feedback from their PI, or their PI is not providing sufficient guidance. A rejected manuscript can be a way to shock the system, so to speak, and get the PI and trainee communicating in order to fix problems in how the authors go from data to results to inferences, or bringing on additional experts to address gaps in technical expertise. \n\nThat's not to say there aren't malicious or frivolous rejections (there are and I've seen some first-hand) but if you're trying to be constructive but still identifying critical problems with a manuscript, the chances are this will ultimately help everyone involved, including the trainee.",

I always find flaws in work, starting from poor writing/grammar to flaws in methodology to hastily conducted literature surveys. In fact, I've been told more than once that it's \"not etiquette to give too much negative feedback.\" I still don't know wth this means, but my advisor seems to have no problem when I decide to give an \"Accept\" to authors, but always throws a _load_ of questions when the decision is \"Reject.\" Maybe I'm being naive and am still inexperienced but this was always counterintuitive to me. But I digress.\n\nThat being said, many of the manuscripts that I review actually make me very frustrated. It's obvious that even the authors know that their writing is (excuse my language) utter crap and they just wanted to submit it to receive feedback.",

The editor has to make the decision whether or not it can be resubmitted. With that said, I have not reviewed a paper that I thought was fundamentally unsound. I don't feel bad, because I think of my first manuscript which was a hot mess. My PI probably should not have let me submit it. But, I think he was fed up with me not making progress so we just sent it in. Fortunately the reviewers gave constructive feedback and I end up resubmitting laterally and getting the paper accepted. The review process made my paper way better than it was.",
