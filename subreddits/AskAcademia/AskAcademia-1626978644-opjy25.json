  "text": "I want to keep it short , I have been diagnosed with ADHD during my program. I never knew there were accommodations I can ask for via my doctor \u2026 now I am about to defend my thesis\u2026 what accommodations could serve  me through that \u2026 I mainly have severe anxiety with public talks but I manage if it is less than 1 hour , this is way longer, last time I did present something similar I got very frustrated towards the end and as per one committee member I didn\u2019t not show confidence \nAny tips , any suggestions, any encouragement is highly appreciated . \nKamilia",

      "text": "I'm not sure about specific accommodations via your university or doctor. However, as someone with ADHD and a fear of public speaking I can give my two cents. \n\nFirst, practice practice practice. I can never keep track of an outline or notes, so practicing is key for me to remember what I'm going to say and when. However, I often blank on important words and numbers so I usually keep a note card close by with those details. Perhaps take it easy on the stimulants that day.  Everyone is different, but sometimes my adderall hits me in a way where I ramble.  Keep an eye on the clock. \n\nLastly, if you really have severe anxiety consider talking to your doctor about a beta blocker Rx. Beta blockers will inhibit the somatic response to anxiety (shaking, throat closing up, etc). They won't make you less anxious but they will stop that feedback loop between mind and body. Beta blockers were key for me to get over my public speaking anxiety. \n\nGood luck!",
