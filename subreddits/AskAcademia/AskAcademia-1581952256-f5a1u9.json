  "text": "Hi all, I work currently at a physics institute at a European university. A few hours ago, I overheard a conversation between an older professor and a few postdocs about academic career prospects. The conversation, which was more like an argument, centered around a disagreement about how the career prospects of younger researchers have changed in the last few decades. The professor's argument was that things are as they were when he was young and that young people today give up too early. The postdocs disagreed.   \n\n\nThis got me thinking and looking for information showing trends in career prospects  for new academics in the last few decades. How is it different for somebody getting started now compared to somebody starting in 1990? Does anybody know any really good papers or reliable information sources on the topic?",

A K99/R00 is the best way to get a faculty position with around 80-90% finding one (the K99 itself funds at 20%). With a K99/R00 in hand (usually get awarded in the 4th or 5th year of postdoc), they'll start a year or two later (2 years of K99 support) meaning it takes 5-7 years of postdoc to start a faculty position. I know of new faculty that never got the K99/R00 (you can't get it after your fourth year of postdoc'ing) and have taken 8-10 years of postdoc to get a position. Maybe the median time to find a position is around 8-9 years then? That's quite a long time considering PhD's are 5-7 years now and growing plus an increasing number of students are doing postbacc's and \"taking time off\". Also, I know the time to tenure is increasing for many institutions. At Harvard I hear it is 10 years.\n\nAdding it all up guesstimates for the median student (not counting that the process gets longer as you're doing it) that's:\n* 2 years Postbacc\n* 6 year PhD\n* 8 year Postdoc\n* 6 years to Tenure\n\nTotal: 22 years post-undergrad.",

              "text": "That is assuming that they get tenure at all. What are the probabilities of this for a given person entering an academic career? It seems the main thing that causes postdocs to quit is not the difficulty in achieving their goals or the sacrifices required to get there, but in the probability being very low that they ever will achieve their goals. \n\nThis is the different between the older professor that OP mentioned and the postdocs. The older professor might have also had to struggle to get to where he is, but he did so at a time when his chances of success at the end of this struggle were good. The postdocs might be willing to do the same thing, but their chances are massively diminished, and at the end of the struggle there will most likely not be a job for them.",

That is why I think it is fairly frequent that PI's will begin at a top one and then use that as leverage to get hired with tenure at a lower-prestige one. \n\nI don't disagree. Science is a much more difficult endeavor than it was in the past. The numbers for my field were of around 50% of PhD's making tenure-track in the 80's and now it is around 5%.",

      "text": "I am not sure what the situation is in Europe, but a number of structural changes in American higher education have made the hiring situation extremely dire. The main cause is the rise of adjunct labor, which started in the 1970s but accelerated rapidly after the financial crisis in 2008. Something like 80% of the teaching force was tenure track or tenured in 1969--now it is something like 25%. There are a number of bigger economic forces behind this, including the weakening of American labor unions and the general shift across the business landscape to part-time or 'gig' labor (itself related to a number of factors, including the upward spiral in the expense of providing healthcare benefits to employees in the US). There has been TONS of reporting in the American news media on this (just google \"adjunct crisis\"), but here is [a starter.](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-higher-education-crisis-is-a-labor-crisis/) Three other forces in the US have pinched university budgets (which they have dealt with partially by trimming instructional costs and hiring fewer full-time people): [a widespread decline in state support for public education](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/most-americans-dont-realize-state-funding-for-higher-ed-fell-by-billions) (there has been radical disinvestment by many states in their public universities in the last 30 years), a  smaller generation of college-aged students after a long period of expansion (reduced tuition revenue), and the phenomenon of [admin bloat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/) (American universities have radically expanded their administrative staff in the last few decades)\n\nThe net result is that there is lots of \\*work\\* across the US teaching in higher ed, but the number of \\*jobs\\* (defined as full-time employment with benefits and research support) has radically shrunk. The humanities and social sciences, which can't offset cuts as much with outside funding, have been hit hardest, but the sciences have been affected too.\n\nAs I hope this answer demonstrates, the shift has been long in the making and is the result of a lot of complicated forces. The only real way to address it, in my opinion, is through a revitalized academic labor union movement (this is already happening in lots of places in the US) and by a long-term campaign to get states to reinvest in public higher education. Not very satisfying or quick solutions if you are currently looking for a job, unfortunately. And as you will quickly learn if you ask young researchers, many people with tenure are unaware of or in denial about how radically the labor landscape has shifted--this is a huge problem because it is \\*precisely\\* those senior academics who have the time, institutional protection, and stability who should be spearheading these changes to preserve the professoriate.",
