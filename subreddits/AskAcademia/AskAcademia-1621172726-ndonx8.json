  "text": "PhD Comics has a flowchart regarding getting and using funding here: http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd050611s.gif\n\nI'm not very familiar with the funding side of things, as I am a student.  The \"How It *Really* Works\" cycle definitely seems real, and was encouraged by my professor.  However, it seems a bit like fraud, especially the part when the funding is used for something other than intended.\n\nIs there a term for this method of grant funding (a classmate called it \"pre-j--king\", but I need a more official term)?\nAlso, do you know about its legality (and where the legality might vary)?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the insight!  It really is a shame that academia has come to a point where we must worry about survival above all else, and is definitely a major concern of mine.  Good luck with your own funding!",

I understand that's an unpopular position with many institutions as they've moved PIs to soft money and use them to solicit donations to the institution, which is used to build new buildings to hire more PIs on soft money.  However, I know several institutions do give PIs a trust fund supported by indirects (e.g., one institute gives their PIs 20.75% of the indirect costs generated by the grants the PI brings in).  That wasn't supposed to be the purpose of indirects, but the rules are written so broadly that most everything falls within indirects (e.g. travel, supplies, salaries, training and educational assistance costs, employee fringe (on top of the already included salary fringe line in the detailed budget), etc.).\n\nAt least with the NIH, several FOAs, including the parent R21, don't require preliminary data and some even explicitly prohibit it.",

You need to have as much data as possible to ensure the success of your grant, so you're halfway through the project before you even apply, and then what? You're supposed to put the project on hold while you wait the 9-12 months for the project to be reviewed and funded? No. You just carry on and develop past what you said you'd do in the grant. It's not fraudulent- the grantholder gets the research they paid for, they get one or more publications on that grant and what's the issue here?",

But overall, remember a big part of getting a grant isn't just the idea, but showing you have a good track record. They want to know that if they give you a million dollars, you'll do good work with that. That's why it is hard for new investigators to get the big grants and really need to show they are a good investment based on prelim data and more senior co-I's. Also, even though you are a student- this is the best time to start getting familiar with the funding side! Ask questions, ask to see grants, write your own fellowships or small grants. Even if you leave academia, these are valuable skills. And when you see a budget and see how much people cost, it can be a good motivator to spend your time wisely!",
