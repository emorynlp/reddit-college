  "text": "I've been writing a review paper (with over 200+ references so far) and this is my first time doing this. I'm wondering how often do authors make some mistakes in such papers, and how is it handled by reviewers of journals? Would a few mistakes, or just one, such as wrongly summarizing something, get you rejected right away? Also, how would this be handled if it is found out after the paper has been published? Does it get it retracted?",

      "text": "Just about any paper submitted for peer review will have some mistakes in it. While having frequent and glaring mistakes can definitely affect the outcome of a review, having a few small mistakes is unlikely to affect the outcome. That is part of what the peer review process is for.\n\nIf you wrongly summarized something, a reviewer or editor will correct you if it's something they are familiar with. The honest truth is that if it's some random paper that is not particularly well known, there is a decent chance none of the reviewers would notice, particularly if what you are saying sounds relatively logical and straightforward. When I'm a reviewer, I don't check all of the references in the article, although I will look up a specific article from time to time if the way its results are framed is unexpected or does not make sense.\n\nIf there is a minor error in a published article, either 1) they will publish a correction, or 2) they may decide it's minor enough to not make any changes. An article would only be retracted if it had fundamental errors that rendered it no longer meaningful (or for other reasons, e.g., fraud, undisclosed conflicts of interest, etc.).\n\nLong story short: do your best to make the article as accurate as possible. But as long as you've made a good faith effort, try not to worry too much about the possibility of there being an error somewhere.",

      "text": "This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. MANY review articles don't stand up to close scrutiny. If they are critiqued it is usually about the pros and cons of the chosen methodology, not about the sources used, and if they are presented correctly.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't worry about it too much unless it affects the results in a significant way. But, some (like myself) have Google Scholar alerts for their own name. If you misrepresent a piece of work, chances are the authors are going to get to know about it. When it happens to me, which it does every now and then, I don't care too much as long as it isn't making me look bad.\n\nI'd say the most common cause for misrepresentation is bias and that people don't read the sources they refer to properly.",
