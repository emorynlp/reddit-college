It is mandated by a well-intentioned government effort to integrate the university to surrounding society, so it's not like some evil thing in itself, but the effects are very apparent.\n\nNow, you have to be a crazy kind of idealist to assume that if private business interests were completely shut out, no other biases/interests would affect the research/teaching of the institution - so it's all a balance. \n\nBut things like being \"for profit\" vs \"not for profit\" is effectively the difference between *being a business* (which completely removes the pursuit of truth as your main agenda) to simply being *affected by busineess*, just like the institution is affected by politics and all other areas/agendas of life and society.",

I think we can all agree that things like Prager U are mostly using the aesthetic of academia to push right wing propaganda, but the main problem with this kind of question is what the actual regulations would look like. If regulations are too strong, then you can start to run into scenarios where do you find unexpected places where it was not meant to or was intended to cover, or you run into a situation where do you find you can\u2019t actually stay about the organizations that you want to. \n\nFor example, in the Prager U scenario, how do you govern a non-location specific entity? In theory, Prager U probably could be \u201cbased\u201d anywhere, not just within the United States. And as far as I am aware (could be wrong wrong, as I don\u2019t exactly follow them that closely), they don\u2019t necessarily sell any kind of curriculum or credentialing, and they don\u2019t charge for a lot their content, so It seems like it would be a lot harder to go after them when they certainly aren\u2019t \u201cripping off\u201d students as it were. And don\u2019t mistake this is some kind of defense of them, but all I\u2019m trying to say here is I\u2019m not really sure how regulations on this kind of thing would apply. In this case, I kind of think that you\u2019re bound to be disappointed if you think regulation like this is going to solve that kind of problem here.",

Our PI has us including for-profit universities which just crawls all over my ass. It is very clear in my field (education) that those places are not at all interested in helping students develop any sort of deeper level thinking about the field or the work. It\u2019s all \u201ccall and response\u201d type of training, when what education needs is learning to critically think and to create environments that meet the needs of every student. \n\nI truly think those places do not deserve to be called universities. However, this is the future. Just look at what is happening with the consolidation of community colleges into one state wide school. The bad far outweighs the good.",

Most high school seniors and parents that I talk to have ZERO idea as to what these differences are. There is, as just one example, a \"you get what you pay for\" among many that private colleges will provide a better education (and not just better dorms and athletic facilities.) I've seen many, many parents who simply assume that they need to pay sticker price private tuition for their mediocre kids, because that will get them the \"best.\" These are usually kids who would be equally suited for large state u.",
