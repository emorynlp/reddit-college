  "text": "Canadian masters student here, thinking about a PhD in English literature. The goal is to teach in Canada, especially in English and the digital humanities. I also will have a LIS (librarianship) certification.\n\nCould you highlight for me the pros/cons of studying at Oxbridge vs. Ivy (esp. Stanford, Yale, and Harvard, which all have great digital literary labs or projects)? \n\nI would love to hear from people generally in humanities, not just English.",

      "text": "I'm a last year Canadian PhD student at Cambridge and have visited some American schools. Will try to provide insight.\n\nOxbridge will take you 3 years and they are quite strict about graduating in time. American schools will take double that. I actually wish I had a bit more time, like maybe six months, but the length of an American PhD does seem excessive. You don't take classes here, but in most American phds you do. You don't have to teach at Oxbridge but it is extra money. The teaching is in little groups of a few people at once, called \"supervisions\", rather than big classes. The college system is a big thing - you get assigned to a house (think Harry potter), can live there if you want, and a lot of people's main social groups are their colleges. \n\nDo you like hiking? Mountains? Forests? You're not gonna get it in England. On the other hand, maybe you like beautiful old architecture and tradition and sitting around big tables with chandeliers dressed up in formal wear - we've got loads of that!\n\nOther thoughts: Brexit is a pain in the ass. British people can be really lovely but it's often hard to get to know them in the first place. The NHS feels like a conservative government took Canadian healthcare and gutted it over the course of a decade (which is essentially what happened). It functions and it's probably still a lot better than America(?), but I go back to Canada for a lot of health related things.\n\nOverall I would 100% make this choice again.",

It can be offered to very good students who gained lots of research experience during their bachelor and have very good references and academic record. So in the end they get a PhD 3 years after their bachelor if they go to the UK compared to staying in the US as they truly skip any master requirements",

You simply said it's not possible in the uk, I clarified that it is regardless of what OP asked just so that anyone reading with intentions of doing a PhD in the uk knows and get the correct info if they think they are to that level. But you are right that it is not common as I said and there's no direct route on how to make it happen. Even in oxbridge you can go from bachelor to PhD. They will consider it but you have to take the chance to apply for PhD positions even without a master. Sometimes they will suggest master applicants to apply for a PhD instead too if they think they qualify even if they don't have a master. Of course it's unusual, we are talking here about bachelor students with publications already and sometimes work experience as well and near perfect academic records, it's really not the norm.  I often see it happen because someone worked under the suggested PhD supervisor during their bachelor and the supervisor wants them to continue the research as a funded (PhD) student",

There is high demand and often professors fill in if they can't find enough grad students to supervise. I do think it is similar across fields. It's good pay too,  30+ pounds per hour of teaching, but that doesn't include marking or prep. See my other reply re: wales haha, no it does not compare but maybe you will like it anyway :)",

If your plan is to stay in academia, a longer (funded) program can be advantageous because it gives you more time to publish in preparation for the hyper-competitive job market. Due to covid, the publication process is slower than ever and the job market is at its most competitive. So you really need those publications, and on average they'll take at least 2 years. Unless you come in with an article or two ready to submit, a 3 year PhD doesn't give you much time to build your CV.\n\nI did my phd in 5 years at an ivy. I would have stayed for a sixth, but I landed a post-doc. It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, as these are quite rare in the humanities, but as someone who started grad school straight out of undergrad (not your situation, I know) I would have appreciated more uninterrupted time to get a few additional articles in the pipeline.",

When I graduated, all the publications I had out at that time started off life as seminar papers written during coursework. They were enough research to get me my TT job. Only one of them really had anything to do with my dissertation, and it was more a prelude to it than a constitutive part of it.\n\nThey also showed breadth. Even if you end up getting an R1 job, you won't just be teaching your specialized area. Coursework, especially coursework that generates publications (or, at least, conference talks) is a way of showing that while you dissertated on the appearance of pets in 18th century portraiture, you also have something to say about 16th century vases, can employ queer theory to analyze tik tok, *and* can draw on your expertise to put together a really interesting survey class for first-year undergrads that meets various gen ed requirements and attracts them to study art history. (Not a class you'd have helped to teach at a UK institution, as they don't have gen ed in the same way, and don't try to recruit current students to their major / honour school, as they've already applied to a specific department as part of their admission to the university).",

I trust you're aware of the most basic distinction between a US degree and one in the UK, in that the former takes 6-8 years or so, and requires a heavy teaching load, whereas in the UK, you get just 3 years, and teaching is entirely optional. If you're funded, you are literally paid just to research, that's it, with no obligations beyond that - although there are plenty of teaching opportunities if wanted. Regarding libraries, I can't speak for Ivies, but I can say that Oxbridge have some of the most amazing libraries in the world. There are tonnes of special collections e.g. copies of medieval lyrics that you literally cannot access anywhere else, all sorts of famous manuscripts and the Oxford and Cambridge libraries are Bodleian (sp) libraries, which means they can request a copy of any book ever printed in the UK, I believe, so you're never going to be short of paper to shift. There's also a number of awesome faculty libraries which are just as well stocked and often advertise for jobs and work experience. So, if you're searching within the UK, I say that you'll find it tough to do better. Hope that helps!",

It's around 500\u00a3 per year and you pay the total upfront for the duration of your studies. Some universities will apply for a 3 + 1 years visa in case you need an extension, so it can cost up to around 2000\u00a3 (2700USD). There's an online calculator to approximate how much you would be paying. It's better than the health insurance you would usually be given with a US  studentship tho, so still worth it.

(This is true even if you earned a Master's from another institution in the U.S. or abroad, though they may allow you to take fewer courses.) As far as I understand, you can't pursue a UK PhD unless you earned a Master's beforehand. (*Someone informed me that UK DPhils don't always require a Master's. My guess is that Oxbridge, which both state it as a requirement, would regularly use it as an easy way to narrow down the pool, since they're so selective.)\n\nSo, all told, both options (can) take roughly the same amount of time.\n\nTeaching loads vary widely by U.S. institution. I was at an Ivy and only TA'd two courses. The goal was to gain pedagogical experience, not to financially support ourselves (although we were paid). At public institutions with less funding, students teach *a lot* more (i.e. almost every semester, sometimes beginning as early as their second year while they're still in coursework, often multiple sections) because those grad students do actually depend on teaching for tuition remission and a living wage. Hope this all helps!\n\n(Obviously, there are PhD students in the U.S. who stay on as 7th and 8th years, but they're moved into a different administrative \"unenrolled\" status, are no longer eligible for funding, and are likely to have their degree candidacy terminated.)",

          "text": "I responded to your comment above but maybe since you reiterated, I will too. In the UK, a master's degree typically only takes one year. So the masters plus PhD is typically 4 years, which is still shorter than the average American PhD program. There are also 4 year master's + PhD programs in the UK that you can pursue directly after undergrad (I'm in one).",

              "text": "You're welcome! And /u/Monsteriah pointed out the UK route is still generally a year shorter (assuming a 5-year U.S. degree). Another thought: in the U.S. lack of teaching experience puts many people out of the running (even at top R1s, we expect to see something). Maybe consider asking Canadian faculty how much they weigh teaching experience when choosing new hires? That might help you with your decision. Good luck.",
