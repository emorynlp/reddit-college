  "text": "I\u2019m a TA and this term I am conducting classes for one of the intro lectures for first years. It\u2019s like a general knowledge module on my country (so we cover history, econ, politics etc). \n\nI had my first independent lecture today on a topic I\u2019m not familiar with at all. And it was so bad. I couldn\u2019t pronounce a few names (it was on the origin of our language), my explanations were all over the place and I couldn\u2019t answer a question a student had (I did answer it later though). I found out the topic yesterday so I didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to deal with this. This was their first impression of me and I\u2019m a little worried that I\u2019ll make things worse for them. \n\nWas anyone ever in a similar situation? How do I recover from this?",

However, all in all, I made it through relatively unscathed and that is because I had a mentor in my undergrad advisor. She told me of her 1st time, in her own words: \u201cI sucked and nobody could argue that fact.\u201d She said she was prepared as an \u2018expert\u2019 in her field, but no one taught her how to teach. And the university did not provide mentors. To make matters worse, she was hired in Dec, 1 week before the semester started due to a faculty\u2019s death. Thanks to her, I know to focus on the positive and build upon that every time, as you will do!",

That means their listening and thinking critically. \n\nDon't make excuses or ask for forgiveness but take some reasonable steps to do better using your personal strengths. \n\nIf they ask a question and I don't know the answer, I tell them it's a great question and ask if anyone else in the class knows.

Opening the door for possibility while maybe not your ideal lecture, it wasn't as bad as it seems?  We're often our own worst critic, especially when we're nervous and being observed. None of what you've described sounds terrible. You didn't insult anyone or make them cry ... Ive had professors do that and still recover. This will be okay for you too.",

      "text": "My first time leading full classes was last semester. I've been in a similar situation with my teaching experience so far. I've TAed for 3 courses all of which I hadn't taken before. I was trusted to just lead classes anyway (which I guess is normal but I still find that super weird). For the first course I TAed for, I led class every other week plus review sessions. It felt super overwhelming to me at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. \n\nMy main source of worry before every session is that I will not know the answer to student's questions and that I am somehow letting them down. There have been times I didn't know the answer but I have never had an issue just telling them \"I'm not sure but I will find out for you\" -- just make sure you actually do find out for them. It feels weird to admit to students that you don't know something, but I try to remind myself that I am a student too and I am also learning (especially so for courses that I have never actually taken lol). \n\nWhen I get worried about them judging me I try to remind myself of when I was in undergrad. Most of the class, myself included sometimes, half payed attention for most lectures. Chances are if you mess up many of them won't even notice. And even if they do, they won't likely remember it -- I can't think of a single time that my professors/TAs messed up during my classes in undergrad.\n\nEach time you do this you will get more confident and it will get easier!",

Until the one student in class that was hell bent asking me every \u201cwhat if\u201d question imaginable started interjecting. Questions I didn\u2019t have answers to... to say it was a confidence  breaker was an understatement. I really wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d recover from what felt like (to me in my student\u2019s eyes) was my inability to have answers. It was a rough semester, the student in question challenged me and actually ended up scoring the best in the class and wasn\u2019t a pain in the ass intentionally, he just wanted to learn and was inquisitive. I learned you should always have a canned response for when you don\u2019t know the answer (mine is, \u201cgreat question! We\u2019ll be touching on that very soon!\u201d Or \u201clet me get back with you on that\u201d) so it doesn\u2019t ruin your confidence for the class. Most of the time, they forget they asked or it does come up in a future class lecture. Honestly I\u2019m glad it (the inquisitive student) happened to me last semester because nothing can unsettle me in class again, lol.",

This gives you time to research it if necessary.\n\nI don\u2019t find anything wrong with professors saying they don\u2019t know. It\u2019s impossible to know everything even about one subject. I\u2019ve also seen classes where a question\u2019s answer isn\u2019t known, the student can earn extra credit by researching and posting the answer (with citation).

Hopefully, you know (or have control over) the content of the second class, and can put the prep in. \n\nThere's lots of good advice above (even though the suggestions move in several very different directions) on how to address day 1. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and include it as part of how you prepare for the second class. \n\nI'll just add to that advice: It's okay to tell your students that you weren't given enough time to prep the first class, and you have prepared much more thoroughly for the second. That can help your students reconcile the different experiences, if they were concerned about your trustworthiness as a TA after that first class, and to recognize that you're better than that first impression might have left.",

You're modeling to students that you are human as they are. Third, lecturing for the first time is really hard. Takes a a few months to really settle in, tbh. \n\nHave an outline. Ask yourself, what do I want to the students to remember from this lesson? Try and produce a narrative. \n\nImportantly, students can't distinguish mediocre teaching from bad teaching, in my experience. You experience your own faults at a much higher magnification than they do. What you see as huge mistakes, most don't even notice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, just keep plowing forward, step-by-step.

Especially when you mispronounce something. I'm super bad about that.\n\nAs for not being able to answer all questions off the top of your head... someone else already mentioned admitting that you're not sure but promising you'll look it up and get back to them. This is great advice. Not only does it ensure you give them the proper information it's teaching your students that's it's okay not to have all the answers all the time. My mentor in grad school taught me a lot but the thing that has stuck with me all these years is that unless you have a photographic memory you're never going to remember every little thing about your subject. What you need to learn is what questions you should be asking and where to find the answers. It's a philosophy I live by both in research and teaching.",

Try out different ways of teaching, play around with your ideas a bit and be honest. In my first course, I told my students that I had never done this before and that I'm trying things out a bit and they completely understood that.\n\nDon't try to hide if you don't know the answer to a question. Admit that this is a good question and tell them you will find out the answer to it. Then you can start the following session discussing this question. Another technique is to try and find out the answer to that question together (initiate a group discussion or look it up yourself). Not knowing an answer is nothing to be ashamed of!\n\nWhat also helps is to have a little feedback session at the end of your course. That way you can find out what they liked, did not like and you can adjust your plans for the next semester.\n\nYour confidence will grow and your explanations will get better over time. No one starts teaching already an expert. Give it time and prepare well. You'll soon find that teaching is fun and can start enjoying your session! Good luck :)",

I've found in situations where a student asks a question and I don't know or don't remember the answer, that being honest in a certain way is key. I would usually say something like, \"That's a great question. Honestly, I'm not sure, but I think it's important to consider! What does everyone else think?\" Starting a class discussion helps to not only engage students, but also inspire critical thinking. Through class discussions, an answer to the question may also arise!\n\nFrom this point, there are definitely things you can do to increase your credibility. If possible, try appearing as confident as possible for the other classes going forward. While you can't fix what has already happened, you can appear confident from here on out, which in my opinion, is absolutely critical for increasing credibility. I have personally experienced this myself. Last semester, I started teaching a class I wasn't familiar with, in a format I wasn't familiar with. It was nerve-racking to say the least, and I won't lie, I definitely came off pretty nervous the first day... which is something I actively try to avoid. However, I found that practicing my lectures and activities helped me, at the very least, feel confident in my wording and presentation, so that when I got to class, I demonstrated confidence in myself and therefore seemed more credible.

      "text": "Hey, performing is hard, teaching is hard, teaching outside of your comfort zone is hard, teaching a course or a topic for the first time is hard! Don't be hard on yourself!! I'm sure you'll be great, and you'll be fine, and your course will go better, and your courses (plural) will go better! You're in this \"first Nicaraguan Deaf kids brought to this school for the first time\" stage right now, if you know what I mean. Don't dwell on it. Take note, and try again :) Practice makes perfect!\n\nAnd as a short-term solution, think of adapting more open, vulnerable approach to teaching, where you are more of an older peer and \"person responsible for the group\" in a hike, than an omniscient sage. Here's my absolute favorite book on the topic: [\"Teaching what you don't know\" by Therese Huston](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674066170)  I love this approach, and found it really liberating, when I started myself :) Good luck!!",

      "text": "Ohhhhh it happens!  Some times it takes practice to fall into your teaching groove.  I suggest overpreparing as much as possible, where possible.  Students have a way of poking holes in your knowledge--they are particularly good at finding questions to ask that you simply don't know off the top of your head. THAT IS OKAY! Don't be afraid to tell them, \"Let me look into that for you\" or \"That's an excellent question and I need some time to answer it properly\".  Never try to bullshit your way out of such a situation--i.e. don't pretend you have knowledge that you don't have.  In my situation, I teach physics and so I always make sure to have many ways to solve the problem at the tips of my fingers. I've also learned how to do all the questions incorrectly (the most common mistakes) this way I can immediately point to a reason for their mistake and where to try again. \n\nYou will definitely get used to it and start to feel more at ease. I used to be terrified of public speaking, now I have no issue speaking at length in front of large crowds. It definitely doesn't help to not have much time to prepare, but given enough time, as long as you stay calm and have a general plan to stick to, you will be just fine. \n\nI find that, after some time, talking to a large group of people is no different from just chatting with 4 or 5 people.  Feel free to ask them for feedback or to answer questions as you're lecturing to keep engagement up--just remember, you're just having a conversation.",

I guess I thought they would all be blown away and it would inspire a riveting discussion. \n\nIn my fifteen years teaching, I've seen lots of first year teachers not do particularly well.

      "text": "Everyone has given great advice for dealing with the experience, but there is also a lot of great resources out there for learning how to be an effective professor. Some universities have started to build resources for improving teaching and my program (anthropology) actually has a class on teaching anthropology that was incredibly helpful. The Chronicle of Higher Ed is good for keeping up to date with things happening in teaching. They also have helpful stuff like this: [https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-teach-a-good-first-day-of-class/?cid2=gen\\_login\\_refresh&cid=gen\\_sign\\_in](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-teach-a-good-first-day-of-class/?cid2=gen_login_refresh&cid=gen_sign_in). \n\nIt's also good to think about your pedagogy and how you want to teach, like do you want your students to be doing collaborate learning([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132366/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132366/)), active learning([https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/active-learning-higher-education/](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/active-learning-higher-education/)), universal design ([https://www.washington.edu/doit/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Universal%20Design%20in%20Higher%20Education\\_Promising%20Practices\\_0.pdf](https://www.washington.edu/doit/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Universal%20Design%20in%20Higher%20Education_Promising%20Practices_0.pdf)). There's a ton of stuff out there that can really help you dial in what YOU want to do as a teacher. Basically, if teaching is going to be part of your future plans, it can be really helpful and even empowering to figure out what sort of teacher you want to be. Knowing what you want students to get out of your lectures/classes can help you figure out how you want to set them up and what you want to focus on.",

And I have to admit that a couple of times I pretended having internet connection issues in the middle of the class just so I could leave the zoom session and lookup the answer to a students' question. I then rejoined the session and impressed everyone with my crystal clear explanation :p",
