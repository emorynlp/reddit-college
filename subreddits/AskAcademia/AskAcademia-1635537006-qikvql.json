  "text": "About two weeks ago, I was offered an amazing research assistant position at a lab. In the acceptance email, they asked me to respond within a week so that we could \"get the ball rolling\". I responded that same day. A week and a half later, I emailed to check in about the onboarding process and still haven't heard back. Should I be concerned? Might they have taken my offer off the table?\n\nI apologize for the typo in the question!",

      "text": "You didn\u2019t give a lot of details, so I\u2019m going to make an assumption that it\u2019s an academic lab run by a PI. If it\u2019s a top-tier research group particularly, the PI is probably coordinating with you himself right now, offering the position and will do the administrative things later. Top lab PI\u2018s can often get hundreds of emails a day, which they normally don\u2019t have an assistant for.\n\nMy guess is one of three things. They either missed it, opened it and forgot about it, or opened it and started doing administrative things to hire you but forgot reply to your email. In any case I would just sent another polite email asking if they have any information for you.",

      "text": "They haven't sent you the contract yet and you're asking about onboarding?\n\nYou need to negotiate your salary and start date first before they can send you details about onboarding. A week and half is really not much time at all. It sounds like you're able to start immediately but remember most of the people they recruit will have notice periods and people often can't start their jobs for several weeks to months. This means HRs are keen to get your acceptance ASAP so they can get the paperwork started but once that happens they don't generally need to move very quickly as most people can't start straight away. Also university HR teams are generally massively under-resourced while handling extremely complex recruitment - lots of visas, secondments, visiting workers, and the start-up packages of faculty. Unfortunately, junior roles tend to not get priority.",
