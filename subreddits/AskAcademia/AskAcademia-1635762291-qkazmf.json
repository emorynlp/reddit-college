      "text": "Most posts here seem to involve STEM and lab work; my career was humanities, in the U.S., at a large research university. A couple of thoughts, though...\nFirst, surely it would depend on the issues/ personalities/context. \n\nIn the U.S., universities have changed considerably in recent years and my university has created many new mechanisms for reporting and dealing with complaints about faculty at every level, including both academic and personal issues. Sexual harassment cases in particular have led to much greater awareness and scrutiny of the power dynamics between students and faculty and the need to set behavioral expectations and regulatory mechanisms to enforce them. We now have student and faculty committees, grad student unions (and a host of other mechanisms) to mediate between faculty/the department/students, and students are encouraged to meet directly with faculty and with department chairs if they have issues with professors, teaching assistants, lab supervisors, etc. Conflicts and complaints used to be handled at the department level, which generally meant nothing was ever done, and students who reported issues were often exposed and vulnerable to faculty retaliation. Grad students who were sexually harassed by faculty often ended up leaving the university, and the department kept issues with faculty confidential.\n \nNow faculty are expected to listen to students and take them seriously. Departments are obliged to keep some student complaints confidential, to take appropriate action and to refer students to newly created program offices and/or communicate serious issues and complaints to the central administration. Most of these changes are very recent, within the last 2-3 years.\n\nSo at my university, yes, it is now much more possible to lodge complaints about faculty without fear of reprisal. These issues will never disappear but conditions have improved.",
