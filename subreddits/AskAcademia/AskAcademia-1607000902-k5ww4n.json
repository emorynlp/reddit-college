  "text": "Currently I'm reading mid 2020 publications of authors in my field to discover problems and ideas that may be at the basis of my own PhD proposal in early 2021. I feel like there is some exciting stuff here that could work for me and I'm making notes on interesting questions / issues.\n\nTo know if I'm on the right track or if I could improve what I'm doing, I am very curious to hear about the process and things you did to get to your (accepted) PhD proposals!",

              "text": "Well, you'll never know; it's research. You have to search the literature, to make sure that nobody has done it before. But you can never be sure that nobody is working on it. The only thing you can do is to network on conferences to see what is the current hot topic in your niche. One practical tip: if you talk about your topic, tease it first and don't shout out your idea to solve it unless you trust your peers blindly. A friend got his idea stolen... especially in a publish or perish situation, people become moraly flexible. \n\nIf you reasonably sure, nobody works on your exact topic, than it can happen that things don't work out as expected. Or not in the expected timeframe. So, exploit your results you get. Maybe you can do more experiments or transfer your results to other situations or you can think about your results from different perspectives. Or you could see why the results you wished for can't be achieved with current methods or at all. In the end you must create enough new knowledge such that your commitee can justify to give you your PhD. Don't become mad over things you weren't able to achieve. In the end a finished PhD with other results than you wished for is better than a PhD you can't finish.   \n\nTbh my PhD was also not straight foward. I had to adjust a few times, but I was able to proof that some things were even theoretical impossible. Also, I wasn't able to do certain experiments, because I had not enough computing power or funding to extend that.",

I came across a paper detailing how one specific term ('markedness') has taken on a dozen meanings since it was first used and how each of those could be replaced by more descriptive, i.e. more transparent, terms, e.g. frequency.  I also noticed that this term was used a lot in the literature on language contact as an explanatory factor for language change, but that it wasn't usually defined all that well since the term is so prevalent.  Since I wanted to do something with language contact, I decided to break down the various senses of the term and analyze the adequacy of each sense's predictions regarding language change and 'markedness' (at least as they relate to my subfield of morphosyntax).  The work's ongoing, but the proposal has been accepted. \n\nSo basically, I found my group first and then worked to find a theoretical reason to justify working with them (since personal feelings/connections aren't much of a basis for a dissertation).",

I wrote a research proposal which was accepted in the UK but eventually found supervisors in Australia (better university too). They helped me brainstorm a lot on my topic, and critiqued my proposal a lot (which was a really good thing - in hindsight, the first one was terrible). After reading a LOT of articles, I came up with my current topic. The biggest takeaway of this is to find something you\u2019re passionate about because you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time reading on it so might as well enjoy it.",

      "text": "A mentor cautioned me before going into my PhD program that I should pick a topic I'm interested in, but make sure it's one you know you can spend at least four or five years on without getting exhausted by it. And I knew two subjects at the time: dinosaurs and reptiles. They were topics that had fascinated me since I was a child...The only possible problem was that I'm in English/Literature. The most viable road for my research would be a cross between animal studies and science studies, which was great because I actually have major disagreements with both fields. So, I managed to find a body of texts that were under-discussed in literary studies (texts with monstrous reptiles, including dinosaurs) and a potential \"intervention\" with animal and science studies while working in the emerging field of conservation humanities. I did manage to find an advisor who is actually excited about my work, and I'm set up to do my comps in a few weeks.   \n\nPart of me was also interested to see how far I could get by saying I wanted to talk about lizards in an English department (the answer: much farther than I expected).",

My advisor was on sabbatical that semester, and I was set to have a meeting with him in late November at our annual national conference, and a week or so before that I had an epiphany that I could study the way that the DSM & nosological systems (that determine how mental illnesses are classified and diagnosed) structure the language and categories of controversies in medicine, and how the controversies get translated across different technical systems (regulatory, legal, medical, criminal, etc.) and in the public sphere.\n\nI went from having no progress in like a year to defending a proposal a month later and then writing a 750 page (approx. 130,000 word excluding references and front matter) dissertation in about a year. Also, that same week that I met with my advisor that semester, I met the woman who is now my wife. It was a productive week.",

But it honestly doesn't cost much money to send some surveys out, or provide a psychological intervention done by me for free, or get people to come in and do some tests. I am limited in what I can do but keep in mind in social sciences we don't have to do things that cost a lot of money. For example, I am planning to study the types of supports that schools provide to kids with ADHD - honestly, just see if they are doing anything that is supported by research. No one has done this before. So, easy, just have to ask some people some questions.\n\nIf you mean how do I fund my PhD, I am in Canada, so there is not steep tuition price. I've managed to cobble together funding from scholarships, bursaries, TAships, RAships, and clinical work for the university. Some years I have no money, some years money is good.

                      "text": "I'm actually writing over 25 scholarly books as a series so others will be able to synthesize what I've discovered. I doubt another form would work for me as well. I'm quite used to this way, so unless someone could provide me assistance and show a better option, it likely won't happen. Anyhow, my writing style doesn't suit \"modern\" academia if that's what you're suggesting. With all the corruption, politics, nearsightedness, and rules of academic journals and the likes, it would slow me down by decades and is the same reason I dropped out of college. It's already difficult enough without using certain inventions for writing that will become more popular in 50-100 years.\n\nRegardless, I've already cured my stage 3 kidney disease back to 100% among other things \"we're not supposed to be able to do\" by \"modern\" science, so I know success will come.\n\nFor reference, I live in a place with less than 300 people, and Covid did nothing to change my lifestyle if that gives you any idea as to part of my nature and contacts.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong though. Feel free to give/suggest more specific insights I'm unaware of. I may be gifted, but I'm by no means flawless or omniscient.\n\nThanks,\n\nV",
