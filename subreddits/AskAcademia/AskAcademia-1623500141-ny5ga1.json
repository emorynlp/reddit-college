  "title:": "Dedicating my master thesis to a deceased friend",
  "text": "I am currently finalizing my master thesis and in my acknowledgement section I would like to dedicate it to my friend who passed away during the semester. I have a hard time writing this dedication because of the formal style. I want to write about how smart she was and how her level of determination and excellence will always inspire me. \n\n\nSince acknowledgement are supposed to be for people who helped you with your thesis I don\u2019t know if it is appropriate. Thoughts?\n\nETA: Thank you for all your answers, it is very helpful and definitely eased any worries that I had :)",

Usually, at the beginning you give the academic acknowledgements at the beginning (chair, committee members, people you worked with in the lab, etc.).  But then thanking your family, friends, your favorite bar tender, etc. for supporting you is completely common. \n\nBack when I was in grad school, we were instructed to not include the acknowledgement section when we turned our thesis into our committee as to not seem like a kiss-ass by thanking them.  I rather liked that practice because it really gave the student complete freedom to write whatever they wanted in that section.",

Second paragraph, quite open references to pub crawls with the students in the lab and some inside jokes.

In a famous case in the Netherlands, a thesis was rejected because the author thanked God. In other European countries that would not have been a problem.",
