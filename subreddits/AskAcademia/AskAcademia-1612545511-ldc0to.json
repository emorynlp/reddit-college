  "text": "This is part rant and part question. I had an introductory meeting with about 15-16 other PhD students who had just started and the session included a question answer session with professors where anonymous questions could be asked. One individual, whose supervisor expected him to work weekends as well, asked the professors how he can politely tell his supervisor that this isnt right.\n\nThe response of one of the professors was:\n\n\"We are in this because we love science. If you don't want to work weekends, perhaps you do not love science and you do not belong here. If that is the case, you should leave.\"\n\nI was rather shocked. I admit that I do put in extra hours because I want to and have to because of my horrible productivity throughout the day. However, what was suggested by the \"expert\" was that it is basically compulsory to do this. Is that really what is expected in the Academia? Why is it like that? Why isn't mental and physical health given their due importance? Burn out is a thing.",

      "text": "I worked for 60 hours per week for my first 2 years. I was burning out and decided to not do that anymore. I didn't tell my professor, I just stopped. I guess my advisor could have fired me, but that would've cost him years of work and training.\n\nNow as faculty, I still work just 40 hours. Partly because I learned to get a lot done in 40 hours, partly because I turned down the offers from departments where I could tell they expected more regardless of productivity, and partly because I'm in engineering and good faculty are hard to find, so they'll pretty much put up with whatever I feel like doing.\n\nMoreover, I worked 6 hours total in my 4 week winter break. I worked zero hours fall break. I expect to work for 12 hours this week long spring break, simply because I'm behind on grading. My work-life balance is superb.\n\nBeyond just bragging, my point is it's possible. Admittedly, If you want to land a TT gig at a top 20 school, then it's probably not possible.",

      "text": "That is a toxic as fuck response, and I hope the chair of that meeting stepped in, and then took that prof aside. If they didn't the organisation has big issues.\n\nI make it very clear to my PGRs that working 40 hours a week effectively is in itself a good achievement. Being at work for 70 hours is meaningless if they're not productive, and it's unhealthy and unfair in any case. Academia demands enough of you already without sacrificing your evenings and weekends for a lacklustre income and no guarantees of jobs. Fuck that.\n\nIt's perfectly possible to be productive and successful at 40 hours a week with a bit of discipline. I treated my PhD like an 8-5 and I encourage my PhD students to do the same. My most recent graduated student did that, has 4 awesome 1st author papers including big name journals, won awards, and got a great job. Weekends should be taken and the work will still be there on Monday. Will I ever be written about in the history textbooks? Almost certainly not. But neither will 99.99% of the rest of the academics I deal with, so frankly I will take this one life I have and live it. And I expect those around me to do the same. Expecting other people to fuck their lives up because you have a misguided sense of what is reasonable is not cool.\n\nDon't enable that kind of fuckery. Get the job done, and draw your own lines in the sand at what is achievable. Don't become the sausage meat in someone elses grinder. You want to know why the mental health stats in gradschool are so terrifying? It's because it's a black hole of shitty expectations that students have on them - both from themselves, and from bad supervisors. A PhD is taxing enough without also making it a physical and mental marathon with no downtime. Work 40 hours well. Hell, work 30 hours well. If you're working 70 hours I'll put money on half of them being unproductive.",

If you\u2019re working excessive amounts of time and outputting little, you\u2019re probably burnt out and could benefit from working less.\n\nI feel you on this. The worst.",

That has absolutely nothing to do with how much I love science and love my job. From my understanding, it's considered quite healthy to have hobbies outside of work - and if work is taking up 60-70 hours per week, that doesn't give much time for those, let alone a family or any relationships outside of work.\n\nThere is this great organization called the [National Center for Faculty Development & Diversity](https://www.facultydiversity.org/) that really emphasizes work-life balance. I know several faculty members who follow their programs and are quite successful (have a life outside of work and are making research waves, while remaining excellent instructors), so it definitely can be done.",

      "text": "You've gotten so many good comments on this post, but I'll also add this: most of the people who *think* they are working 60-80 hours a week really aren't. They're just spending that time *at* work (in their office, at their desk, etc.) There are studies that show that productivity drops sharply after about 50 hours a week, and after about 55 hours drops so sharply that it's kind of pointless to work additional hours ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/stanford-study-longer-hours-doesnt-make-you-more-productive-heres-how-to-get-more-done-by-doing-less.html)). There's a reason why we moved away from that during the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, you're also more prone to making mistakes when you're exhausted and overworked.\n\nIf you think about it, 70 hours a week would be 10 hours every day of the week, or 14 hours 5 days a week. That's just not a sustainable level of work. \n\nI left academia for industry a few years ago, and one of the things I learned is that when my work hours are *constrained* to 8/9 to 5, I get a lot more done in that period of time than I did when I was in academia and I theoretically had all day to do things. (It's also confounded by the fact that I grew up, though - I went to grad school straight from undergrad.) It's not that I was working more then, though; it's that I simply wasn't disciplined about. When I wrote my dissertation I got *very* disciplined - I wrote (or did dissertation-related things like analyzing data) from 10 to 6 every day and put in a few hours on Saturday as well, but I didn't get anywhere near 60 hours, and I finished my dissertation in 11 months.\n\nThat professor doesn't necessarily love science more than you; he's just inefficient and is willing to sacrifice his personal time on the altar of science. Which is fine for him, I guess.",

Obviously people who are thinking well realize that this mis-locates the flaws entirely.\n\n(Even knowing all this, it still has shocked me that throughout this pandemic, I have not gotten the impression that academics generally expect anything less from people lower in the hierarchy in terms of output- obviously an out-of-place notion in a well-functioning academy- than they would under normal circumstances. I know many people who were rightly barred from going to campus because of the virus but whose supervisors expressed judgment and disappointment that they had gotten less lab work done this past year...)\n\nTo be clear, none of this is compulsory or mandatory, and in fact we all may have some sort of obligation to resist these pressures, but you should recognize that the expectation is there and it will not be easy to carve out a more healthy life for yourself.\n\nEdited to add: I'm in the U.S and am speaking mostly about my experience with people in the English-speaking world.",

It\u2019s a fallacy of composition to think \u201canyone\u201d could do it because even if they did, it would just become harder to distinguish oneself. There is only room for a few applicants at the top of the pile. The more productive everyone becomes, the more effort it takes to set yourself apart.\n\nI know people that did it anyway. They didn\u2019t do it by \u201cbeing strategic in their projects\u201d and going home at 5. They worked like crazy. I\u2019d come in in the morning and they were still there from working all night. Most people\u2019s organs would fail if they worked that hard. \n\nI managed to get tenure with less effort, but I was still functionally doing 60 hours a week while I did my PhD.

Yes, I work a lot in academia, yes it\u2019s not a 9-5, yes there are times I work weekends and holidays but you have to be in balance. I do work a bit on the weekends, but my expectation of productivity in myself is very different than during the week and the types of \u2018work\u2019 I do is what I find most fulfilling or least cognitively demanding (like reading papers, just thinking about new ideas, working on grants, Editing my CV, working on a blog or my website, etc). And unless I am under an urgent deadline, I stop the second I don\u2019t want to work any more or when my kid wants my attention so we can enjoy time together. I may not be the most brilliant or most productive but that keeps me in balance, that keeps me loving science, that works for me.

I could be working less, but I'm trying to re-record my class lessons (to improve the quality) and I'm managing a lab of about 15. I'll probably reduce my goal to recording half my videos. We'll see. Once I record my videos this semester I'm planning on reusing those this summer and next year (and probably the next if we stay online longer). I'm also planning on shrinking my team to about 6 students (most are graduating). I'm hoping to have more time for writing and enjoying family and life.  \n\n\nI could literally focus on one research project (or non if I don't care about being promoted to full prof) and reuse my slides and videos forever... but I don't find that exciting.

Academia is so flooded with (over) qualified people now that balance is for those who can either throw caution to the wind, are already tenured, or have found that dream position where students don't email at 10pm and research/publication expectations don't impact tenure.

I probably did some 60 hour weeks when I had a major paper due or was preparing for comps.

      "text": "I think you need to work as much as you have to, to solve the question or problem you are trying to solve, by the deadline given to you by your research adviser. If things don\u2019t come naturally to you or you have gaps in your base education (for example, I took an accelerated calc 3/4 which left out a lot, so I needed to teach myself calc 4 on my own in order to be up to par with what I needed to do for my thesis), you can expect to be working nights and weekends. It all depends on the circumstances and what you can handle, and your adviser should respect that but I appreciated mine pushing me hard to see how much I could accomplish. Just as an example, I would meet with my adviser once a week for an hour or two to go over my research progress, learn directed/focused coursework, and discuss my goal for the following week. Most of the time I would have to spend 10-20 hours thinking about and working on whatever problem we were trying to solve, on top of my other coursework, leading labs, grading assignments/exams and proctoring. But if I wasn\u2019t able to solve it, we would work on it at our next meeting and he was always satisfied as long as he could see that I put a lot of effort and thought into whatever I was able to complete. I didn\u2019t do that great in undergrad but still managed to get into a great grad school for my field, so I did have to put in a lot of extra time, but I got a lot out of it and had a great experience. So I guess in the end I would just say that 60-70 hours sounds like a lot, but if you enjoy what you\u2019re doing, learn a lot, and have a great/respectful relationship with your adviser, it doesn\u2019t seem like much while it\u2019s happening.",
