  "text": "I\u2019m a graduate researcher focusing on my Masters in a special Pharmacy concentration. I\u2019m working on a huge breakthrough with COVID-19 research and just helped earn a ridiculous grant for my research team. I am in a position where the future of my career may be determined by my next actions. I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post this but I feel like everything I have been working for over the past year is about to fall apart. Please direct me to the appropriate place if this is wrong. \n\nI was visiting one of the Dr\u2019s that\u2019s part of my research team with another colleague of mine. Discussing future moves over dinner and drinks. The colleague left and i was asked to stay to go over a few more details. I was prevented from leaving physically and repeatedly touched without my consent despite saying no and moving away from him. I\u2019m afraid to report this incident because my career in research could be over. I need this opportunity. But I don\u2019t think I can face him in the lab again. He\u2019s my superior and my future working on this project and any credit that may be mine may not be used. What do I do? What would you do? Please help me decide what to do next.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you guys all so much. I\u2019m so overwhelmed by your support and just utterly thankful for everyone who commented below and messaged me. I\u2019m going to continue to respond to the comments and chew on this information for a few more days. \n\nIn the midst of the quarantine\u2019s chaos, I\u2019m awaiting on a return phone call from the Victim\u2019s Advocacy center through an anonymous contact. I\u2019m going to try to get in writing a confirmation that any information I share with them will not be shared with anyone else without my consent, and confirmation that they are not held by the same Title IX regulations as University payroll staff are. \n\nThat being said, I have blocked communication for now with the PI and informed my colleague who has been really supportive. He has decided cut ties with the professor and informed me of some disturbing signs throughout that night that I missed. I am so lucky, and just so fortunate things had not been worse but now that I understand how common this actually is, I\u2019m going to do my best to find ways to be supportive to other students who experience these occurrences. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t responded to everyone yet, these thoughts have been eating away at my entire day. I\u2019m in tears writing this, thank you all so much, again, for your advice and support. \n\nI don\u2019t know if another update is necessary but I can if anyone is interested when I hear back from the VA center.",

I had to deal with sexual harassment during my PhD and was guided by a couple of people. my first objective was to get through my PhD and then my second was to file a warning and start the process. I remember speaking to a student union welfare rep and a sexual harassment specialist. I was referred to the SU rep by HR. First port of call is to speak to specialists at your institution who can confidentially advise you. I will leave it here for now and please do ask if my experiences can help.\n\nEdited to add: Part of it is that you need to decide what outcome you want. Right now may not be the right time. Also, anyone you can trust within the research group? My experience was a few years ago and hate seeing others go through things like this. Stay strong.",

          "text": "I\u2019ve had an experience going to my (top) university\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d ombudsman to talk things over because a harasser coworker was making life impossible for me and trying to denigrate my work/ get me fired. I just needed help approaching this issue with my boss, and didn\u2019t complain about the sexual harassment part at all, because I was young a stoic and didn\u2019t want my career to be \u201cover\u201d. The next day my PI who had no knowledge of the issue, at least from me, apologized profusely and told me I don\u2019t have to work with the guy anymore. Everyone did a good job keeping him away from me after that. I\u2019ve been wondering ever since if the confidential ombudsman is there for you or for the university to not get sued. Did they discuss everything with my boss without my consent? Just something to keep in mind- I\u2019ll never be able to prove anything and in my situation it worked out for the best for me, but I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone working for the university. You should talk to someone though, maybe an undergrad mentor, someone you\u2019re close with and can ask for advice but is not on university payroll.\n\nEdit: because it\u2019s very early and I can\u2019t seem to make sense- I mean definitely talk to someone, you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to, you did nothing wrong. But try to talk to someone you trust because any of the resources at the university might be there to protect him/them not you. And definitely get proof, like everyone else said. Also I know my story is anecdotal, but I\u2019ve heard firsthand from 2 other friends who filed complaints against their harassers- one filed a title IX and the department forwarded all of her emails to the harasser. A second was pressured and gasslit by the student adviser not to say anything because it would ruin the harasser\u2019s career. I\u2019ve seen enough to know that these kinds of things you strategize and discuss with people you trust- preferably at a different institution and with no skin in the game- and you only tell the university once you\u2019ve gotten an attack plan together.",

You can also ask someone in terms of hypotheticals: \"hypothetically, suppose I were helping someone to report a sexual assault--what are the confidential reporting options on this campus?\" Mandated reporters are not (supposed to) be investigators; as long as you do not indicate that sexual misconduct occurred, the person should not be mandated to report.",

A few months later, my advisor called me into his office, closed the door so it was just us alone, and screamed at me for attempting to ruin his career. Turns out the ombudsman alerted the department chair, who happened to be a good friend of my advisor. Advisor switched gears very quickly once he realized it was supposed to be an anonymous report and that he had just outed his friend. Thankfully this happened when I was already planning to leave this lab and the advisor and I put on good faces for the duration of my postdoc, but it effectively burned that bridge for me. \n\nAll in all, you should absolutely talk to people for help.

This happens in life a lot, we face a situation where there is no win, and we need to make the least catastrophic choice. Good luck and stay strong.

It didn't go so well sadly.   \nFrom my perspective it seems that there is a fine balance between anonymity and gathering enough facts to take action. On one hand, you don't want your career to suffer so would ideally be anonymous. On the other, you may have to come out with your name if the institution doesn't want to let go of this academic.    \nSome of the female colleagues were thankful they spoke up, others wished they hadn't.   \nDo you know of any female academics in higher positions of your institution who you could get advice on this? \n\nIt sucks, it's awful and one of the reasons I gtfo of academia. \n\nI wish there was a clear answer here. Coming out will harm your career, but not speaking up won't fix this problem. The extent of harm or good your actions will have depends on the situation, the institution, mechanisms in place (like ATHENA SWAN), and your allies.\n\nAll I can for certain is, this is not your fault it happened. What happened was bad and totally unprofessional (and illegal). You have every right to complain about it and anyone that doesn't support you is in the wrong, not you.   \nDefinitely try seek out help, allies, support from anyone you feel you can trust.",

It is of course up to them to decide whether they want to report it or not, but it does sound like they do and like the situation has left them disturbed enough to be thinking about it afterwards. I honestly do not believe the department would be on a students side when shit like this happens, at least not from my experience. Department faculty is often a clique-based hierarchy that defends its own stronger than anything you can imagine, and the amount of politics that go into that kind of a toxic environment is absurd. I know of some cases similar to this both from my uni and other unis, and not once did the department faculty take a students side. Its unfortunate but that is usually the case; people value their jobs, status and relationships much more than they value the right thing to do, and this is especially true, ironically, in a uni environment where tenure is basically obtained by a combo of bootlicking and black magic.  \nTo the other person responding to this comment - I think its incredibly naiive to think that uni/department personnel could help OP without jeopardizing their relations, without a shred of real evidence. Sure, by the book these situations have a handling protocol, but thats just what it is - by the book, in theory. Not once did I see it really work out in practice. OP needs to obtain concrete evidence if they want to take this guy down, and they absolutely should. No career and no future is worth tolerating such blatant disregard of other people. If we as future academics want to make our already toxic environment better, people like that guy need to be booted out of it.",

I once filed a complaint about a professor because of sub-par teaching and disrespectful language use towards the students, and I had to meet with some people and give more details, but I never had to face the professor herself, and she wasn\u2019t informed that I was the one who filed the complaint. I eventually got a letter informing me that they had evaluated the report and what the conclusion was, and this was sent through this digital system that we have in Norway now that is equivalent to the kind of letter you would need to sign for if it was sent a physical copy. So they\u2019re pretty serious about doing things the proper way. Your uni might do things differently, but either way it should be possible to find out how they handle complaints. You could probably talk to someone in the administration and not give them details (you don\u2019t even have to give them your name if you do it by phone), and find out if you can file a complaint anonymously/semi-anonymously, or if the person in question will be informed that it was you.\n\nEdit: also, I am so so sorry this happened to you! Hope you\u2019ll find a solution where you don\u2019t have to see this person anymore without jeopardizing your career. And if that\u2019s not possible, know that no matter the outcome, you did not deserve this and he is a jerk. I know that\u2019s not really much of a comfort, but with the amount of blame typically put on victims of harassment I just wanted to emphasize that you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, and how you choose to deal with this is 100% up to you!",

      "text": "AcademMisconTA, I am so sorry that happened to you! Unfortunately, that type of behaviour is prevalent in academia and able to persist due to the power structures and hierarchy that exist in the academy. You need to do what makes YOU feel comfortable. I would recommend speaking with a student union representative if your uni has one. If you are in the US, you can speak with someone at the Title IX office, though be prepared that Title IX exists ONLY to protect the University, not the students. Some people here are recommending you email or talk with this person directly. I would say only do that if you feel safe and reasonably comfortable. You do not need to put yourself in a position that you feel is unsafe just for 'proof.' Lastly, consider speaking with the department head or another faculty in the department whom you trust. Keep in mind, though, that they are likely required to report to Title IX if you disclose (again, that's if you are in the US). Also, keep this reddit thread as proof of disclosure. If you report at any level, they will ask if you have told anyone this already.\n\nThere are many avenues you can take. You can not formally report (though I do recommend disclosing to someone you feel you can trust or possibly a therapist) and continue working in this lab until you complete the Master's work and move on. I would only take that route if you are able to complete this work without ever being alone in the same room as this person. You can disclose to other members of the research team and allow them to guide you through whatever process is appropriate. Or you can formally submit a report/complaint with the University and take action from there. Honestly, all options are hard. The most important thing is that you have people you can trust and that you are safe. Sadly, most womxm I know in academia have experienced some level of harassment. This is not something that should be swept under the rug, so THANK YOU for sharing with us here. Regardless of the path you chose, I encourage you to continue telling your story if you feel comfortable doing so. You can contribute to awareness of this systemic issue at conferences, with colleagues, and in op-eds. I hope you are well through this process and know that none of this behaviour is your fault.",

      "text": "Your post reminds me of the time when I was being sexually abused by an 80 years old professor who was my direct instructor in a graduate level program, almost 5 years ago! He bullied me and took advantage of my vulnerability as an International student and even provided me false information regarding immigration to make me rely on his influence only! He sabotaged my self-confidence at that time by telling me how he was the only person who could help me get through all my struggles as an International student and took advantage of that! He made sure he showed me how powerful he was as he was a member of Rotary club, friends with the provincial ministers and a face for the university as an important donor!  I kept quiet for 8 months until I graduated and later just tried to forget it happened and move on to build my life. Later I did have an opportunity to record his confession where he did say he touched me without my consent but I never put any charge against him. I am currently studying in the same university in another program, in a different department. I intend to do a masters and a PhD in the future. But if harassing students sexually is a common phenomena in academic field, it is a huge shame! Where does it end? What can we do about it? Does #metoo doesn\u2019t speak for us? Yesterday only I watched the documentary on Jeffery \u00c9piston on Netflix and it disgusted me to my core! The miniseries showed  how sexual predators prey on vulnerable people and often time they are the powerful faces of the society!",

That's the only step that can lead to real long-term consequences for a criminal act.\n\nA university's Title IX office is neither a criminal investigative nor a judicial organization.  They have very little real power, especially when it comes to investigating things that happened off campus.  Sure, the guy might eventually lose his job if you go that route, but that's only the very beginning of what's at stake here.  Criminal acts deserved to be punished by the criminal justice system, not by a university make-believe court governed by opaque procedures and run by people who don't have a clue about real investigations.  If somebody makes lewd remarks to you on campus despite you asking them to stop, that's something your Title IX office is capable of handling.  Title IX offices can't even begin to handle actual physical assaults like you experienced.  That type of situation is simply not within their skill set.  That's why we have a real criminal justice system with real investigators trained to deal with these situations.\n\nI strongly urge you to file a police report as soon as you are able.  The longer you wait, the more wiggle room the perpetrator will have to weasel out of any consequences.\n\nBest wishes to you.",

Second, to prevent any funny business, file a warning and get any sort of processes going.  (3.) Do not be in such awe of these people and listen to your instincts; if one of your peers were acting like this, you would probably tell them off.  The trick in this situation is to stand your ground and move forward.  \nAges ago, I started a degree and did not finish it (moved to another school) and was being harassed by my advisor.  It was a different time.  He considered himself gentile and superior, and I was a blue-collar upstart.  \nHowever, human behaviour remains the same.  When people harass, they are seeking to define a power relationship with you to meet some sort of need.  Sexual harassment from what I have seen appears to be about using a power imbalance to try to form relationships that these individuals could never form outside the office.  \nIn my case, the individuals wanted to be able to condescend and destroy an individual who did not meet his specific criteria of values, appearance and skills.  In your case, I suspect they are looking for some sort of unrealistic romantic relationship.  Their actions tell us more about their failings as individuals than anything.   Functional and successful people do not act like this.    \nGet your degree, but begin making plans to move on.  They may not be as professionally successful as they portray themselves.",

Once I have built a solid case, that's when I would consider officially reporting him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also try to get advice from trustworthy people in your department's admin, and have a call with them asking them about what would happen if \"hypothetically\" so and so was reported. It's a good way to get customizable answers and advice to go about this situation without actually having anything be on record. I would get in contact with Title IX office, Ombudsman office, sexual harassment office, or whatever anonymous way you can get advice on the best route on reporting it and the best  kind of evidence you can collect and produce when the time comes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't have to make a decision about any of this right now. Take your time, it's okay.  \n\nI would  recommend being as secretive as possible about any intention to report anything, because you don't want your harasser to catch wind of it and preemptively retaliate.  I have witnessed situations in my department where a very prestigious professor emeritus was accused of discrimination, and once they heard about it, the university pushed them into retirement so it becomes a civil dispute rather than something the university is involved in. Which made it difficult for the person who reported the discrimination to pursue any legal action because the fees were no longer covered by the university.  Another instance is of a student who was in the process of reporting a superior for harassment and the faculty in question found ways to malign the student on record to discredit her. People can be crazy when it comes to protecting their careers, it's good that you're already being tactful. \n\nFinally, ask yourself, which would make you prouder of yourself: reporting a harasser or getting what you need from him (credit for your work etc) and moving on? nothing is wrong with either, and if you didn't report him, somebody else will eventually. It's not your personal responsibility to take on every wrong doer you encounter in your life, sometimes you'll have the mental capacity for it and other times you won't, and that's okay.",

When I talked to my colleague today, he informed me that in light of yesterday\u2019s conversation  with the professor that the he was attempting to scrap my future research contributions. In that case, I believe I\u2019ve gotten as much credit as I possibly can out of the situation. \nI have relinquished the desire to fight for further participation in his lab, as it is a one-on-one, small quarters and I will without a doubt be alone with him for several hours at a time in a building that is minimally populated for the remainder of the semester. I don\u2019t think I can take the chance right now. \nI am going to focus on finding another lab to finish my thesis under without an official report as well as talk to the VA center, where no reporting is required. I think I\u2019ll make a final decision on to whether or not to make the report official for Title IX admin after I\u2019ve secured my diploma or I\u2019ve got all my needs met in research. Your concluding question...is a very difficult one to answer. I don\u2019t know if reporting him will necessarily make me proud, but finishing school in December will absolutely make me happy.",

Unless it is possible to sort this thing out (either gathering evidence and complaining or standing against him (most of these people are cowards inside)) within a short time period, feel proud of your contributions, politely ask for nice recommendations from the professors (without blaming anybody of anything) and get the hell away from the mess. You can't dream of a bright future with a gloomy present. These kinds of events, in most of the times, changes the life-course of a potentially good academician. Don't let it loose your focus from academia. You're still at the early stage of shaping your career. It is how you take things and deal with them matters more than how others deal with or perceive of you.\n\nTLDR: If it can't be fixed in short time without getting 'huge' attention for this incedent, feel proud of your contributions and seek for study opportunities somewhere else.",

You must stand firm and set your boundaries.  You are no less worthy of your boundaries than theirs.  (This seems antithesis to others' advice, but it establishes you having set your boundaries.  Record this interaction!)  \n\nSecond, you need to bring these actions to the attention of their higher ups.  Everyone has a higher up.  They need to be read in on the situation.  No one likes being caught unaware if a situation escalates.  This may actually be first.  Or coordinated with my first item.  (Again, do so in a way that is recordable.  Sending email? Mark it as \"read varification necessary.\")  \n\nThird, DOCUMENTATION!  You must document every interaction.  Even the inoccuous ones.  If you are to be subjected to regular interactions with this person, you must document every interaction.  If a pattern emerges, it will be documented.  If you can record interactions, all the better.\n\nFourth, No Matter What Happens, Stand Your Ground.  You have every right and reason to expect to work in an environment that is beneficial for your future.  If that fails, Do Not Blaim Yourself If You Have Followed The Previous Steps.  \n\nYour goal is not to 'take down a predator.'  Your goal is to educate someone about the current expectations of ethics and decorum.  If they can't handle that, it is on them.  Your documentation will show that you attempted a non-confrontational relationship.  If this person can't handle that, they will bury themselves.  And you still come out the good guy who tried to educate someone stuck in the old school world.  \n\nI know that this is a difficult situation, but you deserve to feel confident to perform your duties as prescribed without feeling singled out or hampered.    \nI am so sorry you are having to go through this.",
