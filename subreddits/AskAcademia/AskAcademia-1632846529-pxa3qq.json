      "text": "I would email the professor. Most likely, he collaborates with others in programs/institutes that offer a PhD. \n\nI am currently a 1st year PhD student. My main advisor is in the PhD department, but my 2nd advisor does the research I want. They just happen to have recently began collaborating and were willing to share me as a student. My 2nd advisor will give me more hands-on research experience and my 1st will guide me through the program milestones.",

      "text": "You\u2019d likely be able to have them on your committee and work with them that way, but usually your committee chair has to be from the institution you\u2019re getting your PhD from. I would also check to see if they\u2019re interested in taking on additional students before making any decisions one way or another. It\u2019s not uncommon for professors even at PhD granting institutions to be too busy to advise additional students.",
