  "title:": "Rules and conduct on this sub",
  "text": "Hi all. In light of recent posts we\u2019ve realised that a little refresher on rules and conduct might be required for some users (these are all listed in the sidebar/about section, but apparently some people have missed or forgotten them). To summarise a few major points:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Report problem posters; do not take them public. Mods can't see everything, so you need to bring things to our attention.\n\n2) Don't bully. If you are told you are bullying, stop what you are doing, even if you think your behaviour is helpful.\n\n3) We are not therapists or counsellors. And if there are any here, they'll tell you that you're not helping by playing armchair psychologists.\n\n4) Undergrads really shouldn't be answering \\*most\\* questions here. People asking questions are looking for answers from people with experience; something most people early in their academic journeys won\u2019t have.\n\n5) If you disagree with someone, comment yourself and let the upvote/downvote system do its job.\n\n6) As well as following the rules and code of conduct of this sub, remember reddit as a whole has its own rules and an expectation that users follow reddiquette.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is a reddit wide rule against bullying, threats, and harassment. If you have an issue with a user on this sub you can either use the report feature on their posts/comments (if they are breaking a rule), or contact the mods if you have concerns. We will take action *if it is appropriate to do so*. It shouldn\u2019t need saying, but users certainly should not target other users on this sub (or anywhere else on reddit) as this is in violation of reddit\u2019s own rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for the standards of this sub, to quote the code of conduct in the sidebar:\n\nIf a reasonable person wouldn't say it to a professor/colleague/conference speaker they don't know well, it's probably over the line. This includes off-topic and unproductive discussion as well as rudeness.\n\nDisagreement is completely fine, encouraged even, when there are different perspectives to share. If an idea is a bad one, please do tell someone that it is in no uncertain terms. Avoid ad hominem attacks, treat people online broadly as a reasonable person would treat a relative stranger in person, and help us out by reporting any posts which fall foul of this policy.",

I think that is how it should be, but if you think undergrads specifically should be limited in their contributions you need to explicitly state that because that does not come across right now IMHO. \n\nPerhaps others can chime in.",

Certainly career stage isn't everything - I'm quite a senior academic in the UK, but tend to stay away from US discussions when I don't definitely know the answer (or at least provide a qualified response).\n\nConversely, sometimes an undergraduate may have specific experience with the question being asked and can speak from authority.  I don't think there's a perfect one-size-fits-all rule, but generally responders should be providing answers from a position of experience and show an awareness of the limitations in the scope of their knowledge.  For example, I chair my university's academic integrity committee and have a ton of experience with it - but I'd be pretty careful commenting on a US thread about it and qualify the scope of my experience if I did.",

However, on reddit the general tendency, even in highly moderated subs, is for the silent majority of users (most of whom have no special expertise themselves) to upvote responses that resonate emotionally rather than the ones that actually make the most sense.  A good example of this is /r/legaladvice, where people frequently upvote bad legal advice because it *feels* like the correct or most just response.  Mods there frequently have to lock threads down for this reason.",
