  "title:": "Why are online/virtual conferences so expensive?",
  "text": "For context, I am not in academia but my work and interests rely heavily on information that comes from the academic community. In other words, I am not eligible for funding or discounted fees for attending conferences. There are several conferences I've been interested in attending this year, especially given that they've been designed for a virtual audience and don't involve travel.\n\nWhat's surprised me is how many have registration fees similar to that of an in-person conference. I find it hard to believe that the running costs of an online event come close to the in-person costs, so is this money just going into the pockets of the organisers?",

These days it is utter BS.\n\nI have arranged a couple of international conferences, and we never got paid. The bulk of the fees went to localities, food, airfare for keynotes, etcetera. A tiny amount was spent on web services, registration admin etc.\n\nTo pay serious money for a two-day Zoom meeting is ridiculous.",

      "text": "While I'm not on the planning committee, I am on another committee that deals with our annual scholarly conference.  Our biggest costs for an online conference was the online part.  We didn't have the computing infrastructure to host a online conference so they outsourced it.  That was an expensive contract. \n\nAs far as I understand, our conference is not a money maker. In normal years it roughly breaks even (registration $300 member/$500 non-member).  The money comes from membership fees and their journals.  Last year they deeply discounted it, but this year it was roughly the same.  I have not heard the profit/loss of it for this year.  \n\nI will say that sitting on these committees, almost everyone on those committees come from big research universities with large grant support.  They honestly don't see the money because it is all paid for either by the university or from their grants.  We also have a sizable group of physicians that attend, and nobody is worried about their ability to pay.  We will, though, have long conversations about grad students and post-docs and how much we ask them to pay.",

No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave I met co-authors I never would have met otherwise: yes.\n\nHave I been given the opportunity to serve on high-level committees with other people in the field: yes.\n\nHave I been approached to edit a volume by a well-respected publisher: yes.\n\nHave I gotten to go to cocktail hours and informal hangouts with more senior and famous scholars in the field: yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the academy, networking does a lot more than magically produce employment. First, the key to jobs are papers and grants. Networking and conferences can facilitate these. Second, search committees like candidates that they've heard of and that come highly recommended by senior scholars in the field. Networking and conferences can facilitate that, too. Tenure and promotion is based on overall impressions of you across the field. Networking and conferences can help with that too.\n\nThe importance of conferences as a barrier to networking, publishing, jobs, and promotion is precisely why it's so troubling that conferences are most accessible to the most well-resourced individuals, leaving others at a disadvantage. So while we may not agree that conferences \\*SHOULD\\* matter this much, it would be disingenuous to pretend that they don't under the current system of academia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar",

It's less than venue rental, but not insanely so, in part because convention centers are often subsidized by cities and the support staff you're paying for are more highly trained and way more expensive. There's no speaker travel, but you're still paying honoraria. You're probably paying more staff overtime too.\n\nThere's also a supply and demand factor. Attending a virtual conference with full price registration is still way cheaper than attending one live. If most attendees are academics doing conferences that they've built into grants years in advance, they can pay full price and still go to twice as many conferences as they budgeted for due to no travel costs.",

A lot of the mingling that happens can be useful but actually having researched the people in the room enough to know who to talk to is a bit unrealistic and many times you are speaking to academics who are already struggling to have their universities justify paying for their work ( at least in the art fields I tend to see this a bit) so if you are going to possibly network for work purposes it doesn't really add up to much. \n\nAt least that has been my experience so far.",
