  "text": "I've co-authored a paper with a student that based on her work from her dissertation (which I supervised). She will be first author. When submitting the paper, I can't decide what to do about her institutional affiliation, as she is currently not with any academic institution. Should she put her affiliation as being the school and university in which she was a student (and where the bulk of the work was done), or should she identify herself as an independent researcher? What would you do?\n\nI doubt this is field-specific, but if it is relevant, the field is social science / public health.\n\nThanks.",
