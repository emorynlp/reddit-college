  "text": "TL;DR - My PhD broke my academic ability and now I struggle to be productive in reading or writing. I have work to get done - any advice on breaking the PhD curse?\n\nI successfully defended my thesis back in March and celebrated my graduation last week. The PhD was a far more challenging journey for me than I ever imagined. I knew it would be intellectually hard - I can't imagine anyone assumes it will be easy - but I wasn't prepared for the emotional and psychological difficulty.\n\nDuring the final year or so of my PhD I lost my love of reading - I couldn't even read for pleasure anymore. I'm slowly gaining that back but it is taking considerable effort to do so. The anxiety I experienced during the writing up phase has also seemed to leave me with what I can only describe as academic burn out. I struggle to read or write academically now and whenever I start those kinds of activities I feel the same anxiety and procrastination seeping in and interfering.\n\nMy current job is a research role and I have a number of papers to write over the next few months. I'm looking for any advice or guidance on how to approach academic work after the strain of the PhD.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude42\n\nEditted to change wording.",

What is working for me is to take lots of breaks (as in, stop working and do anything for like 5 minutes after even minor milestones), stick to a strict routine, and \\*make\\* free time for myself and make sure I am only doing really fun things during that free time (for me it is playing video games and watching anime). I am not as productive as I once was right now (this summer has been very hard for me), but I am getting \\*something\\* done.",

          "text": "We sound very alike - so let me make it clear: You are not a failure! PhDs are incredibly challenging on an emotional level - why do you think so many postgrads experience mental health issues. It's ok to find it hard going, quite frankly I hated most of my PhD, but I'm still glad I saw it through and completed. If anything, the mental struggle of it just makes me all the more proud to have finished.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of depression I would advise you to seek advice from your campus counselling team. They are especially trained to support you through this. If that is not sufficient, speak with a doctor about accessing a mental health service (caveat: I'm based in the UK so things may be different elsewhere).\n\nYou may find some benefit from engaging with small creative projects in your spare time. Art is good for the soul and whilst you are beavering away at your thesis it can be nice to have projects that you can 'tick off' in the meantime.",

      "text": "You just graduated last week?  I wouldn't worry about this too much.  This is analogous to a marathon runner who just crossed the finish line saying, \"I lost my love of running.\"  You're absolutely exhausted and need some time to recover from the extensive work and stress.\n\nIf at all possible, take some time off, try to spend free time doing activities where your mind can take a vacation (including sleeping, watching stupid TV, reading trashy novels, etc.).  If you really love academic work and reading, that'll gradually come back.  You do say that you're currently in a research role, so I guess you can't turn your brain completely off, but just remind yourself that the pressure of dissertation work and graduating is off.  Most people try to finish off any remaining PhD projects shortly after graduating, and that's generally a good idea; however, if you're currently burned out, it'll only hurt you (and your projects/research/long-term outlook) if you try to do too much too quickly.\n\nDo you feel like excessive pressure to produce is coming from your advisors/supervisors or is it from yourself?  Either way, it may be a good idea to talk to your current supervisors, tell them that you're feeling burned out, and suggest a longer timeline for completion of these papers.  Most faculty will gladly be flexible with their postdocs, they're just happy to be having someone working (at a low salary) to continue the group's work.\n",

If you really want to get your brain into academia side of things, read something pop science.  My personal favorite is bill bryson's a short history of nearly everything. It is interesting enough to read over and over, and it puts me in the mindset for writing.\n\nAs far as writing anxiety goes, really focus on the draft concept of first draft. If you start something early, then you have time to put it away and come back to it fresh.  My advice is always to just get something on paper first and then edit it. Don't fret on individual sentences.  If you can't form a good sentence, put in a filler sentence like \"Talk about X, Y, and Z here\" and just move on. Getting something on paper to start editing is the hardest part. IF you can convince yourself it doesn't need to be perfect, that is half the battle. Perfection comes through editing.",

      "text": "Your post really resonates with me... I hope you don't mind me posting my story, you aren't alone in this feeling! For reference I am entering the 4th year of my PhD.\n\nAs a child (ages 8-15 or so) I had very severe ADHD. It wasn't \"prescribed to sell you pills\" bullshit ADD/ADHD like some people have; I had neurological tests, etc. I Just could not read anything beyond the fun fantasy stuff I liked. Ask me to read three pages of a math textbook and it would take me literally five hours, even though I liked doing the math PROBLEMS (just reading the book was the problem). Meds gave me terrible side effects so I never used them for long.\n\nIn high school and early college I sort of started to outgrow it. For no particular reason, I slowly but surely found myself more able to read things that I didn't want to. There was no dramatic transformation, and I didn't even try. It just happened. Maybe it was maturity, idk.\n\nWell, that was then. After about 3 years of struggling to lay the foundations of a thesis project (with extremely minimal help from my advisor for the first year, and literally hearing from him for about 3 hours per month afterwards), I think I've mentally reverted back to a 10 year old. Not in terms of intellect; of course I know more about math and quantum chemistry than pretty much anybody who hasn't been to at least a master's program. But I mean, in terms of focus and motivation. I kept looking in journal articles for \"something to do\", hoping it would make me suddenly realize \"ha! That's what my thesis topic should be!\". It didnt work. I can't look at journal articles anymore. I start trying to read one, and about 20 lines past the abstract, I just... can't. Even if it's something that I think I'd find interesting, that I would have gobbled up when I was early in my PhD, or in undergrad. I compulsively tab out and open a tab in reddit or start watching dumb gaming videos in youtube. \n\nThe same goes for writing. I have not ever written up something meant for publication. However in my first semester PhD course, before this started, I had to write a journal article-style manuscript for my lab techniques course every week. That was a bit annoying, but fine. But I have to write one manuscript for my degree's requirements, it's not for a journal, it's just to explain some things I did and a small proposal for something in the future. It is only a bit longer than any one of the ~15 of these I did for the course. I have literally had 18 months to write a 15-20 page document that won't even have to go through drafts. How much have I written? About 3 pages of the \"real\" stuff, and another 2 pages of easy background. \n\nI can still do other things... I can code just fine. I can do math. But I just... can't make myself read science anymore. I tried to go back to reading fun fantasy, like the hobbit, just to calm down. It didn't work well. I could do it for an hour or two but that's all. \n\nIt doesn't help that I am being forced to change PhD groups and essentially lose all the projects I haven't finished (aka all of them). It seems likely that I'll master out instead once I hit the mark to get the masters after fall semester. It's not like a masters degree is a mark of shame, look at how many people aim for them specifically... \n\nSorry for hijacking lol",

I really  think I should have taken some time for myself before getting started on another big challenge. As others have said, get some therapy and focus on things you enjoy.
