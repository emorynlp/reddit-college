  "title:": "My advisor was sexually inappropriate - how can I get around a letter of recommendation from him for PhD applications?",
  "text": "Background: I finished my undergraduate a few years ago. Research was my passion, but this burned me out and I've been too afraid to go back. I'm also not in the US.\n\nLong story short, my advisor was a creep to me, I don't want to elaborate in case he's on this subreddit. I know he uses Reddit a lot. I didn't really work with anyone else in the department, and I have no interest in reporting it - it's well known, my department doesn't care. I also don't want to bring this up in a new application, I don't want to seem like I'm slandering someone - and frankly, it's probably irrational, but I'd feel unprofessional talking about it.\n\nI'm finally in a place where I want to apply for my PhD, but I don't know how to explain the fact I won't have a letter of reference from the person I did my undergraduate thesis with. I honestly don't even know who else I can ask for a letter from - it's been so long since I left that I don't think any professors would remember me.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can frame this without it coming off as unprofessional, or like *I* did something to sour the relationship?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks Reddit.",

      "text": "First of all, sorry about what you've had to go through OP. That's extremely serious and it's unacceptable that the department refuses to acknowledge it. There is no place for sexism in academia/science, period.\n\nNow on to the matter at hand, e-mail your old professors with a document containing your CV/accomplishments and let them know that you are interested in applying to graduate school, maybe add a photo to your email profile so they'll remember you. Worst-case scenario, they toss the email. Best case, you get a LOR. Tbh, the LOR probably will not be as strong since it's not from someone who advised you but it's better than nothing and if you have a good CV the professor can still put in a good word for you.\n\nIf anyone asks about your PI during your PhD interview process, I think it's fine to be honest and say that you have broken contact with them due to numerous instances of sexual harassment towards you. If they are understanding, they'll be quick to drop it. If they blacklist you for it, that person was shitty to begin with and you'll probably dodge a few bullets in the long-run.",

I always thought I needed to know someone really well in order to ask for a good letter of reference. While that definitely helps, most students don\u2019t have access to that kind of support - especially first gen students or ones without strong existing networks. Or, in your case (and mine), students who apply to grad school after they are out of undergrad. You need someone to vouch for you. If you use the approach described above, most faculty should be willing to help you out. This is a pretty common occurrence. \n\nSomeone may ask more about your former mentor. (I had 1 or 2 people push to know more about why I took off a few years.) If you complain too much, reviewers may perceive you as being high maintenance. So my advice is to be as discrete as possible. There are \u201ccoded\u201d ways to indicate sexual harassment. \u201cThe environment in his lab wasn\u2019t very supportive for female students\u201d (assuming you are female). \n\nMost people who ask will do so because will they want to either see if there are major red flags or to make small talk (most likely scenario). As long as you weren\u2019t acquiring felony convictions or getting kicked out of labs, you\u2019re fine. If I reviewed your application, I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice that you didn\u2019t have a letter from him. \n\nGood luck!",

For better or worse, if you were my student and you were in say the top 50% of my class, and you ask nicely, you won't get a bad letter from me. If I felt that I couldn't recommend you for the particular program or position, I would discuss the reasons why with you. Of course there are differences between a good letter and a great letter. The better I know you and the better fit you are for the position, the better letter I can write. \n\nBut to be honest, unless (a) your professors are famous researchers and they say you're the best student they've ever had (which would help your case) or (b) your letters are negative (which is very rare and would obviously hurt your case), the letters of recommendation aren't likely to influence your PhD admission one way or the other.  99% of the time, they just serve as a confirmation of what we already know from looking at your transcript, resume, and personal statements.",

I had a similar situation in my undergrad but I never went to the department. He has since retired so now (so yeah it was 42 year age difference at the time) so it just feels pointless to talk to any one from the department about it. \n\nWhat I hate is that all these stories - including mine- is that these professors have a long career and get to retire cause they are tenured. There are 1000s of PhDs waiting for a job- why can\u2019t you just fire the predators and give the jobs to those that are waiting?\n\nWhere our stories differ is that when he asked for a sexual relationship it was after I asked for a recommendation letter. I said no and never contacted him again. I didn\u2019t get into the schools I applied to that round (whether that was because of him, I don\u2019t know) and the next year I asked my other professors. No one was concerned that they were not my undergraduate advisor- no one asked about it. All I can suggest is that you ask the other professors who knew you (took 2 or more classes with them). If it makes you feel better, I\u2019m in a PhD program now so it didn\u2019t hold me back. And with your bravery, it will not hold you back either. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for you and everyone else that has been put in these situations.",

It was in the middle of my PhD, but I also didn't want to name names. About a month ago another professor at my University contacted me and they had several complaints brought up against him, that is the only time I felt comfortable saying anything. No one wants that hanging over their head especially in academia as it is so stigmatized. I eventually had the professor who conducted the investigation write a letter in lieu of my advisor.\n\nObviously, you have a different situation. Up until the call with the other professor I was set on using my advisor as a reference even though I knew it had effected my chances of getting into another school, I didn't trust him to not go behind my back. So you have really 1 of 3 options, you talk to your department/dean/etc., you go ahead and use him as a reference as long as you still have a good relationship(in the sense that he won't say anything negative), and finally you just don't use him use another professor/PhD one that worked with you or published with you.",

      "text": "Professor here. I'm so sorry for what you experienced. ***No one will care that you don't have a letter from your advisor.*** It's not something we check for or make note of. We only care that the letters are strong, which means they're written by people who know you and your work well. \n\n/u/po2gdHaeKaYk is exactly right. The real issue here is getting a minimum of three solid letters. Based on what you wrote, it sounds like other than your advisor, you don't know who else to ask. So, even if you asked him (don't), you'd still be two letters short. Definitely follow other posters' advice on how to approach faculty and provide them with enough materials to put something together. \n\nWhile I think you should remain optimistic--we really do want to help students--you should also be prepared to hear no. It won't be just because they don't remember you well enough. It's also because writing a letter puts our reputation on the line; we are vouching for you to our colleagues. If we vouch for students who end up plagiarizing, harassing other students, imploding, etc, our colleagues will no longer trust our judgment.\n\n**Candidate interviews are definitely field-specific**, so if your discipline doesn't have them, this may not even be something you ever have to address in person. I'd be surprised if anyone pointedly asked you, but if so, I like /u/sunia42's suggestion. \n\nThe last thing I'll say is that you should think about why you want a PhD. (I don't mean to imply that you haven't, just encouraging you to keep doing so.) If you're considering working in industry, a PhD is rarely needed and the time spent in school can make you less competitive. If you plan to pursue academia, please understand that the job markets (in the U.S.) across the humanities, social sciences, and STEM are terrible and have been for a long time. Tenure track positions are becoming more rare, and recent grads must compete with PhDs who are still on the market 4-5 years after defending. Finally, if you don't know about the exploitation of adjuncts, you should look into it.\n\nGood luck with everything!",

For example, if an application includes a personal statement, you could describe your past research project and literally include a footnote that succinctly (1-2 sentences) explains the situation \u2014 sexual harassment happened, not comfortable asking for recommendation. Admissions committees at any school worth attending would not hold this against you.",

They can also explain the textbook and what they covered in the class. There are so many programs in the world and they vary so much, such information is very helpful for the people who go through students from all over the world. And many schools don\u2019t have academic advisor program anyway so it doesn\u2019t really hurt your case if you don\u2019t get a letter from the creep. \n\nI hope this helps.

And she'd never know, because letters are confidential. He could also use this as an excuse to attempt to rekindle communication, to manipulate her, to reassure himself that he didn't really harm her since she's asking him for a letter, etc.\n\nFurthermore, the power asymmetry between professor and student--*and she was an undergrad!*\\--is so large that there's no such thing as a mild transgression. We know the power we (well, some of us) have. It's the power that's allowed him to maintain the status of a respected researcher despite the fact that his sexually predatory behavior is well-known in his department.",

I will add that because your letters may be weaker since you don't have strong relationships with other faculty, your research statement/statement of purpose and writing sample must be exceptional. \n\nIf any of these professors agree to write for you, **don't hesitate to ask for brief comments on how to improve your statement and sample.** If they've decided to write for you, they'll be willing to make at least one or two observations about your materials. (You may have to gently nudge them as a reminder.)\n\nAlso note it's acceptable for one or two of your letters to come from people who were visiting assistant professors, non-tenure track faculty, a research librarian with a PhD, if you did a lot of archival work, etc. As long as they have PhD, work in academia, and know you, they're an acceptable reference.\n\nI'm sure you feel strongly about pursuing academia, but it's worth acknowledging that having weaker letters may ultimately prevent that possibility. Grad school is competitive in general, but unfortunately, it becomes more competitive during recessions. I don't mean to discourage at all! I pointed out the many, serious negatives of academia in my other post just to remind you there many ways to build a fulfilling, intellectually challenging life. \n\nEven if you're accepted into a program, I encourage you to remember that. I'm a young professor, and I've seen too many colleagues and students tie their self-worth to academia. It really hurts them. \n\nTL;DR: Screw that guy; go forth and prosper. Best of luck to you!",

Sexual violence is routinely dismissed at EVERY level of the criminal justice system--the campus officers or police who decide not to take statements; the extraordinary backlog of untested rape kits in every U.S. city and town; the victims who are silenced, shamed, doubted, coerced, etc; the list goes on. And we know this happens in every sector--academia and Hollywood, the military and Silicon Valley.\n\n**On what basis do you presume the professor would \"feel bad\"** when OP confirmed their behavior is a constant and known variable within the department--*meaning it's been going on for years, with multiple students?* Why would you think this person would suddenly and inexplicably \"feel bad\" when they've never admitted, apologized for, or *ceased their predatory behavior*?\n\n**What OP can gain is twofold**: the assurance they won't get a recommendation letter ***that secretly sabotages them*** *and* the assurance that they can maintain the peace of mind they've gained since cutting off communication with their abuser. \n\nMoreover, **OP doesn't need their abuser to accomplish their goals.** This man no longer has any power in OP's life. He is nothing, and OP will succeed--whether in academia or elsewhere--in spite of his abuse.",

However, if a professor or other figure in power **over many years** abuses **multiple people** in a **subordinate position** in any capacity, and it's a well-known fact within a department which routinely looks away from that behavior in order to avoid conflict and bad press, then \"misunderstanding\" does not figure into this equation.\n\nI'd encourage you to consider that actual misunderstandings are one-off scenarios. This term can't explain or apply to *repeated* predatory behavior. Other students commented to OP about his behavior, even though they could only see a fraction of it.\n\nConsider that \"mild\" transgressions can still inflict the same enduring psychological harm that \"major\" transgressions do. Someone who blocks you from leaving a room or makes \"jokes\" about rape or requires you to have late night meetings in their home in order to pass your thesis defense **communicates the same threat to life, instill the same fear, and affirm your inability to stop them** as someone who throws things or gropes you.\n\nWe don't need to elide differences in acts of sexual violence in order to note that it's never actually about the sexual threats or behavior. It's about power. If someone effectively strips power away from you, the psychosocial impact is the same. \n\nI'll stop with this post, since I don't want this to devolve into an argument. I absolutely agree with you that creepiness is a broad term (which can be frustrating and unhelpful).
