  "text": "I completed my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering from a State University in India and recently completed a distant learning MS Program in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University. I have over 10+ years of work experience in the Technology Industry and I want to join a PHD program in Computer Science. Is it possible for me to join a PHD program with a different undergrad major?",

      "text": "Usually yes, it's no problem as long as you have the qualifications and basic background knowledge. My degree titles have jumped around from Physics and Math to Nanoengineering to Electrical Engineering, and the only thing that has ever mattered is that I have the basic knowledge required to succeed in whatever degree I'm applying to. Sounds to me like the distance MS and probably the work experience will be more than sufficient to get in to a CS PhD, even more so if your experience is relevant to the PhD topic.",

      "text": "Yes, engineering to CS in particular is fairly common, also to shift even later (from PhD to faculty). Usually it's from an electrical/computer discipline of engineering, but from the sounds of it you would be fine with already having an MS in CS.",
