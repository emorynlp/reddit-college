  "title:": "Is academia so competitive now that it's pointless to try if you aren't exceptional/remarkable?",
  "text": "People will suggest to major in engineering instead of physics or mathematics due to academia being so extremely competitive. Has it reached a point to where if you're not, say, winning math olympiads during secondary school, you should probably not bother with a mathematics degree & academia, and instead default to engineering & industry instead?\n\nI'm wondering how the landscape looks for any and all fields right now, but especially STEM. Do you need to be effectively the #1 best applicant out of 300-3,000 applicants to recieve an offer? Do you actually need 1-3 post-doctoral positions to have a chance? Is all of that just hyperbole from bitter people?\n\nIt reminds me of how some children in europe begin training at 5 years old in these expensive soccer camps, so that they can have a chance of being on a team when they grow up. Is that what it's like now? Are you competing with people like that?",

Easy, as in, you do a short experiment.or draw up a table in the paper, and get authorship. I'm always a bit more sceptical of those with a lot of papers and a large number of authors on each. The students that go to top undergraduate institutions seem to get into top tier graduate programs, where the research groups are well-funded and their projects are well-defined with some key details completed for them. In my experience, all of this is amplified and a large number at top institutions have received tremendous boosts throughout their careers, not just in research.",

              "text": ">A bad supervisor can destroy your academic career and ruin your mental health.\n\nVery good point and it needs stating more often. We should also bear in mind that it is not just the bad supervisors as we would typically imagine it that can ruin a student's career. We typically imagine bad supervisors as being the abusive, selfish, or uninterested supervisors that don't care about their students at all. However, there are plenty of supervisors who are none of these things and still don't give their students any realistic career prospects.\n\nThe truth is, if you are not famous in your field and very well connected, or are not doing a topic that is likely to be super hyped when your student goes on the market, or you are not able to give your student projects that are likely to lead to papers that are immediately highly cited and/or published in prestigious places (Nature, Science, etc. for STEM), then your students are likely not going to have much chance on the job market.\n\nI see so supervisors who do great science and are very attentive to their students and train them really well, but the students graduate with a couple of publications in low tier journals with very few citations in topics that no hiring committee cares about.",

Don't sign on to high risk - high reward, and don't rely on data or telescopes that are out of your control.\n\nI imagine the vast majority of academics would have discouraged working on such an ambitious project because the likelihood of getting to the end of your PhD time limit with no data and no thesis is too high. Now those students are world famous and will have their pick of any tenure position.\n\nYou can't predict which fields will be big when you're applying to PhDs and apparently neither can the experts. So it's all chance.

      "text": "\\>Do you need to be effectively the #1 best applicant out of 300-3,000 applicants to recieve an offer?\n\nR1 craziness aside, in my (now quite long) experience on search committees at PUIs pretty much anyone in the top 20 of a 200+ person field could do the job. Certainly all of the short-listed candidates in a typical search call it the top half-dozen) are more than qualified on the basis of research, so at institutions like mine it's teaching skill and \"fit\" that makes the difference. While it's possible to prepare to be more competitive as an instructor, fit is so elusive a quality that it's impossible to describe and can seem quite capricious. There's no way to know how a given individual will interact with all the members of a search committee, a department, and the dean(s) during an interview, but quite often the debates in the final step come down to how the candidates will fit with the department, its mission, and its projected future needs.\n\nSo no, you don't have to be #1 on any meaningful scale. Being in the top 10% if often enough to get your file carefully considered and perhaps will get you a zoom interview. But you have to knock that out of the park *and* be a near-perfect match to the position (both the advertised part and the internal, unpublished requisites) to get an on-campus interview. From there it's usually a matter of not fucking up and fit.  Still, a 1-in-200+ shot at a given job isn't very good odds.\n\nHonestly, I've often seen people who are *amazing* on paper who don't even make the short list in a search-- if something about how they interview, their attitudes, their references, their teaching reviews, etc. turns off even a couple of members of the search committee that's it, since they are looking for reasons to cut people from the pool. For example, I've seen what looked like really good candidates dropped after zoom/skype interviews when they haven't asked good questions back to the committee-- taken as evidence that they hadn't done their research on the institution so weren't really serious about the job.",

For something like physics or biology, the typical successful applicant will have 2 post docs from very reputable labs. I don't know the details for straight math faculty. \n\n2) Yes, you need to be the best out of a large pool of applicants. In EE, the pool size seems to be about 200. My schools psych and philosophy departments also had about 200 applicants for their searches this year (physics wasn't hiring). However, being the most qualified doesn't just mean highest research output or smartest, it also entails being a good fit both in personality and specific subfield. \n\n3) Math olympiads have nothing to do with research success. Most of our faculty were near the top of their class, but very few were engaged in anything competitive. Really, hiring committees will care very little about undergraduate activity and not at all about anything pre-University. Personally, I'm in EE/BME and I'm not especially good at math. I'm technically competent, but squeaked by in my advanced math courses. I am, however, very good at communicating my ideas, managing projects, and making people feel comfortable and confident. Being smart is less important than working hard and understanding \"the game\" of academia. \n\n4) Many faculty candidates have been aiming for a faculty position since undergrad. Very few really started that path before then. I started targeting a faculty position my 2nd year of undergrad, got my name on a publication that same year and published at least once per year after that. I taught, took a pedagogy course, wrote and won grants, took R&D heavy internships, and built a substantial network of academic collaborations. My faculty job hunt was fairly easy: 3 offers from ~20 applications (I think, it could have been as few as 14 applications). Physics and math will likely be a more difficult hunt no matter what, especially if you want to be at a research intensive university.",

The Internet (and esp. reddit) is incredibly negative. I'm also kind of inclined to believe the people who are getting the jobs are NOT the ones freaking out about it on reddit/twitter/etc, so take that with a grain of salt.

Sometimes they get a job out of their \"genius\" reputation, but then they get quite behind in terms of funding and visibility because they start to work on some niche field or lose interest and dedicate themselves to other things (being pro chess player or being fluent in Chinese or whatever).",

      "text": "It is totally possible to be in academia as a mediocre person (I am living proof of it). I am completing a PhD in theoretical physics, and I am not particularly bright, I have done all my university education at a sub-par university in Australia, and it's been ok. I have colleagues who did even worse than me in subjects and still completed their PhD and are now working as researchers.\n\nThe key is finding an area that fits your skills and interests. What makes researchers better than others is conviction and workaholic tendencies. The people that get the most papers published are the ones willing to work 70 hours a week, they eat, breathe and bathe in research, they have no life outside university.\n\nHaving said that, you need to ask yourself: \"Is academia really for me?\" Because PhDs, especially in areas like physics, are really not valued outside university. In fact, employers will not even bother calling you for an interview, because your skills are not relevant to any job in industry other than maybe R&D positions, but those are purely technical/experimental and the only people that can actually get R&D jobs are engineers (never met a scientist in my life who got an R&D job in industry, though they all tried).\n\nPostdoctoral positions are very scarce especially in fields like physics/math. It will be almost impossible to find one after your PhD, most people wait 6-10 months before landing a job and it is usually overseas so they have to move all over the place and get paid really shit (Postdocs in the US for example only pay you like 40K a year, 50K tops which is a joke considering your qualifications). To qualify for a lecturer position you need to do 2 postdocs in general and have 10+ publications in high impact journals (some universities will require you to have 20+ though). To give you an example, I applied for postdocs for the past 8 months, couldn't land a single interview, so naturally I gave up because I don't want to move across the globe and get paid shit money for insane amounts of work. \n\nSo if you are concerned about job prospects, probably an engineering degree is the safest option. You can always do a PhD later (one of my engineering colleagues did a PhD in pure mathematics after his Bachelor's degree, he majored in electrical engineering and people were happy to let him do math).",

It is absolutely nothing like this in the US. Physics PhDs routinely get positions in finance, data science, biotech, consulting, semiconductor industry, tax prep companies... and are paid very well. Entry positions often get paid more than tenure track positions and can also be challenging intellectually. We had job fairs where companies come on campuses to recruit fresh phds, during postdoc we had university postdoc association organizing visits to industry. Many PhDs have programming / modeling skills that are easily transferable. Astrophysics and particle physics folks often come lots of big data or statistics knowledge which can be really good. Many companies will hire PhDs even to do customer support, if its a major company where you need a PhD level to understand a high tech instrument.\n\nBTW, postdoc salaries in the US are a little higher than you mentioned typically $50k-$60k/year, but how bad it is depends on the specific area. We can agree that they are very low regardless, even in places where postdocs have a union.",

I don't know what the situation is in the US or whether PhD graduates are treated like Gods, but here in Australia PhDs are worth absolutely nothing.

Second, learn what quantitative skills you're almost-comfortable with.  Whatever your major is, talk to your university's career development people about internships and such.",

I was in two of those searches, one in my school and one in my department, and the Dean made the final decision and ignored the committee's recommendation. The exact dame thing happened last February in a very highly ranked R1 in the west coast. I also know of other cases when a candidate that wasnt the strongest one received a job offer because they wouldn't \"rock\" departmental equilibrium (for lack of a better term). \n\nI mean it when I say the job won't always go for the strongest candidate, because sometimes the strongest candidate is not the best fit. Saddly, fit is not about how good you are, but about how the institution sees you against its current layout and future plans. Therefore, it's not always easy to assess as an applicant.",

It may mean that one will never be a Michael Jordan - not everyone can be one in any given field - and also mean may need to be of independent means to do so. I suppose it really is much like being an artist then, but with really expensive tuition fees involved.",

I'm definitely hanging on to this post for guidance since I'm trying to achieve a faculty position in a few years.\n\nOne thing I know is labour markets in general are very field and region dependent. Personally, I'm expanding my network as much as possible, and getting advice all the time on things I can do to give myself the best chance. That's one thing I can directly control. In addition to the others like pursuing publications, grants, etc.",

If things don\u2019t work out there are other avenues and the experience will not be wasted. You will certainly not make it unless you try.",

      "text": "We don't get 3000 applications. Take a look at the survey of earned doctorates published by the NSF to get an idea of the total numbers and the numbers from top 50 and top 20 universities in each field. I've been on committees that have hired \\~15 profs (all ranks) over the past 10 years at an R1 and we typically get between 200-400 apps for TT assistant prof calls. I've seen way too many CVs for being outside of HR but I have a bit of insight (at least from my field/university). \n\nOur process is very HR heavy so dept committee, dept approval, assoc dean, dean, university. When people are talking about schmoozing in this thread tread lightly; nobody has directly schmoozed their way in. Controlling the ownership of your own career by actively finding opportunities and networking constructively with scholars in your discipline is going to bring you a lot further than being drinking buddies (not saying you can't do both if you want though). You're probably better of schmoozing editors than one of the many cogs in the conservative university HR systems.",

      "text": "I am the most mediocre, subpar candidate for a physics PhD program. I barely made the requirement for grad school applications, did terrible in my intro classes and had a rough time throughout my degree. Before May I really thought I was going to take a gap year and figure out what to do with the rest of my life since grad school felt out of reach. I didn\u2019t even get to take the physics GRE or the regular GRE due to COVID. I\u2019m now attending UTA as a space physics PhD student through a scholarship program. I still doubt my ability to make it though this program tbh but the admissions team saw something in me that I still don\u2019t see and they wanted to take me. There is absolutely more than just raw intelligence and a stacked resume that makes a candidate.",

Turns out, I'm more passionate about astronomy and astrophysics so I'm gonna frikkin major in it anyway. Do what you love no matter what, even if I never find a job in my field at least I got to study my passion.",
