In that case, \"spray and pray\" is essentially the only strategy that can land you a job.",

But be open to letting fate have some influence as well. You want to be open to opportunities as they arise. The typical PhD ->postdoc->TT position at dream uni is only achievable by a very small percentage of folks. \n\nFaculty jobs are slim but there are a ton of postdocs right now, and government hiring is picking up too. After my PhD, I applied for a few postdocs and took the one in the best location for my family with the most opportunity for networking (academic, but affiliated with federal work). After my 2 year postdoc ran out I got a fellowship to stay in the same place (for better or for worse). \n\nThe job market sucks and is super competitive. I was kind of picky on where I applied for the last three years. I got bites but no offers. This year is the last of my fellowship and I\u2019ve worn out my stay at this uni. so I\u2019m applying to everything this round and letting luck take us where we end up.",

I also had a specific history of teaching experience that made me competitive for the position.\n\nMostly it was dumb luck. \n\nI would say that even if you're looking at positions that are not research intensive, the current job climate dictates that you need a history of scholarship.\n\nedit: I also have a very different approach when it comes to applying for jobs in academia. I don't yolo out 78 applications in a job cycle. I apply to 5-8 positions, ones that I know I'll be competitive with the search committee and that I'll be fairly certain I'd take if offered. That also means I spend significantly more time on the application. It works for me - I've had at least one offer every cycle I participated in.",

I kind of thought that was what you had to do in order to be a successful researcher so that is the route I went. I learned a lot during my postdoc, but eventually fell out of love with the idea of being a professor, and the funding situation was not looking great with <10% of R01s getting funded. If I had it to do over again, I'd still probably take the postdoc, but I would focus on projects that translated to drug discovery so I could have made an easier transition to industry. I did eventually make the jump to industry, but got tired of lab work so I switched to a R&D/ sales role with a device company. I could not be happier- I am doing great science and have a much better work/ life balance than I ever could have imagined when I was a postdoc.   \n\n\nMy advice is talk to people, ask questions, and figure out what sounds good to you.

There were a few jobs I would pass on applying for (e.g. Stanford and Princeton both had \u201copen calls\u201d for my entire discipline, I skipped those because I was unlikely to get those interviews and I was really busy). I took every interview I was offered, I would have accepted literally any job I was offered. But, my financial situation was going to be a horror show if I didn\u2019t find a job\u2026 to the tune of $135k of private student loans. I lucked out, I basically got my dream job, they let me defer a year to finish my post doc. \n\nI have another friend who has applied for 4 years straight now and has not gotten any offers and only been on a few interviews. This guy is an amazing scientist and teacher and has good pubs; I don\u2019t understand it. He was discerning about the jobs he applied to in the beginning of his job search, but at this point he would take basically anything. \n\nI have yet another friend who has applied for the past 2 years, has a really nice post doc right now, and has turned down job offers (one last year and one this year) for the past two years because she wants to contribute this post doc. She gives me anxiety. She turned down last years offer because she didn\u2019t want to live in that area and didn\u2019t want to work at an institution where they didn\u2019t have their own research facilities\u2026 Both of which she knew when she applied to those places, so Personally, I\u2019m not sure I would have applied for those jobs. That search essentially failed because she didn\u2019t take it; I understand her thoughts on it, but I have conflicting feeling about the whole situation. \n\nSo perhaps there is something there: make a list of priorities and only apply to places you could see yourself being satisfied at. But acknowledge that it\u2019s tough out there and you may not have the luxury of being choosy in the end.",

      "text": "Your #1 concern is obtaining a tenure-track position in your field.  \n  All else is secondary.  My advice is to forego buying a home, vehicle - accruing debt of any kind - until you are an Assistant Professor tenure- track working full-time at a university.\n  Research the market in your field.  \nOnce you obtain a tenure-track position be careful about purchasing homes and vehicles until tenure is granted. \n   If you do not obtain tenure it is much easier to move if you are renting a home.",
