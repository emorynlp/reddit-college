  "text": "Hi all! I\u2019m currently in grad school and almost finishing the program by next spring. In all honesty, I\u2019ve been so grateful for having a positive university experience overall. I meet amazing cohorts and professors in my field who are indeed supportive. We have a healthy campus climate that celebrates diversity and intersectionality. However, all of these from the outside seems to be great, but internally, I feel like I am out of place or don\u2019t belong \u201cintellectually\u201d. I struggle in speaking up in class but no issues with small groups. Higher education is highly competitive and I\u2019m working hard to complete all my requirements. How do you deal with Impostor Syndrome? Thank you, I look forward to your responses!",

Each of us is just a tiny blip in the whole scheme of things.\n\nFor me success (publishing, getting grants) is enough to nuke impostor syndrome for the most part. I am pretty clear headed about where I lie on the spectrum of things and the fact is  I'm better at certain things than the brightest minds in my field, even through they're smarter than me. We all have our place.",

              "text": "I\u2019ve realized since being out of grad school that a lot of people with phds have a niche where they\u2019re really good at one very specific thing but struggle to apply knowledge more broadly. And in exceptionally troubling cases, they never learned to think critically at all and just float along with their degree as a raft. No one knows everything. Most people don\u2019t know much. A desire to learn, read, absorb concepts, and think critically is more important than anything else, long term.\n\nEdit for additional comment: doing well in class has nothing to do with one\u2019s ability to succeed in the real world. Memorization and ability to be polished is meaningless without the ability to put information into context",

I could speak in class because I read constantly throughout my studies and would just talk about my notes on the thesis being discussed. Most people didn\u2019t really do this so they often found themselves unable to speak, I.e prepared. There\u2019s no mystery here. Anybody can and does indeed paraphrase authors readings. Sometimes people just have stronger interpretations than others. I think this is mostly todo with preparation more than anything. I knew of students woul wouldn\u2019t read or take notes and then expect to be able to contribute on a deeper level, is this not just simply a underprepared student and not in fact an imposter?",

There are a lot of hurdles to jump but I know I have grown so much personally and professionally. I also came across this post a few days ago and it really resonated with me, so thank you to whoever shared this:\n\n\u201cA no-fail environment does not mean success.

          "text": "This is a great answer. As a college psychology instructor, father, and therapist, I can say it is often the case that people cannot see the forest through the trees. Other's very often have a much clearer view of your strengths and weaknesses than you do. If everyone around you believes you are a high achiever, try to listen to them.\n\nHere's a little tidbit of information you may not have had, feeling like an impostor or as though you are faking it, typically only happens to to high achievers who are too hard on themselves. \n\nThey often think if they were smart, they would know all the answers, they feel like success is tainted if they needed any help, have trouble accepting any praise, or that they must do everything perfect or it doesn't count.\n\nIt is hard to understand or accept that your brain very often lies to you, but it does. It's easier to see it in others. Have you ever thought, \"who are they kidding? or \"who do they think they're fooling?\" About a friend or coworker who believes something untrue?\n\nStop thinking the little voice in your head is always right. Especially if it's a nasty little critic of your successes. Learn to quiet your inner critic, and talk to yourself in a more positive way. If you are going to believe the little voice, make sure what it's saying is more supportive.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t. It\u2019s human to feel like this, and you\u2019ll (probably) always be human.\n\nThere are ways to mitigate the feeling, though. I, for example, keep a folder in my email inbox where I save emails from *other* people that provide positive feedback about specific actions I did. The actions can be tiny, like \u201cchatting with you yesterday really helped, thanks!\u201d or larger, like copies of specific evaluations. When I\u2019m feeling impostor-y, by definition what I say to myself doesn\u2019t help (because I feel like an impostor). However, having these tangible words from others available helps. It doesn\u2019t get rid of it right away, but I believe it helps me \u201cshake off\u201d that feeling faster. \n\nThat said, I think part of me always has that feeling, but there are certain times where I\u2019m more fixated on it than others. That\u2019s okay. When the fixation is bad enough that I cannot get things done, that\u2019s when I pull up that email inbox, then try to disconnect from whatever is causing me that feeling, long enough to start thinking about something else so the fixation isn\u2019t strong enough to be detrimental to my work. \n\nHopefully this makes sense! Happy to chat about this more. This is, ironically, one of my favorite topics to discuss. I\u2019ve hosted a few discussions on it.",

      "text": "What worked for me was attending a university-sponsored session on impostor syndrome. Not because of anything the speaker said\u2014I can\u2019t remember any of that\u2014but because I looked around the room and saw 299 other people who also had imposter syndrome.\n\nThere were two other sessions that day, also booked solid. So, I did the math and quickly realized that 900 people, myself included, at this institution alone, on this particular day, felt horrendously inadequate most of the time. And that was only the ones who could admit it.\n\nYeah. It was just the feeling of looking around at a huge lecture hall full of people, all of them willing to say, as one, with absolute certainty, \u201cI DON\u2019T BELONG HERE!\u201d",

I learned how fucking insecure some of them were. And that's when I realized--basically everyone who isn't a neurotypical white male is faking it. This helped a LOT.",

Also faking it.\n\nThe way I feel about it is that as soon as I quit faking it is when I have quit pushing for growth.\n\nEmbrace the insecurity a little. Look back on when you were both insecure and successful. You lessen imposter syndrome with repetition and time, but you stay there too long and you get stuck in your comfortable rut.\n\nI think Grad students and professors are always susceptible to this because there is no option for repetition as all research and publication needs to be original work and you are putting your new thoughts out there for the world to judge which is a very vulnerable position.",

      "text": "There are many idiots in academia as there are everywhere else. One of the ways to get over imposter syndrome is to stop thinking about yourself so much. Observe other people: the ones who talk about nothing and don't stop. The one note people who say one smart thing early and just repeat it for the next four years. The ones who read a lot and then just spit out that stuff as though it is their own - like their brain is a copy and paste. \n\nAs for the ones who have original thoughts - and there are fewer of those than you think - admire their brilliance and listen and learn from them. Don't worry about what they think of you. Don't even think about yourself. You aren't there to complete. You are there to learn. So learn.",
