  "text": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all, I am sorry if I should not be posting this here.\n\nI am trying to publish an article in the medical field.\n\nI browsed through the Scopus list of indexed journals and found one that seemed to suit our article. The website seemed a bit sketchy, very basic but with no ads or pop-ups, the front page presented the most recently published articles and it did not try to aggresively encourage publications; one had to actively search the author's instructions. The initial presentation genuinely seemed more focused on the actual content than to \"capture\" authors.\n\nI went through some articles and they seemed legit. I even found 2 articles whose authors I know, one of which is even a national expert in the field, with lots of publications.\nThe journal is also the official journal of some national societies of the medical specialty, which I confirmed in one of the society's website.\n\nThe submission was through manuscript submission via e-mail (not an institutional one), but I researched the editors and every seemed ok.\n\nI submited the article but months passed by without any response. I sent another e-mail months later after the first submission asking if there was any problem and they aswered me the following day saying that they did not receive the article and asking to submit again, which I did.\n\n48 hours later, I received and e-mail saying the article was accepted. Zero revisions needed, which I found a bit odd. \n\nThe e-mail also stated that there was a publication fee of several hundred dollars. **This was not stated in the authors instructions!** \n\nThey said they would send me an invoice if I agreed with the terms and conditions and that they are planning to publish in a specific month next year.\n\nThe journal is not in the list of known predatory journals, it is indexed on Scopus and it is the official journal of national societies. It seemed legitimate at first but this got me worried. \n\nIs this a predatory journal?\nThank you!",

          "text": "Thank you for the insight!\n\nTo be honest, the paper was first rejected in an already small (but legit) journal, so we tried to lower the bar a bit. Unfortunately I lowered it a bit too much, it seems.\n\nI am also worried because, at submission, we had to sign a \"copyright transfer\" in the case the journal was published; it did not bother me at the time because I had already seen that in other journals; in retrospect I feel like it was a very stupid decision. I fear they will stop me from withdrawing based on that; i don't think they have the legal grounds for that though (it doesn't even state the paper's title...)",
