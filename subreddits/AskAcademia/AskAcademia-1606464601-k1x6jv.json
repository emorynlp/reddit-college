  "title:": "Anxious, depressed and wondering if leaving academia might be the right choice?",
  "text": "I'm a researcher based in AU, interdisciplinary across sociology, public health and cultural studies. I'm 5 years post PhD and currently in a research only position at a second tier university.  I've done okay, I have a decent track record in publications (30+ JA, 1 book, etc) and grants ($1mill+) and do a lot of internal and external service, as well as some teaching. I'm currently on a major ECR fellowship. I probably work too much, 60+ hours a week the first few years post-PhD, but have since tried to slow down and ensure I take time out. \n\nDespite this, I've been battling increasing states of anxiety, depression, and chronic health issues which seem to get worse the more I engage in academia. I'm finally getting one chronic illness sorted which I was hoping would help me get back on track, and then was hit with another, lifelong progressive disease that I'll be managing for the rest of my life. It almost feels like I'm trading pieces of my health for the next publication or grant. Alongside this, I feel as though my research is absolutely worthless and I shouldn't even be bothering. I stare at my screen and think \"why are you doing this, no one gives a sh*t about your work. It's not worth anything.\" \n\nI can't focus on my project, and I feel incredibly isolated and alone in my department which I have tried to address and gotten nowhere. I'm not sure if this is COVID related being stuck at home for more than 8 months, but the vibes and energy I used to get about my work are completely gone, and my research feels pointless. There's a part of me that keeps wondering about leaving and doing something completely different, even though now is the worst time to try and transition careers and I'm incredibly lucky to have a job, especially a research one. \n\nHas anyone else currently in academia felt this way? Did you take the leap and leave? Was it a passing feeling that got better over time and if so, do you have any strategies for managing these crappy feelings and wanting to throw the towel in when it feels like your research etc doesn't matter?",

But I do feel that much of it is due to the extraordinary situation of being quarantined, limited interactions of the online environment and the current state of affairs both inside and outside academia trying to change with the times with major political tensions resulting in very few successes.\n\nIn order to keep my sanity I tell myself that it\u2019s imperative not to get immersed in the day-to-day madness and to see the big picture that is the extraordinary situation we are in. Otherwise I end up blaming myself, which I do constantly, so I try to fight back by telling myself that it\u2019s OK to feel sad, lazy, hurt and anxious because this is definitely not an environment that allows people to function normally. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful at all but it\u2019s how I try to cope these days.",

      "text": "Absolutely know what you are feeling, I have been having a similar situation since one and a half year. It started after a major publication that took everything out of me and left me empty of curiosity and pleasure for my work. It got progressively worse with time (peaked after 6months). At that time I I was in therapy and doing mindfulness training with my heavy work load(got an ERC as well... meant nothing). Nothing worked, I decided to focus on myself and my loved ones, full time. It affected my work and my progress but I don\u2019t regret it now. I found out that my work had lost meaning and no matter what I did or how well I did, nothing was enough and would never be. I had to find meaning again. Now I am progressing well, working full time again, but with meaning and curiosity. By the way, cutting out toxic people who bring you down is one of the keys to build you up. Having people on the same line and happily doing science is a reminder why I started doing science, why it is fun and that this my dream job",

Teaching (even in person) also made me incredibly tired and mostly just sad. One day in July I realised I was crying when thinking about giving lectures in autumn. I was working with people, sure, but only in theory - because most of my colleagues were competing with me for journal space and grants. I missed teamwork from my days in industry. It took a long time and Covid was surely of no help, but I recently got an industry job. \n\nToo early to say whether it will work out for the best, but I feel like a change, whether temporary or long-term might be good. Now, this might not be the solution for you, but I just wanted to stress that you're not alone!",

      "text": "I've heard this a lot during CoVID and I think it's absolutely understandable since we all are a lot more isolated. My PI also recently asked my if I have any idea how to foster more interaction between lab members as he has the feeling we are a lot less \"close knit\" than before since most people sit at home \"doing their thing\" and less discussions take place. There's also a lot of stuff happening in the world that argubly is a lot bigger than most of our research is, although that was always the case, it's just a bit more obvious now. \n\nCoVID was also giving me the last push to leaving. Overall it was a combination of realizing that I'll have to wait about 15 more years for tenure (so no job security until then), seeing friends struggling for funding year after year and a general drive to not move hours and hours away from my family (and friends) plus seeing a pretty much perfect job opportunity (thanks to my big bro!) in industry.  \nI'll switch to industry in January, going from studying grasp movements in monkeys to being a Software Tester at a prothesis manufacturing company. It's a permanent position (with option to climb the career latter) two hours away from my family, 30km from where my husband found a job.  \nAnd you shouldn't forget: You can always return to academia, especially if you only take a year or two off.",

      "text": "These ups and downs are very common in academic work - and in other self-directed, creative pursuits (authors, artists etc). The key difference with industry in our case is that you don\u2019t carry the weight of whether the work is \u201cworth it\u201d (whatever that means). It is natural to second-guess yourself, and to fall into the trap of familiarity breeding contempt. After several years of constant exposure, it\u2019s inevitable that the ideas you were excited about seem mundane. \n\nThe way I have coped with this is to periodically review my ideas and projects and ask myself if this is the most impactful and interesting thing I can work on. The time and place for all things pass: are the things I started several years ago still relevant? If not, how can I close them out and work on something more interesting? Am I just going \u201cthe grass is greener there\u201d and becoming a dilettante?\n\nIt hard to evaluate this yourself sometimes, and from what you write you might not be in the best emotional place to do so. Find a trusted colleague (anywhere) with whom to do a thorough review: explain your current projects, where you see them going, what you ultimately hope to achieve and how you will get there. Make new plans. Work on important things. \n\nIt also sounds like you are having some mental health challenges. These are real: deal with them. Take a break, get your life priorities straight, listen to your therapist (or change them if it\u2019s not working for you).",

      "text": "I hear you and I feel for you. I think you've been doing amazing! \n\nBefore you decide to give up on academia, which is something you've spent quite a lot of time to get into and are obviously good at, please eliminate the following causes as other comments have also highlighted;\n\n* toxic work environment (seeing as you feel isolated)\n* type of work you've been doing (i.e. are you writing for fellow scientist/social relevance questions)\n* is it COVID related? (these are strange times). \n\n I had a TT job right out of my PhD in the social sciences, got it actually before the ceremony finished too. Did well for two years (4+ publications p.a. in Q1, 6 courses, supervising 3 PhDs, 1.5 mil in grants both local and EU).  Unfortunately, I was in a very toxic environment with senior colleagues who saw my achievements as threats. What followed was a year of verbal and physical abuse in person and over emails and calls. Add to that attempts to sabotage my career, including stealing data from my computer to asking students to torpedo my evals. I was declared sick by my company doctor and confidential advisors. Major depression, chronic illness as a result of untenable stress from the personal attacks. I had the same thoughts of is it worth it and I should just go back to industry where I was before. Not saying you had the same, but I recall exactly the same experience of feeling isolated and being drained by the environment I was in. I had no one I dared to voice my issues to. I had no one I could discuss content with, also for fear of retaliation or worse, getting ideas stolen again. I still like what I did, but I liked it less every day and I wondered if it was worth all the mental and physical harm. My saving grace was that I had already built up a robust and warm international network of peers and colleagues. I realised after a conference that that was exactly what I lacked - intellectual support and community. \n\nI was invited (luckily) to be a visiting prof elsewhere. Shortly after that, a tenured position there opened up and I was invited to apply and got it. After a devastating year, chronic exhaustion and developing chronic asthma, I quit. I still remember the shitstorm that came when I resigned. I can say I am very much more happy and content now that I have moved away from the shit show of a department. \n\nThe only positive things out of my bad experience is that I made some agreements with myself which I hope you might consider:\n\n* I'll only work with people I know and trust...and those they know and trust. Seems unfair but really, life is too short to get backstabbed constantly. \n* I will build and maintain an intellectual community and nurture those who enter. Jobs might last a few years, but collaboration can last a lifetime!\n* I will only work on research that satisfies my intellectual curiosity and is not harmful to society. If I'm going to be expending energy on something, I better like it intrinsically.\n* I have a duty to pay my lessons forward. I mentor young academics who run into the same issues. Unfortunately, we are not alone. The more people talk about this, the better.\n* I derive great joy from teaching and will continue to do so but I will not do service disproportionately to my peers. \n* I am more than my job. Socialising, hobbies, keeping strict boundaries between work and life are not essential. They are crucial parts of your career. \n\nTL;DR: It does get better...and maybe it's not you.",

But I\u2019d ask you to consider, maybe write a reflection journal, on whether it is the field you\u2019re in that causes you these feelings or if you are getting the right support for your mental health.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t getting the right support for your mental health, then this will cause a ripple effect on your commitments and cause it to feel more challenging. Do you go to therapy? What ways are you looking after your mental health?\n\nI\u2019m not sure where you are based, but in the U.K. mental health disorders can be considered as a disability under the Equality Act 2010, if it is long-term and affects you on a daily basis. This means that you are legally entitled to ask for additional support at work, school, etc.\n\nIf you do think that it is your mental health that you need help with and it\u2019s not necessarily your phd, asking for more support might help you get to your goal without sacrificing your mental health. Your previous hours of working per week would make anyone struggle, it\u2019s just not sustainable.\n\nIf you think that the field you are working in is making you unhappy and you would like to go elsewhere, then by all means, go for it because life is too short to stay somewhere that makes you unhappy.\n\nEdit: just like what the other people have said, we are in a pandemic!

It might be current circumstances, it might be false association (are you really trading health for work, or do they just correlate?), but it might really be that you sincerely do not feel your work matters. Some questions, then, are why doesn't it matter? Can it matter? What does matter? It might be the case that you can take a turn and research something that does matter. Or, alternatively, maybe what you think matters is just not a candidate for you to research.  \n  \nAnother question is the kind of mattering. I'd like to propose inherent vs. Instrumental value. In this case, the question is, even if the research doesn't matter in itself, what does it do for you and for your life?  \n  \nLeaving Academia can be hard, and people need to be brave to do it. It's the right choice for some people. But I think asking about what matters to you and in what ways is a good place to start.  \n  \nAnd to answer your question: I often feel this way. A turn in my research might work, but maybe I just need to get out and do something practical with my interests (in my case, mental health advocacy and support seems appropriate).",

      "text": "Based on your grants and publication record, it sounds like others don\u2019t view your research as useless, so I think you can safely rule that out. You sound exhausted and totally burnt out. Academia can offer some flexibility in your schedule compared to other professions, but otherwise I\u2019ve found it to be a very tough place to manage chronic illnesses. They can be made to feel like personal flaws more than health problems or disabilities that can be accommodated. I\u2019ve dealt with that personally and I know how frustrating it can be. You *should* be able to comfortably do your work irrespective of your new diagnosis. And I promise that stress makes everything feel worse. \n\nIf you\u2019re not already, please reach out to medical professionals to tackle your anxiety head on. Treat it exactly like your other health issues, because it is. Chronic stress and anxiety is like trying to work with your arm pinned behind your back, except nobody can see it. \n\nIt may be that you will feel more fulfilled and more comfortable working in industry. However, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to walk through this decision with a therapist or counselor. They\u2019re there to check in on how we\u2019re processing situations and to help guide us through difficult things. Having that guidance can help you feel more secure in whatever choice you make. \n\nIf you do decide to switch to a different job, remember that it\u2019s just that: a new job. I think as academics we can sometimes wrap our identity up into what we do. It\u2019s part of the passion we bring to our jobs. And that be a good thing, but it can also make changes feel like failures when they\u2019re not. I\u2019ve largely left academia at this point but still work on my research with various collaborators, and it took me awhile to catch onto that.",

Being able to disconnect from work feels great, although switching from the long working hours and tight deadlines has definitely been a process. It took a while to stop thinking, *But are you absolutely sure I shouldn\u2019t be working?*\n\nWhichever way you go, please be kind to yourself.

Absolutely do not miss academia (ok, I had interesting fieldwork and made great friends...but the friends all moved to different corners of the world, so it's not like I could catch up with them on the weekend pre-COVID anyway).\n\nOf course, there are some things I would not appreciate now had I not had the experience in academia (I love that when I have holidays and visit my family I don't have to answer work emails in between, or work on some proposal or manuscript while in the airport...had I not had the academia experience I might romaticise the idea and take my current work for granted). \n\nI am so glad I got out when I did (mid-thirties), as I think switching careers is harder the older you get.\n\nWhen I left due to the circumstances of cuts (I was put in the redundancy pool), I decided to treat it as if it was something exciting and better, and definitely not like a failure or second choice, which was a good decision.

              "text": "A colleague two years older than me who went through the same redundancy round thing kept going as a post-doc reseacher (so she took a step back form her lecturing position, just to have a job in the field) and became stuck. She wanted to get out (at least that's what she kept on saying), but seemed to be afraid/didn't know how (I tried to help her, but she didn't take me up on my offer) and is now early 40s. Nothing wrong with that age at all, but employers will look at you different anyway (they'll have some biases about ex-academics anyway, that they are stubborn, might not be efficient) and the older you are, the more you need a good story for your career switch. \n\nAnyway, my advice would be to make a plan. Create a strategy. And with that I mean do your research on your options. What kind of jobs do the leavers form your field have, and what would be a good fit for you? What skills can you take and are there some things you can devellop know (your academic mentors won't know, so when they have advice about working outside of academia, you need to curate that carfully). Talk to people in the non-academic jobs you like (what do they like about it? What has surprised them? Do they employ many academic leavers and what to they like and dislike about working with them) Etc etc. People in the field you want to move to will have so much more valuable advice than people that are in academia (even the career services in universities can be a bt out of touch. As well a 'applied scientists'. In my current work we sometimes collaborate with a research group that prides itself for being very applied, while most of my colleagues adn myself think they are just very academic).\n\nOnce you know what kind of of organisation you want to work for, learn how they operate. What langague to they use, how do they get money for projects, etc. \n\nIf you feel like you've painted yourself into an academic corner, it's time to unpaint/Shawshank yourself out.  (When I spoke recently to said colleague she said I was lucky to have found my job, and while I am very gratefull it wasn't just luck that got me this job. It took research, soul searching and effort to reach out to people to learn about the charitable sector that got me this job. All applicants for my job were people with a PhD and some with postdocs, and I was the only one who stood out in my approach in the interview).",

Anxiety, depression, frustration. I enjoyed my education and research was, still is and will always remain my passion, but I feel like doing it with a deadline and requirements make us feel anxious. I was able to publish my master's research in a well-reputed journal and can easily get an admission in PhD on the basis of my CV, but my mind is not ready to start another strenuous journey of 4-5 years with constant hustle. Once you get the taste and thrill of getting your name on a paper, you become addicted and becoming a workaholic is not good for our health. This happens in my case. I put all my energies and focus on a task that if anything goes even slightly wrong, I become anxious and depressed. I lose the healthy balance and that's what scares me the most. Do you feel like this too?\n\nI think your research really matters as you mentioned that you have good number of publications. \n\nI would suggest that if you have spent 5+ years in your PhD, you should not get all your struggles go to drain no matter how hard it is for you right now.

      "text": "I totally relate to what you are experiencing. I believe it is an issue with setting priorities and boundaries stemming from a distorted perception of self-value in a highly competitive unsupportive work environment. As academics, I noticed we tend to prioritize our work over our mental health and this is probably because we place our value and identify on our achievements in academia. We also find it extremely hard to set boundaries for the same reason. What happens then is what happened with you, me and I am sure unfortunately many others, issues with mental health, chronic exhaustion and burn out especially when the work environment does not care about your mental health as much as getting work done and having their  reputation enhanced. As humans, our health and well-being should always be our main priority. However, it is unfortunate that academics never discuss that till they get these health issues and reflect then. Even if you hear stories, you never think it will happen to you. Some get them while doing their master, some while doing their phd and many others get them after, like you. But, it eventually happens. We have to raise awareness of this issue in our field and prevent it from happening to others.\n\nIt is great that you have access to therapy and working on your health. I think this is the most important step to take. Working on your identity, life purpose and value will bring a new life outlook. I do think that the current work environment is contributing to your health issues, but are not the main cause. The tendencies we have in the structure of our personalities can be taken advantage of in other work environments as well, probably not as much as academia does. Awareness here is key, as placing importance in health and what truly brings happiness to you in the field (ex. curiosity fulfillment) as well as finding your value in other aspects of your life should be what matter here. Also, it is important to learn how to set boundaries and when to say no and take a break when needed.\n\nYou are definitely not a failure. You are actually a success story. You have done more than most. Good luck in whatever you decide to do. Get in touch if you need company, I sure do (:",
