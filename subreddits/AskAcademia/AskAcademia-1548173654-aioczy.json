      "text": "Don't feel bad. Read this story and be thankful this wasn't you. \n\nI went to a tiny college for undergrad that was one city block wide. I got into graduate school at a HUGE state school. \n\nFirst day of graduate school, I DROVE to the \"FRONT\" of the school where all the old buildings are since that's what I used to do at my tiny school. It took me 30 minutes to find a parking spot. When I finally got a spot, I looked at the map and realized my class was in a building about 2 miles away, up a hill. \n\nI walked as fast as I could. 20 minutes later, I arrive at my first graduate level class dripping in sweat, and out of breath. There are 21 students seated in a tiny classroom with 22 seats, one for every student already there and one for the professor. There are no more seats left and almost no where to stand, the room is so small. The professor is talking about 2000 miles an hour, he briefly looks at me as I walk in, doesn't acknowledge me but keeps talking.  \n\nAs I have no where to sit, and almost no where to stand, I just stand awkwardly at the door for a few minutes. Then I try to kinda shuffle in behind the seated people, and accidentally kick a gorgeous woman in the foot and almost pull another guy's computer off the table by tripping on the cord. \n\nI go to take a notebook out to take notes, but I realize I forgot my writing materials in the car. I have to ask one of the other students for a paper and pen. A guy gives me some materials, but I have nothing to write on, so I have to take notes up against the wall. \n\nWith my arms up writing on the all, I can spell the horrible stench of my own body odor from walking up a hill at full speed for 2 miles. I can see other people smell me too, people are trying to scoot away from me a bit. \n\nThis went on for about 15 minutes of horrible awkwardness, people are just looking at me and trying to ignore me and my stench.  The professor won't even make eye contact with me. \n\nThen finally the professor lets up, says, let's take a break, and another student a woman went and got me a chair from another classroom. I got myself in order, went to the restroom and punched the stall in anger in frustration with all my might. \n\nI broke my fist, and I had to go to the hospital that night, but goddam it I made it through the second half of class. \n\n",

I tried it in therapy I was like \u201cthis is a load of shit\u201d but it does seem to help. Maybe give it a try? \n\nI had to do it recently when a visiting scholar I know started sitting in on the class I\u2019m teaching. She had subbed for a class I took like 3 years ago when the professor was in the hospital. They were close and she was upset and I gave her the most awkward hug. So she shows up to sit in my class and I\u2019m like \u201ctime to put that shit in the box\u201d. So I did, then I went to talk to her. She\u2019s like \u201cwhere do I know you from\u201d Hahahaha so she probably doesn\u2019t even remember. \n\nHang in there!",

Unable to speak as the cluster  and pain started, I just started screaming....in the middle of math class...passed out for a second, and woke up sobbing hysterically from the pain. \n\nThey cleared everyone out of the room and the principal, vice principal, nurse and like 5 other teachers came minutes later thinking I had a seizure or something. Made me lay on the ground. Put me in a wheelchair and threatening to call an ambulance. I was very very tired but insistent they just call my parents. \n\nSome students thought I was doing it for attention or to get out of class. The teacher kept an eye on me at all times for the duration of the class afterwards. It was very embarrassing and I just wanted to curl up and die, dreafed going to school. Maybe not the funny embarrassing you were hoping for, but please don't let your emotions get you down. These things happen.",

So I was in a lecture style class this year, but for some reason, just for the first class, they booked this conference style room. The table took up 80% of the room, and there are not enough seats for all of the students. They have to go out and borrow chairs. It was hot when the class began. I was sweating from rushing to be on time. As more and more people came in, the room became even hotter, and the prof said there was no way to control the temperature. I began feeling like I was having trouble breathing. Claustrophobia is not usually an issue for me, but this was just so crammed and hot and miserable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then the lecturer says \"This room is great isn't it. So intimate.\" and the professor replies \"Yes, it is, I hope we'll be able to use it for the rest of class.\" WHOOOMPF panic attack. I attempt to extricate myself from the room, stumbling over people and backpacks, trying to get to the bathroom before the hyperventilating turns into sobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the bathroom was pretty close to the classroom, and they must have heard me. Now, I'm used to engineering classes, where the prof is pretty much always a dude. Alas, in this class, it's a woman, and she followed me into the bathroom to make sure I was ok. This was very nice of her, but it was NOT what I wanted for my first impression with this professor. I wanted to put myself back together. It was also a new trigger for a panic attack so I'm all \"what the hell just happened.\" eventually I got myself back together (and cooled down in an air conditioned part of the building) and went back for the last bit of lecture. But yeah. Whole class heard, prof saw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood news, they did not use that classroom again except for one or two more, and the professor always emailed me that I could skip if I needed to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo bring it full circle, the end of the year project was to write a research proposal, and only one of the options was about device design (the rest were like molecules and genetic treatments, and I'm not as comfortable). But the device? Needed to address a medical issue (clots)  that I have PTSD related to. I thought I could do it. I study a medical issue related to the whole PTSD medical incident. But man, I could not keep reading about anticoagulants without melting down. Kept re-experiencing memories of the anticoagulant injection pain I had gone through. I had to get an extenstion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarted the semester with panic. Ended with PTSD meltdown. Still got an A \\*punches air\\*",

Basically everything I did during this time was embarrassing. If you don't know much about it when one is in a manic state they often feel grandiose and sometimes even like they are part of a conspiracy or having a spiritual awaking. \n\nAnyway what's relevant here is that before my final paper was due in one of my classes, I asked to speak to my professor after class and I started crying and said I DON'T THINK I CAN WRITE MY FINAL PAPER BECAUSE I THINK IM JESUS. (Btw I seriously did think I was reincarnated Jesus). Just thinking about it makes me mortified. He was so nice though, he said even if you are Buddha I know you can write it, but I'll give you an incomplete if you want. (I think he said Buddha because I had big gauges and was dressing like a hippie back then so was sort of appeasing me in a nice way).\n\nI think you're good compared to that lol. It's clear this stuff happens fairly often because he said that without skipping a beat and without any kind of judgement on his face. My dad is also a professor and has said this kind of thing happens more often than you think. ",

I was eager and confident, and excited to work alongside esteemed scientists and colleagues.  It was a bustling lab full of  students I knew from my undergraduate classes, post docs, and multiple high profile PIs. I was chipper, aiming to make good first impressions. I started setting up my lab bench, cleaning everything, weighing reagents etc...A girl I vaguely knew from my major said she loved my khaki shorts. I beemed and said \"thanks!\".\n\nWhen I went to the restroom I was horrified to find out that there was blood ALL OVER  the back of my shorts. I had started my period earlier than I expected and didn't notice until nearly the end of the day. Wearing light, tight, khaki shorts, the blood stains were obvious. Everyone saw it. I was mortified and I went straight home, changed and came back and tried to push that out of my mind with work.\n\nI worked there for a year and my colleagues were kind and respectful to me. No one ever brought it up.\n\nP.S. I also have panic attacks and can totally understand how mortifying those can be. #Solidarity",

I was also a total combative ass in small group discussions.  The small group included the program director of my funding mechanism, so I told him with very few filters all of the petty problems and frustrations I had of the program.

      "text": "I was an undergrad in a 200-person lecture hall. One day the prof kicked out a kid in the row behind me for wearing headphones while he was lecturing. The rows were super close together for some reason and he had to go behind me to get out. My hair was in a bun, and a zipper on his backpack got caught on my hair because of how close he had to walk behind me to get out. And it WOULD NOT COME OUT. Instead of continuing the lecture, the professor just watched and awkwardly commented while the kind souls behind me tried to get the zipper out for seven (I am not joking, SEVEN) minutes. I was soooo red at the end of it and people in the surrounding seats called me Hair Girl for the rest of the semester. Now I\u2019m a grad student in the same department and I asked him last year if he remembered that and he cracked up and said yes \ud83d\ude05\n\nThese days I try to get things out in front whenever possible. Going through a bad breakup with my partner of four years right now and told my advisor. He has been more than understanding and has taken some pressure off me this week, so I have actually managed to not cry in front of him (...yet). These things happen, academia is a high-pressure environment! ",

      "text": "I\u2019ve had MANY of these moments and I still think about them to this day and want to crawl into my own asshole.\n\nOnce during my masters degree, I had to give a very small presentation on my literature review in front of my research team and a bunch of big shot doctors who I absolutely hated. The moment it was my turn to speak, I had a miniature panic attack and completely froze. I couldn\u2019t talk and I just kept saying \u201cum\u201d and \u201cuh\u201d. I had to laugh it off and say I was nervous in front of everyone but literally no one cracked a smile. The room was ice cold. My mentor took over for the presentation. \n\nAnother time, in undergrad, I was an assistant to my professor in one of her classes. At first, I was doing great and for some reason, my work ethic started to go down the drain. I missed maybe two classes out of the semester but didn\u2019t inform the professor I wasn\u2019t coming in and I was skipping office hours - usually because I kept waking up late. On the last day, the professor told me pick up the finals from the secretary and give the test to the students. Naturally, I woke up and the secretary had already shown up to the classroom and handed it out. I got dirty looks from the students and the secretary. Later the day I had a research meeting to attend and I quickly stopped by the professors office to give her the students finals and as I was saying \u201chi, I\u2019m here to drop these off but I have to go\u201d she yelled and told me to get in her office. I got chewed out by her pretty badly and my only response was to cry about my life problems (I had recently gotten kicked out of my home, relocated, and financial difficulties along with trying to do well in my classes). She was not interested in any of it and I lost a recommendation. It was awful.\n\nOverall, these things will continue to happen because us students are almost always spread to thin and have a lot going on. The good news is that literally no one will ever think back on those moments except for you. Just learn from them and plan for what to do if it happens again. Let me know when you a plan bc I need one ASAP hah",

      "text": "In my first year of undergrad I was in a 150 student chemistry lecture with a teacher that despised slouching. (Fuck him, right?) One day he called me out in front of class saying \u201chey blonde girl, sit up straight or get out of my class\u201d. I just ignored him as he continued to call me out and walk to my row and yelled at me for being downright disrespectful asked my neighbor for my name because I continued to ignore him (I know, I made things worse for myself. I get it. I\u2019m an ass. But seriously fuck him.) Anyway, calling me out by my full name he told me to meet him after class or I would fail. I met with him after class and he gave me this long ass lecture about how I\u2019m a disrespectful student and he wouldn\u2019t stand to have that in his class and if he ever caught me slouching again to just not show up because I would fail. Then he told me I needed to meet with him during office hours to go over what respect meant. \n\nPissed off, scared, and beyond furious that this even was a conversation, I went to his office hours told him that I would not actually enter his office as I believe this was fully unethical and that I would be going to the dean of science to which he laughed and responded \u201cgood luck\u201d.\n\nThe dean was on vacation that week and I ended up breaking down to his secretary as I tried to make a future appointment to see him at a later date. She was a wonderful lady who made me some tea, wrote down a summary of what happened and said she would call me as soon as she could schedule a time. \n\nThe next week I got a call with a scheduled time to meet with the dean. He asked me to explain what happened and patiently listened to me as I cried and was all red in the face and going through a whole wave of emotions. \n\nHe told me that while he almost always sides with the teacher as he knows them and typically takes their word over the students he had already asked he teacher to come in and recount his side of the story. The teacher in question apparently showed up to the meeting with the dean, walked in told him to \u201cgo fuck himself\u201d and handed him his resignation letter. \n\nThe teacher was contracted through the semester (we were about midway through) and was not able to be replaced so was required to continue to work through his contract. The dean said I could continue the next semester with another teacher if I didn\u2019t feel comfortable. But stubborn ole me told him I\u2019d be fine and continued to go to the class. But you bet your ass I went and slouched my ass off for the rest of the semester.  \n",

      "text": "I\u2019m replying to this late, but I wanted to share my story. I was taking night classes at my local community college downtown. Since it was in the city, there was no parking and I had to park on a very busy street out front - it was city property. They\u2019d tow you after a few hours, but I thought I would be fine since it was evening. Well, one fateful winter evening after class I walk out to get my car and go home. Only it wasn\u2019t there! Fuck, I thought, I\u2019ve been towed. I was really upset, couldn\u2019t afford this happening, called my boyfriend in panic to have him come get me. I went to security to seek out the lone policeman to see if he had any info on where my car even could\u2019ve been. When your car is towed how do you know where it\u2019s been taken? He says that it would\u2019ve been done by the city and he didn\u2019t know why it would\u2019ve happened considering it was evening, etc. he graciously walks me out to wait for my boyfriend so I wouldn\u2019t be alone downtown at night - waiting in the cold and dark. We walk out and what do I see? My fucking car. It was parked a bit further down than where I remembered :( ",
