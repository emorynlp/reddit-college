  "text": "Hey guys, \n\nI've been writing literature reviews for three years now at university, but it's not up to the level I want. I was wondering if anyone had any tips that you don't usually get told on how to make your literature review really good? I know the basic structure it should be but I need to make it about 3000 words as it's for my dissertation which is about video gaming.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "The best advice I got in undergrad to elevate the lit review is to generalize the prevailing ideas and use prominent witters as stand-ins so it is easier to speak to those \"factions,\" to use a fairly representative sampling including those who support and oppose the argument you are presenting, but to save one \"ally\" out of the lit review section to introduce later in your argument. Very effective technique, it makes for a more accessible and interesting read. My thesis prof definitely advocated for an aggressively argumentative approach to thesis writing, and suggested that you emphasize the largest opposing faction to your argument well in your lit review to clearly refer to later in the paper. You aren't trying to simply describe everything that head been said about your topic, but to make those ideas navigable for the reader and to identify those wise thinkers who are \"for\" your argument and the deluded fools \"against\" your argument. Hope this helps.",

              "text": "When you do your lit review, you will gather the prevailing ideas and then categorize them by a representative writer.  You got that much.  Have a mix of supporting and opposing \"factions\" but pick one writer, preferably someone \"important\" whose ideas/writing supports yours, and don't mention that person in the lit review.  Later on, after you have made your argument, pull out this authority on the subject who just so happens to support everything you said.  Very effective.  This \"ally\" does not even need to be in your particular field.  The best theses bring a secondary perspective, as you know, and that ally can be a famous authority from the secondary field whose works support your perspective. \nFor example, let's say your thesis is on how video games promote laissez-faire capitalism through random loot drops and rewards for beating bosses at the end of each level.  Your argument is that this is a false economy because there is a limited number of items/coins/ammo per mob and that despite the seeming randomness, reward is fairly fixed and that the idea of laissez-faire is actually false and teaches players to accept the apparent benevolence of oligarchs who, with their promises of \"some\" reward for labor, actually offer very little.  Your lit review will cite Dr. A whose published articles represent the many writers who argue that in-game economy is an unrealistic model, Dr. B whose book represents writers who claim that gamers recognize no connection between games and real life, and the goddamned fool (you will imply) Dr. C who has written time and again and who has gained a loyal following of people who believe that video game loot drops teach a positive perspective to children who learn that even though grinding for hours for XP or loot feels mindless and unrewarding, this is a great way to teach them that the unrelenting cycle of unsatisfying drudgery, spending, and entertainment prepares them to be productive members of society.  You argue that Dr. C is an idiot and that the American economy is not laissez-faire but oligarchal, that the apparent economy of video games is \"fixed\" to diminish the ratio of reward for labor to increase \"playtime\" hours which is used to market the game as a superior product compared to \"shorter\" games, and that the only lesson is that game designers see gamers' time as a valueless commodity.  Oh, and incidentally, the very famous and well-respected economist Dr. D happened to write about the American vs world economies and clearly shows that the idea that labor is undervalued and reward is capped to promote increased labor with the illusion of greater potential reward is destructive, racist, and increases social inequity, a;; while claiming to be beneficial laissez-faire capitalism.  You conclude by denouncing Dr. C and calling for game designers to take a proactive approach to in-game economies by increasing the value of labor, particularly skilled labor, thereby encouraging gamers to practice skills which will in fact benefit society.\nMake sense?",
