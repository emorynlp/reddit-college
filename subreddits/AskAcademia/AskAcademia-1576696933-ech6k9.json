  "title:": "Grad student wants to switch advisors b/c his advisor was mocking his religious beliefs. Suggestions as to what I should do?",
  "text": "I'm a philosophy professor and the interim director of graduate studies at my university.\n\nA second year graduate student working with one of our older faculty members wrote me an email asking if he could switch advisors, and explained that his current advisor was making rather inappropriate remarks about his religious views.  We emailed back and forth to discuss it a bit, and decided we would meet in my office at the beginning of next semester.  The student is an Orthodox Jew, and his work has nothing to do with religion.\n\nThe faculty member in question is in his 70s, a secular Jew, quite well-known in his field, and is known for being something of a curmudgeon.  He's also more senior than I am. The examples I was given were things like:\n\n> Professor: You know, I try not to judge people for their religious views, but tell me, do you avoid *shatnez*? [apparently a mixture of wool and linen fabrics that Orthodox Jews do not wear]\n\n> Student: Yes...\n\n> Professor:  Good gravy you're nuts.\n\nRelevant portion of an email exchange I was forwarded:\n\n> Student: \"I think [Author X's] view is defensible in theory, but I don't you can advocate it in light of the data given by [Author Y].  It just looks like it's theoretically possible, but empirically false.\"\n\n> Professor [quoting the last sentence]: \"I don't know if I agree; the interpretation of [Author Y's] results could also be indicative of [alternative interpretation].  This might just be a question of interpretation rather than a matter of empirical fact (unlike, say, evolution, the age of the Earth, or the existence of God).\"\n\nanother email exchange:\n\n> Student: [informing advisor of the dates he would be be unavailable due to various Jewish holidays]\n\n> Professor: \"Have fun! Keep me in your imagination.\"\n\nI was forwarded a couple other email exchanges along the same lines, and given a few other anecdotes that made me understand why the student felt uncomfortable working with this faculty member.  Obviously this isn't appropriate coming from faculty, let alone from a PI.  The student told me that, while these were only occasional jabs at his religion and he got along with his advisor most of the time, it happened often enough from someone in a position of authority over him that he felt it would impact his academic work.\n\nI put him in touch with two other faculty in the same field, both of whom said they wanted to look at his work before being confident that they could advise him.  Is there anything else I should do?  Should I talk to the faculty member in question?  To the administration?  \n\nI'm also not Jewish, but the student and faculty member both are.  I'm a bit worried there's a cultural element to this that I don't really understand.  If anyone can fill me in on this, I'd appreciate it.",

They will know how best to support the student.  Reporting it will also absolve you and, if they handle it well, the university of culpability should the student decide to sue the university over this (which isn't as uncommon as you might imagine).",

      "text": "Okay. So I am a student who was in this situation with a faculty who kept undermining my cultural practices and I ended up switching advisors. The program director handled it perfectly and here's how: \n\n1. I met with the program director and told her exactly how I felt and what happened and why the things that were said to me were offensive and she validated my experience, apologized, and asked me if there's anything I felt like I missed out on as a student (learning wise) because of this and offered to arrange for me to make up for it. \n2. she had a meeting with me and the dean where I again discussed the entire situation and they asked me for my advice on how can the dept do better. be careful of this because it is not the minority student's responsibility to fix this issue, it's the dept responsibility to hire someone to do cultural sensitivity training for the staff. \n3. she sent an email to me detailing all the decisions that were made regarding the resolution, for documentation, and informed me of all my options for reporting. And she informed the university's Ombudsman and  Office of Cultural diversity officially. \n4. she arranged for me to meet with the faculty at fault and she attended the meeting as a mediator. and I was able to explain why the things said shouldn't have been said. The faculty apologized to me. and now I feel better about the whole situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think the student's cultural background is relevant at all. It's the fact that a student's learning experience was compromised due to insensitive remarks by a professor. The professor's status shouldn't be a factor at all. Hope this helps.",

This is one of those situations where the chair needs to draw a line and make it clear that this behavior is not acceptable. Obviously, there are limits on what can be done to a tenured faculty member, but the first step is to sit down and address the behavior directly.",

In all cases as an advisor, I'd never joke about a number of things, and religion is one of those things.   It seems fair then that the student be allowed to switch.  \n\nThe fact it was brought to your attention may mean you have a duty to report to HR via some policy or procedure. HR could advise you on this, as well as whether you are the person to chat with the current advisor about the student's perception and desire to switch.  I always advise faculty too, you might be in a state where one party consent is all that's required for recording a one to one conversation. I  keep that in mind, especially in possibly contentious meetings, and for that reason, I often don't meet people one to one for any hot issue.",

I don't think there should be any problem with you facilitating that.\n\nI think the issue here is if you are required to report this as discriminatory behavior to the university - if your school has an equity office or an anti-harrassment wing of HR see what their policy is.  Our uni's policy is to have the immediate supervisor handle the first occurrence (in this case that would be the department head telling their professor to knock it off) and then report to equity office for all recurrent behavior after the first warning.",

Asking a student about their religious views and then saying they're nuts, is very inappropriate. \n   1. Now, if a student volunteered their religious views in the context of a philosophy department discussion, seminar or paper, it would be entirely appropriate to say that those are bad arguments due to apparently false premises that the student had not sufficiently defended - but that is not what is being alleged.\n3. The second email exchange was totally appropriate. Evolution, the age of the Earth, and the existence of God are matters of empirical fact by definition regardless of what you think the empirical facts of those matters are. Moreover, in the context of a philosophy department, \\*\\*directly questioning the existence of God(s) is 100% within proper bounds\\*\\* - that's a core part of the discipline. \n4. Telling a student to \"Have fun! Keep me in your imagination.\" is quirky and silly but not discriminatory. A faculty member ought to be respectful of their students but they absolutely need not show reverence towards their religious beliefs or holidays.",

      "text": "Is it not important to differentiate between discrimination and rudeness? I would support the student changing advisors, if that is the student\u2019s preference. But there is always an issue with interests aligning. In this situation, changing an advisor may lead to the student writing something that is less interesting and suffering in a different way. Depending on interests, I am not sure that I would encourage the student to fire the advisor. That advice should depend on an informed assessment of whether staying with this advisor puts the student\u2019s career at risk. \n\nTo date, the student has not documented evidence of discrimination. What unfairness has the student suffered? What resources or opportunities have been denied? There is a risk of that, but in this email to the OP, the student may be looking for evidence to the contrary. The student might find it useful to speak with successful advisees who have worked with this professor despite divergent viewpoints to better understand the quirks of dealing with him, for example. \n\nIn many fields, we work on an apprentice model that benefits from getting along well with doctoral supervisors, but it might not be necessary with this particular professor. What the student needs is good research guidance, timely feedback, a fair evaluation, and an effective reference later on. \n\nApart from discrimination, I see incivility. I see a professor feeling entitled to disagree and seeking out that disagreement in a way that is counterproductive to his role as an educator. I teach at a university with many student athletes. I have little interest in (and a real distaste for) sports, but I use sports metaphors and cases in my teaching because it helps my students to learn. This professor is doing the opposite by picking fights with someone that he should be mentoring. He\u2019s obviously out of touch, and his obliviousness, ineptitude, or maliciousness is getting in the way of his role as an educator.",

      "text": "A few things to keep in mind here.\n\nThe exact nature of what does and does not constitute antisemitism or discrimination within the Jewish community is a subject of a lot of lively debate, but that debate is something for Jews to decide individually and collectively. It is not your position as a goy to step in and take a side. I can explain some of the history and ideas if you're interested but it should not feed into your decision-making here. You should not tell the professor that he is being antisemitic because it is not your place to do that, and you should not tell the student that he is not experiencing antisemitism because, again, it is not your place to do that.\n\nJews are considered a protected class under Title VI, as has reentered the public discussion thanks to Trump's executive order last week, so if a student feels discriminated against because they are Jewish, you are required to act to protect their right to an equal education. If the student wants a different advisor, the obvious way forward is to grant them that. It would probably not make sense to discipline the professor because this is more a matter of intrafaith debate and coming down on either side puts you and your department in a bad position. The best way to take this, honestly, is to grant the student a change of advisor and drop it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: got a bunch of downvotes, I'm assuming from non-Jews who don't really understand the central role of arguing about ritual within Jewish culture, including within religious practice.  Arguing about the specific correct ways to do certain types of ritual, the importance of certain types of ritual, etc are all fundamental to the gemara and responsa, so this sort of discussion is not the same sort of thing as if a non-Jew was involved in the same discussion. Again, there is nuance here. The student has suggested a way forward that will help them to be able to do good work, and it makes sense to go forward with that plan. But the idea that a diversity office is going to know the way forward here is going to make this a much bigger problem, partly because this is a nuanced issue and partly because diversity offices have a bad track record of dealing appropriately with antisemitism in general.",

Clearly in this case that has failed and is antagonistic, but the healthy version of that sort of relationship is commonplace and is in fact the precise reason why there is such a strong push to diversify university faculties more generally.

There are manners by which attacks on Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and other minority religionists can and are legally construed as racially motivated, and that is where there is typically strict application of discrimination law. But if the criticism is actually clearly a criticism of beliefs and not construed in a racist manner, it is actually very hard to construe that as discrimination if no services are being denied. Given that this is very explicitly a discussion about ritual adherence between two members of the same ethno-religious group, you're going to have a difficult time making the argument that religion here is a stand-in for racial stereotypes.\n\nThis may apply differently in countries where there are strict blasphemy laws, but my understanding here is that this is not one of those countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> whether they are Jewish or not. Nobody's religious beliefs should be mocked in the academic place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis gets delicate because what counts as a belief and what counts as mocking are very flexible. Apparently a substantial percentage of Fox News viewers believe that saying \"Happy Holidays\" is a war on their religious beliefs, or that cracking jokes about how bad Christmas music is is literally worse than the Holocaust. I frankly do not trust the Christian Right enough to accept a statement like \"nobody's religious beliefs should be mocked in academia\" because quite frankly enough people have shoved their religious beliefs into the public arena by trying to force everyone else to adhere to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it tasteful for the secular professor here to snipe at the frum student? Probably not, and if it was a WASP professor we would be having a very different discussion here for damned sure. But I don't think this is a situation where a non-Jew should be stepping in and trying to define the behavior as antisemitic. The professor is being obnoxious about it and is not taking a hint when the student tells him that it's enough. That's a good a reason as any to support the student switching advisors. But I don't think it's a good idea for a non-Jew with no understandings of the nuances to stomp in and start declaring that one of the two is an antisemite. That is some Meghan McCain bullshit.",

              "text": "> I get what you're saying, but no workplace is the place to litigate issues between religious sects. How would you react to a Hindu professor who made derogatory comments to students from a \"lower caste\"? \n\nIn the caste system, there is a strict traditional hierarchy which governs social power dynamics and historically governed civil rights. Within the Jewish community, the secular professor and the frum student are on equal footing. One does not have hierarchical power over the other. In fact, it might even g the other way, where the frum student may have greater credibility within the community because he is observant.\n\nYour example is instructive though because you could easily flip it and create a complex gray zone. Let's say a professor of Dalit background is confrontational to a student of Brahman background who perhaps brings aspects of his Brahman identity into the workplace, perhaps saying things about how the traditional caste system is ridiculous and harmful. Is that something that would be productive to elevate to a diversity officer or HR? Or is that a conversation that a white person maybe should just stay out of? Even then, if the Brahman student feels like that is not going to be a productive relationship, is it within their rights to request a change of supervision?\n\nOr we could bring this back to a Jewish example but take it out of specific religious observance practices. Let's say the student is pro-Israel and the secular Jewish professor criticizes that stance, perhaps saying \"I don't think Jews need our own state\" or something like that. Is that an antisemitic statement that needs to be referred to a diversity office? Is it different if the professor is not Jewish?\n\nAs for whether any discussion at all about identity can or should take place in an academic workplace, I will point out that members of minority groups can and do have conversations about identity. Those conversations are often about how to navigate a majoritarian work environment which is sometimes hostile. As a PhD student, I had a committee member who was also Jewish and who I would frequently have conversations about Jewish culture things, who would host me and some other Jewish students for some holidays, and who would provide support for things like asking for days off for holidays when other professors might not be understanding. But in a philosophy department specifically, I can see justification for a more in-depth set of interactions that do get at deeper identity issues, especially if you're Jewish. That is in part because philosophy as a field is massively dominated by Christian thinkers and antisemitic texts. We're talking about departments which may well offer entire classes on Heidegger. Whether this professor is doing a good job of being a mentor is a different thing (he's clearly not) but saying \"well, the fact there is any discussion of religion at all is irrelevant to the degree and therefore it is inappropriate\" simply misunderstands the manner in which minority groups navigate the academy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Obviously the fact that the Jewish student reported this behavior is a sign that you're wrong here, and that this is in fact a matter that should be handled at the university level. \n\nThe student reported it as evidence of a conflict between himself and the professor and asked to be moved to a different lab. It doesn't sound like the student is calling it religious discrimination or antisemitism. Not every interpersonal conflict rises to the level of referral to a diversity officer.",

      "text": "I can imagine how uncomfortable and uneasy that must make the student feel. But let's talk honestly.. How many professors have you met that open ridicule theism altogether? I've had many laugh in my face. Some consider it fundamentally acceptable in my field as you're allowed to ridicule anything not backed by evidence (science in general). No one of those I met ever even considered getting offended by this (I am a theist myself). I wonder if getting ridiculed (as indirectly as shown in your examples) for one's specific religion would evoke a different reaction amongst my colleagues.\n\nEither way, I would find this rather bad.. I would ask my advisor to behave more professionally and to refrain from making such comments. If he refuses, I would consider a change of mentorship but on the basis of him being rude and inconsiderate and not on the basis of being anti Semitic.",

          "text": "> How many professors have you met that open ridicule theism altogether?\n\nSeveral.  It just seems extremely inappropriate for a faculty member to do to a student.  There's a power dynamic here that makes it seem rather more inappropriate than if a faculty member said it to another faculty member.\n\n>Some consider it fundamentally acceptable in my field as you're allowed to ridicule anything not backed by evidence\n\nThe same is true in my field.  It's just extremely rude.  I'm an atheist, but I would never consider mocking someone for religious beliefs irrelevant to their work.  If you start using religious beliefs to make philosophical assertions, then I'm going to criticize those beliefs (if not outright mock them).  But I don't think religious views *per se* should be an impediment to an academic career.\n\nI've known people in the field who have strong religious beliefs to keep their mouths shut until they get tenure (some of them even after that).  This is usually because they're worried about ridicule or discrimination on the part of their colleagues; unfortunately, I can't say they're unjustified in doing that.  That doesn't mean I have to approve of the attitudes that lead them to do that.",
