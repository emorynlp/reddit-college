  "text": "This is just an anecdote but generally you will hear a story here and there about how someone with a 2.5 GPA got into med school with a bad MCAT score and that this person didn't need to worry about being admitted because they became buddy buddy with someone in the admission committee. Is there truth to these stories or are these just from bitter people who didn't get in?",

Friends, big donors and relatives who would not get in could appeal to the president for admission. Needless to say they were not the brightest light bulbs in the chandelier.",
