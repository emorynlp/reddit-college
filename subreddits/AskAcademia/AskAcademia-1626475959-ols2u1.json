  "title:": "Struggling with tenure-track application package and questioning what to do",
  "text": "I recently got a PhD in chemistry. During grad school, I TA'd for five semesters and realized that I really enjoyed teaching. I became interested in becoming a professor at a primarily undergraduate institution, particularly research-oriented liberal arts schools. I decided to do a combined teaching/research postdoc at a research-focused liberal arts school and am now working on my application package for tenure-track positions. I was not expecting the process of coming up with research proposals to be so stressful. At first, I thought I'd be excited about having the freedom to choose my own research topics. Then, I started having a really hard time trying to choose topics/projects from all the options. I've also gotten really bad imposter syndrome, feeling like I wouldn't be able to start a research program of my own. Another problem is that many liberal arts schools don't have the kind of equipment that I would need to carry out my research (which is more materials science than chemistry). So, I am having to heavily adjust my proposals to use more standardized equipment, which means I am not as excited about the proposed research. I do know that I wouldn't want to apply to research universities, though. I am now questioning whether I even want to go into academia anymore, given how unhappy I've been the last few weeks just from working on my application. Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.",

          "text": "I\u2019m going to have to respectfully disagree with this approach. There are only select times that you can apply for jobs, and you only get so many tries. Furthermore, if you have a poor research proposal you will almost never get feedback on it; either your application will be passed by in favor of someone else or you will interview and not get the job. \n\nAll the ideation, iteration, editing, and polishing has to be done before you apply, not after.",

      "text": "The research proposal is by far the hardest and most stressful part of the application package. \n\nFirst, like any written document, writing something compelling takes many iterations and revisions. Do you have resources or people to bounce ideas off of? Also, my advice would be to think of what program would you hope to build? How can I combine my grad and postdoc into a new way of looking at things? From there come up with detailed examples of projects and how you would work with students to accomplish those goals, what the first experiments would be, etc.\n\nSecond, can you play to your strengths as an educator to combine research with teaching experiences for undergrads? That is, in addition to thinking about what you would accomplish on the materials side, how would you teach interested students on fundamentals of materials science? Science education is a big part of NSF\u2019s mission and your interviewers will recognize that.\n\nThird, people at small colleges can get often access to facilities at nearby larger schools and national labs if you\u2019re willing to go there. So maybe you don\u2019t have access to some expensive X-ray characterization apparatus (or whatever) but someone else might.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Physics prof at a PUI here and I totally get what you are feeling. First, in terms of applications you are definitely doing the \"right\" thing in tailoring them for the equipment that schools you are interested in are going to have. This will show a search committee you have done your homework and actually want to be in a PUI environment.\n\nI don't necessarily think your options may end up being as limited as it seems. I think it may not hurt to dream big and also write about what you could do if you get grants for equipment (bonus points if you mention specific grant plans) or can identify potential collaborators at nearby research institutions. I'm good friends with a new chem faculty and over the summer she is at a local R1 twice a week for collaborative projects and ultimately this will be a nice leg up for her students. You can write about potential on and off campus activities and potential funding streams. I think acknowledging that you know the limitations of on campus stuff and planning how to accommodate is a really smart thing to do in your statement.\n\nAs someone who has been on a hiring committee at a PUI, good statements to us are ones that seemed feasible for our environment and would involve students, not the ones that would be published in the highest impact journals. Because of this I think there is a lot of flexibility for faculty in what their research ends up looking like once they start. So even if you aren't super jazzed about the research your write about (and as long as your can amp up the enthusiasm during interviews) you won't be held to those exact plans. So you will likely have more time to pursue the avenues to get to your dream projects or even find something else you are interested in.",

      "text": "Join futurePIslack. They\u2019re running a peer review group now. \n\nSend your proposal and other things to all your friends and mentors. They\u2019ll critique your ideas and point out holes in your logic. You can then refine your ideas and make a better package. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is the future employer doesn\u2019t necessarily expect you to do all you outline in the research statement. The goal is to get as close as possible to what you think you\u2019ll do and make it defensible, fit into institutional infrastructure, and seem fundable. There\u2019s a whole year between writing it and employment, after all \u2014 lots can change in that time. The system knows this. I find keeping this in mind makes everything less stressful. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t hurt to try exploring other career paths. I learned from interviews in industry that it\u2019s not for me....",

      "text": "If you\u2019re applying for faculty positions, a key component of the application and interview process is to communicate a sense of excitement about your work.  Go for \u201cI am crazy excited about these ideas but of course I will have to adapt them to the equipment, budget, and lab space of your institution.\u201d That gives you a good shot.  If you start off by compromising your ideas to fit them down to your idea of limited equipment, you won\u2019t get offers.\n\nThe \u201cindependent research program\u201d thing can be intimidating.  Your prior experience and training are as an individual contributor. One way to approach this is to think about what experiments you think would be really cool.  Then since you\u2019re interested in PUI, think about how to involve and engage undergraduate students in the work _you_ find exciting.  If you can communicate your excitement about not just research but research _with students_, hiring committees will want to bring you on board, and you will get help (from dean, dept chair, senior colleagues) figuring out how to adapt your plans to local resources.",
