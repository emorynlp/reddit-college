  "text": "It all feels less spectacular than it should.\n\nI loved my field when I decided to pursue a PhD. And then I started getting worn out. I dropped out because I was having too much trouble working with other graduate students.\n\nI found a job in the field, and seeing how my profession works in practice killed any last passion I had remaining for the subject.\n\nI ended up losing my job during the pandemic and decided to finish my degree. It was the easiest option, and an option that meant I could stay at home. The passion never came back, but I was able to finish writing and defend my dissertation.\n\nSo, now what? I'm working for my advisor and will do so for the next couple of months. I hate every minute of it. Doing anything feels like a hassle. The thing I hate doing most is *writing*, which is not a good omen for a future academic career. I can't imagine doing this for the rest of my life. I feel trapped.\n\nI know I can't be the only person who's gone through this. How did you pivot to something else? How do you find meaning in your work?",

Funders have loads of weird and wonderful jobs from managing portfolios of funded projects to working on open access to driving directed funding schemes. Learned societies may also have stuff. These jobs are great because they need some research knowledge to help you navigate their work and a knowledge of academia so you are putting that PhD to use and supporting a sector that you value while also not being an academic.",

      "text": "Realize there are more career options than being an academic.  Even in industry, you are not locked into R&D positions.  Of friends I have with STEM PhDs:  one is in sales of high-end research equipment.  One does a kind of technical support, company buys his company's product and he goes on-site until everything is working, he gets to travel all of the time and loves it.  Another is basically a high level recruiter and talent scout for PhDs for R&D.  Another has a job where she just reads articles and attends conferences, her job is stay on top of the literature and the latest/greatest and send reports to the R&D staff so they don't have to waste time doing that stuff.  Another works for a large academic group writing policy related to STEM.  If you are in biomedical, look into being a Medical Science Lesion (it is what I would probably be doing if I was not in academics).  Another got a fellowship (with congress I think) to work on governmental policy (lost track of her).  Another works doing grants congruency at a university (there is the whole world of research oversight, IRB, IACUC, Bio/Radiation Safety, post-award, etc.).  I interviewed for a job with the government to be a grants officer (giving out grants rather than writing them).  I also interviewed with the military to do evaluations on trainees (the military seemed to take a very broad view of what a PhD qualified you to do).  And another friend busted is butt working as hard as possible for about 10 years in industry, getting lots of stocks, etc., retired early and is now a documentary film maker. \n\nThis is on top of getting jobs that are teaching oriented, such as small liberal arts colleges and community colleges.  The first job I was offered at a liberal arts college didn't even have a publication requirement for tenure, just giving research presentations at regional conferences would have been enough.    \n\nMy point is, you do not have to become your advisor.  Being an academic at a research university is only one option.  Good luck!",

Therefore, going a different direction can feel like a failure.  While money is not the sole measure of success, I can tell you most people I know in these alternative jobs are making at least twice what they would be making in academics.  The work-life balance for many of these jobs are better as well (ie, you can leave your work at work).  \n\nYou are right, the lack of networking opportunities during the pandemic is making this all harder.  I don't really have any tips based on experience to help you there.  I would hope, though, that means companies are having harder times recruiting people so maybe cold-calls and applying to open positions may have better luck now, but I have no data to back that up.",

Because of that now I have a full time job in a field unrelated to my PhD. \n\n>How do you find meaning in your work?\n\nIt's gonna sound very shallow to many people but I just went for the best offer that I thought would hate the least.

First, just go to one of the big job sites and Google your degree or overall field (so anything from e.g. Neuroscience over Biology to STEM), then some specific skills you always liked to applying. Those can be specific like \"microscopy\" or broader soft skills. See what types of jobs come up.   \nYou could also try to check out alumni from your institution on LinkedIn to see where they went, although it can be hard to find those from the same department.\n\nAfter getting a first idea what you could even imagine to do, try to apply to jobs, get done interviews, \"orientation days\" done companies offer or if possible informal interviews with either alumni or any other contacts you can find. At that stage you don't necessarily expect to find a job but just dig deeper to see whether you might like a job.  \nAfter finishing my PhD I thought I might like consulting for a company that covers a broad field of problems but attending their orientation day made it crystal clear to me that I would actually dislike that job.\n\nOtherwise r/LeavingAcademia is dedicated to that topic, although not huge has some nice insights every now and then.",

This was after 2 years for a masters in it. It\u2019s a long story, but I am so happy I went back to my biology degree bachelors roots and am now finishing up a one year post bachelors program to become a clinical laboratory scientist in a hospital lab setting. The job and pay will be more stable than anything I could have had before (especially with covid now as I would have been finishing my degree when all universities seemed to have a hiring hold). I also get to directly contribute to my society with meaningful work. \n\nThe program I\u2019m currently in has been one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done, not just because they take the last two years of their traditional bachelors degree and shove it into 1, but my biology mindset needed a lot of refreshing at the beginning of the program with a ten year gap. \n\nI don\u2019t regret it at all! I did not get along well with some of the graduate students I used to work with. I\u2019m a bit of a passive person that wants good work flow and apparently telling someone to work with another student because the advisor said so means others will literally just give you the cold shoulder until you leave and yell at you when they find you alone in a room lol. I found people hated you when you did better than them too. The only people congratulating me on grants I received or big projects I got to work on were professors, then students would be jealous kids and hide your special weigh boats and things. But I also was finding things like a huge lack of lab understanding from every level in the academic world. My advisor never went into her own lab for years at a time, the other students from my university and others across the world typically didn\u2019t know what running standards with your samples meant or why it was important, and it was a challenge to publish anything that didn\u2019t follow a preset story. It was only getting worse, so I left. My field was one I don\u2019t tell many about today because of the atmosphere on it all (pun intended) but it was stable isotopes with the purpose of using the produced records for climate models. \n\nAll I can say is, do something you won\u2019t go crazy in, or at least that you can find a good pay with so you can use your non work hours as fun. Get into a career line that values a good work life balance. Don\u2019t stay and become more bitter. Hope this helps :)",

      "text": "I am about to finishing my phD in theoretical photonics and I am pivoting to RF engineering after I am done (still in academia). This was due to numerous reasons, partly because photonics jobs are scarce where I live, but also because physics itself got quite boring to me. The whole mindset of seeking for \"new physics\" even when there's clearly none to be found was tiring, oftentimes papers that were ready to be published were drawn out for several extra months trying to spice things up with some \"exotic physical phenomena\". I felt like I needed to change into something more to my liking, like engineering research. I work better with practical problems that have a clearly-defined goal, \"we want this X to happen and use it for Y\", and I feel like that's where I would be most useful as opposed to continuing to push myself ultra-hard to pass as a \"physicist\" when in reality I have more of an engineering brain.\n\nI think in general it's natural to feel very drained after many years of working on the same research topic. Many other academics I know have felt like this, and what helped them was to change fields every now and then. You may end up coming back to your previous area at some point in the future, or you may not. The point is that the only way to keep curiosity and excitement alive is to always seek out the projects that really call out to you. It may be hard to land a position in a different research area, but if you truly like what it's about then it will be worth it.",
