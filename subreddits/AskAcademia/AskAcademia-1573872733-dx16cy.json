My school actually tries to put together full-time contracts and to keep people on,rather than doing per-course deals, because we've been able to hold on to good people longer that way.  No institution is going to ever be 100% TT as it doesn't make sense from a budgeting/planning standpoint, but certainly some (including mine) try to use per-course adjunct as they were intended to be, i.e. for last-minute needs and/or to bring in people with professional experience to teach the occasional class (like lawyers).

          "text": "I actually am mastering out this semester, though I'm ABD (I do have an MA in another, related field). There are many reasons for this, but one is because my husband now makes more than I ever possibly could with a new professor's salary in the social sciences. Even if I found a great job, with benefits and tenure I'd make less than he makes now living where I have been going to school - a job he took to take care of us while I studied and which he was promoted enough times in since that he now has incredible healthcare for us both. He can't move his job - he'd have to find another. \n\nIn other words, we *couldn't afford for me to get a good job with a PhD.*\n\nSince my only real love is teaching, educating - and I have more than my fair share of criticisms for the centrality of research in PhD programs and university positions vis-a-vis teaching responsibilities - I decided I was just done. With two MAs and a decade of teaching experience and experience working in other parts of the education industry I decided I'd finish now, and adjunct here and there while also doing part time work with education companies.\n\nIt took a decade for me to realize that you don't get a PhD if you want to teach. You get one if you want to do research and are willing to be *forced* to teach in order to have the resources to do it.\n\nIt is one of American higher education's worst structural issues: PhDs are geared towards two, often very different things - doing research and educating university students. PhD programs, for the most part, are designed primarily with the former in mind and the latter treated as an afterthought. Yet, you can't teach at a university without a PhD you get mostly by doing... a lot of research on a very small niche topic in your field. That research experience does not mean you are more capable as an educator - often it can do the opposite. I wish PhD programs were split into two types, research and education, with those seeking to teach being provided greater breadth of training in pedagogy and the various topics within the sub-disciplines of their field - and related fields.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, we produce an army of researchers that, each year, is 10x larger than the number of available jobs at universities. Tenure is drying up. Many companies prefer people with Masters and a few years actual hands on experience to more expensive, less experienced PhDs. Adjunct positions face the same issue - often preferring MAs where possible based on cost. **All the while** American higher education seems to not have fully realized that the whole system is breaking down - not only is there incredible discontent among faculty and grad students (grad students themselves being one of the most psychiatrically depressed demographics in the country) leading to lower morale, there is also a dramatic new change in the industry: online accredited education. Whereas a decade ago a handful of legitimate universities offered a few online classes, mostly in the summer or to student populations that were more diverse in terms of age, families, etc now we see large universities offering hundreds of online classes *during a normal semester to students who live on campus*. \n\nMAs can make great online classes. Online classes can be taught to thousands at a time; hell, they could be bought and packaged as a whole making having an actual trained instructor 'in-the-classroom' completely unnecessary. Eventually, more and more Americans are going to decide it isn't worth the opportunity cost and actual cost of a university education when they can take an online program at their own speed and for far, far less money. Additionally - as our industries seem to diverge and proliferate ever faster with technology, many fields now accept specialized degrees/accreditations that only take a year or two - and which are very focused on a specific set of skills for the job market.\n\n/ramblingrant",

          "text": "As a current Ph.D. student and former high school teacher, I can tell you that neither one really \"gets the summers off\".  As a grad student, you are expected to continue doing research, and in my case, I generally have to teach in the summer (but that brings in extra money).  As a teacher, sure, you don't have to go to work, but it's not just like a giant vacation.  There's still prepping that has to happen; you might have coaching responsibilities; there are mandatory professional developments, and on top of that it takes a lot to get out of school mode and actually in to summer mode (that doesn't happen just after the last day of year).\n\nOne of the things I like about the academic route, however, is that with research there is always something new to learn/discover.  I do love teaching (and get to do a lot of it), but teaching at a university and doing research alongside that is very different than teaching the same few courses year after year in a high school.  This obviously is somewhat dependent on your subject and the school where you'd be teaching, but as a language teacher, I just got 5 levels (1-AP) of the same thing every day of every year.  For me, it got a little stale.  As an English teacher though, you'll likely have a bit more flexibility in what/how you teach.\n\nFinancially though it does suck to be a grad student.  I left $50,000/year as a teacher for about $16,000/year as an M.A. student (and now at about $24,000 as a Ph.D. student).  If you are truly passionate about the Ph.D. though, I'd say go for it.  If the tenure-track position doesn't work out (and you may also realize that's not actually what you want), you can always teach high school (and start out higher up on the pay scale because of the doctorate).",

I had 2 other jobs though (Upward Bound & working for my university's document library), my B.A. loans were deferred, and I only was able to make it work because my live-in girlfriend was an elementary school teacher (who also didn't make much, but we made it work).  My girlfriend paid rent, and I paid for internet and groceries.\n\nEDIT: Also, over breaks, I would go home and do some extra office work for a drilling company that I had worked for in college.  So I guess over the year, I had 3 extra jobs in addition to the adjunct position.",

The only reason I was able to do it and have enough for bills was because I live in a fairly inexpensive area and am married. I split the bills with my husband and I was also able to go on to his health insurance through his work.\n\nI told myself I would give it 2 years and if I didn\u2019t go full time at either college in that time I would look for other options. I got lucky and went full time in 1 year. The way the job market is for professors, I\u2019m never letting go of this job and someone will have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t have rich parents or a rich husband. We have no children and live a no frills life. I got through grad school by pinching pennies, living with roommates, and eating a lot of pasta and beans.",

      "text": "I don't have any real answers, just data that might be interesting.\n\nAdjunct pay varies wildly depending on the state, type of school, subject taught, etc.  But it's generally sucky, unless you're at a top private university or a unionized school in California.  According to [this article from the Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Adjunct-Project-Shows-Wide/136439), the average pay reported by adjuncts for a three-credit course in 2013 was $2,987.  Assuming, full-time is 15-credits, that's only $15k/semester or $30k/year, excluding summers.  Pretty atrocious!\n\nHowever, [this AAUP study published Insider Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/04/11/aaups-annual-report-faculty-compensation-takes-salary-compression-and-more) reports much larger salaries on a per-section basis.  The average for a part-time faculty member with a doctorate ranges from $10,156-$12,431 per section.  This sounds much better but it's a bit vague on how many units that is and how many of these sections would equal full-time.\n\nI did my adjuncting in California, which is an anomaly as I got benefits and a substantially higher salary.  It's unfortunate that it's not a similar situation nationwide.",

IT'S GREAT.\n\nI adore teaching and by god I'm not got to stop, but I can't do it in this way forever.\n\nEdit: I missed the commenter who can make $60k in a good year. That's awesome! I absolutely support what they say about unionized schools. The school in my area that pays $7k has a robust union. Summer classes also help if you can get them.",

If I were to work as an adjunct after I graduate, it would be significantly harder to get research grants due to both institutional affiliations and lack of time, so I get that this is not a long-term solution, but thought I'd share it as a potential source of income.",

              "text": "How in the world did you get that from my comment? I am a professor and highly respect the job of a teacher (since I do it myself). Adjuncts are literally *not supposed to make enough money to live on* . They were not designed that way. They were designed to fill gaps, for single classes or special cases. That's not how we use them, but that's their original purpose.\n\nWhat's being done now with adjuncts is criminal, but we can't fix it by complaining about salaries. We need full time faculty to fill those jobs, and hire the people who are adjuncting to do it.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll add some more context, since the response was so negative (downvotes, etc). Hire an adjunct for a class or two gives departments flexibility. Maybe someone has a sabbatical, or a course release, or whatever. The pay is intended to be a small stipend for your time - but it was never intended to support full-time work. The original idea was for adjuncts to have *another* full time job, and the adjuncting was supposed to happen on the side. In this way, a professor from the original department could pick up additional teaching, if they thought it was advantageous. Or maybe someone outside could pick of up teaching experience. Everyone wins.\n\nBut when we have people trying to adjunct for their entire career, we get cheaper, lower quality teaching, as well as a class of academics who are sorly mistreated. And that's not a comment \"adjuncts are worse teachers\", it's more like \"adjuncts have less time to spend improving their teaching\", which is quite true. As a full-time professor, I might teach up to four classes a semester (if I have no research or service responsibilities), and I feel like I could devote enough time to the students to provide a good experience. If I was teaching more then that (like some adjuncts do), the quality of teaching would suffer. That's just an admission that teaching is a real job, and takes real time to be good at.\n\n(And of course, if you're an adjunct teaching 4 classes a semester, you probably have extreme economic pressure that prevents you from actually focusing on teaching the way that someone like me can.)\n\nSo, yes adjunct salaries could be higher, but we need to support more *full time faculty* (both NTT and TT) and reduce the need for adjuncts. That will have the biggest impact on both teaching quality and job satisfaction.",
