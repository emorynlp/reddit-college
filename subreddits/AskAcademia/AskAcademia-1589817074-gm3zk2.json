  "title:": "Librarians of Reddit, what tools or systems at the library could greatly benefit a researcher\u2019s search and workflow, but is rarely or improperly used?",
  "text": " ***TL;DR:* Researcher and Librarians of reddit, I was hoping you could share techniques and tools/services/features that are often forgotten, tucked away, or just plain underutilized. I\u2019m referring to things that could greatly help researchers in their lit- or topical searches, and information collection & management after they\u2019ve begun finding info.**\n\n___ \n&nbsp;\n\nI was going through some old documents that I needed to organize and thought about the systems that librarians used to use, such as index cards, and topic bibliographies. \n\nI remember getting a library ran crash-course in my undergraduate education on using EBSCO and other things, but it was relatively identical to what they taught to highschool students in the late 2000s: relatively analog methods of search, easybib and EBSCO as a search engine. Before that we learned about bibliographies written by subject-experts in a field that lists books and publications on a subject or sub-discipline. These were rarely used or findable during undergrad. *Is there a good digital version of subject bibliographies?* Most search algorithms don\u2019t seam to curate the best books for a subject matter for a given year. \n\nMendeley is a great tool it was relatively fresh in My undergrad years. However I\u2019ve always wanted to know more about little known research tools that could drastically improve your research workflow and it\u2019s organization. Researchers in academia often have access to software or database subscriptions as well interlibrary programs, but there are many facets to these things.\n\n*What tools or functions (digital or self-used) in a library is often underutilized or in-plain sight but is so useful if people actually knew about it?* \n\nWhen I think of tools & services, I typically think of EBSCO/EBSCO-Host, JSTOR, or WorldCat. Basically things almost every University provides. *What little known, tucked away, or underutilized features such as source referencing and search management, workflow aids, or other features that are super useful are rarely found by the average first year grad student?* Or *what features or common tool do you share that are rarely talked about that is a game-changer?*\n\n***Side-notes:***\n\n1. I know that reference librarians are invaluable tools and people, but I want to focus on things that they and other librarians provide or teach about.\n2. I hope this is the right place to ask.",

      "text": "I'm an academic librarian... I've learned about research through my degree, and through dogfooding, my university has faculty librarians so I have to do personal research, as well as helping students.\n\nI'm cribbing from my instructional presentation for incoming PhDs:\n\n\\- Forward citation searching. Very few grad students know about this. Scopus used to be the only tool, but now Google Scholar is so good at it, just truly choice. I teach this all the time. Most of them know about regular (backwards) citation searching, so the idea of doing it in the other directions pleasurably blows minds.\n\n\\- Google Scholar Alerts\n\n\\- Statistics, how to find them. Usually subject specific so you'd have to tell me what you're into. Also getting students to understand stats don't just come out of some ethereal butt - no one can say \"How many people use potholders instead of oven gloves in the US?\" unless someone pays to do a study to get that number.\n\n\\- HathiTrust, search-inside feature for in-copyright books, you can use it as a power index for books you have in your hand\n\n\\- Subject Heading searches in catalogs and databases - this is the main value of professional databases over Google Scholar\n\n\\- LibGuides - these are the modern version of the subject bibliography (though I am tickled pink to see someone who doesn't have an MSLIS who remembers them), if you can hit on a good one you've got a hot little ticket to get your research in an area going. I maintain a very specific one for a unique study of subject that gets thousands of hits a year, outside of my university.\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head! But I can answer questions about the mysterious powers on the other side of the reference desk.",

          "text": "I'm going to piggyback off this awesome reply as another academic librarian to emphasize that so many researchers have trouble coming up with search terms, which limits the results you might find. Subject headings are an awesome tool and are found in the metadata when you click on an article title. Additionally, many databases (and this is definitely true for EBSCO), have a thesaurus you can use to find terms for your search. I'll also add that thinking through synonyms or related terms is immensely helpful to get you the results you are looking for. For example, searching for \"concussion\" is fine, but you'll find way more articles by adding \"TBI\" OR \"traumatic brain injury.\" \n\nThe filters in databases are also immensely helpful and contain related terms as well. You can narrow in your focus so you're not finding too much information, and find related terms that will help your search. Depending on your discipline, the database may allow you to filter for article types (reviews vs case studies vs systematic, etc). I help a lot with medical research, so guiding students towards filters and analyzing article types is helpful. \n\nLast tip! Putting terms with more than one word in quotes, like I did above, forces the database to search for it as if it's one word. Otherwise, if you search traumatic brain injury without the quotes, the database is going to show you results that include those three terms somewhere in the text, but not necessarily together. Putting the term in quotes will give you results where \"traumatic brain injury\" appears as one term.\n\nYour university librarians also have several ways to get in contact with them. They want you to do this. You can usually set up a consultation, connect over chat, or email if you need help or have questions.",

I\u2019m glad to see that google scholar is catching up. I think it is also trying to compete with Web of Science which aggregates articles or publications by specific authors. The only thing it doesn\u2019t do well is list the author you are trying to find and filter out for that specific author. Sometimes it lists the most relevant work that aligns similarly to theirs.

Many LibGuides will have them listed if they exist.  Often users fail to chose the best words for their searches. Likewise, use the related terms that are listed in articles you have found through your favorite databases. These will also help you find better information on your topic. Also, use LibGuides from multiple schools. The information provided is different on each and they\u2019re a quick way to gather a lot of information. \n\n\u2022Use a citation management tool. The university I attended provided RefWorks for all students. I found it helpful to write annotated bibliographies and attach them to each citation. If it had been a while I was able to read my summary of the paper and why I thought it was useful. This helped me streamline my work when doing Lit Reviews. \n\n\u2022Understand how to use Boolean Logic. I have to explain this to patrons almost daily. The amount of information on the internet is insane- but if you do not use the correct search form you are just making work harder on yourself \n\nAlso, utilize the chat service on your libraries website if you ever get stuck.

      "text": "I'm no longer working as a librarian, but as I like to say, you can take the girl out of the library, but you can't take the MLS out of the girl.\n\nFirst (and I'm guilty of this now that I'm back in student status, and because I have the training myself), I think people forget that there are actual humans behind all those databases and libguides, and you are not just allowed to ask them for help but actually encouraged to do so! There's a caveat, which is please do your own legwork first--since you're not an eighth grader, I would prefer not to explain to you what \"ILL\" means or define the difference between peer-reviewed/refereed and not. But it's actually kind of *fun* to be given a challenge to find something. I'm great at coming up with incredibly complicated (and thus incredibly refined and useful for narrowing results and disambiguating common words) search strings with booleans, wildcards, and parentheticals, but lately it seems like my school's ILS has actually gotten less intelligent with them, so I've worked with my liaison librarian to come to a happy medium between 8000 results and no results from being too talented at searching for it to handle haha.\n\nOn the other hand, keep in mind that with covid, everyone who works at the library from page to actual librarian is really stressed out and doing their absolute best, so some things that would otherwise be absurdly easy to provide you with are impossible to get. That's when it's also good to have friends who work at other academic libraries to find a journal article that your home institution doesn't subscribe to, for example. (I realize this is way easier for me to accomplish because I spent 23 months with a large group of people who still work as librarians today, but try?)\n\nThe other two things that are amazing skills to develop at any age, and which I learned from a colleague who was a Google librarian before coming to the school I worked at: 1. **SEARCH FOR YOUR RESULT, NOT YOUR QUESTION**. If your question is \"how many people do X in a given year,\" that's fine, but think about what your result would look like. Is it likely that somebody would title their graph \"how many people do X in a given year?\" Nah. What might they title it? \"Frequency of X by year.\" You want to know \"what themes do Author A and Author B have in common?\" Good luck finding an article that has such a remedial-sounding title. \"\\[Author A in quote marks\\] \\[Author B in quote marks\\] \\[particular theme or framework or theoretical lens you are hoping to find in common\\]\" is more likely to yield something useful.\n\nGoogle is weird and horrible because they claim to be designed for stupid people in order to democratize information but actually serve to deprofessionalize essential roles like educator and librarian. They actually have secret hidden smart skills and functionality for librarians or for people who know how to search like librarians. Search as usual, but on your results page, hit Tools. That'll reveal a second menu that allows you to filter results by a time period of publication; to filter image results by color, size, or type (line drawing, photograph, etc); to filter by usage results, etc. Another way they are secretly for smart people is that you can run searches for a particular website *only* even if that site itself has a garbage search tool or no searchbar at all. Here's how you do it (remove quote marks and brackets): \"\\[search term\\] \\[space\\]  \\[the word \"site\"\\]  \\[no space\\]  \\[colon\\]  \\[no space\\] \\[no http or www\\] \\[blahblahblah dot com/org/whatever\\]\"",
