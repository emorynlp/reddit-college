  "title:": "Has anyone made the move from research to project management?",
  "text": "I'm currently a STEM postdoc in a department in the UK, been thinking about moving to something new but with no clue what that could be. Our department has just advertised a Project Manager role working on a newly funded experiment, and it feels like a potentially interesting sideways move.  \n\n\nI arguably don't tick every \"essential\" box in the job description, but the missing experience items are all things that aren't exactly rocket science, so I don't know if it is something I could actually make a reasonable play for.  \n\n\nDoes anyone here have experience of moving from research to project management? Any tips on how you marketed yourself, details of what particular challenges you faced, and anything else helpful you have to share would be very much appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "I worked as a project manager in a big manufacturing company for a while but I was not loving it. Seemed somehow basic yet a lot of little tasks and quite stressful. Dealing with a  lot of people.\n\nI got the job because I was very open and communicative at the interview. I also talked about some leadership experience I had (leader of some projects etc) also I talked about how I like doing this stuff and how i think I am skilled at it. I didn't have any professional experience tho.\n\nAnyway now I'm a post doc and I am thinking of trying again some job as a PM, product owner or something like this... (Maybe this time in some field that interests me a bit more, not a manufacturing facility.) So would love some insight on this too.",

The more items you hit, the better, but no-one will fit all parameters *unless* that job description was written with a specific person in mind, in which case you're SOL no matter what. Since it's in your department, you should know this, and proceed accordingly.",

So if you see a job you think you could do, and you have a goodly amount of the qualifications, go for it.",

I accomplished this by applying for Science & Technology Policy fellowship programs, which are largely targeted at STEM PhDs and provide a good entry-level position in government departments that do project management and oversight of governmental research grants. Happy to discuss further, DM me.",

      "text": "Yes, and it\u2019s been wonderful. I got tired of my proposal ideas being shot down, and my articles never being read by the right people, and seeing too much \u201cbad science\u201d get funding because of cronyism or buzzword usage. So when I moved into administration, I found I could address all of those issues in a job with far less daily pressure than a postdoc faces.\n\nBut I\u2019m a better administrator than I was a researcher. This role suits me. It does not suit everyone. Being a pure researcher is about what you know, what you can publish, and what you can produce. Being an administrator is more about navigating systems that others have created, handling personalities, being able to say \u201cNO\u201d frequently and convincingly, and working to support other people\u2019s career growth. We always need more good administrators, I say. But be sure you\u2019re a fit for the role.\n\nSell yourself honestly. But it never hurts to talk about ways you\u2019d refine the process to widen or narrow the focus. Or to talk about new initiatives you\u2019d undertake. Or to show that you can stay organized, but also be firm with that system of deadlines and procedures. A good manager is skilled in human relations, most critically the ability to say no and mean it.",
