  "text": "I recently had a realisation that whilst I enjoy the concept of a PhD, I really don\u2019t enjoy the actual work. I\u2019m in my first heard all I\u2019ve done so far is work from home. I haven\u2019t even physically met the people in my department or the other PhD students. \n\nTry as they might, I simply can\u2019t garner the same enthusiasm and spark for learning I had as an undergraduate student. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had very limited social contact but I\u2019m just not feeling it any more. \n\nWhat should I do?",

Having people around you in an office can make it a lot better though. Also, a PhD is less about learning, and more about developing techniques, gathering data, and doing research. So it might just be that your expectations were not going to match to reality.\n\nIf you're not feeling it then quit. There's no point forcing yourself through something as gruelling as a PhD if you're not enjoying it.",

Being around people who share similar interests with you and understand you when you talk about some technical stuff and are even excited about it is an incredible booster for me, and it's been impossible to maintain that over the web. My love for that part of the experience was as big a motivation for pursuing academia as my love for research was.\n\nAlso for some of us the physical framing of being at the uni is a big booster. I find being at home with my books and papers has really slowed me down because without going to the library or enjoying my time at a cafe w/ the laptop and notebook has put me in this... not holiday mode, but this low energy \"battery saver\" mode situation. Now that I'm fully vaccinated and vaccinations are progressing where I am, I am really coming to realise how big a difference that sort of performative aspect makes, at least for me.",

From a certain perspective, spark may be defined as an emotional/instinctual response, reflecting the degree of fit, between yourself and the world you find yourself in.   \n\n\nIts easy to find that fit in undergrad. Everything is more structured, laid out for you, complex but certain. But postgrad is very different, unstructured, open ended, complex and very uncertain.  \n\n\nIn postgrad-you need to engineer fit for yourself, it wont just come to you.",

Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.\n\nAs an UG you have new and amazing ideas thrown at you all day long, with all the learning materials lovingly prepared by teaching staff.  You see far more than you can process in class which is why you need tutorials/projects/coursework/revision time to get your head around it all.  It's super exciting.\n\nOnce you're deep in to a PhD, you have to learn things from other peoples papers which is slow and much more confusing.  You also have to work out things yourself which is even slower and more confusing.   If you learn one new thing a week you're doing very well.  Most of your time is just spent being confused.  It's a very different thing.  The upshot is that when you do discover something, it's yours.  You did it.  You aren't learning about someone else's discovery.  It's a thrill (that can be surprisingly scary). But yes, ultimately progress is much slower and much more frustrating than UG.",

Which is to say, if I had tried to do my PhD remotely it would have been an absolutely terrible thing. (And while I'm at it, undergrad would have been, too.) We are social creatures and despite all of our attention the solitary acts of study and knowledge-creation, those things are usually social as well. There's something exciting about making new friends, arguing with them over the details of something that you individually are still trying to understand, sharing experiences and frustrations, being involved in forms of competition with each other, and so on. Much less the difference between remote advisors (they can be so remote anyway!) and in-person ones. \n\nSo I would suggest that your feeling MAY be related to the remoteness. But I can't guarantee that, obviously. But I am sure that if I was starting a PhD remotely, I'd be miserable and dejected, too.",

I had an absolutely wonderful PhD adviser. He did not publish Nature, Science and Cell papers but had taught me how to design experiments, how to manage research projects, how to deal with other academics during paper reviews, etc... we had countless discussions about research papers where I learned how to critically assess papers. Once his main grant ended, I had to teach for few years, which sucked, but I mastered the undergraduate material I didn't understood that well beforehand and because of this I had an incredible freedom and support in developing my own research projects and directions. Each year in graduate school I feel I learned exponentially more about science. I would consider him a mentor and certainly a friend. \n\nI cannot say any of these things for the two \"famous\" labs I worked as a postdoc. I absolutely loathe how students and postdocs are trained in these labs where the focus is really on developing a great academic, rather than a scientific career. Students in these labs had a miserable experience, in line with his comment. (I personally highly suspect that data manipulation has been involved too, and some sloppy experiments that somehow always confirmed PIs \"amazing intuition\"). \n\nMy opinion is that a person really needs to evaluate what they want to get out of their PhD. If the main goal is to pad their CV with lots high impact factor publications... good luck.",
