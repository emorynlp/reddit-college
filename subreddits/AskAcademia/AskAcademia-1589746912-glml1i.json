          "text": "I'm confused why you think this. The 12-18 months number that immunologists have offered is actually conservative. As you can imagine, there are components of animal testing and human trials that simply can't be accelerated (i.e. waiting for the immune response, waiting to see adverse effects) since we need solid data that the vaccine won't actually *worsen* people's conditions or kill them.\n\nYou're right that medical personnel should be the first to have access. I really hope that's the case. The fastest we've ever created a vaccine (for the mumps) is about **four years**. I'm not trying to pick a fight, but I haven't really seen evidence that would support this claim.",

Even with these shortcuts, a fall timeline isn't really tenable--even the 12-18 month timeline referenced by immunologists is predicated on *nothing going wrong.* \n\n/u/TheMacAran makes good points about how molecular biology has advanced in general and also reiterates the importance of confirming not just the efficacy of a potential treatment, but its safety. That takes time.\n\nRemaining optimistic is important, partly for our collective mental well-being; I also think it's important to be cautious and grounded in our predictions.\n\nI don't think we're allowed to include links in posts, but Forbes has an article on some of issues with the Oxford study I haven't seen many other places.

Our repertoire  of molecular biology techniques and our sequencing ability is light years beyond what was even thought possible then.  There is already a very promising molecular target for anti-bodies (the \"spike\" protein that covers the surface of this virus). We've isolated it, sequenced it, and been able to clone it.  The big question that remains right now is \"what's the safest and most effective way to induce anti-body production?\" and we have far more tools at our disposal to do that now than trying to create or find an attenuated strain that's safe to use, or hope that a killed version would be sufficient.    \n\n\nI'm not saying a vaccine is right around the corner, but 12-18 months is reasonable IF the methods currently under investigation are safe and effective.",
