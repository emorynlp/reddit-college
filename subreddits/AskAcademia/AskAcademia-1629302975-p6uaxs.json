  "text": "Hello. I recently had a proposal accepted for a conference held via Zoom in another country. Before presenting, I must pay \u00a320. I have never presented before and do not know if this is normal? \n\nIs it normal to pay for presenting?\n\nEdit: the \u00a320 is not in addition to the usual fee to attend. The fee to attend is \u00a315, presenters pay \u00a320 in total.",

Essentially, I meant it as \"presenting my result\" since one would have to send in the abstract to conferences/congress and if you're selected, you get \"invited\" to talk. The reason, I think, is because a lot of external funding, should you need one, has a prerequisite of \"being invited to present result\".",
