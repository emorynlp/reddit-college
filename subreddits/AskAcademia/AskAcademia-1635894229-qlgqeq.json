  "text": "I have heard in machine learning, most people get their PhD at the age of 30\\~32. So I would be at least 6 years late or even 10 years older than my peers. Would this put me at a serious disadvantage when I am looking for a tenure track position?",

Moreover if that doesn\u2019t work you can easily find jobs in the private sector that pay well.",

I just thought I'd clarify your first point: In the US, it is only illegal to discriminate by age if the applicant/employee is age 40 or older so it wouldn't necessarily apply to OP. And even when it's illegal, it's really difficult to prove except in extremely overt cases. Subconscious biases for example can absolutely play a factor and are usually nearly impossible to prove.",
