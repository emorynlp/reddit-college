  "title:": "So much effort about encouraging young people to do science, what about creating more jobs in academia?",
  "text": "I am watching this increasing trend of scientists encouraging youngsters to become scientists for the last couple of years. However, whenever I visit the r/AskAcademia subreddit, I find some posts about the poor condition of the academic job market. Now, what's the point of telling young people to become scientists, when there's not much scope to really do so.   \n\n\nNow, my question do academics reach out to the authorities to fund/ create more academic jobs or not? If yes, do you know about the details of this effort? If no, why don't academics do more to really promote science?",

As a biology prof at a small college, I really struggle with requests from marketing for statements on how to pull in more majors outside of those who plan to go to grad school in some form. We do a great service for those who want to go to med/vet/PA/dental/etc school, but our rote bio majors don't have a ton of job prospects, as BS Bio is a dime a dozen and, frankly, unskilled. I've known of CC programs that teach lab tech skills and graduate AS students with way more job prospects than our BS students since they at least have run countless tests and analyzed results beyond the handful of times that happens during a typical BS program.",

Going beyond that ranges from difficult to downright impossible.\n\nI'm at a top institution with a world-class careers service. They can put PhDs in direct contact with industry leaders, mostly because those industry leaders are alumni or have close associations with the institution (cronyism at its finest, but its in our favour, so hey). But even still, the vast majority of professors and full-time faculty here do not have any industry experience. A lot of them have never held a non-academic job except maybe cashier work as a teen, but that's not a career. The people we're working with on a daily basis, our *mentors*, can't mentor us when it comes to industry jobs. And they certainly won't allow us to do internships with companies unless that was already baked into our project.\n\nI can reach out to the careers service to get feedback on my resume. They can teach me how to express my experience in terms that are palatable to industry, but I think few universities have such a careers service. It's only the very largest and most renowned universities that have enough PhD graduates across enough industries of interest to be able to offer that service. Many smaller or less prestigious or more rural institutions really have no idea how to guide PhDs in *any* direction.\n\nHaving all these general skills is great, but if we can't effectively (a) find workplaces that'll value us, and (b) sell our skills to them successfully, then it's all a waste of time.\n\nAfter 3-10+ years of PhD training solely towards an academic career, that's all we know how to do. You overwrote any previous knowledge we had about resumes. All we know now is how to write an academic CV, and it's getting us all rejected from industry jobs. PhDs need more than general problem solving skills, we need to be taught how to apply in industry.",

I had one colleague in each of my MS and PhD programs who sought out internship programs in the hopes of making connections and gaining industry experience. In the MS program, we were paid so little and they weren't going to kick the person out of the program, so she simply rejected a summer RA position and went to do the internship instead. However, in the PhD program, they were simply told no despite how many different combinations of extra service, expedited research chapter/publication production was negotiated or offered. \n\nIf students are simply barred from doing internships and making non-academic connections, it makes it very difficult to succeed. However, I understand the hesitancy to grant said internship given that the PI required research output from said grad student for their personal work. Somewhat of a Catch-22, though I still think that there should be greater leniency on the grad student who holds absolutely no power and has horrible job prospects to look forward to.",

There's also the fact that, to take climate change as an example, researching climate change is an immensely important aspect of it, but mainstreaming climate change considerations into how we run our societies implies jobs that, in their day to day, have little to nothing to do with actively doing science. The people filling those jobs should have a background in climate science, but it would be a waste for them to spend 4 years in a wetlab when they need skills that are better conferred in a social science or humanities department.",

The funding agencies (primarily NSF, NIH, but also DOE, DOD, etc) are basically the ones that determine it, and that's based on how much money they're given by the federal government...  But the academic job market can't grow indefinitely and faculty turnover is greatly outpaced by the rate at which students graduate.

In something like data science, even 5 years ago it was feasible for anyone with some in-depth statistics background to get a job because there were barely any data science programs and the quality of their graduates was unknown, and therefore those were the candidates that were available to employers. Now that data science has become institutionalized, you'd find yourself competing against people who have spent years building their career specifically in data science, so of course it's going to be harder to compete. \n\nTo take an older field like finance, there are still certain quant positions that are well-suited for theoretical physicists and other pure mathematicians, e.g. in high-frequency trading shops. A typical setup is having a team of operations researchers doing the modeling in something like R or Matlab, and a separate team of programmers transcribing the models into whatever is the newly fastest programming language. The drawback is, of course, that you don't need a PhD to do this work. idk about wetlab disciplines, but in mathematical sciences, I think even employers are increasingly aware that, while you need to understand the techniques in-depth and understand the theory behind them, the years you spend writing a dissertation are wasted.

For example, the National Council for Science and the Environment has been lobbying for 20+ years for increases in NSF funding, support for things like NREL, applied research, and investments in energy/climate related work. There are many, many other organizations doing similar work.\n\nThe problem is that 1) half or more of the Congress are now actively anti-science and opposed to government investment in almost anything that isn't defense-related, 2) that same half is also mostly opposed to higher education, and 3) overall public support for research and teaching reflects (or drives) those divisions. So we aren't going to see any sort of moonshot style investments in science, research, or higher ed probably ever again.\n\nThere's also a major problem in academia, often labeled as the \"neoliberal business models of university administration.\" Whatever you call it, the basic premise is to run higher ed like a business, to wring profit from all operations and cut costs just like they would at GE or WalMart. This is one of the drivers for admin inflation-- the ranks of VPs and directors and other managers which have proliferated over the last 20 years while faculty lines have been cut. Since labor is the largest cost in running most universities, that's where the cuts have been made--- contingent labor has replaced tenure-track faculty virtually everywhere and those who remain are of course \"doing more with less\" each year.  Exceptions for a few elite institutions of course, but for most of us that's the drill.\n\nNone of this is going to change without a major political/cultural shift in the US. 25 years ago I thought climate change might drive that, but instead we've actually gone in the opposite direction due to our toxic politics.",

Lots of big corporations look the same in an org chart (look at Best Buy, Target, WalMart, etc.) but the difference is they usually expect some benefit from those execs, whereas we seem to create new VPs and even full departments either as a way to signal we're taking some concern seriously (while pushing it off to the side, like sustainability) or in the worse cases to reward someone who \"needs\" a bigger title.

However, this is a local issue of funding and faculty do not have decision powers at a university.  We can advocate, but ultimately, some Dean, VP/Provost, or President/Chancellor makes those calls whether to hire an assistant VP of donor outreach or an assistant professor of chemistry.  \n\nAll academic research societies I am aware of that have sufficient membership/funds attempt to lobby the federal government for increased funding for research grants.  If universities see an opportunity to make more grant dollars they will invest more in STEM faculty and labs (eg. if a professor gets a $1 million grant, the university gets a check for over $1.5 and gets to keep the difference).\n\nBut, as others have said, being a professor is not the only pathway for PhDs in STEM.  Many other posts have mentioned industry R&D.  In addition, there are government lab (DoE national labs, NASA, NIH intramural, DOD, CDC, VA, etc.). There are also non-profit research institutions (Woods Hole, Allen Institute, SRI, etc.).  There is also need for science adjacent positions, working in policy and oversight at both the local level (ie, at universities), state, and national level.  You also have industry jobs that are not directly R&D.  One of my former students sells research equipment.  When I was a post-doc, I was recruited for a job that would have me traveling to meet with faculty to get them excited about and help facilitate them writing research grants to a company (plus do expert testimony for government and regulatory agencies).  \n\nMy point being, there are lots of opportunities for scientists outside of academia so it is not dishonest for faculty to promote others going into STEM.  Unemployment for PhDs is something like 1-2%.  They find jobs.  \n\nAll that being said, outside of a few disciplines, we do not have near the shortage of STEM majors some policy makers (and industry that wants to drive down labor costs) would have you believe.",

Therefore, encouraging kids to become scientists is, in itself, harmless, and possibly helpful. If some kid hates STEM, then no problem. However, if some other kids are intrigued, or didn't know what it means to be a scientist, such campaigns might open their eyes. Perhaps later on they will realize a PhD is not for them, fine -- what happened, maybe they studied some science and math? Could be worse.\n\nYour second paragraph is related to the first. Don't you see?",

You must become part of a large-scale organization that will validate your publications. You must publish (and frequently) to be considered \u201ctop tier\u201d. In order to receive grant money you must prove that you can publish (read as: \u201chave already published\u201d), have a plan to publish, and be part of an accredited institution to receive greater consideration.\n\nAcademia has, for some time now, insisted on creating a large number of \u201cresearchers\u201d and then taking the best ones. Along with the requirements to be part of such an institution for both grant money and publications, has created a viscous cycle that only benefits a relative few.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t a large amount of money available for research - the United States alone gives hundreds of millions of dollars to the NSF and the NIH every year to encourage scientific advances. The problem is distribution and the perception of what is considered \u201cvalid science\u201d. Attention mostly goes towards expensive\u201chigh profile\u201d projects at big institutions. After that, the general rule of thumb is that the institution at/through which the research is being conducted then takes half of the grant money for administrative purposes. This is not to minimize the cost an institution bears for providing \u201cvalidation\u201d and for housing the research, but these costs often seem arbitrary percentages rather than flat rates. The irony is that academia has created scientists to obtain grant money and then reaps most of the benefits, leaving a large number of scientists out to dry.\n\nGood science has been, is, and should be based on good procedure, data collection, and transparent analysis. Unfortunately, science conducted by individuals or independent groups is very difficult without private funding that often leads to questions about the findings. It\u2019s the worst kind of catch-22.",

      "text": "Reminds me of this article: [How Academia Resembles a Drug Gang](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/12/11/how-academia-resembles-a-drug-gang/)\n\n> Drawing on data from the US, Germany and the UK, Alexandre Afonso looks at how the academic job market is structured in many respects like a drug gang, with an expanding mass of outsiders and a shrinking core of insiders. (...)  \n Academic systems more or less everywhere rely at least to some extent on the existence of a supply of \u201coutsiders\u201d ready to forgo wages and employment security in exchange for the prospect of uncertain security, prestige, freedom and reasonably high salaries that tenured positions entail.\n\nSo for your actual question: It seems to be complicated. Most PIs I ever talked to expressed that they would love to have more permanent staff. Whenever a trainee leaves, a lab is at risk of loosing knowledge, so some kind of data manager or staff scientist is something most PIs would like to have.  \nBut the whole academic funding scheme is based on projects and even funding from University is often build on the idea that hiring absolute experts for each project is better than keeping all-rounders who might be less qualified for specific projects. Why keep the same guy for 12 years when you can just cherry pick an absolute expert with up-to-date knowledge for each project? In many ways, academia is more like a consulting firm, you lend your knowledge to labs for a couple of years and move on once you are no longer needed.  \nNow how much do PIs do to change that? I actually never saw much effort in that direction. PIs create new temporary positions through their grants and if they have some kind of evaluation to pass I sometimes heard that they use that leverage to get another permanent position from University but the actual push to change the systems isn't really there. Even in Germany, where [74% of people have temporary contracts (\"befristet\") and positions between PhD and PI aren't really existing](http://ngawiss.uber.space/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Befristung-im-Vergleich.png) it feels like some outliers try to change that but most just shrug and say \"it is what it is\".",

      "text": "You are forgetting the main piece of this puzzle: funding for these jobs comes primarily from the government. The US President sets the annual budget for all federal agencies - including NIH and NSF. At the state level, your state governor and legislators set the budgets for state universities. \n\nIf Americans vote for smaller government and lower taxes, then academic opportunities (including funding for grad students and post-docs) dry up.\n\nThe solution isn\u2019t for academics to reach out to politicians. The solution is for you to vote for politicians who support state universities and STEM funding.",
