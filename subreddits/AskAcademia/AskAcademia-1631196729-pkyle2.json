  "text": "Updated: \n\nThis thread is entirely filled with people who are ableist because it assumes people can use any random chair in the world. \n\nI have cancer and I have to have surgery. I will be recovering from said surgery. I cannot use any random conference chair or hallway chair for a long period of time. \n\nTo clarify, I am using my own startup budget to order the damn chair and the fact that I am receiving comments like this on Reddit for wanting to order a freaking $100 desk chair volumes about the state of academia. \n\nThe post was never *actually* about the desk chair.\n\nThere are people who just need very basic workplace accommodations, that doesn\u2019t mean they are entitled.",

      "text": "Maybe it depends on the institution, but this sounds exactly like my experience and everyone else in my universities experience (pre-COVID). My office and lab were both unusable (full of asbestos floor tiles that were partially damaged, a non-functioning fume hood, someones sample collection, a leaking sink, etc) when I arrived. My spaces were not prepared until 1.5 years after my arrival (it took 6 months for facilities to schedule me an appointment to talk to me to *start* the bid process), my furniture wasn't procured for another 6 months, so I didn't really \"move in\" to my office until 2 years after the start of my position (so I spent the first 2 years in some random space filled with weird objects collected over the career of an emeritus faculty member who never bothered to clean out his junk). No one asked (and there appeared to be no way) for me to order anything in advance, so my computers didn't show up till about 2-3 months in to my work. There was no training on how to do anything, I basically just showed up at the doorsteps of colleagues like \"Hi, can you explain the procurement/travel/grant management/etc system to me?\" I got one day of training from HR on benefit elections, etc, but nothing about the grant submission system, the payroll system, or really anything else. My startup account is constantly being shifted so the account numbers change, so half the time when I submit a purchase order it gets bounced back because that account number no longer works. So, I guess welcome to academia?\n\nEDIT: Oh, and since desk chairs were mentioned, I had to find a desk chair myself. There was a random semi-functional one in a hallway for a few days, I just stole it when I figured it was just waiting to be surplussed. It was ungodly uncomfortable and I relished putting it back in the hallway 2 years later when my furniture was finally delivered. The chair was gone two days later, the circle of life continues.\n\nEDIT 2: 5 years in I still don't have a whiteboard, because my attempts to order one keeping being declined because it's somehow suppose to be routed through facilities and purchasing, but nobody will tell me how.",

Everyone complained about the building and facilities services when I interviewed so I knew it was going to be a problem, but after 5 years on the market, 100+ apps, and 13 on campus interviews, a job was a job even if it was in a decaying building. Plus I was told we were going to get a new building in 10 years. Little did I know that the new building has been 10 years away for 30+ years.",

We give you a desk, perhaps an office, and then we wait to see what you need. We give you some start up money but we want to see if you're actually going to show up. Why? Because we've had people accept and then never show up, taking another position at another university they didn't tell us about until the semester started.\n\nAnd, you get to pick stuff out, your computer, for example, and office supplies, and stuff for your lab, and even if you give us a list we may not order because, again, you might not show up.\n\nAnd then, you'll be gone in the spring because your first choice called and their #1 person didn't show so now know your top of their list and can you teach remotely until you can be here in person?\n\nAcademia is nothing like you think it is.

I work at a regional uni which ends up being a stepping stone for new PhDs back to R-1s.\n\nI get fresh PhDs right out of a PhD or postDoc and the funny thing is, they know their stuff but they don't know how academia actually works and are completely unprepared for all the other stuff.\n\nI know you never said anything about a PhD being training however you will be surprised how many new faculty think a PhD is training for academia. Having sat across the table from so many I am simply speaking to you from my experience.\n\nAs for the unprofessionalness, look, people have to do what is best for them and I don't begrudge people for acting in their own interest. If your first choice is Yale and Buckeye State University offers you a job, you might jump on that. And the Yale calls July 28th and says, \"Hey, our candidate took a job at Michigan, can you start this fall?\" I would not think less of you if you jumped. This has happened to my department 3xs. It is what it is.\n\nI lost 50% of my department in 3 years due to this. Half my department turned over. Part was the university, part was state politics and how they sort of hate higher ed.\n\nI don't know you so I am not being critical of you. I am simply relating my experience. And because I network with others in my state, it is a pretty consistent experience, in all fairness.\n\nThere is a lot which happens off-stage, as I tell my classes, and potential and new faculty.",

The biggest mistake new faculty make is pushing and saying things like, \"Well, at Harvard / Cornell / Yale / Duke we had ______ and I don't understand why ...\"\n\nI work at a regional uni and have work at several community colleges and the one thing that will set people on edge is making statements like that at a regional uni or a non-R1 uni.\n\nMake sure to get a feel for the temperature of the room before saying things. Your best friend is the department administrative assistant. Period. Your next friend is any lab manager. Those are the folks who will give you insight into the local politics. Leave your peer faculty for last. Be nice, of course, conversational, listen. But the hourly folks handle stuff, and the non-faculty people who are admin but who may also teach are going to be your allies.\n\nGood luck to you and I hope you have a rewarding experience.",

I was the first TT prof hired in my dept in >7 years, and it seemed like they just didn't know what to do with me (we've had 5 hired since me so I was at the beginning of a ramp-up in hiring).\n\nBUT - our department support staff were AMAZING. They would help me with anything I needed, and still do. One of them even found money to pay for office furniture for me so I wouldn't have to touch my startup, going against what the dept head said. I would be really worried about a dept where staff are so unhappy / poorly treated. Everything you do depends on them, even after you get used to how things work. Also why is the dept head not helping you interface with them? It's also a big red flag to me if dept head is not willing to insert themselves into this situation and help you. I'd contact Dean in this situation, to be honest.",

              "text": "For whatever it is worth, it is my experience that all universities and departments largely retain this kind of information as tacit knowledge, because their systems are often changing and nobody has ever tried to write it all down. To learn how to do this stuff, you need to figure out who knows how to do it (probably the support staff in the main office), and ask them nicely, and they'll explain it. Because it's the kind of thing that not only varies from institution to institution and department to department, but varies over time (here, the answer would be different 4 years ago versus now). Over time you will pick up a lot of this knowledge yourself and if you are proactive and kind you will endeavor to share it with the junior faculty.\n\nAs TT faculty you've got to be proactive about this sort of stuff. If you don't have a chair you've got to make it happen. They aren't going to try to anticipate your needs for you. The office staff are likely drowning in other tasks and the location of Professor X's ordered laptop is probably low on their awareness and urgency unless you become a polite-but-squeaky wheel.\n\nI wouldn't take any of this _personally_. It is entirely its lack of personal attention and specificity that defines it.",

Generally speaking we usually round up students to help them unload their moving truck and host a welcome dinner for them as soon as they are ready for one. Then I personally meet them on campus for a tour, then take them to HR and security for an ID, etc.  We go to their office with our department coordinator to see if they  need anything from chalk to a new desk, then make that happen.  Then once the semester starts we will host some sort of \"get to know our new colleague\" thing for faculty from other departments, i.e. wine and cheese or whatever on a Friday afternoon. My wife and I always invite our new colleagues and their families/SOs over for dinner early on as well. If they need/want it we'll help them find a realtor, talk about schools, places to eat, things to do, etc in the process.\n\nSimply ignoring someone's arrival on campus would never happen at my school. Beyond the departmental stuff there is always a formal new faculty orientation (two days) in the fall and they are all introduced to the entire faculty at the fall workshop.",

In my department they didn't even give me a computer or an office. I was told to hold office hours in the department lounge or the coffee house across the street and to work at home or again, at the coffee house. (Now, eventually, an emeritus professor-- who had an enormous office, a former classroom-- offered to share with me, so that was a BIG plus in my book.) I was told to give students my home phone and the department number if they wished to reach me.\n\nBut, most important, I had no idea that I could apply for things like U money to help start my research, or even that I could apply for TA's to help me teach. Now, eventually I learned much of this stuff, but my first year was pure torture (at a Big 10 school, the state flagship, and at the time the best funded state school).\n\nAnyway, YEs, this sucks. But a lot of people have gone through something similar and it is not uncommon, though perhaps not usual either. Judging from the experience of my students who have gone on to academic positions, I'd guestimate that this is the case in about a third of prestigious R-1's but less common at U's that emphasize teaching or are lower ranked on the research quality/emphasis spectrum\n\nMostly, and finally, let me suggest that at your U it probably is just \"the way things are done\" and you should not consider it as something personal or a statement on your research (or teaching) quality. Just as some schools suck in the ways they treat students, some schools suck in how they treat new faculty,",

      "text": "When I started my job in industry, I had a similar experience - I had to wait a bit to get monitors for my computer, all the emails I got listed the wrong manager, my relocation benefits were delayed and I had to send several emails to chase it down, etc. I've been here six years and I *love* it here.\n\nI hire people now, and I'll say it's completely normal at my company for people not to have a PC or some furniture on the first day. The weeks leading up to a new hire's arrival are pretty chaotic, especially since you are beginning at the open of the academic year. We're also in the middle of a global pandemic; there's a shortage of the silicon chips needed to make...everything...so all kinds of electronics are delayed or on backorder. I had to ask a new hire to use their personal laptop for a while until we could get their computer shipped to them. HR is trying to keep up with constantly changing information related to the pandemic and workplace policies.  \n\nI'd give them a couple of weeks to get their shit together. This time is going to be a blip in your long experience at this particularly university. If people are flippant and don't seem to care that's another issue, but if people are genuinely trying to help and are mortified that this is happening, I'd give them a bit of grace for not having their shit 100% together in the middle of a global emergency.",

Because unless they did, you're making an assumption about their intentions.\n\nI hate to be blunt, but in my job I have so many things to do that checking on someone's laptop is literally at the bottom of the list, especially since we have so many ways to ensure they have access to resources if their laptop isn't here on time. It doesn't mean that I don't care about them as a person - in fact, I'm usually spending most of my time and energy on *other* things that do matter more, like making sure they have an office, that they're showing up in our system correctly, that I have a training plan lined up for them, etc.\n\nWhat people are trying to tell you is not everything is going to be perfectly lined up at first. If you start out bitter and resentful about relatively normal chaos, that's going to carry through the rest of your year and perhaps later into your career. Again, it's different if absolutely no one is trying to help you or seems to even care, but if you are asking and mostly getting what you need once you remind people, I would at least *try* to assume good intentions first - or, at best, sit down with the chair or a trusted other in the department and tell them how you feel.\n\nAlso, some HR departments just suck, but don't blame that on the department. They have no control over that.",

I've lived it, as have many others in this sub! - but it's not an out of the ordinary one. There's not much else you can do besides talk to your chair, HR, an admin, and/or the dean...or perhaps order your own equipment and pay for it yourself, or get reimbursement.

Just work through the issues. Hopefully, it will improve for you. I expect there is information on the HR webpage detailing much of the information you need, but Adm staff will likely be the most helpful rather than other faculty.",

This isn\u2019t negotiable once I\u2019m already here or else I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. I was diagnosed with cancer. Would have never moved here if I had known. \n\nI am not entitled. I am simply asking for answers to things that I agreed to as part of my contract. I have not been rude to my colleagues or anyone else. I need a laptop to be able to teach my courses and do my work. \n\nYou are gaslighting me about being a human in a position where I am asking for basic affordances in my workplace.
