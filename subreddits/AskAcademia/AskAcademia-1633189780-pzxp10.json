  "text": "I'm a PhD student going into my second year. \n\nI spent my first year working alone at home thanks to the pandemic. I received an email from my supervision team to say that campus is reopening and they sent me a seating plan of the assigned desks for PhD students.\n\nIt just so happens that one of them shared a course with my last year so I kind of know them by face and name. Should I shoot them a message on Facebook and introduce myself as a \"way into\" the PhD office social circle?\n\nI'm feeling a bit lost and disconnected",

      "text": "It's normal to make friends with people who share your classes, so sure, do it!\n\nIt would be a bit more organic if you waited until you saw them in person, but no one I know would really hold it against you for doing this virtually. Just explain that you're feeling apprehensive about being around so many new people, and are excited to see a familiar name. Maybe you two can plan to study together or something.",

      "text": "I'm in my department's mentoring program. A lot of students feel disconnected due to pandemic and the lack of the usual events. You might benefit from joining a peer mentorship group, your department's social group, other campus groups, etc. to get access to free food at least! \n\n(I notice you are also looking for a desk space. Making acquaintance with a lot of other young PhD students is a good way to ask how other people are getting desks / if a lab has extra desks.)",
