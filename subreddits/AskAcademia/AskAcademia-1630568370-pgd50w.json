  "text": "Hi friends, I have been asked to consider the position of an RA at a different lab than my PhD (part-time). I wanted to know if any of you have done anything similar and your experiences? I am keen to take on the position as it would add to my skill set and look great on the CV. But at the same time don't want to bite off more than I can chew. \n\nTips, tricks, advice welcome \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "I've been working part-time ever since I started my PhD - that's been my main source of income. It's doable, but you should be aware that your PhD project will suffer occasionally and will take longer than if you were to work on it full time; you will sometimes only have time to work on your PhD during the weekend, for example.\n\nIn any case, first check if your PhD advisors are OK with this; they will very likely expect you to focus on your PhD full time! If, however, you decide to take the job, my main advice would be to set very clear boundaries: since this is a part-time job, make sure to only work part-time and not more than that. For me, this has sometimes been a problem - because of an important work deadline, I would have to put in many more hours, which means I wouldn't be working on my PhD during that time and would have to compensate later.",

      "text": "As a PhD student,  i wouldn't have been able to do it. I was overwhelmed with what i had. Nobody in my program has ever done that. Too demanding. Now, as a PI, i wouldn't allow any of my PhD students to take employment at s different lab, even if part time. Here's why: as a PhD student in the states you have a teaching assistant appointment and a research appointment, each making up half of your contract,  which amounts to 40 hours a week. Additionally, you may pick up a few extra hours at the lab for dinner extra cash every semester, but nothing major. If you also take a job elsewhere, you won't be able to focus and generate what I'm paying you for. Since half of your salary comes from my grants, i must ensure you can give me everything. That's why i pay well at my lab. No part time gigs elsewhere",
