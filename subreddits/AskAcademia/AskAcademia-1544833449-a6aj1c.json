  "title:": "Passed my thesis defense today. Confused by my reaction post-defense.",
  "text": "After countless edits, highs and lows, feelings of hopelessness and feeling like I would never see the light at the end of the tunnel, I passed my defense today. \n\nMy committee was, as expected, very critical. I felt myself stumbling for words at times. I thought they wouldn\u2019t pass me. At the end of the defense, one of them said, LethargicMagician, you have been a valuable member of our department and teaching program. You are a hard worker and you deserve to finish your degree. Congratulations. \n\nMy first reaction was to ugly cry. I felt so overwhelmed with relief, joy, and even some inexplicable sadness (thanks, Imposter Complex). When I walked out of the room and over to my mother, I felt drunkish and hazy and at a complete loss for words. About two hours later, it hasn\u2019t really hit me yet. I think everything I went through to get it done drained any other reaction out of me. \n\nBut, I officially hold a master\u2019s degree in philosophy. After work, I\u2019m going to drink a nice, cold, Guinness. \n\nDid anytime else have a similar reaction post defense? ",

      "text": "This wasn't during my final defence (which was pretty easy), but my comprehensive exam from my PhD was brutal. It was 4 days of written exams (9-6pm everyday) followed by an oral exam that could be on any topic in my field. After 4 days of written exams, I was seriously fitigued, and half way into a 3 hour oral exam I started hallucinating and had a sort of 'out of body' experience. I was speaking, giving them a response to something, and my mind started wondering - I was thinking about food, and I sort of \"floated up\" and saw myself speaking - but I wasn't in control. It was a complete disassociated moment. Never experienced anything like it before or after. \n\n ",

Even a year and a half later, I still feel a strong sense of gratitude evey Saturday morning that I don't need to get up and work on my thesis! I did mine while working full time and it was tough. ",

(Also Australia, almost 10 years ago.) these days I\u2019m a bit annoyed I didn\u2019t get a defence - I would have liked the closure, and one of my markers just didn\u2019t get what I was doing, so I would have liked to confront them rather than writing a series of \u201cthis will not be addressed for these reasons\u201d responses!

This accomplishment is unlike any other in good and bad ways. \n\nYour feelings are what I experienced with the master\u2019s and doctorate, and I\u2019d venture to say it is a pretty typical reaction for most people after those projects and processes have dictated your life. Perhaps the stranger feeling for me, though, was the anticlimax of having the PhD in hand, yet not hearing the angelic choir sing nor seeing the heavens part to reveal some greater truth or present me with a magic lightening bolt.  I was certain there would be some sort of immediate and recognizable change in my life, but it was more like a gradual shaking off of guilt for not working on the document and foreign realization that I was able to make my own choices.  It will sink in, but slowly. ",

The substitutes were well versed in the subject of my thesis (and one of them actually helped me with my statistics) but neither of them had actually read the thesis. They asked weird questions that didn't really seem appropriate to which I had to say \"I don't know\" a number of times. I passed and my advisor (who I really didn't get along with) hugged me saying \"I know this is weird, but my advisor hugged me too and it was weird, so here you go.\" I got an email from one the committee members who was absent congratulating me for finishing. He also said \"I heard you were excellent in your orals.\" So, yeah, it was a weird whirlwind for me too. It feels like they put you through the wringer the whole time you're in the program and then on the other side they're so happy you've finished. It took a while for it to sink in, but by that time I was already starting PhD work and it wore off quickly. Yeah, finishing is definitely a strange feeling.",
