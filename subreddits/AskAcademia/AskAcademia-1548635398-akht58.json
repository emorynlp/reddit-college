  "title:": "How do you keep your motivation & energy levels up as a PhD student? What keeps you going?",
  "text": "Quick backstory: I'm a first year PhD student in STEM, and have just joined a new (and very successful) lab after a semester of rotations. My first semester was by no means exhausting, but I came into this program with burnout, and have had no time to recover. I earned my B.S. and M.S. while working full-time, worked overnights in a factory on breaks to support myself.... now that I'm actually here in a PhD program, I feel like I have little left to give in terms of effort. \n\nSo what keeps your energy levels up? What motivates you to pursue a degree or career that requires so much hard work? \n\nI used to always set achievable short-term goals, but I feel like my PhD program (like many others) is really about accomplishing things in the long term. I'd be interested to know what works (or what hasn't worked) for any of my fellow grad students. Thanks! ",

You don\u2019t have to love the experiments or the reading, you just have to do those things to keep moving forward. But you should like to be curious and just really want to know what\u2019s next. What\u2019s going on with the protein you\u2019re looking at? What\u2019s the next possible thing it could be doing in the cell? What\u2019s your model? They\u2019ve just told me to driven like you\u2019re a detective seeking answers. You want to know answers. The reading and experiments get you there but you need the mental drive to want to know answers.\n\nI\u2019ve also had other people just say that they love having their own project. They love that they decide what happens next, where the project goes, etc.\n\nSorry this is long winded, I just understand where you\u2019re coming from. It seems like there\u2019s no light at the end of the tunnel this early in the program sometimes. Especially on the bad days.",

Big picture that can help, but maintaining a healthy life and being productive many times needs more than that.",

      "text": "I'm also a first year PhD student with a b.s. and m.s. with no break in between. I've been viewing a PhD as a culmination of medium term goals (complete your courses, pass your QEs, publish, write dissertation) that can be further broken down into shorter goals (study, read, lab work, write). To accomplish those short-term goals, I reserve about 9 hours/day during the weekday to on-campus work; once I leave for the day I do not think about my work so I don't experience burnout. On weekends I keep Saturday for hobbies while Sunday is chores, shopping, and some light, at-home coursework/research. \n\nSo, instead of motivating myself to work, I have disciplined myself to work. Keeping a consistent schedule helps me maintain a disciplined, consistent workload without experiencing burnout. The key is to do extra work (the work without due dates) when you have free time on-campus. Sure, on rare occasions I have to work more than my allotted time, but that's okay; I still reward myself after accomplishing those tasks.\n\nHope this helped.",

      "text": "Recent chemistry phd graduate (now postdoc). I was fortunate to work in a less demanding group and division (computation and theory). What I will say is, if it's possible, leave one full day a week for just you.  Whatever you do, make sure it's just for you enjoy and to decompress. I stayed home and played video games/hung out with my neighbors. \n\nMy other advice is make sure you have friends both in your lab, in your department and outside of the university. Take some time to hang out with your lab mates and have the camaraderie (and to complain with). Have your department friends to hear other stories and to talk to about your experience (and to complain with). And have those friends well outside of your university so that you can experience what the rest of the world is like (and to also complain too; if you can't tell you will complain a lot about a lot of things, just make sure you have the right people to complain too).\n\nLastly: exercise. You would be surprised how some physical activity will improve your mood and overall energy. Try to hit up the gym or go for a jog.\n\nYour first year can be really daunting, especially looking out for the next few years. Just stay grounded and you'll come out relatively sane ;-)",

      "text": "Hi, I don't necessarily motivate myself by keeping in mind my long term goals. Obviously, I have some long term goals but I find it more effective to focus on short term goals. To make sure to be constantly productive, I try to work on three to four different tasks per day that all relate to my research, and I spend 1.5-2 hours on each task. These tasks include working on different articles, doing coursework, applying to scholarships, working on conferences. With that process I end the day with the feeling that I've really moved forward in different aspects of my research. I also start the day with the most daunting task. \nI also live with a chronic illness and that way of working has helped me tremendously because it ensures that all aspects of my work progress even if I have flares up and stuff like that. It's more rewarding for me to see how much I can accomplish in a day rather than stressing about the future. At last, I've recently downloaded an app that's called Forest and it basically blocks you from using your phone or certain websites on your computer for a set amount of time. This also really helps for productivity.\n\nEdit : someone said to eat candy to feel better. Of course, it's fine once in a while, but I think that it's important that you eat very very well to maintain your health and energy levels. I eat organ meats (very rich in vitamins and minerals) and nutrient dense foods (with fats) so that I don't feel like I'm craving all sorts of foods while working. Cravings and blood sugar variations car really hinder your focus.\n\nPhysical exercise also helps. I cannot do lots of physical exercise due to my health but I've learnt to appreciate the benefits of a simple 15 minute walk for example. It really makes a difference.",

      "text": "I had a lot of trouble with this throughout my PhD and I still struggle to stay motivated as a postdoc. I love my field as much as anyone but that alone doesn't really help for me. If anything, I'd use it as an excuse to waste time because I'd read papers completely unrelated to my work to avoid having to deal with struggling through actually accomplishing something. Of course reading papers is an important part of academic work but not when you have a week left to submit job applications and haven't finished your research proposal...\n\nWhat works to motivate me is the feeling of small accomplishments along the way. Like you said, this whole career is based on long term goals so its easy to get overwhelmed and feel like you aren't accomplishing anything. At least for me, it really helps to reflect on what I have accomplished recently, even if its just writing an abstract, reading a paper I'm supposed to be refereeing, or editing 1 page of a manuscript. The momentum built from these small things really builds up. \n\nAlso you might want to consider taking some time off if that's an option in your program and given your personal situation. I didn't work full time during college so I didn't have it as bad, but I also felt extremely burnt out before my PhD. I took a year off  in between where I tutored to make a living and it really helped when I finally started my PhD. ",

I did service but once I served on a grad committee for a year and organized a few outreach events I turned down almost every request to do service. Service is NOT necessary as a grad student. Service IS beneficial as a grad student. Too much service is a death sentence for a grad student (IMO because your long term goals should be beyond your current department).\n\n3.

It eliminates major commutes (assuming your campus(es) aren't too large), and many student-oriented jobs work around busy class schedules. I worked as a GA, TA, RA, etc... and as a pharmacy tech... which in your case would give you tangible patient contact hours for med school. ",

You're either listening to it and not studying or studying and not listening to it. The former is bad because you're not studying, and the latter it's just blocking out distraction and white/pink noise does that job better.",

The timer app Forest also gives you rainforest sounds. \nI've used these instead of study music throughout undergrad, they are much less distracting and also have a calming effect (at least on me).",
