  "text": "I'm a Masters (Physics) student from India and I am looking to apply to the UK and Europe for a PhD for Autumn 2022. I am making a list of people I would like to work under. In doing so I have a few questions. I am set to graduate from my Masters in April 2022 and will have a thesis dissertation by then (which I have just begun work on). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Approximately at what point should I start emailing them to see if they'd be interested in considering my application (interview/submitting grades, transcripts etc). I would like to have at least my grades for this semester with me - which I will receive around early December. Would that be too late? I have seen a few funding deadlines in the UK around January. \n2. If I am emailing professors, do I need to include all my details (scores, SOP and so on) in the initial mail itself, or can I just send an inquiry, with my CV and maybe mentioning a one or two of their papers which interests me.",

      "text": "I think you should start emailing now so that you would submit your applications by December/January. Also its good to apply as early as possible as some universities have earlier deadlines for scholarships/studentships/funding etc. I dont think you'll have to wait till you get your semester grades. You could apply with your current grades and submit your other grades when you receive them. You would probably be given a conditional offer in that case.",

          "text": "The reason I'm apprehensive about doing that is because my second semester grades are quite bad (I'm in my third semester now). I've had a very good academic record throughout my Bachelor's (9+ CGPA /10) and in my first semester of the Masters was also good (8.4/10), but thanks to Covid and having to move across the country in the middle of the semester, my second semester did not go well and so my overall CGPA dropped (7.67/10) . I'm confident I will improve by the end of this semester. My Master's is at a much better ranked university (Top 5 in my country) but I am not sure how much this will help offset the drop in grade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it worth the wait?",

I'm not in physics, but am a faculty member at US R1 university and I am constantly getting long emails from international students with details about their school, grades, rankings, etc. that don't really give me any useful information. \n\nAt the letter of inquiry stage, all I really want is a CV and a cover email stating your specific research interests and why you think those interests align with the type of work I do. If you look like a good fit and I'm accepting students, I'll encourage you to apply.",

      "text": "Every country is different, but in the UK (where I am now) it's common for potential students to email us through the fall to introduce themselves and discuss projects.  They apply on the timeline as you've indicated (around January).  I think waiting till December is cutting it too close.  The idea is to have these conversations *before* you write your application, which takes some time and effort to do well.  If you only start contacting people a month before the deadline, it gives the impression that you're disorganised and rushing to throw together a sloppy application at the last minute.  It's not the end of the world, but I think you're better off starting now.  \n\nThe \"initial contact\" phase can be relatively informal.  I'd suggest you just start by sending emails which introduce yourself and your qualifications/experience (you can include a CV), describe which project you're interested in and why, and ask if you can discuss (or send questions over) about the project.  Where I work, nearly all the students are funded through a CDT, and as part of their funding application they select a (pre-defined) project written by a particular supervisor.  So if you email me, you should be telling me which of my projects you're interested in and why, and this is explained quite clearly on our website.  It's not a great look for students to contact supervisors asking for information that is extremely easy to find, so I'd suggest you read the sites carefully before initiating contact.\n\nIn some countries, PhDs are not students on a school calendar but are hired as employees who start whenever it suits everyone involved.  So for those places, you just find the advertisements online (or contact the professors) and apply before their closing date.  One example of this is the Netherlands, which conveniently has a [national academic job site](https://www.academictransfer.com/en/) which includes the funded PhD positions.",

Needless to say if you already prove in such a cold call that you are sloppy in researching a subject, and just spam people, you will  not be getting a reply...",

December is way too late to be getting in touch as the applications are VERY specific and we need to make sure you score well in every section.
