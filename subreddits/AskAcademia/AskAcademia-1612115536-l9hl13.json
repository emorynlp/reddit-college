  "title:": "Is it always a no-brainer to send a thank you note after an interview for grad school?",
  "text": "I had a Zoom interview on Friday, and after searching around on this subreddit I noticed some people send follow up thank you emails/cards. My interview was incredibly short, and a bit rushed, but at the end I did thank him verbally for his time and for reaching out/speaking with me (I can't remember my exact wording). But I didn't send a direct thank you email, I guess I felt it would be a bit ass-kissy? But maybe I should have? I'm not sure if this is considered impolite or a no-no to not send anything after an interview.\n\nI have a second interview with a different school this week that I believe is supposed to be with the whole faculty and not just one person, so I'm just trying to prevent any mistakes from happening for next time.\n\nEdit: I sent the email, so I just got to hope for the best. I'm in the US but didn't realize how common this is.",

Students want to get in to some program, but they need to demonstrate that they really want to get in to our program, and that they'd be a good fit. Students are more and more applying to a zillion programs. You need to take the effort to show why this program. \n4) If you are still an undergrad, highly recommend you meet with your university's career counselors. They can help you with all this and interview skills. You might have heard that interviews are just to look for red flags. Not sounding enthusiastic, not sending personalized notes, etc- those are red flags. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but this is the game.",

You said I can repeat things I said in my interview, but is it alright to refer back to my personal statements? \"My work with special needs students that I discussed in my personal statement really showed me teaching was the path for me.\" I'm not sure if it's better too since I know they can be skimmed or if I should stick to the interview only.\n\nI for sure should not mention any shortcomings right? Ex \"despite growing up in a suburban area, I look forward to gaining the skills to teach in an urban environment.\" Basically focus only on positives?\n\nBad or good idea to reference/emphasise the fact I am a first generation student?",

I say this because she seemed really excited during the call, encouraged me to apply early and even offered to waive off my application fees (which seems to be uncommon for international students). I did not send her a 'Thank You' email.\nI wrote up the application in very high hopes, got my recommenders to send in their letters before the early application deadline, and then wrote to her to inform that I had submitted the application. She wrote a very short reply to inform me that she isn't going to hire me.\nI'll never find out the real reason, but some of my friends said that I did not match up her enthusiasm, and that she expected a thank you email.",
