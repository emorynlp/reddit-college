      "text": "We had a really bad case of fabrication in my department back in the 80s, and it\u2019s still discussed with graduate students in our research ethics seminar. Long story incoming:\n\nBasically, a grad student was doing a project examining the constituent minerals of a newly discovered rock formation. His advisor left for some reason halfway through, and he got placed with a new advisor that didn\u2019t really understand the project or the methods he was using, and just let him keep going at it. He ended up claiming he had discovered a several new and unique rare minerals - all of which had never been seen before in the geology community. He named them and everything, published about it, got his degree... his advisor didn\u2019t really know enough about the method to check. \n\nA few years later another professor in the department happens to take a look at the data and realizes these \u2018minerals\u2019 look remarkably similar to some synthetic substances he had created years ago during a collaboration with a material science professor. These substances happened to still be sitting on the shelf in the room where the student had done all of his data collection (the room the machine he was using was in). Professor gets pretty suspicious and brings it to the department head. They decide to invite the student back to \u2018examine\u2019 some new rocks to see if they have his new minerals in them. They stick a camera in the instrument room and run a cable back to a computer in another room to watch what the student does. Every day for the 2 weeks of the student\u2019s visit, they watch him go into the instrument room, lock the door, then sit there and read a book. Didn\u2019t even touch the machine. Didn\u2019t do anything at all! At the end of the two weeks he emails the profs with a dataset very similar to his original one, numbers just barely tweaked. It was blatantly obvious to everyone what was happening. \n\nThe university tells the journal, they get his papers pulled. Profs also write a new paper discrediting his work. They also decide to rescind his degree due to research misconduct. It turns into a protracted legal battle where the student sued the university, claiming that \u2018a degree is like a gift, once you give it you can\u2019t take it back\u2019. He actually won the first case, then it went to appeal and he ending up losing. A dramatic situation all around. Frankly I don\u2019t understand what would drive someone to so blatantly fabricate shit, but oh well. Makes for a crazy story!\n\nEdit to add: you can read the paper discrediting everything here if you are interested: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260079704_New_Data_on_and_Discreditation_of_Texasite_Albrittonite_Cuproartinite_Cuprohydro-magnesite_and_Yttromicrolite_with_Corrected_Data_on_Nickel_Bischofite_Rowlandite_and_Yttrocrasite. Also yes, the student\u2019s last name was Crook. You can\u2019t make this stuff up!",

      "text": "I have a story of temptation that I resisted.  I was in my 8th or 9th year of my PhD and the stupid gizmo I made just wasnt cooperating.  I discovered one night that I could just bump it and it would make a spike like what I was looking for.  Trust me that the urge was VERY strong, but I didnt do it.  I kept grinding and eventually got some legit data.  I am SO glad I didnt do that.  Not that there was ever a real shot of me doing it, it's not in my nature.\n\nAs for the 'why'.  Well, year 9 is bleak.  Youve sunk almost a decade into this stupid thing, you just want out and to make enough money to eat a real meal, maybe spend a holiday with family and you know you dont have a real career as a researcher.  You also dont want to tell everyone in your life that you spent a decade for nothing, just an MA or MS that you could have gotten by year 2.  You also know no one is going to replicate your work, so what's the harm?\n\nWell, I also knew I'd have to live with it forever, and it would undo me if anyone ever found out.  Just not worth it.  So yeah, I got real data, published an OK paper and got out, but I understand the pressures that might tempt someone to actually do it.  I honestly wouldnt judge someone too harshly if they did.  I mean, they should be kicked out of the academic community, but like, I'd kinda understand.  Like how you can understand someone killing a friend for a deep betrayal.  Not something you'd condone, but also not a mystery as to why it went down.",

I did have thoughts late at night that if a bus clipped me it wouldnt be so bad, but it never got dark enough to actually start making plans.  Yes, those 9 years were pure hell.  3 deaths, financial ruin, failed ambitions and a feeling of existential despair I cannot really communicate with words.  But I got through it, and I'm glad I did.  I'm a totally different person than I was when I went into the program.  I wont have a job in an academic institution as a researcher ever, but I also know what I'm made of and what I can withstand and keep on going, so that's something.",

Things snowballed into dozens of papers being retracted, and it seems like the reputation of the person who almost definitely made up data is destroyed. The blog post linked above is how the initial steps of confirming the falsified data were taken, and covers some of the issues of trust and ethics many people witnessing this have had to grapple with. \n\nI think the person pushing for their own papers to be retracted because of bad data shows enormous courage, as well.",

On the upside, at least from what I have seen so far, everyone is being extremely supportive with all of his collaborators, particularly the early-career researchers. None of them were aware of what he was doing, and he cost a lot of people good publications. Still waiting to see his reaction to all of this, given that he has been radio-silent since all of this exploded.",

I'll try to keep this brief.\n\nFamed psychologist Neal Miller and a graduate student, Leo DiCara, published compelling data that autonomic nervous system functioning could be controlled through conditioning. Imagine the implications if you could easily \"train\" an organism to control its heart rate, body temperature, or blood pressure. The studies were expectedly groundbreaking and accelerated DiCara's career to full professor at the University of Michigan in a short amount of time.\n\nIn the mean time, enormous efforts were made to try to replicate the findings, but failed. Even in Miller's own lab, new students failed to observe the original effects, and DiCara---ostensibly busy with his new position---did not offer help. \n\nThey finally got DiCara to sit down and try to replicate the findings one day for just 4 hours, but this too failed. After, DiCara returned home and committed suicide. The events cast a dark cloud on the field of nervous system plasticity and biofeedback. From a [source article](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19771003&id=qOMLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fVgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3449,318952):\n\n>\"Last summer, DiCara ... who in the meantime had gone from post doctoral to assistant professor to associate professor to full professor on the basis of these studies ... went to the shredder and fed into it all of the work he had ever published and he then went home and committed suicide.\"\n\n[Another source](https://www.mail-archive.com/tips@acsun.frostburg.edu/msg29219.html) of discussion that provides some detail.",

I hope that someone takes the initiative to refine or test them again in the future. Unfortunately it probably won't happen for a couple generations because everything he touched is pretty radioactive.\n\nWhich is one of the major problems with how incentives are structured in academia. There is no incentive whatsoever to replicate, and considering null results unpublishable actually can be problematic for some fields where \"why this didn't work\" is as important as \"why this worked.\"",

I heard they had to correct previously published data in the past for that reason, but the P.I. is the department chair. Lol nothing happened.",

The friend let him know and he went and loaded the fish that he forgot and the friend recorded that they had been in the beaker the whole time.\n\nSomeone else overheard the exchange and brought the issue to middle management, who escalated to the bosses. The guy who loaded the fish was fired and the friend was given a week unpaid suspension and no raise that year.\n\nI honestly felt bad for the guy.

Nothing has ever officially been done about it. The PI has at least 6 RO1s that the institution is getting overhead from. The PI is on several co-PI grants with other PIs who are desparate for money and the department doesn't want to lose them. Some of these figures are in at least 1 published paper and several grants that have been funded. There was a lot of other stuff going on (I assume still goes on) that I'm sure IACUC would be very interested to hear about, but I was advised by the administration to keep it to myself.

What's the appropriate punishment for it -- a slap on the hands? termination from your current position? permanent revocation of any opportunity to do academic work (e.g. blacklisting from all journals?). Is it field dependent, e.g. medical research may be held to a higher standard than, say, paleontology? Hypothetically, what are the minimum circumstances under which you'd personally fabricate data? Say someone either willfully or out of willful ignorance partakes in dodgy statistical practice, e.g. failing to report multiple comparisons, or excluding outliers solely for reasons of inconvenience, or whatever. How bad is that compared to wholesale data fabrication?",

If the experiment fails because someone fucked it up mistakenly, well that sucks but such is life.

Smaller proteins get through faster and so you can separate proteins by size. Once the proteins are separated along the gel you can then apply a current to push the proteins onto paper. Then an antibody/antibodies to a specific protein can be used to detect that specified protein or multiple proteins. \n\nThis is a really basic overview so hopefully science reddit doesn't shame me.",

My PI suspected it and eventually verified that this was happening (I think he asked to see the data plotted in multiple different ways or something). This post-doc was fired immediately.\n\nI agree that data fabrication warrants people being fired. Possibly jail time depending on the circumstances. As a scientist, you implicitly agree to be honest with your data reporting (people do mislead and it is very annoying but at least you can not fabricate data flat out). If people just make up data, the whole system breaks down because other scientists depend on other's research. But data fabrication is not only an issue in the sciences. Take the Volkswagen diesel scandel - They made up data about diesel emissions to get around US regulations\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen\\_emissions\\_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal) \n\nTop executives were fired, and should have gone to jail. But unfortunately, I can't find evidence that they served jail time :/",

      "text": "This is sort-of non-academic and non-data fabrication but after many years I can finally do catharsis.\n\nI was RA in a top Latin American school. Our institution had a huge reputation. Huge. Our research Center was founded by some Stanford PhD and works closely with big names in the field. While I was working there, we got a sweet consultancy deal with a foreign government institution that required surveys in low-income areas. I was in charge of the whole data analysis and empirical methods but our small Center did not have the personnel to collect so much data. Thus, we outsource and paid $7k to the largest market intelligence firm in our country.\n\nThat firm is huge. The CEO is a reputed data guru hired by the most important development banks, financial institutions, political parties, journalists. If you want survey data from my country, it is likely that he's behind that. His political comments are considered god's word because he \"knows all the data.\" They have a reputation for predicting elections though I always thought there is something fishy about them: although everyone says they are great predictors, it was easy to see in their reports that they **never** made anything but wishy washy assertions. For example, they wouldn't predict a party to win/lose with x probability, but say that the party \"may win or lose.\" In the same sentence, they would openly say both options. So they never got anything wrong...\n\nBut well, they are the country experts in collecting surveys in low-income areas, we had to hire them. No choice. Otherwise, our contract would be invalid. I  meet with them several times disclosing exactly what we need for our model: age, income, buying patterns, living area or coordinates, time schedules, and more.\n\nA few months later, we got our data. The worse data set I've seen in my life. Only undergrads do similar stuff: age was in pre-made intervals during the questionnaires (useless to model!), instead of actual age; income was also in intervals (useless!), and they did completely faulty questions; location or coordinates was nowhere to be seen. In sum, we did not know if the data was fabricated but there was no way to know if it was or not. There were no statistical weights, so no representativeness, and so many more issues. It was awful and we just did not know how to do a proper model using those variables. 7k lost because the contract our supervisor signed simply did not allow us to demand better quality. We were also under limited time to present our results.\n\nEven if the data was not completely made up, my results were! I had to make the most ridiculous model just to fit that data, using methods that had absolutely nothing to do with our problem. But well, I got paid and the institution that hired us was happy because it was a survey from the reputed data company analyzed by super scholars.",
