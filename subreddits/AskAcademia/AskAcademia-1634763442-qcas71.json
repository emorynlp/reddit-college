  "title:": "Writing a NSF proposal as a postdoc while maintaining maximum ownership of the project",
  "text": "So I recently started my post-doc at a top-lab in the U.S., which I am extremely happy and excited about, but I'm struggling with the tension between working under an advisor while also building my own research portfolio. \n\nI've been nurturing the idea for a project all through my PhD, and my new advisor supports it, and even wants to apply to an NSF grant with the project, due in February 2022. I have a strong sense of ownership with this project, and beyond that, if its funded I want to be able to leverage it into a faculty position. However, per NSF guidelines, post-docs cannot serve as a PI or Co-PI on any grant, and instead are relegated to the \"other personnel\" section. \n\nSo my motivations are to maintain as much ownership of my project as possible, both for personal and professional benefit. With this in mind, the following are potential paths forward:\n\n* Convince my advisor to bump me up to a \"research scientist\" position before February, allowing me apply as a Co-PI. However, if I push too much, I risk damaging my relationship with my advisor, and potentially with other postdocs who have been in the lab longer without such a promotion (it usually comes with a pay raise). It could also be awkward the project is not funded. \n* Wait to see if the project is funded, and if so, negotiate the same \"research scientist\" position, but only *after* my current contract ends in August 2022, and afterwards my advisor should add me as a Co-PI.\n* No negotiation, but make clear in my CV that I was the primary contributor to the grant\n\nI'm new to applying for and navigating grants, so I'd love insights on which of these options might be better career-wise, or if there are other dimensions I hadn't considered.",

      "text": "Not sure how it works in the social sciences, but you generally can't do these kinds of things in practice in the sciences. You can technically be a co-PI if your title changes, but it will weaken the grant because you're an extremely junior co-PI. I believe NSF and most funding agencies usually won't allow addition of a co-PI after the award is made. The PI level grants aren't designed for postdocs. Neither the funding agency or the university wants a postdoc to have ownership of the grant. You should look for mentored grants like the NIH K99 and other K-grants. Other agencies also have mentored transition grants.",

      "text": "I think an open conversation with your PI is in order. You already seem to be taking the view this is going to be a fight and you need to outmanoeuvre your PI yet you also say they're supportive of you. \n\nTalk to your PI about your hopes and also be open to hearing their views. You may not be ready for that post or may need to demonstrate certain things before they can support it or there may be external reasons why they can't. Or they may agree to make you a research scientist if you get the funding and add you as co-PI. If they just shut you down you should ask for feedback on why. You may not change their mind but you might learn something.\n\nRight now you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain so I think going for it and being open and transparent earlier rather than later is in order. Be clear about what it is you want - people often hedge about when asking these things and bosses can easily misunderstand what's being asked for. \n\nLastly, I wouldn't wait until after you've applied because that's going to mean your PI dealing with bureaucracy and they're going to feel like you should have raised it earlier and possibly that you misled them with your intentions.",

I had an incredibly supportive PhD advisor who was really pro-active about doing things in my best interest; the funny thing is that that support left me a bit lost for how to go about having frank/tough discussions. Its a skill I should develop. \n\nAnd your point about not waiting until after submission makes a lot of sense, so I won't even consider that option.",

              "text": "Definitely a direct conversation is in order for your first and second options. Just wanted to add that if those two options don't work out, the third option of adding it to your CV needs to be backed up by your PI in their letter of recommendation. It is a common issue that PhD students or postdocs don't get to be PI even if they contribute significantly to writing the proposal. The hiring committee will rely on your PI's recommendation to judge how much you contributed to the effort rather than just relying on what you say on your CV. Maybe bring this up in your conversation if it looks like the first two options are not feasible.",

However, it\u2019s the institution that stipulates whether postdocs can be PIs, not NSF. Most institutions don\u2019t allow it because \u201cpostdoc\u201d is a temporary position and NSF funding is awarded to the institution, not the PI. So if you are a PI of a grant and you move, the grant will stay at your institution and be given to another PI\u2026 usually. Some institutions will let you negotiate to take the grant with you but it\u2019s not usual and entirely at the discretion of the institution.\n\nI agree with what the other poster said- talk to your PI. If this research idea is really important to you, I\u2019d explore what small part of it could be submitted as a postdoc fellowship project, or else save it till you are a PI.",
