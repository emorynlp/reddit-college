  "text": "I am PhD in life sciences with 2 years postdoctoral experience. Tomorrow I have an interview for project manager position. I have relevant education and experience but no project management (as a job) experience. \nI am looking for any advice as I really am into this job. Also, the interview is online so any tips would also be welcomed on this matter.",

      "text": "Look up STAR technique - Situation, Task, Action, Result. It's a way to frame and structure interview answers. Have some examples of things like:\n\n- managing your time\n- prioritising work with competing deadlines\n- team work\n- managing a difficult situation\n- project you managed to completion\n- managing upward\n- gathering views/engaging stakeholders.\n\nThese don't have to be formal situations, they know you're straight out of PhD. You don't need a different example for every one of these but you do need to be able to produce several different examples. Also have a think about what things you might need to learn in order to the job, and have an answer to why you want the job and where you see yourself in X years time/what do you want to do in future. And then the rubbish question of what weaknesses you have (I personally think this is an utterly shite question because no one half sane answers it truthfully) and slightly less shite, what would your friends/colleagues say are your strengths/weaknesses.",

Don\u2019t know what to get from this",

In the IT department, they may be more likely to hire people who have actual \u201cproject management\u201d credentials, But for other kinds of academic administration, we kind of just want somebody who knows the ropes and can keep a project or initiative progressing.  Being organized, goal oriented, collaborative, and personable is good.\n\nIn a lot of ways, completing a PhD demonstrates you have the first two things on the list.",
