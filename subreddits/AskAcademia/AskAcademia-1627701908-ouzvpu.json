  "title:": "PhD advisor quitting academia when I am getting on the job market. Anything to plan ahead for?",
  "text": "Edit: Thank you so much for the kind and helpful responses. Now I have a better idea about what may happen next. My advisor and I will have further discussions in the next months. I am deleting the post for privacy concerns, but anyone in similar situations should still be able to refer to the suggestions in the comments. I am sad to see a brilliant researcher and mentor leaving the field, but it is probably better for them this way. Shit can happen in life, and self care is very important, whether you are in academia or industry.",

          "text": "I should clarify that there is no guilt tripping. I tried to post as little information as I can (probably will remove the whole post later), so it may not be clear, but they are the best advisor I ever met and they are thinking of my interest. It was just a lot more sh*t in their life than what an Internet post can show. We will figure out a solution together when things are more under control. Don't worry about me, I am okay -- just asking on Reddit to plan ahead for myself and perhaps to vent too. Thank you for the care and concerns though, I appreciate it deeply.",

If you are worried that a different PI might change your project or duties, you should discuss with advisor to ask him to come to a written agreement about your role. He/She will have some say in who will be next PI so should be able to negotiate.\n\nIf your advisor has fame in the field now, it should not be a problem for the rec letter. Also, University can arrange adjunct professor status to allow them to act within university status. You could talk to them about that too.",

          "text": "Thank you very much. I will talk with my advisor to sort things out when their situation gets more manageable. I would not be surprised if there were a fight between multiple involved parties over the grant. Just curious, how is the plan to transfer PI usually negotiated? Is it more common for one of the co-Is take over the grant (so that it transfers to another institution), or for the university to arrange someone internal (previously not on the grant) to take it over within the institution? How much power does the quitting PI/co-Is have on this issue?",

It is less about a specific path being less desirable, but more about a lot of sh*t happening to one person at once, forcing them to change their life trajectory. I guess you may receive more helpful suggestions if you make a separate post about your questions? Good luck with whatever you choose.",
