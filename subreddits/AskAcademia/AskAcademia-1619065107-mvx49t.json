  "title:": "How do I study and retain information from papers and books that I read on my computer?",
  "text": "Sorry for the wordy question, but I'm at my wit's end.\n\nMy go-to method while studying is reading a book, and underlining the important stuff with a pencil. Since I am a Math student, I practice all of the formulae and proofs on a separate rough page that I discard once I understand it. If there is anything that I need to add, I do so in the margins of the book with a pencil. Or in a separate notebook, if the book is a borrowed one.\n\nMy question is, given the sheer necessity of reading so many papers for a single topic, I download them and read them on my computer via Foxit reader. However, for some reason, I find this extremely difficult. I have trouble even going through two pages at a time, and it's even more difficult to retain information as I'm not that comfortable with underlining stuff using those pdf highlighters.\n\nCould anyone just please please suggest some alternative? Distraction is not a problem, it's just the reading and remembering stuff that is. It'll really be helpful since it's undoubtedly more economical to read papers online (like reading 5-6 papers only to prove a single topic)\n\nThank you genuinely in advance!",

You could probably get by with the other memory option (32GB) if you are planning on unloading the pdf's when you're done with a given project, but the 128 would be safer. It will save you a BUNCH of money over the Air or the Pro. Do be sure to back it up; Apple gives you a small amount of free iCloud space (5GB) but it's worth the $0.99 per month for the 50GB option. The iPad 8 uses the first gen of the Apple Pencil while the others use gen 2 of the Apple Pencil. I have both an Apple Pencil as well as a Logitech pencil. If you're just going to use it for the pdf's, then one of the non-Apple alternatives would be fine. If you anticipate doing drawing or other artwork on the iPad then the Apple version is really a lot nicer. If you think you'll be doing a lot of artwork then certainly the iPad Pro is worth considering.",

Zettels unfortunatly felt for me too rigid, but I know people who love this system.\n\nLook for inspiration in Andy's notes, they helped me a  lot.\n\nhttps://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes\n\n\nFor every paper, lecture, anything like that I would write down a whole ,,literature'' note. From it I would write and link seperate ,,evergreen notes'' ideas, and how I view these ideas. So I could understand said topic better as a whole. Of course, you can find your way and find a better solution for yourself.\n\nAlso, I've found that there is no time for every idea, so don't feel bad about keeping literature notes for a while. While revising them, you can link your ideas with literature notes, and after that you can write better little one-idea evergreen notes, to which you will be able to come back anytime and write them better or revise them. Obsidian helps to keep things organized and easy searchable.\n\nI would also suggest look at Linking your thinking channel at youtube, they can help a lot also\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA\n\nPhew, I've wrote a lot, but I hope it helped!

Start can be slow, but its worth it.\n\nThey are evergreen after all, always growing!\n\nAnd most of us, modify our ways of taking notes.

      "text": "A lot of great suggestions for tablets/e-readers. I just want to add the obvious solution is to print out the paper. While some may wince at the environmental impact of this, and while it is true that note-taking on a tablet has a smaller variable carbon footprint than paper, the calculation reverses if you are purchasing a new tablet solely for the purpose of reading papers/taking notes, since the manufacture of a tablet requires substantial emissions ([https://slate.com/technology/2011/09/paper-versus-the-ipad-is-taking-notes-on-a-tablet-computer-or-a-notepad-more-environmentally-responsible.html](https://slate.com/technology/2011/09/paper-versus-the-ipad-is-taking-notes-on-a-tablet-computer-or-a-notepad-more-environmentally-responsible.html)). According to that article, the manufacture of an iPad requires the carbon equivalent of 13,000 sheets of recycled paper.\n\nA lot of the work I do involves complicated mathematical expressions. In my opinion while a tablet is good, there is often nothing that suitably substitutes for printing out the important pages and laying them on my desk, and going through them with a pencil in hand. \n\nIf you do not own a printer, I suggest the Brother HL series for home use. It is very fast and economical.",

I've found the best way to retain information from papers is to write a super quick summary of the paper (the major rationale for why the study was done, what the major results were, how this is relevant to you) right after you read it. Try to do it without actually just copying things from the paper. This will force you to make a quick synthesis of the paper, and, you can build a database of quick little summaries of many papers that are important to you that you can quickly go back to and reference.",

      "text": "Right now I use Notion primarily because of KaTeX support (since I\u2019m a math student as well). This is where I keep an archive of definitions and theorems categorized by subject, chapter and sub-chapter. When I am trying to understand a theorem or topic I always try to type out a proof underneath the statement of the theorem in as much detail as possible in my own words; the key thing is to rephrase and reconstruct the idea, it also helps switch variables, notation or indices so that it is more \u2018unique\u2019 and \u2018yours\u2019 rather than you just retyping what the author wrote. Often I\u2019ll also verbally explain the proof to myself to make sure that I really get it. These are techniques focused in active recall and I didn\u2019t invent it; it forces you to be more aware of the information and to work harder to understand it, which also leads to strong memorization (but that\u2019s not the sole purpose). Sometimes I will also sketch out the proof on my iPad but you should really keep a copy of \u2018your version\u2019 of the proof if you need to reference it later since you literally wrote it and it will more likely than not make more sense to you than the author\u2019s version in my experience. I\u2019d really advise against using highlighting techniques even if you are more comfortable with it as the literature in psychology shows that is not very effective when compared to other techniques; you can find out more about it if you watch the lecture from Marty Lobdell on the topic. I strongly suggest watching the lecture. To summarize everything, what works for me is (1) creating archive of notes that I can reference later, (2) rephrasing and reconstructing proofs myself, and then (3) practicing problems. If you find information still isn\u2019t being retained flashcards with definitions and theorems are also a great idea; and if you want to see a sample of stuff I did Notion lmk and I\u2019ll dm you a link to it.",
