If you're paying for a Ph.D. in a lab science you are definitely doing it wrong. \n\nI only know one person who paid tuition for a PhD that was from a reputable program, but it was 30 years ago and he had very specific reasons for doing it, and reasons it worked out, that don't apply to most people\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  Since this question starts off super-broad, the \"purpose\" of a doctorate is to learn stuff and let other people know you know stuff. Specific kinds of doctorates have other \"specific\" purposes. \n\nPurdue is making a sharp turn towards money-grabs as opposed to actually rigorous and valuable programs since Mitch Daniels took over, so without spending my time looking into this program in detail I'd guess it's probably trash. Most \"professional doctorates\" are considered garbage/resume fluff by people with PhDs unless it's in a program with rigorous external evaluation, like many health-related programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Big assumption that a PhD will be a \"detriment on your mental health\". It can be, but most people get through without thinking it's traumatic. Whether it's \"worth the time\" depends so much on what the degree is in and what you want to do with it that it's pointless to ask without more specifics.",

Is this true?\n\nThe best advice I was ever given as a final year undergraduate student is that if you're good enough to go to graduate school, somebody will pay you to do it. This turns out to be 100% true. \n\nIt's also true that you list not only info on your degrees earned but also info on your funding  history on your CV. So it's not going to be a secret if you paid for a PhD vs. received some sort of scholarship or funding. A funded PhD on your CV will simply carry more weight if it's being read by an academic or anyone with knowledge of academia (it's possible that a non-academic looking at your CV would not grasp these nuances).\n\nI am in a humanities discipline. I can tell you for sure  that any of my current colleagues with permanent jobs who are under the age of 50 or so had funded PhDs (I'm less sure about the 50+ cohort, but it's entirely possible they all did too).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you don\u2019t want to teach for a living, is a PhD worth the time away from your family and the detriment on your mental health?\n\nNot unless you're in a field where industry specifically prizes and rewards PhDs.

      "text": "On the first question, there are a few possibilities. One is that you\u2019re doing this at a school where everyone pays, meaning it\u2019s either very low-ranked or it\u2019s a for-profit place. In either of those cases, yes. Good luck teaching at a university. \n\nAlternatively, you may go to a place where funding is competitive. The department not offering you funding is a signal to you of how they view you. Sometimes you can work your way onto funding if you outperform expectations (I have a student like that). But still, if your department isn\u2019t funding everyone, it\u2019s probably mid-tier at best. And that makes it hard to find a job in academia (at least in my field). I would never advise a student who wanted to go into academia to accept an unfunded offer. \n\nFor your second question, I think it depends. I don\u2019t know anything about the doctor of technology degree you mention. I\u2019d get information about where their students get placed, and ideally talk to someone who\u2019s done it. I have friends who did PhDs and placed in industry. It just means you have greater specialization in your given area. \n\nAs for your final question, this probably depends too. My guess would be that the marginal value of the PhD probably isn\u2019t worth it when you compare it to the Master\u2019s plus the experience you could get during that time. It\u2019s a personal accomplishment, though. So if that\u2019s meaningful to you, then it might be worth it. Personally I didn\u2019t feel like the PhD took time away from my wife (I didn\u2019t have kids at the time) or was detrimental to my mental health. Not everyone feels that way.",

      "text": "1) As others have said, this depends a lot on why you are paying for the PhD. If it's because you are going to a for-profit university or a lower-tier program that doesn't fund its students, then yes, you'd have a hard time finding an academic position (at least on the tenure-track).\n\nIf you're doing it because you lost funding, are in between funding, or have to earn your way into funding - then that's something that I personally  wouldn't advise, but if done at the right university could theoretically keep you competitive. (In practice, I think students who fund their own way are more likely to drop out.)\n\n2) Well, a PhD is a research degree. It's supposed to teach you how to do research in your field of interest, and the foundational content and theoretical knowledge you need to pursue that.\n\nI think a doctoral degree, more generally, is about demonstrating mastery at the highest level in one's (sub)field. I can't answer whether it's worth spending time on the [D.Tech](https://D.Tech) from Purdue, as \"worth\" is going to vary from person to person. However, I will say that I don't think the degree would be regarded as highly as doing a more traditional doctoral program when looking for jobs.\n\n3) PhD holders do more than just teach - in fact, the PhD is a research degree, not a teaching one. I work in industry and a PhD was practically a requirement to get my job; I don't teach.\n\nIf you don't want to go into academia, a PhD is only worth in my opinion if your field has a relatively clear path to other kinds of jobs that require a PhD, or for which a PhD is very useful. For example, if you wanted to work as a researcher at the CDC or SAMHSA or another health agency for the government, having a PhD is a necessity of those jobs even though they are outside academia. Or perhaps you want to go into R&D at a pharmaceutical company or technology company.",

      "text": ">If you have to pay for a PhD, you\u2019re doing it wrong and nobody is going to take it seriously. Good luck teaching at a university. Is this true?\n\nMost strong programs have funding. I think the more important rule is cost-benefit analysis. A Ph.D. program is 5+ years and so to be paying tuition plus not making income is financially difficult. If you are going to make a lot of money with your degree, that could be worth it (see: debt from professional degrees like a medical degree). But usually, a person with a Ph.D. does not make the kind of money to justify the expenses.\n\nNobody will know if you paid tuition for your Ph.D. in all likelihood, and I'm aware of people who did pay tuition and have done well for themselves as professionals in academia and in applied settings.\n\n>What is the purpose of a Doctorate and is it worth studying for? For example, Purdue University has a new online Doctor of Technology program. Is this program something even worth spending time to complete? What does a \u201cprofessional doctorate\u201d offer to a modern worker?\n\nWhen I hear \"online doctorate program,\" my first thoughts are \"red flag, run away, money grab.\" Obviously, there's some nuance (after all, most Ph.D. students just completed some version of an online doctorate program thanks to COVID), but I suspect that the mentorship and other kinds of opportunities you have in person would be difficult to replicate in an online environment.\n\n>If you don\u2019t want to teach for a living, is a PhD worth the time away from your family and the detriment on your mental health?\n\nMany people with a Ph.D. will go into research and industry careers. As far as the tradeoff, that is a personal decision, and while grad school isn't exactly known to promote mental well-being, I would discourage someone from entering a situation they believed would be detrimental to their mental health.\n\n>There are a lot of PhD programs that I have seen advertised to active duty military that are cheap and \u201caffordable\u201d for the GI Bill, etc. The veterans take them seriously, but I don\u2019t have the heart to tell them what I\u2019ve seen on this subreddit. I\u2019m also active duty. Depending on the responses to this post, I plan to stop my academic career at a masters. (I don\u2019t want to teach)\n\nIf a grad student can get a Ph.D. program mostly or all paid for through their GI Bill benefits, then that changes the calculus. The issue, as I described above, with unfunded programs is not necessarily that they're a bad program, but that the cost-benefit analysis makes it such that the debt incurred is typically not worth it. If a student brings in their own funding in the form of GI Bill benefits so that they're not going into debt, a Ph.D. program may very well be worth it. (Of course, that doesn't mean that all Ph.D. programs will be worth it, and it's good to beware of programs targeting veterans for their GI Bill money so that they can get full tuition for graduate programs of questionable value to the student.)",
