  "text": "I'm a junior scholar (newer PhD), and I'm now to the point where I'm juggling two larger projects, some revisions on articles, and new articles. This is the first time I've had quite so much research in progress, and I'm having some trouble figuring out the best scheduling system to help the development of these projects.\n\nDo you work on say large project 1 and article 1 MWF and project 2 and revisions on TTH, or would you break up a single day into hours or small increments to dedicate daily time to each project? What works for you?",

I'll just sit and grind them out until they're done. \n\nReferee reports with approaching deadlines and articles/chapters/revisions due a bit further out get second priority: I don't want to be unreliable, but getting a bit behind on these things isn't a huge deal (as long as I'm behind by a couple of days or weeks, not a couple of months.)\n\nNew articles are last priority - unless, of course, I'm on to something so big that I can't sleep until I work it out. In that case I usually get things done anyhow, since not sleeping = more time to work. \n\nWorth noting: I don't switch between tasks well.",

      "text": "I'm usually on 4-6 projects at a time.  I definitely don't do entire days on one thing, though I know some people work better that way.\n\nThings I do: \n\n* keep a detailed to-do list, and use the important/urgent matrix (mentally) to sort and prioritize my to-do list.  I generally a small sort daily and a bigger sort weekly.\n\n* block time in my calendar for individual tasks if they're high priority, to ensure they don't slip.\n\n* document things well enough that I don't waste too much time if I come back to a project after dropping it for a few weeks.  \n\n* do different types of work at different times in the day.  My days are often broken up with meetings, colleagues needing help, etc, so I tend to do writing work or intensive programming/analysis in the early evening when I can have a couple hours of uninterrupted time.  My officemate does the same approach but early in the morning before others arrive.\n\n* try to slide through things rather than force them.  If I'm really frustrated/stuck with what I'm doing, I drop it and do something that I can actually progress.  Then come back to the difficult thing later when I'm in the mood.  (This obviously only works if you don't have an imminent deadline!)\n\n* keep a critical path in mind for all projects, and spend small amounts of time on low-urgency things if it will disproportionately help move them along. So if I'm not working on Project 3 for another few weeks but I do know that next time I work on it I'll need something that I don't have, I'll buy the thing now so I have it ready for when I want it.  Similarly for lab things that need a long \"wait\" time (i.e. experiments that need to wait for days/weeks/months) - better to spend a bit of time starting it now while it's not urgent, and let the waiting period happen while I'm working on other things.",

I have found this to be really helpful for the weeks where you need to work on everything but nothing is quite yet 'due'. I have ADHD so it helps me focus if I only work on a project for 3-3.5 hrs at a time. \n\nI also try to match the most cognitively draining tasks with the times of the day that I have the most energy.  I believe i got this idea from scholars talking about the book Deep Work (never actually read it myself).",
