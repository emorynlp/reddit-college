  "title:": "Reaching out to faculty as a potential master's applicant",
  "text": "I am looking into going back to my old university to do post bacc work to raise my low GPA before applying for a master's in the biology department. I have been speaking back and forth with the admissions of Biology department who also knows me, for honest advice on a plan and he has given it. I'm focusing on my former school so far because I have a good working relationship with several faculty there. I might look into one other school perhaps, but in my situation it seems best to work with the university I know and with faculty I know\n\nThere are two faculty members I know well that I am going to reach out to. I'm reading their websites and literature first. Both of their research areas are interesting for me to study. One of them I volunteered under as an undergrad.\n\nHowever I don't know if it's a no no in academia to mention that you are also seeking out other faculty as well for consideration.",

It sounds like it would better than to not mention explicitly the other faculty I am considering unless they ask of course. Discretion sounds like my friend",

              "text": "This is the way. However, there is a point at which this kind of flips. If you get two offers, or more likely you get one and believe there's a strong chance you'll get the second and you're not sure which you'll go for, that's sometimes the moment for honesty. It's really about acting with integrity and not misleading someone and/or putting them out. It's very circumstance dependent but ideally you want to avoid stringing someone along.",
