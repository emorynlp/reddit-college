  "text": "I recently read two great articles from Inside Higher Ed. \n\n\" At his small, teaching-focused institution, Clark and a facilities colleague spent half a day measuring and \"experiencing\" every classroom and lab, all of which were designed for active learning. They looked at every space \"from the perspectives of cleaning, scheduling, room capacities, HVAC systems, pedagogical practices, student and faculty behaviors, student conduct issues, and more,\" he wrote to the POD Network. \"It's one thing to draw six-foot circles, talk about reduced classroom capacities, and propose wearing masks in class -- it's a whole other thing to actually experience it.\" [Link](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/05/27/will-active-learning-be-possible-if-colleges-have-physically)\n\nThis article links to Clark's amazing article: [The Physically Distanced Classroom: A Day in the Life](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/views/2020/05/27/envisioning-day-life-physically-distanced-classroom-opinion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the morning going through my syllabus and I have a ton of small group discussion that simply isn't going to work in these new socially-distanced classrooms. Our university is telling us to plan for hybrid, which means there's another layer of unnecessary complexity to this. \n\nDespite all the complaining about online education, being able to use breakout rooms in Zoom for synchronous small group discussion is actually a huge benefit pedagogically. \n\nExcept everyone seems to be desperate to get back on campus without really thinking about what it will look like.\n\nDo you have any ideas to share about how you're planning to adapt your courses for the fall?",

      "text": "Last week I spent Monday morning planning out a seminar for my class in September. We're doing hybrid teaching, so we're going to have one cohort who's taking the class online and half (if we're lucky) who are actually in the building. So, I'm planning the class and I want to have them interview each other to identify an entrepreneurial opportunity and then reflect on how they observed it. \n\nOnline, as you say, it's easy enough. Breakout rooms, shared whiteboards, easy peasy. \n\nBut then I realised I Can't Do That In Person. 2 meters distance! I'm in Scotland so the guidance is \"leave room for a hairy coo\". How are we supposed to have in-person seminars people need to shout at each other from across the room to think, pair, share? \n\nFrankly, I think the underlying assumption to any in-person teaching plans is that by September we're going to ignore a lot of social distancing guidelines. Either formally as the regulations get changed or informally because that's just the way things have to be for it to work. There is no solution for making teaching work in a Covid world. We're just pretending there is in order to preserve some sense of normality and ensure there is some sort of teaching income.",

And \"it's on the professors to ensure that guidelines are being followed.\"\n\nThe only reason why I'm not entirely worried is because they are also requiring that our classes be adaptable for *both* virtual and in-person students (... instead of some remote/virtual classes and some in-person classes... because that would clearly be too hard) and we have to be ready for students to determine their status on a class by class basis throughout the semester (for instance, if a student would be exposed and need to self quarantine or basically if they just decide to stop coming to class because we obviously can't argue with students about whether it's safe or not).

The cold and flu are rampant. They won't contain this and I give it 4 weeks before we start seeing entire classrooms get sick. Normal cleaning procedures are the bare minimum and staff and students are expected to clean when they see a problem, if they are proudly sticking to procedure the outcome is inevitable...

Large swathes of students are destined for a poor education because they'll be beyond sick, and our university is not only increasing tuition but made it clear they won't be giving refunds. If the student body wasn't made up of 70% subservient premeds begging for their med school prereqs from staff that absolutely adore the asskissing, there would be a protest. They even took down the article for our school news just the other day that was telling people they were increasing the tuition. They know they're in the wrong and trying to contain it. My school hasn't even gotten through summer semester and they're already doubling down and covering with damage control. At this point I can't help but think me and my fellow students are doomed to mediocrity. Upper staff have treated it all as a joke when approached. When I mentioned the issue with student mental health the one I trusted most directly told me \"we don't have grad students with mental health problems.\". They genuinely are clueless and uncaring to anything going on. Their white towers were silly before, but now they're risking other people for it. I was on the wall before with them but covid has shown the crack in their masks and made me as a student lose complete faith that they have anything at all under control or that they care even in the slightest about their students. So no I don't see how they'll pull this off and I predict it will take a death to make them see the problem with the way they've treated this event. We have a relatively older student body and faculty (Avg - Stu: 26, Fac: 50+) so its very much in the realm of possibility.",

Here in Canada, where most large universities are in urban areas with relatively few students in residence, the conversation has started to move past that to just getting to class. Even if we make the classroom work (and that's a big if), many/most students are coming in by transit; the Uinversity of Toronto, York, Ryerson, Uinversit\u00e9 de Montrl\u00e9al, UQ\u00c0M, McGill, and Concordia all have subway stations on campus (or essentially on campus). Plus, many classrooms and offices are located in large towers that essentially necessitate the use of (cramped) elevators, and even the ground level of many campuses can be packed almost shoulder-to-shoulder at class change time. Even if we figure out the classrooms, what's the point if students can't get there while social distancing?\n\nEssentially it's looking like we'll only be able to do in-person classes once we're comfortable not social distancing. My uiniversity is pretty firm that Fall will be online only, with some very rare exceptions for particular classes, assuming provincial public health regulations allow it. Winter is still a big question mark, but essentially it looks like we need to find a way to be OK with not distancing to allow it in person.",

Being 1 or 2 meters apart isn't enough, by far, if you're closed in the same room for long time (there are many case reports of a single person infecting a whole bus of people, even those at the other end, of a call center where the whole floor got infected etc...). At the same time, ultrashort contacts (hallways) are not really an issue.  So... Let's stop feaking out about how many people you can fit into a class with X distance or if you can make hallways less prone to incidental contacts.\n\nIn person lessons cannot be achieved, unless the virus is under control in the country in general thanks to some technical solution (maybe widely adopted and ultra-precise contact tracing when very few cases in the whole nation are present?)\n\nHaving said that... Let's face it. Remote things suck. I work in a hospital, therefore we were always allowed to go to work (I work in Milan, one of the hardest hit areas in the world) and I went back to the office as soon as the situation got slightly acceptable because talking to colleagues via skype/zoom/teams etc... is just soooooooooo ineffective",

We have some older faculty, and students with underlying conditions, so we may just decide to take those \u201clecture-style\u201d classes online and it won\u2019t be a massive disruption. I suspect many faculty at our school will go the same route - we got lots of practice teaching remotely March-May, and many of the kinks have been worked out. \n\nHowever, we\u2019re really struggling with what to do with the performing ensembles (and I\u2019d love to hear what other people are planning to do!). All the research coming out from the WHO, CDC, and many choral organizations is saying no in-person choirs for the foreseeable future. I still want to have the kids have SOME kind of group singing (and they\u2019ll be heartbroken without it) but even breaking the Chamber choir up into quartets or something may not be safe, not to mention the massive logistical issues involved with something like that. And with the larger choir....half of them don\u2019t read music and almost none are confident enough to sing alone, so a similar plan with them is not an option. I have some ideas on the chalkboard for zoom-facilitated work, but honestly at this point I have to wait for the administration to make some decisions.

The opera and orchestra are in a similar situation - I guess just the string players could meet spread out and play together but you can\u2019t play clarinet with a mask on, so....\n\nSorry, this mostly just turned into a rant.

          "text": "It's heartbreaking, but group singing is pretty much the riskiest thing you can imagine. Good breath technique means you'll have projection of particulates close to 30 ft. So if each performer can be separated by >30 ft and outside, it's reasonably safe. A real choral experience is anathema to a world with social distancing.\n\nThere are larger and lesser tragedies of this pandemic, and losing group singing is one of the bigger losses for me, personally. If we (Americans) vote for scientifically literate politicians, we can make things better and suffer less in the future. This fall though... we'll need the Kiwis to sing enough for everyone.",

That does seem like it could be effective but is far from the way students usually plan schedules. I can't see it working where I am...   \n\nUnfortunately if it is less strict than that (as I'm thinking is likely the case), there is still huge potential for transmission.",
