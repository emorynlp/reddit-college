  "text": "Hi. I am a final year PhD student of comparative literature at an US university, and very soon I will throw myself in the job market. I wanted to know if anybody knows a great company or freelancer who helps people polish their CVs. I would be looking for academic positions in colleges and universities, and would be interested to work with somebody who is willing to work online and has expertise dealing with clients such as I. Thank you!",

Honestly, though, the formatting shouldn't be wild or out there -- keep it straightforward and simple so that people can get the information they need in a predictable way. Don't make a search committee search for the info they want. Focus your time instead on your cover letters, research, and teaching statements. The CV does not need to be \"pretty\"",
