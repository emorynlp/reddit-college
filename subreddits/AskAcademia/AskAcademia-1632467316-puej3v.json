  "text": "A conference I had submitted a paper to recently notified me that the paper is 'considered for presentation', but also mentioned that it would need revision.\n\nThe problem is they plan on releasing reviewer comments only after registration.\n\nDoes this kind of thing ever happen?",

I have seen posters not close until after registration was open but not what OP is saying about withholding results until registration closes.",

And unless you *really* need this on your CV, I wouldn\u2019t reward them for this policy\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for conferences to require presenters to register by an early deadline (eg, the early bird date) or get dropped from the program (after all, other attendees are registering to see the program\u2026).  But I\u2019ve never heard of a reputable conference making you register before announcing acceptances (in my field, anyway\u2026)",
