Lots of people go into industry from academia, at all stages. \n\nIt's far easier to have a successful lifetime career if you do things you enjoy rather than doing things you don't enjoy thinking you'll get some tradeoff in the future. Do what you think will interest you, keep you motivated and you can do well now, rather than what you think will bring you future success.",

In other words, do a bit of research and make that decision. There is no right or wrong here and it will depend on your needs and wants.",
