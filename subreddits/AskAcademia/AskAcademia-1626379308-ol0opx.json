  "text": "I dreamed of being a professor. This community, and my professors, talked me out of pursuing a PhD. I teach high school English now. I'm about to start my second year, and though I do like a lot of its aspects, I'm still hanging onto that dream of being a professor. Much more mature kids, no parents, intelligent coworkers. All while doing what I love: teaching people how to be better readers and writers, showing them the beauty in books. \n\nBut maybe I have a fantasized image of what being a professor is like. Maybe I'm not considering some things.",

      "text": "I'll say this with the caveat that I love what I do as a professor (in a different field than yours). With that said, here are some considerations:\n\n1. You do have an idyllic view of how engaged students will be in your classes. To some extent, this depends upon where you are at. You may have some students who are passionate about your class. You may have other students who are taking it to fulfill a requirement, or who don't put in their full effort.\n\n2. How do you feel about research? Much of your Ph.D. would center upon doing research, and if you want to find a faculty job, you'll need to have your own program of research. If that's exciting to you, great! If you primarily want to teach, that is a lot of time to spend in a Ph.D. program spending most of your time not teaching, all for the possibility of getting a professor job.\n\n3. If you find a tenure-track position (which will make you the exception, not the rule, as 1 of 300+ applicants per opening), you'll be doing a mix of teaching, scholarship, and service. If you don't find a tenure-track position but stay in academia, you will be lucky if you find a visiting professorship or a lecturer position (i.e., a full-time position with benefits, albeit a position that can be pulled at any time). More likely, you will piece together different adjunct positions and will experience no job security and no benefits.\n\n4. Which brings me full circle here. There is a very real chance that your best job prospect post-Ph.D. would be a continuation of what you're doing now: to teach high school English. It may pay more, and it will offer better benefits, than many options you may have with a Ph.D.\n\nLong story short, if you win the tenure-track lottery, you may have something resembling the idyllic vision you have. But that'd be akin to someone who played college sports trying to make it as a professional athlete: the odds are low and the system is not designed for most people to make it.\n\nI'll add: if you know all of this and want to pursue a Ph.D. in English, go for it. But do so because you are passionate about your area of scholarship and want the experience of being in a Ph.D. program, and you understand that completing a Ph.D. program may not improve your job prospects.",

But consider it a pursuit for personal development, not a career move. \nIn my PhD, I traveled around the world (to conferences and accompanying students on study abroad trips), learned a lot of neat things inside and outside the field, and enjoyed the community of people/academic environment. I also lived on about $20k for five years and adjusted my lifestyle accordingly. \nIt is not a foolish thing to do, but it is foolish to do without considering the impact on all areas of your life, and assessing how you feel about that.",

              "text": "WAY WAY FEWER than 1% of PhDs end up as professors. In a lot of fields (mostly sciences) the majority of PhDs don\u2019t want to be professors. \n\nBut certainly fewer than 1% of PhDs who WANT to be tenure-track professors do. I raised it to 10% because my original comment wasn\u2019t limited to tenure track, but any \u201cpermanent\u201d full-time teaching position, which would include positions like lecturers and clinical faculty. But 10% is still an overestimation.\n\nIf you\u2019re an undergraduate thinking about being a tenure-track professor, if you aren\u2019t in the top 10% of students in your major at an Ivy League or similarly ultra-selective, high-profile school; the odds are heavily stacked against you.\n\nOf course, the majority of tenure-track professors don\u2019t come from those kinds of schools, but for any given TT job opening you should assume *at least* one person with an Ivy League PhD and 100 people with degrees/backgrounds that are just as good as yours are applying for the same job, no matter what school you\u2019re applying to. My podunk PUI has professors with PhDs and excellent publishing track records from Stanford and Princeton because we are the only school that was hiring where they wanted to live when they were looking for jobs.\n\nAnd that hits another really important point other people mentioned: if you want a TT position, you can either choose when you\u2019re looking for a job or where you\u2019re looking for a job, but not both. \n\nAt any given school, an opening in a large department doesn\u2019t come up more than once every five years, and a smaller department may not have an opening more than once every 10. If there\u2019s only a handful of schools/cities/states you\u2019d be ok working in, you may have to wait years for a position that you\u2019re qualified for to open, and for most applicants your odds of getting it aren\u2019t good because a hundred other equally qualified people have also applied.\n\nSo you either wait years for a slim chance at the job you really want, or you apply broadly anywhere you think you could stand. And if you\u2019re thinking you\u2019ll start in the middle of nowhere, work there for a few years and then get that dream job when it opens, boy howdy is that not how it works. \n\nDo any reading on the subject and you\u2019ll find lots of stories of people who do apply literally everywhere when a TT job opens, and they can go YEARS without ever even getting an interview because there are so many qualified applicants. Most of them give up after 3-5 years.",

Multiple rounds of job searches can only increase their probability (however small) over the course of their career. To illustrate and keep simple, in the first year the probability is 20,000/200000. At the end of second year assuming they are not hired their overall probability will be the first year probability (20,000/200,000) PLUS the second year probability 20,000/(200,000+180,000). So even though there is more competition in the second year, you have to add that smaller probability to the first year probability to get their overall probability.

I'd be okay with a full time teaching position too as that is also something I'm passionate about but I'd definitely prefer a more research focused role. I also fortunately would not have that added stress of job security as it quite easy to get a TT job back home if you've spent enough time abroad, but I definitely want to stay in the US long term for the better research culture and quality of life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

There are too many PhDs, poorly-funded institutions of higher education, and administrators that have decided that their departments should grow while full-time faculty positions should be cut. More and more, universities are turning to contingent faculty (people with Master's and PhDs) to teach, while offering them no benefits and pay that is barely a livable wage (this is not an exaggeration).\n\nIt is very, very bleak.",

The chances are so slim it may as well be zero.\n\n2) The bulk of your students are often in gen ed courses and they care less about your course than a high school student would. They certainly aren't going to see any beauty in it. \n\n3) A big part of the job has nothing to do with teaching nor learning.\n\n4) Some departments are incredibly toxic. I've heard the argument that industry has the same issues, but it's not the same. I had a job that was toxic and I simply quit and found a better job the next week. You can't really do that in academia.\n\n5) You have almost no choice in where you live and the bulk of jobs are not somewhere you want to live (too big, too small, too rural, too urban, too hot, too cold...) \n\n6) There's not much in the way of career advancement unless you go into admin. You get \"rank\" advancements, but the job is pretty much the same. You'll publish more books and papers and build reputation, but it's not the same. \n\nIt can be pretty awesome, though, and I don't imagine quitting.",

      "text": "- It\u2019s very lonely. The closest thing to regular engagement with coworkers is saying hello to the professor who has the classroom before you or after you. Rarely both though. But departmental wise, most long form engagement includes alcohol \n\n- Being a professor has very little to do with teaching. On the outside, that seems like the bulk of the job. But it isn\u2019t. What professors actually do is research, write, conference, and publish. That takes a lot of self organization and scheduling. Lots of submissions, rejections, speaking with editors, acceptances, and a bunch more so it tends to take more effort than teaching. (I\u2019m only talking about time commitment and overall career. You can definitely *care* about teaching more, but there\u2019s a good chance that there will be more time & focus on research)\n\n- Continuing with research, being a professor is consequently a very independent and hands off job. That means it takes a lot of self sustaining. *No one* is going to tell you what to research. It\u2019s up to you entirely to figure out what research you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re researching it, why you\u2019re researching it, when to research it, when & where to present & publish it, etc. You will rarely encounter a \u201cNo\u201d when it comes to just choosing what to research. But at the same time, there is no \u201cyes\u201d and no instruction. The entire attitude is \u201cwe aren\u2019t going to tell you *what* to do, but you better do something, do it right, and it better be good.\u201d So no one is going to make you busy, you make yourself busy.\n\n- Last point on research: despite research being the main job and teaching being substandard in terms of time commitment. You don\u2019t get paid for research at all or if anything, it\u2019s very minor. So your salary will depend heavily on teaching but the overall career is dependent on a collection of self sustained work\n\n- When it comes to teaching, the students aren\u2019t actually mature. If anything they are less mature because a growing number of them believe themselves to be customers rather than learners. ESPECIALLY when it comes to English literature \n\n- Rampant cheating. Technically your teaching materials are intellectual property but Chegg and other places don\u2019t seem to believe that.\n\n- Speaking of technology and students feeling like customers. There\u2019s a strange lack of human compassion given to professors. Not anything serious\u2026but weirdly mundane. To give an example, most students see nothing wrong with recording you both audio and visually. So they tend not to ask for consent and there\u2019s a chance you find videos of yourself online. Videos you didn\u2019t even know existed. Not saying this is bad but it\u2019s something not many consider \n\n- An extension of that is the way students see nothing wrong with mass unconsenting discussion of your existence beyond the profession. You might see a ratemyprofessor profile one day. You didn\u2019t make it and was not even made aware of that it was made. No one forces them to remain professional \n\n- You are in English and in the humanities. University is also where a lot of young adults get to feel adult for the first time. As an English and humanities professor, they, specifically end up having a lot of emotional weight added to the job\u2026.in a way that other disciplines like stem and sciences don\u2019t. Despite what I said in the previous two points, those same students will still use your classroom to work through issues and traumas. And they\u2019ll use your space to have some of their very first intellectual and divisive conversations. It may range from football games to death & abuse. Sometime both are presented with the same intensity. And they may come to you for any and everything because they see you as an available authority. So you have to make a choice on whether you want to *be* that available authority. How do you grade an essay about a student losing a parent to suicide? Will you have resources to professional help memorized and readily available? Just be aware that teaching as a humanities professor stops being about grades often & you have to navigate being both professional and emotionally available. \n\n- Lots of drug use among academic circles. Not all academics partake in drugs, most don\u2019t. But the ones that do are tight knit.\n\n- No choice in living location or length of stay. Even when going to grad school, there\u2019s almost zero options when it comes to where you will be living. You go where the university is and if it\u2019s 3 universities in 3 years, that can mean 3 different states in 3 years\n\n- Friends and relationships are hard to keep. Especially when both are academics. Thanks to the lack of choice in location, once you do get to know people. They leave fast and quickly. Or you leave fast and quickly, whichever is first. So you really have to think about whether you *want* to pursuer marriage or have children \n\n- It takes a long time to get a \u201creal\u201d job and reliable stability. It\u2019s 5-7 years of grad school then post-doc and job market limbo for a while. (Hence all the moving) And if you\u2019re lucky enough to land a tenure track job, that job is one of the few truly stable forms of academic employment. And even then it\u2019s a 7 year audition before FINALLY getting the kind of stability of a desk job\n\n- Some positive things. Lots of free food and shirts! Food trucks, promotions, discounts. They aren\u2019t just for students. And departments can have pretty nice spreads that can feed you for weeks\n\n- Free access to gyms\u2026forever. If a university or college has a gym. You can usually go for free. \n\n- Free, reduced, and QUICK medical care. Most colleges and universities have a health care facility on site that is incredibly efficient for walk ins. In normal jobs, you need an appointment for for things like joint pain or a gynecologist visit. If you go to the university doctor, you can be in and out within 24 hours.\n\n- Great daycare that is often close. I don\u2019t have kids but I think it\u2019s great that so many universities have daycares and pre k programs\n\n- And finally. It\u2019s actually a really great job. BUT it\u2019s important to really evaluate if it\u2019s worth it. And it may not be. I love being a professor, I really do. But the cons genuinely outweigh the pros. That doesn\u2019t mean the pros are worthless though. But be prepared to do a lot of work with the very likely possibility that you will get nothing in return.",

      "text": "First, sorry to hear that you were dissuaded to pursue a career in academia by this sub and your professors. This is a place to vent our grievances, it is not the way most people feel about their profession, I argue. If I have had a good talk with a bunch of interested students who then turned in good papers, I won't make a post here about it. If I blow a fuse over stupid questions in the e-mail, I might. If I get a research grant, I won't make a post about it. If I get a grant application denied, I may complain about it here. And so on.\n\nAlso, as professors, we may want to give some tough love to someone who has unrealistic expectations about how easy it is to go down this path. Some do this more negatively than others. Evidently, people do become professors. If all of us had listened to this sub and our own professors there wouldn't be any professors out there.\n\nNow to your question:\n\nBoth of my parents were professors, so I have had a pretty good idea about what the job entailed since childhood. But, the thing that baffles me to this day is how little the quality of my work matters outside of research. As long as my teaching and service aren't so horribly bad that it creates a problem for the department, nobody really cares. The most successful professors where I have worked have focused on their own research (where quality and quantity matter a lot) and done the other stuff half-heartedly.\n\nI am not saying that good researcher are poor teachers, though. According to research, there is a zero correlation between research quality and teaching quality. There are plenty of great researchers that are great teachers, and some that do poorly in both, and some that do well in one but not the other. But, what I am saying is that it has surprised me how little it matters if you care about teaching or not. Unless there is some specific drama, my department will not have a clue if I am pretty bad, meh, or great at what I do outside of research.",

      "text": "To preface: I am going into my first year as tenure track faculty. The past 3 years have been spent first as an adjunct (1 year), then as a full-time non-tenure track faculty member (2 years). I love my work. I love what I do. I love working in higher ed. I can't imagine doing anything else, but it's not all perfect. And, unfortunately, you are right: You absolutely have a fantasized image of what the professoriate is like.\n\n1. The students are \\*never\\* as advanced, mature, or dedicated as you think they are...unless you are a leader in your field, teaching at the leading institution for your field, and you are working exclusively with graduate students in a highly selective program.\n2. The salary is rarely commensurate with the workload or the immense pressure to be productive with no real indication of what's \"enough.\"\n3. The tenure track job market is competitive. Insanely competitive. More competitive than you can imagine. I have friends in English who have told me that if you don't have a published book (or at least a manuscript picked up by a publisher) and several other smaller publications by the time you finish your PhD, you are at a substantial disadvantage on the job market. In music, it is similar.\n4. You are at the mercy of the job market with regard to location. If you really want to be a professor, you have to come to terms with the fact that you really don't have the luxury of picking a location in which to work unless you are a leader in your field and schools are literally headhunting you. You may think that the job makes up for a lackluster location - it absolutely does not.\n5. Academia is not kind or conducive to relationships for a number of reasons. You may get a job, but it's in a location where your partner (if you have one) may have a hard time finding work. Your partner may also be in academia, and the institution that hires you can't offer a spousal hire. Perhaps you and your partner both get job offers  from different institutions- both of you need the work, and both of you need to take the jobs, resulting in a long distance relationship or marriage. Maybe you don't have a partner but you get a job in a college town where dating prospects are slim and you have a hard time finding companionship.\n6. The coworkers may be more intelligent than you average person, but that doesn't mean they are pleasant to work with. Frankly, some are assholes.\n7. Much of your time will be spent doing things that take away from time you'd rather spend being teaching or doing research/writing, regardless of what your \"load\" says on paper.\n\nIf you're okay with all of these things, then the professoriate is right for you. Despite the allure and the dreams of most doctoral candidates, for many of them this isn't the right life. Even some of the lucky and accomplished few who do land the coveted tenure track position find that the job isn't right for them. This is not a criticism of doctoral candidates or people unhappy in the profession (or those who have left), rather it's a criticism of the academy itself.",

My colleagues are great-- smart, funny, friendly, we all socialize together (and kick ass at pub trivia!), the workplace is very positive at the departmental level.\n\nWhat you're missing is a major component of the work: service. I generally spend about 50% of my work hours in meetings, doing committee work, writing reports, and collaborating with others on stuff that has nothing to do with my teaching or research. The sheer number of meetings can be mind-boggling, as can the pages of reports that are written (annual reports? assessment reports? mission and values statements? program reviews? etc????) that nobody ever really seems to read. So many meetings and so many reports.\n\nThe other 50% of my work hours are teaching. Note how there's no percentage left for research? At my SLAC we are required to publish for tenure/promotion, but there is basically no time to do any research/writing during the academic year except on the weekends. So it's a huge rush all summer to collect data/write/travel/etc. in order to keep up with the publication push.\n\nMost of our students are great, but overall quite a bit less great than 15 years ago. American culture has changed for the worse and I'm finding more and more students who basically never read a book in high school and aren't interested in anything that isn't directly named for some high-paying job they heard about on TV or Youtube: doctor, lawyer, accountant, something-something computers, or \"engineering\" (which they can't define). Try teaching required humanities courses to some of them and you'll quickly decide you'd rather be in a faculty meeting.",

I made a conscious decision to pick a balanced school rather than a research school because I love to travel and didn't want to spend all summers researching. So to answer the question, if you are lucky to get multiple tt offers, choose wisely, depending on your life goals. 10k more or less, spread out over a year won't matter as much.",

This can be incredibly hard for personal relationships whether your partner is an academic or not as it requires potentially uprooting jobs, friendships, kids, pets, etc. every couple of years until one (maybe) gets a TT somewhere with more permanence.\n\nI'm currently a non-TT lecturer and although I am considered full-time faculty, my contract is year-to-year so can't count on staying until budget requests go through in the spring.

A lot of the people I meet that complain a ton about being a professor tend to be super privileged people who went straight through school and never worked anything else. What everyone else has brought up has some truth to it, but overall the positive outweighs the negative. \n\nBUT\u2026the \u201cif you can get it\u201d part of the TT matters most here. And what I\u2019d tell you is DO NOT pursue a PhD in English literature. \n\nPeople mention terrible job odds and the response was \u201cI\u2019ve faced worse.\u201d Everyone thinks that. No one believes they are the person that will be an adjunct/lecturer forever. The reality is that TT positions in English lit might as well not exist now. That\u2019s the truth and the market reality. \n\nGo into rhetoric/technical communication if you want English-adjacent employment in higher education. You can still bring in the focus you want a lot of the time, but you\u2019ll be actually employable. No one is giving out a TT line so folks can teach students how to interpret Moby Dick \u201ccorrectly\u201d these days.

Research success (whatever that is defined as) is in a lot of ways mostly out of our control. A grant reviewer, editor, committee member or admin can make decisions that can completely change your career. Papers get cited because of where they get published, grants due to the host university, etc. \n\nAs a group of highly-educated people we really fail ourselves, and the profession, by counting metrics rather than working to understand the contributions to knowledge being made. So, being a group of highly-educated people a lot of us spend way too much time chasing metrics. \n\nI have colleagues who produce dozens of pretty low quality articles/year. Across the hall there are groups who think they are always sitting on CNS papers and rarely publish.  These extremes get a lot of the glory as people count and see impressive metrics but very few people are paying enough attention to evaluate quality, reproducibility, etc. It is very difficult to sustain a consistently funded research career by only publishing completed work in field specific journals. \n\nThis brings me to what I think is the most difficult thing for most TT profs (and admins) to swallow, that most large scale academic research is not achievable outside of a few specific institutes/universities and is better left for govt or industry. This isn't true in all fields, but in my experience in my field of applied science/engineering graduate school is the on-ramp for training not the culmination of it. Way too many profs act like there leading some type of competition with google, or Pharma, or insert other actual industry. We are not. We are here to navigate our students towards independent positions and familiarizing them with advanced concepts. We have a rotating cast every fall and cannot realistically maintain long-term projects that require people working at different levels with continued institutional knowledge. Nor should we really be trying to.\n\nOutside of research: \n\nStaff turnover is a serious problem in a lot of depts. There are some positions that have a half-life of months, maybe years, and are often used as stepping stones for different positions within the university. I've had thousands of dollars of grant money evaporate, and a lot of my time wasted, by staff leaving and not training their replacements or positions getting eliminated.",
