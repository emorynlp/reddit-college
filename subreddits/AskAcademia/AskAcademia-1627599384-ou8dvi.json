  "text": "I know the common answer is libraries, textbooks, word of mouth, and monographs but I\u2019d like to learn more. Another example is in math research. Many mathematicians will find a proof in a text and their research will be on simplifying that proof or finding inspiration in the one they found, so I\u2019m guessing the way research is conducted in that area didn\u2019t change much.",

She told the class that she used to have to go through file cabinets of journals and stacks of books when writing her dissertation to find sources. She wrote her 400 page thesis on a type writer. \n\nFor me, imagine not having a citation generator (or the auto generation from journal sites) and not having a way to do spell check- if you make an error towards the bottom of the page you have to rewrite the entire thing.",

Many papers I read these days cite huge numbers of references but it's often clear that they are not all relevant, haven't been considered in depth, and may often be misinterpreted.",

It was a little booklet that had basically the content page of several hundred life science and medical journals.  You got title, authors and the corresponding authors address.  That was it.  It was mailed out weekly.  There was some keyword indexing.    We all had little pre-printed postcards, with space for the details, basically asking for a copy of the paper that we filled in and mailed out.\n\nWe would order 50 or a hundred off prints when our paper was published, and so we would happily mail the papers out when the requests came in.  \n\nNow part of the Clarivate conglomerate I believe.",

Universities had (and in many places still have) huge enormous racks of roller-shelving with hundreds of thousands of journal volumes. So you go through exactly the same process then as you do now,  just using hard copy.\n\nClasses are not really where current reseach is dicussed unless you're at Masters level or above. Current research is discussed in journals. That is where the academic discourse happens (and, of course, at conferences).",

Very often your university would;dn't hold the journals you needed, so you had to wait on inter-library loans to come through. There was no ability to search texts, so you were physically trawling through and reading entire documents to see if they even discussed the topic you were concerned about.\n\nThere was something perhaps more contemplative about being sat in a nice quiet library, but it was a huge time soak compared to what can be done now. And if you want to go and work in a nice quiet library you can still do that.",

With the help of databases etc. you can form a good enough picture of the state of things. Back in the day, you had to be a senior expert to know what research is out there, and what is missing.\n\nYou couldn't search forward in time. If I read a book that was five years old, I knew what research it built on, but I had no way of knowing who built on it since. Therefore you always had to be up to speed to get by. There were no shortcuts.\n\nConferences played a more central part in science as well, I argue. This was often the only way to know what other people were up to, what large projects were ongoing that hadn't published yet, and so on.",
