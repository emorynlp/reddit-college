  "text": "The image 'retreat' brings to mind is withdrawing to seclusion and privacy in order to recuperate and rest.  \n\n\nThis is stressful. It's sitting in a room listening to administrators lecture about 'success types in educated' using crappy debunked personality tests, getting updates from departments I don't interact with, and meandering stories from people who I'm not sure why they're allowed to have a microphone.   \n\n\nShouldn't it be called something else?   \n\n\nFaculty retreat from reality to maintain a grasp on sanity?",

These are usually held when we are off-contract (summers) so we get extra pay as well.\n\nRetreats are far more productive (and relaxing) than workshops. At our retreats we usually drink in the evenings, play ping-pong, go on hikes, etc. Workshops, on the other hand, tend to end at 430 so you have to go home all stressed. By contrast, I love our writing retreats and go as often as I can (2-3 times per year usually) as it's a great way to get work done without being bothered, away from the phone/kids, and in a nice setting.",

We try to plan our next approach but everyone's tired, thinking of the life they left behind. All this promise, hopes and dreams laying in waste.\n\nThe stress and fatigue has gotten to everyone and soon the arguments break out. Some have turned to drinking and some of the juniors are sitting in the corner in the fetal position crying quietly.\n\nBy the time the retreat is complete we are fragmented, resentful, devoid of hope.\n\nBut we shall return, more bitter than ever, as we let out our battle cry: \"YES IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE EXAM!\"",

We also spin ideas for christmas BMJ analyses (i.e. a bit funny)\n\nWe go up to the highlands, do that half a day then half a day of activities like biking. Then we drink. Do that twice, head home.",
