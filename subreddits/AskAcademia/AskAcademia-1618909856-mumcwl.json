  "text": "Has anyone here completely changed fields after finishing a PhD? \n\nI have less than 1 year left of my molecular biology PhD and i am starting to realize that my future in academia is limited, i enjoy my day to day life, but i dont think i have the passion to continue doing this forever. I simply value my free time too much, and research has not been everything i wanted it to be. The industry jobs within my field just dont appeal to me at all anymore. \n\nTherefore, i am now thinking about studying engineering after i am done with my PhD in order to relocate to a different job market. \n\nDoes anyone else here have experience with changing careers after their PhD? How did it work out?",

Most employers are already skeptical of people with PhDs, and they have a legitimate imo preference to hire people with non-academic work experience. If you finish a PhD and then get a second BA, you're going to be like 30-35, with limited practical work experience - it's going to be harder for you. It's better to cut the cord now and find your footing in industry. If you find that you need another degree, you can always go back to school and get one.

But they make bank ($150-160K base + large bonuses and great benefits) you'll get lots of miles that way, and that experience is HIGHLY parlayable into other industries.

Only the very upper level positions (dean and above) have the types of salaries to compete with industry, but those are generally difficult to get without first having a TT faculty career (i.e., they typically aren't staff jobs that someone with a PhD can step into easily). \n\nA lot of the problem with pay also comes down to lack of raises, which are directly related to budget cuts and the general financial cluster that is higher ed. For example, at my R1, we've received one 2% col raise since 2015, and I don't anticipate another one coming any time soon. I don't get the sense that that happens frequently in industry. \n\nOf course there are exceptions to all of this, and I personally really enjoy my job in research and policy.

I guess what I've noticed is that so many universities are failing to face reality. COVID wasn't the cause of our problems, it's a symptom of a larger set of problems that we've ignored for too long. Among that, there's a \"blame game\" where faculty and many intellectuals blame \"managerialism\" as the problem facing higher ed., which I don't believe at all. I don't believe that the administrative functions of a university are the problem. I believe without them, most faculty couldn't do what they're doing.

It\u2019s the stressful low point we hear about where the fun is sucked right out of it and you\u2019re doubting everything. I would finish your PhD while you\u2019re already close, or you could regret that later once you\u2019ve had a chance to breathe. You can usually refocus your field with a post-doc if you want to change slightly, or find a government job that isn\u2019t in research.",

In industry \"years of experience\" are usually worth a lot more than additional degrees, so while getting into the field is also the hardest step, starting to accumulate years of experience of also the most rewarding thing. My new boss once said once you started your job your whole educational background is more of a fun anecdote to tell than really determining your career.\n   \nSo: have you looked into jobs outside your field you may still qualified for? Your options of course depend on which skills you trained in the last years.  \nMy friends from Neuroscience usually did some training courses (weeks to months, far quicker than another degree) and transitioned to Project Management, Quality Assurance/Management, Medical Writer, Data Management or Analyst, Consulting or PR work. Personally I could fall back on my Master in Computer Science to transition to Software Testing but the general idea is to choose a skill you think you would enjoy applying and see if you can find some shorter but intense training for that to kind of min-max the whole transition. Since you still have a couple of months you can see what your university offers although people usually have even better results with courses that are more tailored towards industry, outside of university. But really, try to see what you can already get during these last months at University and take what you find.",

I think as academics we often think first about retraining or getting a new degree to pivot...but you probably don't need one if your goal is simply to work in a different field. Obviously if you want to be an engineer, you'll need an engineering degree - but if you just want a non-academic job and there are lots of things that will make you happy, you probably don't need a new degree at all.\n\nWhen I was about halfway through my PhD I thought about leaving to retrain as well. I had a couple different ideas, chief among them a nursing degree, with the same motivation: if I get a degree in a more 'hot' field with many job openings I'll feel more stable and secure in the workforce. After some research and thought, though, I realized that there were lots of things I could with my social science degree, including UX research, which is what I ended up doing.\n\nInstead of thinking about what degree you should get - you should first identify what you would like to do after you finish. What kind of work do you want to do? Then you can decide if you *need* another degree to do that thing.",
