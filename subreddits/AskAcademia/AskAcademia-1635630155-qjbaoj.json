  "text": "Hi all! I just had a quick question - I'm in the process of applying to grad school and I'm going to be emailing my professors to request a letter of recommendation but when writing the email, I'm a bit unsure of how I should mention that I'm applying to a few universities to a few very similar but a bit different programs. Most of the email templates I found just mention that I will be applying for X at Y university, that's why I don't know how I should put it. Also, these universities have different deadlines but the one I want to get into is later than others. \n\nI'd appreciate any advice!",
