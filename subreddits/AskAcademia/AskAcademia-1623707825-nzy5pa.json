  "title:": "Is it appropriate to defer a PhD because of no housing available?",
  "text": "Edit: got some ideas on how valid this is and how to seek help from the department. Would like some more examples on deferring a PhD. Thanks!\n\nOriginal post:\n\nHi there. \n\nBackground: I am an incoming PhD student in STEM of a public university in US. The program has a very small cohort size (<5 ppl every yr) and the first year of the program is mainly coursework. \n\nMy situation: I am applying for F-1 visa in Canada, and there's no regular appointment available until school starts. I will apply for an expedited appointment but I still don't know whether I can get the visa in time. I have a cat with me, and I don't drive.\n\nHousing issue: the school is in a small town and there are not many pet-friendly apartments. I have called a bunch and most of them are already full until mid September. The left are very expensive ( ~$1500 for 1b1b) and my scholarship may not be enough for daily life if I rent there. I don't have an SSN or valid credit record yet so I can hardly negotiate with the apartment management or other landlords. I haven't seen any post of roommate recruiting in school FB groups or other social media for ~1 month straight.\n\nMy questions: \n1. Should I wait until the visa decision is available and then tell the department about the housing issue?\n2. Is \"I have nowhere to live with my cat\" a proper reason for deferring PhD? \n3. If this is a valid reason, how should I communicate with the department so they won't think that I am very irresponsible?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Generally, being unable to relocate human dependents on time is not considered a valid excuse to defer admission, and furry dependents are pretty much never given special consideration beyond what is granted to human dependents. So, the chances seem slim that your inability to find affordable pet-friendly housing will be sufficient grounds for deferral.\n\nI think it would be best to let the department know now that you are trying to move with a pet and are having difficulty finding affordable housing within that constraint. They may be able to assist you while you wait on your visa appointment, such as by advertising your housing request more broadly or connecting you with other pet owners in the department to discuss options you may not be aware of. This will also avoid blindsiding them if your visa is granted on time but you still struggle with moving.",

We\u2019re on the border of Vermont and it\u2019s pretty similar across the river; near Portland in Maine rent isn\u2019t great (though a bit cheaper, if you can find somewhere to rent!) and in the greater Boston area, I had a hard time finding an apartment to share with other people at 750/room for three beds (so that\u2019s\u2026 2250?). As far as I can tell, it\u2019s a lack of rental supply and resulting high prices because of demand. I\u2019m moving to Virginia Tech in a couple weeks and the difference in 1. Inventory and 2.

                          "text": "Yep, it\u2019s absurd. I imagine it might be better for undergrads with on campus housing options, but grad students struggle. There\u2019s an influx of postdocs, grad students, doctors from the hospital etc and no new affordable living quarters built (plenty of luxury condos near DHMC though, for 1800-2500 per month!) , so it\u2019s hard to find a new place, and even sachem rent (the grad student housing) is 1500-2100 for their 2/3 beds if you can find one. The only exception is old sachem, if you want to put up with the living conditions; they occasionally have some 2 beds on the market for 1100-1300. But they\u2019re grungy and you also have to walk sideways down the hallway to get into the bathroom, it\u2019s so small. \n\nI think the logic for property managers is that if you get young talent that\u2019s used to paying Boston prices because of the college, and there\u2019s low supply, you might as well raise the prices to what they\u2019ll pay.\n\nYou can try to find small landlords in west leb and WRJ that will make things more affordable, but my husband recently tried to get a studio apartment for next year for less than $1000/month, and they simply don\u2019t exist. He ended up rooming with a postdoc in a two bed for $900. We did find a 1 bed in Enfield for $950+utilities, but that would be an hour commute for him (I\u2019m taking the car to Virginia \ud83d\ude05)\n\n I imagine that if you\u2019re an undergrad, you might be able to get some friends together and find a 3/4/5 bed and lower the cost per room? Ive never been an undergrad here, but I can imagine it would be less than/similar to what I paid in Boston. The overall rent though would still be difficult for a young adult couple to pay themselves. \ud83d\ude43\n\nThen, take into account the fact that many of the locals that aren\u2019t college-affiliated/haven\u2019t attended college and don\u2019t make much money\u2026 It\u2019s difficult to have a family up here these days.",

      "text": "A couple thoughts:\n\n1. Reach out to your Ph.D. advisor. (If you do not have one yet, e.g., your program uses a cohort model, then reach out to whomever was in charge of admissions or is coordinating first-year orientation.) Your advisor will want you to be able to come on-time, and may have some suggestions specific to the local area. Or they can put you in touch with current students in the lab / your future program who are familiar with the local housing market and may have some suggestions.\n\n2. Does your university have any graduate student housing? If so, you might see if that is an option. I would also recommend reaching out to your student's International Students Office for A) guidance on navigating logistics related to your visa, and B) tips on finding housing as an international student with no SSN.\n\n3. One site I might suggest is Craigslist. You're much more likely to find mom and pop landlords, or people renting a room out. Compared to companies managing apartment complexes, which may be sticklers about credit score, etc., mom and pop landlords or someone renting out a room may be more flexible with your lack of a credit history or your having a cat. In my experience, landlords tend to have largely positive views about graduate students (e.g., viewing them as conscientious and unlikely to give them trouble). You can also post a looking-for-a-room ad on Craigslist--you may find other grad students or young professionals who are looking for one more person to fill out a house. (One tip: I've seen some rent-a-room-in-a-house ads on Craigslist that take advantage of vulnerable people by having unrealistic conditions, like not being allowed to invite guests over. Beware of this when looking.)\n\nUltimately, not having housing is an understandable enough reason to delay (if that is an option), but before you consider asking about that, do everything you can to find a viable option, including seeking help from people at the university who are familiar with the regional nuances of the rental market. Good luck with all of this!",

Obviously being onsite is ideal but if you can't then I would negotiate that with the school and your supervisor (if you're assigned one already).",

Rent went up like crazy when I lived in LA. A lot more people live father away from campus now and commute by bus. Sorry for your troubles, I hope something good works out.",
