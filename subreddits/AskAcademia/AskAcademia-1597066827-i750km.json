  "title:": "Is it necessary to mention that the order of names in the paper is alphabetical when including it in a CV?",
  "text": "I am an undergraduate student (in Physics). My internship work is being published as a part of a larger paper with 7-8 authors. The paper is quite long (approx 25 pages) and my work forms only 1 section of it (1-1.5 page). However, they are ordering the authors alphabetically because of which I am becoming the 'first author'. The paper itself is quite broad comparing 2 different techniques and I have not interacted with any other author(except my guide) nor do I know what the rest of the paper is about. My knowledge is limited to technique 1 and my result is being included as an improvement to previous results of technique 1 with a bit of extra analysis.\n\nWhen applying to grad school or in the future, should I explicitly mention that ordering is alphabetical in my CV or whenever I mention this paper? I don't want a potential advisor (actually anyone) misjudging the entire paper as my work. Also, when I'm sending 'I'm interested to work with you' mail and bring up this paper-should I mention that it's ordered alphabetically?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The only way OP gains from not specifying is if it leads a reader to conclude OP was the principal author of this study when they weren\u2019t, which is vaguely unethical but I wouldn\u2019t lose too much sleep over it.\n\nAs far as your second point goes, I (a physicist) collaborate with biologists and physicians. Not one of us understand each other\u2019s contribution (beyond a layman\u2019s understanding in very broad strokes) enough to stand by it. We have to trust each other\u2019s expertise.  That agreement of standing behind 100% of the results is a fiction, and if we actually had to wait until that were true, medical research would grind to a halt.

ATLAS (one of the experiments at the LHC) is a 55-nation collaboration with over a thousand scientists involved in that experiment alone.\n\nIt\u2019s not just CERN, either. LIGO has similar authorship numbers. Physics has reached the era of massive experiments, where it takes thousands of collaborating scientists and engineers to design an experiment, because of how sensitive the measurements we must make are. Each of those individuals contributed in a very real way to the experimental design, and the experiment would not exist without their efforts, so everyone deserves authorship.",

When my colleague tells me that drug X is a whatsit pathway inhibitor, and that's why it will induce effect Y when Z is performed, I have to take their word for it. Sure, I could google it, and make sure that it really is. Or at least, that other people seem to be doing similar things, as far as I can follow along. That's a pretty superficial level verification I could do.  But I don't really know in any depth what it **really** means. More importantly, I don't know if it's relevant, or what it implies. I don't know what other effects that they haven't implicitly written about might confound our study. It's really not anything I can stand behind in any level of confidence, even if (as I already said) I can explain it in broad strokes.\n\nMaybe your cohort of undergrads are much smarter and educated than I am, and you're capable of being experts in more than one discipline. I posit it's more likely that as an undergrad they haven't achieved much depth in any one discipline, except perhaps their own, and have an equally superficial understanding in all of them. \n\nI say this looking back at my own experience as an undergraduate student who thought I understood my own field much more than I actually did.
