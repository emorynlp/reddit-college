  "text": "So this semester has been beyond my hardest. From transferring to a new school, taking the most hours I have ever taken, to just feeling isolated, switching meds, my cracks really started to show\n\nOne class I am in is a Tues & Thurs class. Tuesday we write 2-3 sentences on what we read; Thursday a quiz short essay question.\n\nHaving ADHD, taking this in class is extremely difficult given that there are numerous distractions and I need more time.\n\nThrough the DRC on campus, I'm granted extra time and a distraction reduced enviorment. But when I went to my professor, he said, \"I send the questions at least a day prior to the quiz, why can't you do the quiz before class, copy, and paste your answer with the rest of us.\"\n\nI thought this was a really good idea, and I wanted to show that I am capable. Then I forgot. I barely keep up to begin with. How am I suppose to add more to my plate in a class where there is already so much responsibility? You're literaly telling the kid with ADHD:\n\n*oh, you have problems with executive function? Oh you have accomidations to help you? Well, let's do this to accommodate you instead of what the DRC says and give you more to do than the rest of the class... because my idea is more accommedating...*\n\nbut at the end of the day... i know it is my fault.\n\nI should have been my own advocate and said, \"no, I need my accommodations to be honored.\" but then, every class I would stick out like a sore thumb. Having to leave the classroom and then return late would be humiliating every class. In-fact, I tried this. but couldn't find a quite place and did even worse, and returned to my seat with stigma louder than I could bare.\n\nI'm terrified to talk to my professor... it is my fault... im the one with adhd, and i failed to speak up.\n\nI have missed 4 quizzes, and I just want to be able to have the chance to do them with my accommodations. I stopped going to the class because of how it all made me feel.\n\nin the student rule, it says i can go to the dean and ask for an exception... *stigma gets louder*\n\nbut maybe I should email my professor all of this first and ask what he can do? *stigma stays loud*\n\nim just lost, depressed, and isolated...",

      "text": "Hey OP. I have ADHD too, and it plagued me in an oh so similar way on my first attempt at college. I'm in my 30s now and am doing just fine, as one day you will be too.\n\nFirst and foremost, remind yourself to be kind to yourself. Often times our anxiety and depression can make us forget that we are trying our best and that it's okay to take small steps at first. But never forget that you are valid and deserve kindness and compassion.\n\nSecond, understand that it's okay to reach out to anyone in your life, explain your situation, and ask for help. I can't tell you how many times my anxiety morphed simple tasks like emailing a boss/professor into these impossible situations in my mind. It takes strength to ask for help, and even if you don't get it you will ultimately feel better after trying.\n\nLast and most important of all, know that you're not alone. If you ever need to talk, message me anytime. I've made enough mistakes for several lifetimes and can at least tell you what not to do. If you have supportive family, I highly recommend getting them involved. If not, consider me your anxiety-ridden older brother. Best of luck out there, kid. Drink some water, get 8 hours of sleep, eat 3 meals a day, and get some sunshine. It helps more than you might think.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a little confused on what you\u2019re wanting. Do you want the extra time accommodations or not? It sounds like you do but then you list why you don\u2019t (stigma as you leave the class). If you don\u2019t, it sounds like his suggestion to prep the answers first before class was good. I mean I know you forgot once but why not try again? Keep a note and keep trying till you remember? If you strongly believe that won\u2019t help, then you\u2019re going to have to tolerate the feelings you get when the extra time accommodation is given. \nOn a side note, I have struggled with ADHD my whole life and it has been a struggle so I empathize. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get officially diagnosed till later in life and went through college unmedicated and without any ADA accommodations. Although it made school much harder, I appreciated this because I sought out CBT which helped me develop strategies to combat it without meds or extra time. Now in combination with my meds, I feel I am almost at par or at least as successful/effective as my non-ADD peers. I have learned very successful strategies for focus, organization and effectiveness that I think are even better than the meds alone. Very useful as once you graduate, these accommodations cease to exist and the best you can hope for is an understanding and patient boss. My last tip is to only put as much on your plate as you can handle. Maybe drop a class or take less credits, talk to the office to see if it\u2019s possible to get full time status for fewer credits if this is important to you for other reasons. I did not graduate in four years, although I had taken full time credits, I did the bare minimum to keep my head above water as best as possible.",

You doubt that self training can help? It took me 10 years to make a deadline on time. 10 years of feeling like a failure, 10 years of killing myself to try and get it done and it still not being done. But I don\u2019t regret a single failure, or a single late paper or a single attempt because every time I got faster and better and yeah sometimes I still failed (forgot when it was due, just didn\u2019t make it in time, etc) but every time I got better. Why that offends you so much that you would reply with such an incredibly rude and childish response I don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t believe I deserved it. I\u2019m sorry if it sounded like a broken record or invalidation of what you\u2019ve gone through but don\u2019t invalidate mine either. I gave a tip of something that has helped me enormously and not only got me through undergrad, but through my PhD and post-doc. Spit in my face if it makes you feel better.

It\u2019s a result of living in a world where asking for help\u2014in the form of therapy or drugs, for example, or the social safety net or charity\u2014can often be deemed suspect or a liability, because \u201cnormal\u201d people don\u2019t need it. And while we here can all say out loud that it doesn\u2019t penalize, that it doesn\u2019t make one less than, that doesn\u2019t negate all the voices and actions out there that *do* reinforce this, whether out loud or by their actions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that I think your advice here isn\u2019t potentially helpful\u2014I don\u2019t live with this disability so do not claim to know it\u2014but we all need to try to understand where we are all coming from. Maybe OP has had a lot of pushback in their life, or different pushback than you have experienced. I think it is great that you shared your experience, and OP is maybe coming from a different place.\n\nETA: I am directly responding to the idea that the stigma may be self imposed, when that is highly presumptive. You have no idea what pushback OP may be experiencing. And I think OP was trying to point out that sometimes language\u2014even when delivered in a spirit of accommodation\u2014can hedge on stigmatizing. Language itself can be truly debilitating, just like normative academic structures and expectations, to which OP is evidently feeling some chafing to try to conform to, and which do not apparently feel remediated by the options generally available here.\n\nI also recognize here that I am going on for far too long when I have the sense you and I are quite allied in this. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb Thanks for engaging with me on this, too.",
