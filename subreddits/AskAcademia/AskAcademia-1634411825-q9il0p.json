  "title:": "Co-authorship for a sexual harasser?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD student in a stem field working on a project in collaboration with a national lab. The project team is 2 PI\u2019s (one at the university and one at the National lab), and a few postdocs and staff scientists (and me). At one point one of the female postdocs at the university let me know that one of the National Lab team members was sexually harassing her via email. They have never met in person and the harasser is much older with a wife and kids. The guy is a creep. She informed our PI\u2019s and he was removed from the project and \u201ccorrective actions\u201d were taken, though he kept his job (for now at least). \n\nNow I am preparing a manuscript for this project and the sexual harasser did make contributions worthy of a coauthorship, but I don\u2019t really want to have him on the paper and I don\u2019t really want to correspond with him for edits. I will ask my supervisors about this as well but I wanted to find out what the consensus is about these types of situations. Thanks in advance.",

But think about all the people they push out of the field by their behavior and about the impact this has on minority groups in the field, during the time they stayed on. \n\nThe research community should come together and come up with a universal policy on handling these situations and not leave early-career researchers trying to sort this out on their own. Of course, using his work without giving him attribution is a huge no-no.",
