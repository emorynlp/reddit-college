  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nSo I'm a first year phD in the Social Sciences and I've been struggling to be happy for myself and celebrate my accomplishments without the enthusiastic support of my family and some friends? Being the first PhD in my family from an inner city and female and African American, I feel like none of my inner family can relate and are so busy trying to get by the don't have the bandwidth to be truly happy for me and express support. Personally, I am proud of myself as I am fully funded and received additional external fellowship, but I am truly disappointed. It seems lonely at the \"top\". I worked so hard to get in and stay in during the pandemic but my family just doesn't seem to care and I want to be able to celebrate with them and feel loved/support. This is just not what I expected. It feels like the further along I move in my education the more I alienate or distinguish myself from \"normal\" non academic peers and family/friends. Do you all have any advice on this subject?",

One thing that I\u2019d say is that graduate school, just like any other career move is an individual endeavor and no one is really going to cheerlead you every step of the way, save maybe your spouse or children. I suspect that your family is very proud of you and if you are looking for support and ask for it, they\u2019ll be more than willing. With that said, I would hope that you are equally involved in their lives, their accomplishments, etc. and celebrate them, even if they aren\u2019t quite \u201cat the top\u201d, as you say.",

It can be the exasperation you feel when talking to a less than educated relative. Or the pride you get when your group is favored for an opportunity. When I hit 100k I felt like I was better, smarter, more hardworking, and that my people just didn\u2019t get the keys to success. I was full of shit but I didn\u2019t know it, and alienated some really good folks along the way. I\u2019m not saying this is you at all, since I don\u2019t actually know you. But I\u2019m smelling whiffs of my 20 year old self here, so had to throw my 2 cents in.",

I should try to be more involved in the lives of some of my family and friends as well. I don't want to become elitist but its good to do self-check ins along the way. I can be arrogant or egotistical at times, since I am competitive which maybe off putting to some. Lol I really dont mean to be an asshole at times I'm just a proud person at times but theres so much I have to work on and LEARN outside of the classroom",

      "text": "You are not alone.\n\nKeep in mind that there *are* families and communities who see success as an academic professional to be a great accomplishment. So what you're experiencing is not universal. It's probably uncommon. Many of your colleagues will be consistently affirmed for what they do, because they already come from the academic/professional class. This is the part of changing your economic class that nobody tells you about: the people we care about don't know how to interpret our work lives anymore. \n\nIn my experience, this also never goes away. From graduate school, to dissertation, to PhD, to becoming a professor, to publishing a book, the people who affirm you will be the people who have grown up or adapted to the economic class that already affirms those things as accomplishments. So you'll get that from your teachers, colleagues, and eventually your students, but never from the community you grew up in, not really.\n\nI don't have good advice, since it still disappoints me. About a month before my grandpa died I was hired for a great, rare tenure track job at a well-known prestigious college. When I tried to talk to my grandpa about it, he hadn't heard of it and didn't know what tenure was. He just asked if it was union work. It made me profoundly sad that I couldn't really convey to him why he should be proud. And it's not that he wasn't proud, he just had no frame of reference to understand what I had done.\n\nOk, I do have advice. For me, this experience makes me kind to students. I know why it's easy for some students to keep their shit together at college; their whole community is expecting them to and affirming them when they do. And more importantly: I know just how hard it is to keep up when you don't come from a community like that. But for both sides of that struggle, students are all just caught in the brittle, barely-visible class hierarchy of our societies. So: let this struggle make you kind.",

      "text": "Feel this deeply. I am a first generation mixed race woman with a STEM PhD. On the white side of my family, two of my male cousins have gone on to PhD programs in social sciences. They are The Family Geniuses and the family is so proud and in to what they do, but for me the response was \u201cthere\u2019s no way I could understand that stuff\u201d and never wanted to talk about my work or ideas. \n\nMy advice is first to never let your academics be your identity. PhD students and early career academics are so entangled with their studies and work that it is sometimes more than just part of them and it\u2019s so unhealthy. Take your families disinterest in your work as disinterest in the subject, not in you. Highlight your accomplishments to them - I won an award, I got funding for a big project, I published an article, I was invited to get a talk. Focusing on the tangibles helps people outside of academia understand what\u2019s a win and keeps the mind numbing jargon away from them. \n\nThe second potentially helpful thing you can do is get involved with groups or clubs for first gen students or other affinity groups. They can\u2019t replace your family, but sharing successes and gripes with people who just get it is grounding. \n\nLast but not least, find yourself a mentor in your field. It could be your advisor, someone in your sub field or just some professor you connect with. One good mentor can add immeasurable value to your PhD experience. \n\nThe PhD for anyone is tough, but it can be even worse for someone who isn\u2019t getting support. It sucks that your family just can\u2019t give you what you need right now, but I promise you, you can and will find it! \n\nGood luck and congrats on one year down!",

We mist accept it's the way it is, because most people only experienced study and work in their lives, and a phd fits poorly in both.\n\nI would also recommend to make one or two good friends in the program who share your experience, the successes and the frustration. More generally however, I would advise you to learn how to gratify yourself for your successes. It is very important to become independent from anyone other's judgement (yet not immune to criticism!) for our mental health. This is particularly so in a competitive field like research where criticisms are institutionalized but awards and recognition only come late in our careers. I try to reward myself for my successes and to communicate them to people in a way that is relatable to their experience, and it mostly works ;)\nGood luck with your phd!",

Male, white, working-class background from the middle of nowhere KY, raised in a fundamentalist household. I did my Bachelor's > Master's > double PhD with no break. My family never seemed impressed or expressed genuine happiness for my advances in life. The more education I received, the more alienated I felt from family/home. \n\nWhen I received my bachelor's degree, I was told the entire family wanted to chip in to purchase a handmade guitar for me (I played and taught guitar lessons all through HS and undergrad). They didn't do that. In fact, they never even bothered to try (we were poor, but they also constantly overspent, were financially unstable, and had 4-5 car loans, despite only needing 2 cars, etc., etc.). Instead, my mother bought me cheese fries at Long Horn (a fancy meal for us) and my father made fun of the phrase \"summa cum laude when my name was called for graduation. For my master's...we ate at Burger King. I celebrated my dissertation defense completely alone in an Airbnb w/ a pizza. It was lonely. I hope your experience is better (celebrate with friends). I clearly articulated that I wanted some sort of support to my family, but they don't really \"do emotions\" outside of the context of speaking in tongues in church and the like.\n\nAnyway, all this to say, I've experienced something similar on my educational/career trajectory. It can be extremely lonely and alienating, as you said. I will add this though, in hindsight, I wish I had celebrated and been proud of myself/my accomplishments more (I was indoctrinated to be celebration was sort of sinful/conceited). \n\nCongratulations on all of your accomplishments thus far.",

      "text": "I always find it encouraging to watch scientific talks or programmes, like the world science festival. So many researchers are great and admirable people, thinking of yourself as joining their circle is an awesome feeling. It's hard for others to relate to something they don't even have a proper concept of, don't expect them to. We are only disappointed when we have the wrong expectations. Also, don't underestimate how embarrassing it can be to have an achiever in the family, people don't like talking about it but humans always compare themselves to others. \n\nMy advice is basically to not involve them too much, find a circle of people who are also pursuing a degree and share your academic ups and downs with them. You are distinguished from \"normal\" people, it's not just that it feels like it, and part of your growth is to learn to live with the fact that most people you meet will seem kind of ignorant and shallow and most people won't be able to appreciate your work. You have to learn to celebrate for yourself and with people who understand what you're celebrating.\n\nThink of the many situations other people go through that are similar in that nobody sees their effort and the amount of work they're doing. Take a single parent, any underappreciated housewife in the history of humanity, teachers, nurses. Most people have to deal with feelings of their work being 99\u2105 invisible at some point of their life. You are lucky enough to be able to reflect upon it and thus better equipped to deal with it than most people!\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm really happy you made it that far and I will keep you in my memory, hoping for the best.

As a PhD, I haven't had this experience at all, and honestly describing non-PhD's like this is gross. It's true that people won't be able to appreciate the true impact of your work bc that's dependent on specialized knowledge of the state of the field, usually. But anyone who is good at their job should be able to explain what they do to a 5yo. Most people I encounter are really interested to know what I do for a living, and when I explain it in a simple way they have a bunch of questions and ideas. The onus is on you to explain your work in a way anyone could understand, rather than concluding people without your highly specialized knowledge are ignorant and shallow. Same goes for your career: it's on you to explain why grad acceptance is a big deal. Not knowing why that is doesn't make someone an idiot. Yikes dude.",

Going through a PhD has this special power of transforming you ever so subtly in how you ask questions, how you respond to people's assertions - and yes, as a woman, whether you are easily impressed or intimidated. So the idea of staying involved in the lives of your family members is the best piece of advice , and I would add that if you want to share the joy at the top, you're going to have to look for friends and partners from among your peers. \nGood luck on your path!",

People with PhDs aren\u2019t more \u201cspecial\u201d or better experts in their fields than other people who work and succeed in specialized fields. I worked in a very challenging profession before entering a PhD program. Most people, including my family, had *no clue* what I did, the skills I needed to do it, or the challenges I faced. I was fine with that because not everyone could have done the job I did. And I respected their professions just as much as mine. And I\u2019ll tell you the truth - I respect people working on the ground in my field in an entirely different way than I respect the researchers in my field, of whom I have joined the ranks. I\u2019m not totally proud of my decision to leave my field work to go into academia, but I\u2019m coming to terms with it. No profession is more \u201cdistinguished\u201d than another. As a researcher, you do yourself and the populations you study a disservice if you think that. You are simply training for a different professional setting than others, that\u2019s all.\n\nAlso - I think a reckoning is coming for researchers. The growing distrust of scientists and research in the last several years means it\u2019s time for scientists to stop trusting only the media to disperse scientific \u201ctruths\u201d. We have to figure out a way to communicate our findings, and all of their caveats and murkiness, directly to the public in a way that\u2019s comprehendible, and no longer leave interpretation up to news media or social media. We\u2019re a bunch of smart people. I\u2019m sure we can figure it out.",

It also usually occurs when you\u2019re in your 20s, when you\u2019re learning to think on your own anyway, and you and your family are adjusting to your becoming an adult in mind and independence. Even for people who aren\u2019t in college, I think it\u2019s normal in your 20s to feel some kind of distance from family members who are adjusting to the fact that they aren\u2019t the primary influencers of your thoughts and beliefs anymore.",

The responses to my acceptance from my family (extremely low SES background and first gen for most of my educational experiences):\n- people thinking I\u2019m smarter about specific subjects I haven\u2019t even studied/intend to study and lots of misconceptions of what a Ph.D is.\n- extremely flat reactions with \u201ccongrats\u201d seeming more like a long sigh almost saying \u201coh great, more school\u201d.\n- less celebration and more shrugs as I explain the place I\u2019m moving to/what I\u2019ll study.\n- lots and lots of disconnect from the people I grew up with and even my current cohort as they go into the workforce with their clinical degrees and I\u2019m still heading into another 4 years of having a lower income and not practicing. \n\nI learned these lessons after constant disappointment even entering my masters:\n- have friends in your program and \u201cacademic friends\u201d. These are the people you talk passionately with about research, your subject, your interests. These people fill the void that may exist talking with family and friends who don\u2019t have your educational background. I personally really surround myself with this crowd because my family and friends from my childhood are so disconnected I almost feel isolated. No one in my life has made it this far.\n- have a significant other or romantic partner completely separate from research and school. My partner is my rock and my biggest cheerleader but has no idea what I\u2019m talking about when I bring school up. His family and mine are very supportive but show a lot of misunderstanding towards what I\u2019m doing and will often view or reference me as \u201cthe super smart one in the room\u201d yet my imposter syndrome tells me otherwise. This additional support and minimal questioning of what I\u2019m doing (although I\u2019d love for them to be curious and ask me anything related to it) makes me feel like I can do anything I need/want related to my work and research without hindrance. It\u2019s tough when you want to talk about it with loved ones but it honestly is a blessing in disguise.\n- have a crew of people who show love and support but don\u2019t necessarily fall in the other two categories. These are your fun people who will be understanding of your circumstances when you dip for a few months due to burnout and being overworked but help you break out of the shell that can come when you are only surrounded by fellow academics. You can easily burn yourself out listening to the complaints or negativity of fellow Ph.Ds as we all seek to listen and support each other.\n- FIND HOBBIES AND OUTLETS! Workout, go birding, hike, be a craft beer enthusiast, anything. Expand your life beyond the work of the Ph.D. so it\u2019s not the only thing you feel is defining you and I promise it helps take off the edge of pain you get when people don\u2019t understand how hard you\u2019re working. I am slowly realizing people are more interested in hearing about my hobbies and side passions than my academic work and I guess it makes sense - how often do you like hearing about others on their work or even work accomplishments we don\u2019t know anything about? It really really sucks but it gets better and having multiple support systems will even it out. But part of it is accepting that you are doing more than your family and that\u2019s not a bad thing to feel a little isolated. You can love those around you but receive the support and congratulations from the people who get it.\n\nCongrats, you are a rockstar for doing this us strangers are very proud of you.

My extended family talks about our professional lives sometimes but mostly we like to talk about family stuff or other fun stuff. Which seems pretty normal to me. I don\u2019t think most of them even remember I\u2019m in a PhD program. I sometimes discuss it with parents and siblings, mostly because sometimes we have to plan around my study schedule.

What\u2019s so exceptional about me going through job training for mine (which essentially is what a PhD *is* - job training for academia)?\n\nDon\u2019t think of yourself as \u201cat the top\u201d just because you are in a PhD program. The only thing that differentiates you from others is that you chose to go into academia, and others chose to go into different fields (that are just as worthwhile). Someone who knows their field inside and out, has the respect of their peers, and brings positive changes to their workplace - that\u2019s someone who is \u201cat the top\u201d - whether they\u2019re a plumber, a teacher, an engineer, or a secretary.\n\nI\u2019m sure your family is proud of you even if they don\u2019t bring it up all the time. They probably just see you as an adult now. And adults don\u2019t get as much constant praise as kids.

She projects that I look down on her somehow. I mean, I don't. But in her head I do. There's nothing I can really do about that. It's weird because it's like, don't you want your kids to do better than you did? And by better, I mean both financially as well as having the ability to live authentically. \n\nDo what you love, and accept that optionally not everyone is going to come with you on the ride. I'm not African American but I am a mixed person of color, so I can't comment on how race might impact your specific situation, but class is a big part of it.

I recently read \u201cMoving Up Without Losing Your Way: The Ethical Costs of Upward Mobility\u201d by Jennifer M. Morton, and I found it incredibly validating and insightful. In this book, Morton explores the experience of \u201cstrivers\u201d\u2014those of us who used education as \u201ca way out\u201d of the circumstances we were born into and the challenges that come along with utilizing education as a path for upward class mobility. In my case, my income level has stayed low (less than 40k a year at my highest salary atm), but I still experience the loneliness and apathy from my family that you described without the income difference.\n\nI found this book really validating with regard to myself, but even more so, I found it useful as a teacher when considering how to support my students and their relationship with their family/culture. I come from a working class household and had parents that struggled with personality disorders and substance abuse. I am the first and so far only person in my family to graduate college let alone advanced degrees. I teach refugees and immigrants, so this is extremely relevant for my work. You might find it relevant for you and/or your students, too!",

To serve as representation and visibility as another way or alternative instead of the negative media depictions of black people. I kind of see wealth or upward mobility as a side current or tangential goal. I want to enjoy my profession and make a difference in the lives of students, young adults. I don't really care about publish or perish at all and just want to teach and do that to the best of my ability. But anyway sidetracked..thanks again love for your comment",

It sucks when you're not able to share your happiness with friends and families but sometimes that's how it is. It's ok to outgrow your friends and families. In your case, if you really want them to be feel happy and be proud of you, perhaps you can talk to them. Very often people don't understand how academia and PhD work, and tend to think that it's just a few more years of taking classes instead of getting an actual job. Maybe you can try explaining to them (if you haven't already) how much you've achieved and how much their support means to you, then maybe things will take a turn.",

Sometimes parents especially have no idea how to be emotionally supportive, especially if there is generational trauma. My parents lived through some historical trauma in their home country and as a result internalized the message that feelings should be suppressed/don't matter and if you are just putting food on the table you are a good parent and your child will do the rest.\n\nI also want to say that there are definitely cases where things can devolve into outright hostility. My mom is supportive but has completely flown off the handle if I say something that makes her think I'm \"pulling rank.\" I don't do this intentionally but she projects that people think she is stupid, since she is ashamed about not having gotten the same kind of education.\n\nMy BFF from grad school is biracial and had it much worse. Her Dad was seriously antagonistic and guilt-tripped her about making it and leaving the family (her other two siblings are still at home in their 30s/40s).",

      "text": "I am in a similar boat. I come from a poor family in the boonies - first BA ever let alone PhD. I often get less than optimism and happiness from family - i sometimes get extremely negative feedback. My BA was from a very prestigious school that was well known for Vietnam era protests and leftism in general. Family members would jipe at the liberal hippy BS good for nothing brainwashing i was wasting my time with. Now I'm in a very prestigious department in a smaller university and they jipe at me for more wasted time and can't even get into as good of a school as my BA (this department and my advisor are THE #1 choice for what I'm doing. I legit jackpot hit this out of the park getting in here fully funded).\n\nNot a sob story for me - but just wanted to relate with you. You aren't alone at all, although it feels like it. We are often alone in our departments too. My cohort had one dude who ever had a job outside of academia cuz he took a break after his BA and one other student who came from a working family. The rest are either from elite families in the states or abroad. There is nobody in this entire department that watched their parent(s) struggle to make bills, live in a place that got condemned, or had to struggle to survive themselves. Coming from a poor, uneducated urban family (or rural in my case) leaves us in a situation that we are so different than our peers. \n\nSo we neither have that commonality here or back home. We are the odd ducklings. Thus, it is important that we don't rely on outside sources to make us feel good about ourselves. We must find self satisfaction and know that what we are doing is special. What we are doing is unique. And what we are doing is damn well harder than what people realize, either back home or among our peers here at our institute. It's OUR journey, OUR education, and OUR success.",

      "text": "Im not saying your family is narcissistic, but I had this problem alot in mine. Its not that they arent supportive, they do say like oh wow thats great, etc, but its almost like they dont care at all because it has nothing to do with them. I graduated with my 3rd degree, retired from the military, two kids, the kids they were into for the first couple years, but all in all absolutely lackluster response.\n\nBut i've learned also thats its toxic of me to not have boundaries around my expectation for other people. Just because somebody doesnt treat me the way I want doesnt make it their fault exactly and im trying to unlearn it, but I can definetaly call a spade, a spade, and I know that I am very appreciative and I definetaly know how to spot somebody with talent and skill.\n\nIf youre not like your family and this is the response you get when you get accomplishments, most likely are dealing with a narcissistic family dynamic, where you outgrew the family's expectation for you, usually parents gas light to keep their children under a certain par for the course so they never really excel. I cant vouche if this is your case but I can tell you right now if i met you and you said your story I'd say youre one of the most talented peopel I met that day from your display of perservance and dedication to your craft.\n\nSome people also to simplify my narc rant, some people cant stand being outshined, outperformed, especially when they have expectation for you to follow and in your own organic way you fashion a life together that is completely unlike the one everyone envisioned for you, and in the end you were happier, more successful while looking back you can see that it was other peoples guilts keeping you down.\n\nI know it sucks, all you want to do is have a party to celebrate your achievements and half the time youre dealing with other people not caring enough.\n\nI say it was you that got you on your own path, maybe its time to go off and find people who really deserve to celebrate with you.\n\nLastly I do recongize people can be energy draining so maybe celebrate by yourself as well. Learning how to appreciate yourself and do things for you and learning how to bond with yourself and your accolades personally is a much stronger connection to oneself than finding other people to pull it out from.\n\nThis way if youre somebody who likes to just do their own thing , be on their own way when you do meet people its not so important what they think of you cause your value is placed within yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis takes alot of mental strength as this turns out to be so much more than degrees, retirement, accolades, Ph.d.\n\nWe're literally learning how to rewire ourselves and breaking down the ego. That is what is very hard for people is letting the ego go, thats really the biggest problem with being alone is simplifying thought patterns and understanding other people are you and you are them.\n\nI know that sounds ridiculous but its true, the more i stop creating boundaries between how different i am to people I dislike or people I hate or i have indifference too, I take it in and think I too could have become that if I wasnt so aware of being better than that.\n\nBut that alone doesnt justify bringing the wall down to protect you against malevolent nature.\n\nSome people just raised in rubble and some people are raised beside it.\n\nYour entire life is a constant filtering and vetting of picking the best DragonBall Z squad",

But upon deeper reflection, I realized some accomplishments may read as pretentious, so I actually appreciate your raw and honest opinion. Not everyone has to agree or have the same views which is why I posed the question. The thing is getting a phd is impressive most schools have like 6% acceptance rate or lower. And black women only make up 3% of doctoral recipients in the US. So it is impressive and possible a bit elitist but I guess my next question would be how to celebrate accomplishment that are rare without coming off as pretentious or a prick?",

My suggestion is this, look no further then yourself for happiness, or, network, I guarantee your not alone. Other doctor will understand. It\u2019s just a matter of finding them. Congrats",

      "text": "Hi! You have plenty of input but maybe my experience might be interesting as well lol. \n\nMy family sees doing a PhD as being a \"perpetual student\" and not really being a worker. I think they see it as a symptom of privilege (in my country PhDs are not financially supported), despite the fact that I'm on the other side of the world and also completely funded by my uni.\n\nI see this as coming from a place of not being very knowledgeable on academia and stuff like that. For me personally I also try to explain what I'm doing and explain it to them in layman terms, so they can engage with the actual topic I'm studying. \n\nBut I think most of all I've tried to celebrate myself and my successes more, and it's given me more autonomy to look for motivation and support within myself rather than coming from outside. It's kinda curbed that \"looking for approval\" type of motivation that I have personally experienced in the past when trying to excell. \n\nI do have to say that my mother is the other way and is very supportive despite not being super familiar with academia, so that helps a lot. Maybe there is that one person who is there to support you and you can echo your success off them, but I think this is also an opportunity to become more self-reliant and be your own cheerleader! :)",

Buttt, even PhDs with little similarities in research/background have been very supportive, the kindness of stranger can go a surprisingly long way! I've been restricted to online so on here, discord, twitter etc. \n\nI also just reached out to researchers I thought I could connect with. Only one didn't reply! The rest we connected on zoom and sometimes it is just a relief to vent and say I KNOW RIGHT! Haha. But also really helped me to see women, especially Black women futher in their academic career. Also hearing other people amped up about what they are doing can be pretty good motivation and lift your mood. \n\nI'm not sure I'd have made it through the first months without some nice strangers letting me vent, or just chatting really. \n\nI'm also trying harder to communicate what I'm doing better. No one around me has had a similar experience so I know sometimes it goes over their head but I do see glimmers of hope and genuine interest! I think for me I just rely on them slightly less to get it all but try to be clear that I need their support. Easier said than done though. \n\nIf you do want to vent or chat feel free to DM!

I\u2019m mostly self taught although I\u2019m about 10 credits shy of a AA degree. \n\nAll I would say is if you have yet to make any significant income doing what your going to school for at this point I\u2019d be concerned for you. This comes from my belief that unless your training to be a doctor, most of college is a gimmick and waste of yours and taxpayers money. I personally feel a lot of what is taught for most subjects is just impractical in the sense that most entry positions do not really require you to know much of what you spent a vast amount of time and money in school learning. In my experience it\u2019s been much easier learning on the job and much faster because you see the what, why, and how in practice instead of studying hypotheticals and theory. \n\nDon\u2019t know what your studying but I\u2019d say chances are, your wasting your money",

Proud of me, but I\u2019ve always had trouble finding ANYone around here who cared at all about my field of study or education. And, I was much younger than my peers when I got my Master\u2019s, so I couldn\u2019t relate to them either. I kind of had to wait until I started teaching community college, and then I just poured all that passion and desire into the classroom. I still just talk to my family and friends about funny shows or what\u2019s going on with family and friends. Their eyes all glaze over when I talk about my field and they still don\u2019t much care that I have a master\u2019s degree. I feel the same would be true if I were a PhD. Actually, out here in the rural areas, if I got a PhD I\u2019d probably be viewed more suspiciously because they think education is really just meant to indoctrinate students to become liberals. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

      "text": "Yeah, I get this. I'm from an impoverished background, the kind where nobody thinks anything good comes from where I grew up. Initially my family really didn't know how to support me, and most still don't. I think the moment my mom, especially \"got\" how important it was to me to have any kind of acknowledgement from them was during a weird family time where my sister was having her wedding and I graduated my MA and entered my PhD at the same time. The focus was entirely on my sister, and at one point I was so dispirited I broke into tears because no one had even said they were proud of me for my accomplishments. Since then, my mom has at least said she's proud of me a few times, so that's nice. I've since graduated (defended during the pandemic), and that's added to my sense of alienation.\n\nI think the key is to communicate as best as you can. Even if your family doesn't understand your experiences, if they love you and want to support you, they will at least be able to understand it's important to /you/. Sometimes communicating how rare this kind of experience is helps-- only about 2% of the American population gets a PhD. \n\nKeep in mind some communities (like mine) feel like moving away from the original experience can spark fear and resentment, mostly because they're afraid you're going see yourself as \"better\" than them. This might play into family members and friends withholding support. I don't have any advice on how to combat this, but as I kept working on my parents' farm through my MA and PhD, I think this eased people's fears.",
