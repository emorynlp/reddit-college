  "text": "I work in an academic research institute where everyone has some type of STEM PhD.  I am typically the \"get shit done person\" (engineering), but left out of the initial decision making process when grants are written because Im not mathy / physicsy enough.  Normally not a concern for me, but projects end up being a cluster because the grants are based in theory and implementation is somewhat of an after thought.  Additionally, coworkers speak a lot of jargin and/or highly specific language which I am not versed in and eyes get rolled whenever I try to offer constructive criticism.   Best analogy I can give is a restaurant owner giving a chef a bunch of tv dinners and telling him to make Michelin star quality food.   Just venting I suppose...Anyone else have similar experiences?",

In research because it is in the cutting edge, it would be a disservice to yourself if you keep yourself to a bottle \"engineer\". You are a scientist. Period. To be relevant, you need to understand their theories and provide them that link if they cant provide that link to you. Build the bridge. Explain to them the limitations of certain theories in application science. Then brainstorm. :) you can do it. And believe me.. when you show you are useful to them..youd be flooded with meetings of people wanting to hear your opinion on things.",

      "text": "It is not clear if you have a PhD or not but this part stood out a bit:\n\n> but left out of the initial decision making process when grants are written because Im not mathy / physicsy enough\n\nIf you don't have a PhD, why would you be part of the decision making process? Surely you can contribute like hundreds of grad students do when their advisors ask them to write up a proposal but the decision making solely rests with PIs and Co-PIs, both of whom need to have terminal degrees.\n\nSorry but that's how it is. PIs and Co-PIs are primarily responsible for achieving whatever goals they say the grant is supposed to work towards. You are absolutely right in that there are pragmatic issues or constructive criticism that can be raised during the brainstorming/writing process but for many researchers that is the \"application\" phase and not the pure exploratory phase where a lot of work is honestly improvisational and has to be left a bit vague for room to maneuver during actual research.\n\nIf you already have a PhD then ignore everything. Sorry your colleagues are shitheads. Maybe you can talk to your group manager?\n\n> highly specific language which I am not versed in\n\nAgain, this is a \"you\" problem. Depending on how long you've been at the institute, this should not be a hurdle whatsoever. If you've joined within the past year, that's ok, you can work towards addressing this. But then that would also explain why you're left out of the grant writing process. It takes time to demonstrate expertise when it comes to writing a grant which is already a stressful process for everyone involved.\n\nYou can entertain all sorts of pithy, anecdotal comments like \"Jargon is big in the USA\" and that \"people overstate what they're doing\" but jargon is useful because if everyone has the same starting point, you can get ideas across very easily and context is already established. I'm not saying that people who intentionally obfuscate their work don't exist, but you can't assume that a majority of people who speak using terms particular to their area of research are doing it intentionally.\n\nEdit: pasting my same comment below on \"big names getting grants and not worrying about details\"\n\nIts not exactly unique to academia...\n\nThat's why you have CEOs and Directors and so on. Someone has to focus on the big picture and not get bogged down by details. Someone else has to worry about the details and not let details derail the long term goal. Unfortunately, one of those roles is not as attractive as the other. That's life.",

I built up enough of a financial safety net to stay afloat to hold me over and have been \"recovering\"/working on my mental health since.\n\nIf you're still at your job, I would apply far and wide to positions that is remotely interesting to you or you have a few of the qualifications for. I didn't get a callback for interviews until March/April and I applied in Sept/Oct/Nov/Dec. Usually hiring season usually cycles around graduation cycles. So a lot more opportunities start popping up around April/May/June and then Sept/Oct/Nov. So, if you can hang on, stay at your job until you've got a start date for the newer job.\n\nAlso, idk about your qualification, but don't count yourself out before you actually begun! You say you're not sure if you'll make it in industry, **but** what if you do? You'll never know if you don't try and when applying, the worse thing that could happen is that they say no. And that \"no\" isn't a \"no\" forever. It's a \"no\" for right now. Bet on yourself OP!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Also, network! With covid going on its harder, but linkedin is your friend. If you find a recruiter for a company you're interested in, don't be afraid to send them a message or an email! They're always looking for talent and in my experiences, have helped find a place/position in a company. Just make sure you've refreshed your linkedin and resume/cv to be ready to hand over when asked.",
