  "title:": "Risk or not with more experiments for MS",
  "text": "Before pandemic I was starting the last part of my project with a collaboration. My lab didn't have the resources and expertise so I was going to another lab to do it. Unfortunately with pandemic restrictions that collaboration ended and every non cov related research was put on hold. With the results I had at that time I write a MS, then my advisor and other PhDs reviewed it and agree it was good enough to make the cut on a small journal. The thing is reviewers asked more experiments, then did some of that and rejected the paper\u00f1. We tried another journal with lower impact and they asked for the experiment I couldn't finish due to cov (the collaboration one). Things are slowly coming back to 'normal' yet our lab doesn't have the resources to do that assay and it might take a while to even try to do it. I have two options: give a try and look for other collaboration or a grant to fulfill those experiments required by the reviewer? Or should I try another journal? I just want to finish that and go I'm discouraged about academia and wouldn't mind to work outside this field.",

      "text": "Are you fixed on publishing in a journal? If not would publishing it in a pre-print archive be sufficient, or if you're in the life sciences you could check out eLife or f1000. The problem with peer review is reviewers will always feel obliged to suggest further work that could improve the paper. The most perfect paper in the world would probably still get a suggestion for one more piece of data collection, it's the nature of the beast. As you're ready to get out perhaps a different platform would work better.",

          "text": "Thanks. My advisor is the one fixed with that journal. I talked with him today and he's convinced I have to do more experiments, supposedly we'll have the materials to do it all. I guess I'll have to believe him or give up on my project and quit, which I've been considered too, sometimes academia is not as fun as it should be.",
