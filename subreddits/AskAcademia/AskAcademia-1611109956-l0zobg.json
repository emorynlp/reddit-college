  "text": "My husband is a TT at a community college in the US in a department that he loves. I currently adjunct at a few colleges in the area, but I don't foresee a full-time position opening up for me, so I'm thinking of changing careers. The trouble is that we live in a small, rural city that doesn't offer many career opportunities for people with my academic background. \n\nSo, I'd love to hear what your spouses do, especially if you live in a small city. Do they enjoy it? How do you handle different schedules/summers off?",

      "text": "I met my wife in grad school in 1977; she came in one year later than did I. I first saw her as I wandered into the department and she was in front of the building talking to people. Then I saw her in the computer center hitting a keyboard trying to login. I took the opportunity to help her and meet her. Then 5 months later at our annual Charles Darwin Birthday party we really met and stayed together since.\n\nShe finished her MA and decided to not pursue her PhD (ours was a PhD program where we got an MA on the way). She managed to get a job as a programmer (knowing virtually nothing!) at the hospital rehab center. She spent hours at night trying to get a PDP11 to run. Another programmer there took pity on her and handed her a piece of paper that said, 2+3=5 and told her that as soon as she could get the machine to run that calculation come back and talk with him. She did and he helped her out a bit more, then he hired her as a programmer for his side business making spirometers for the military. So, she's a self-taught programmer-and is really good at it.\n\nMeanwhile I finished my doctorate and came to a community college 80 miles away. I assumed she'd just move up with me but she stood firm on her Wisconsin small town morals and told me she wasn't moving to a small town and live with me unmarried. Marriage was a new idea for me but I embraced it.\n\nThe first month we were in our town she sat at home. Then the local school system got a PDP11 and called our CC and asked if they had a recent graduate who might be able to program it. Fortunately I'd had a conversation with the head of the Computer Operations program who told them to call my wife rather than hire a new student. Of course she was able to make the thing sing when she went in for an interview. She pretty quickly became the Director of Technology at the school system.\n\nShe worked 28 years there until she met the time requirements for her full teachers pension. Then she retired. At that time she came to our (now) baccalaureate college to teach as an adjunct. Then a full time person quit at the last minute and my chair and the dean came and asked me if my wife would like to teach full time for a year. I was married a long time by then and so told them that my wife was in an office down the hall and so they should ask her if she'd like to teach full time. They did and she did. It was supposed to be a one-year gig. But at the end of that year, again the chair and dean came and asked me if she'd like to continue. I continued to be smart and told them that she was still down the hall and to ask her. At that point the dean asked her if she'd like to be temporary instructor for the foreseeable future. She said yes. Then 4 years later I became chair of the department and couldn't supervise a spouse. The dean asked our acting president if my wife could officially move departments and simply answer to her, the dean, but the president wouldn't do it. Not a surprise because she came after a really bad president and minor scandal--she was going to be very careful. So, my wife retired again after 5 years at the college. I stayed 5 more years and then I retired--right before COVID. Thank goodness!\n\nSo, we managed to muddle through in small town. The school system might be a good place to find employment while biding your time for positions at the CC.",

So sometimes she\u2019ll have bid a normal (~$250 / h) rate for one day of the weekend, and a higher amount for the other, and they won\u2019t have been able to pull anything together for the latter so they\u2019ll accept her higher bid. Other times they\u2019ll accept her bid but modify the hours and still pay her the original amount \u2014 I think once they might have even paid her like $1k for 0 hours of work lol (they also want to keep their vets happy cos they\u2019re an obvious lynchpin of the whole operation). She's also really well liked by other staff, patients, and clients -- regularly gets nice voluntary feedback notes on how much a pleasure she is to work with!\n\nedit: this is also in the SF Bay Area, a magical land where things in general cost more and all the SWEs don't want Spot to get Parvo.",
