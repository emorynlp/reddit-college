I'm making sure that people sign the sign-out sheet when they finish the exam, and I'm keeping the completed exams organized (e.g. making sure the exam papers as well as the answer booklets are returned, and keeping exams from multiple sections separated, if they're writing simultaneously).  I'm also invigilating by watching for cheating and any other acts of academic inappropriateness.  And I'm watching the clock.\n\nIf any thoughts of worry enter my mind, it's when I'm using a new style of final exam and I'm wondering if I made it too easy or too hard.

Prior to that, however, I spent plenty of time sitting and waiting for students to finish taking exams. What goes through our heads? I was usually grading other end-of-semester assignments or reading papers or articles. Killing time. I would literally write the time on the board every 30 minutes, because sometimes the clocks in the classrooms were broken, wrong, or missing. And I hoped that everyone would finish early-- three hour finals are a long time to sit and try to keep busy.\n\nI much prefer not having exams at all. It wastes less of my time and requires the students to actually engage in higher-order thinking and application of knowledge--  my classes now all have projects or papers due at the end of finals week, which they can do from anywhere.  Many of my colleagues have followed suit, thankfully, so we've actually cut our finals period from a full week down to three days...I'd like to see it cut even more because too many students are stuck sitting around for days in order to take one 90-minute exam for a math or chem class.",
