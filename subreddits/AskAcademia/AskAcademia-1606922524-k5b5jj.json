  "text": "Out of curiosity! I once worked with the head of a PhD program who casually mentioned that the University's grade cutoffs for candidates sometimes leaves them with people who are great at coursework but have no research experience (implied: they drop out too). That's why he's not a fan of the cut-offs but it's the policy... and I'm also wondering if you choose RAs or TAs based wholly on their grades?",

              "text": "I have found students (with excellent GPAs) to be unreliable, as well. \n\nWhen I became an assistant professor, I found it a source of bemusement / slight irritation that with years of data (student outcomes) and corresponding admissions data, we *still* hadn't figured out what makes for a successful graduate student. I think there's a lot of agreement that the current measures (GPA, GRE scores, LORs) are unreliable indicators, at best. What, then, make for a good graduate student?\n\nI truly do believe graduate student success as a researcher comes down to a combination of personality traits, once you've broached the floor of being able to succeed in graduate school course (which I believe 50-70% of our applicants do). These traits are not as well-formed as I'd like, but descriptively they are:\n\n1. **Conscientiousness**: So much of a graduate student's success depends on their reliability, both in and outside the lab (and this also speaks to your point about showing to meetings, etc.). Follow through is *so* important in academia when it comes to completing experiments and writing papers. \n2. **Emotional Tenacity**: A tendency I've noticed of students at fairly well-known institutions: their *utter* inability to deal with failures, perceived or real. I understand it's my job to mentor my students academically and nurture them emotionally, but I've found far more success with students that bounce back and try even harder. Maybe this speaks to my mentoring style.\n3. **Risk-management skills**: Researchers, by and large, are venturing out into the unknown. Whether that means trying a new technique or formulating a new experimental paradigm, that means a certain amount of risk involved (both in terms of time and money). However, I've seen some students take this *too* far, without factoring their own abilities and experimental logistics. So this is a tough one... I'm still learning it myself!\n\nIf you could guarantee me a quantitative metric that assesses all three of these plus the requisite academic ability to pass graduate courses, I'll send you a box of whatever beverage you'd like. Until then, it's parsing it out from interviews, letters, and all the other indicators we currently have available.\n\nEdit: typo",

There are no +/- grades, and an \"F\" doesn't affect your GPA in any way (you just have to retake the class if it's one that's required for graduation). I think part of the reason for this was that we have 7-week quarters rather than semesters, so it's hard to make up a poor grade. To get good grades required conscientiousness and tenacity, because if your grade slipped it often fell into a death spiral. So between the larger \"buckets\" (which are probably more accurate) and the shorter time period for each course, plus a substantial project requirement, a lot of employers in the community knew that they were going to be hiring reliable engineers out of this institution.",

I've even heard from students \"but I did so much better than \\[my friend\\] who got an 82 and I got an 89! It isn't fair!\"\n\nIt really made me annoyed fairly quickly with both the students and the system that didn't let me distinguish between the \"almost a C\" and \"almost an A\" students.\n\nThe \"failure has no consequences\" thing I was very behind in theory, until I discovered that it so often resulted in people retaking the same class 2 or 3 times, or people just stopping to come as soon as their average dropped into the C-range because \"an F is better than a C.\" It was their choice, but when they did this in the middle of the semester after I'd been working with and helping them... it also drove me crazy.\n\nWe're on a semester system though; I actually would imagine both of my complaints would be much reduced with a shorter course period. Thank you for listening to my rant. :)",

Most professors at my school chose cutoffs based on class performance; one computer science professor in particular showed that in his classes, students almost always perfectly fell into three clusters each term, which made assigning grades easy. The shorter terms also helped. \n\nThe thing about the \"No Record\" failure system was that failure didn't have no consequences--the consequence was having to retake the class, which meant either \"overloading\" (taking 12 credits a quarter instead of 9, which carried an extra fee), taking the class over the summer (which cost an extra semester's tuition), or extending your time to degree. Many scholarships also required that students pass all the courses they took. So the consequence was financial rather than messing up your GPA for all time. I totally understand the frustration of someone just stopping a class in the middle of the term, though.",

However, the programs are so competitive that no one is going to bother with submitting that appeal. \n\nHowever, she did get into a really good grad program on the east coast. She spent some time interviewing at 2 or 3 labs to present on her post-grad work, and got endorsement from profs at those universities. Since those programs place more weight on prof input and willingness to accept a student than GPA, she was admitted.",

There are some disciplines where the coursework poorly reflects the actual demands of the job (e.g. apparently lab-based research), and disciplines where the coursework is a reasonable proxy for what you will be doing in the PhD (e.g. pure math). I find that people coming from the former background tend to argue that grades are not an indicator of future success, whereas people from the latter background see grades as a predictor. \n\nI also think this conversation tends to compare 4.0s to 2.0s, which is kind of missing the point. Like, of course you don't need a 4.0 to succeed in grad school. But I also don't think a C average tells us nothing and I get why many programs are reluctant to take a chance on someone with that background. Ceteris paribus, a person with a 3.5 is probably more likely to succeed in grad school than a person with a 2.0. I'm sure some people with a 2.0 could be fine scientists, but I think it's fair that they need to distinguish themselves from their brethren who don't care about school or don't have the chops.",

The rest are in industry/languishing in postdocs somewhere.\n\nSo, in my anecdotal experience, yeah GPA correlates with success.

Most proposed systems are just bad in different ways from the current system. Honestly I think introducing at least an element of randomness would probably be good for academia; ie some system where the committee picks their finalists (maybe 3-5x the number of slots) and the final decision is made as a lottery.

Both all As in graduate school.  But he has a strong passion and drive for his field that I do not, was willing to put in the extremely long hours to be a successful academic, and now is a full Professor and Head of his department.  I'm an NTT Lecturer because I didn't have the drive.  Any decent student can get a decent GPA but that doesn't make them primed for an academic career.  The drive to get experiences during undergraduate  I think predicts a LOT more.  I see it in my undergraduates now - a clear distinction between those getting the necessary experiences and those who aren't motivated to do so.",

Like, I suspect that the average cGPA across America is somewhere in the 3.3-3.5 range, and I suspect that people with sub-3 GPAs are underperforming by 1-1.5 SDs relative the AVERAGE student, not the valedictorian.

As in, if you have an EC that is related to your discipline, it's worth putting on the CV. It won't have much of a part in moving the needle though.\n\n> And I'm not aware of any data showing that interviewers are free from pervasive biases common within the broader population?\n\nI never said that interviewers were free of biases.

I've had students across the GPA gambit be good RAs but (anecdotally) the people with higher GPAs seem to have a harder time completing work independently and freak out often if things are not going according to plan. They also view their responsibilities as more optional for some reason while those with lower GPAs have completed work on time with no excuses.  \n\nAs a graduate student, everyone in my program has 3.8-4.0.
