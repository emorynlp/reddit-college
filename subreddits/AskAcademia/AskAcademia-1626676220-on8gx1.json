  "title:": "What Challenges Am I Facing If I Try To Become A Professor After 46?",
  "text": "Full disclosure:  this is my first post on Reddit (I\u2019ve replied a time or two but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been the OP). I looked for other posts with similar questions but I felt like my situation was nuanced enough that I couldn\u2019t find an answer that suited me. So here we are.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve made a few badly timed (but not necessarily bad overall) decisions in my life that have led me to this point so I need to start with a bit of back story.\n\nI graduated high school in 2000 and worked several different jobs (some part time, some full time) in a couple of different fields for a few years after graduation.  In 2006 (when I was 24), I decided to join the Air Force.  I served for 6 years, got out when I was 30 and started going to school.  I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do so I changed majors several times before settling on double majoring in math and economics. Because of those major changes and not always being able to go full time (and having to take some semesters off completely) due to building a family during that time as well, I took 8 years to graduate. The pandemic was in full swing and most places were shutting down/not hiring.  So, I continued to work a part time job that I had held for the last 5 years in the tutoring center of one of the local community colleges up to the present.  \n\nSo now, because of my wife's job, we are moving to Ohio and I am trying to find a job.  One of my professors had suggested that he thought I might do well in a Phd program so I am considering applying for a Phd in Economics when we move, but I wouldn't make the deadline to apply before next year (I'll be 40) and then wouldn't start the program until the following year (I'll be 41).  Assuming I make it through the program, I'll be at least 46 years old (quite possibly older depending on how things go).  I would be doing this with the goal of becoming a professor after getting my Phd.\n\nMy questions to all of you wonderful people is, what challenges am I facing by doing this?  Do you think it's worth it for me? Do colleges care about my age as long as I can still publish papers?  I'm worried that I might be goofed up either way since I don't have 20+ years in any one industry anyway, so in that sense, what can it hurt to try?",

      "text": "I entered a PhD program in applied economics and there were a few people in their 40s who entered (and finished!) the program. They had to be at least 46 when they finished. So it's definitely doable and I don't think they discriminate on age. I believe they are all going for faculty jobs at R1 schools too (it was a top program). \n\nOne thing I'll mention is the financial aspect. If you have a family, will you guys be able to be supported on just your wife's income? A PhD in economics is very very hard and you won't have time to do a part time job if you want to be successful. I'd assume the funding you'll get as a student with your stipend will be around $2k/month. \n\nAnother thing to consider is do you want to do research? I don't think you noted if you've done a master's in math or Econ, but doing a master's and writing a thesis could be a good gauge to see if you would want to go into research and get a PhD.",

I'm told this is pretty standard but honestly, I'm not sure how these things work).  So, besides some undergrad research projects (which, as anyone who has completed an undergrad degree knows, was not extremely rigorous) I have not been able to do any deep independent research.  That being said, since the program I'm applying to doesn't have a stand alone master's, I assume the students I'd be with would be in a similar boat?  ::shrugs::\n\nAs for the pay, my wife is currently the bread winner anyway.  As I noted in my post, I've been working part time as a tutor at a community college for about 5 years now.  I actually love my job!  Working with students is actually what made me consider this when we found out we were going to have to move. Tutoring doesn't pay much though (less than $2k a month).  So if I could get a $2k a month stipend in a state like Ohio that has a lower cost of living that Colorado, I think we might be ok.  =)",

              "text": "A master's in economics (or math or stats) isn't compulsory to entering a PhD program, but I'd say it is highly desired for your own success in the program and to gaining admission. Especially if you have not done any research, like even working as a researcher for a professor in undergrad (not class research projects). I'm not sure which school in Ohio you're applying to, but in my program at an R1 like 95% of the cohort had a master's and had taken grad-level micro, macro, econometrics, stats, real analysis, etc.  At a minimum I'd take real analysis, grad level stats and Econ online before applying/starting an Econ PhD.\n\nGiven your situation, why don't you do a thesis-based master's at another institution? I'd say that would be the safest bet. I did a funded research-based master's and it gave me a good idea of what research actually is, not to mention helped refine my research interests. I would not not not suggest going in with the mindset \"I'm gonna give this a go, I can always leave with a masters.\" Those people do not finish in my experience and they wasted a lot of years of their life.\n\nEdit: Also, you shouldn't apply to just one school for PhD. Apply to several schools and see where you get in.",

If I don't get in (which I'm trying to be realistic about, it might be tough) there is a closer school that would not be as tough to get into (Wright State University) that offers a M.S. in Social and Applied Economics, but it does not have a thesis option.  \n\nUnfortunately, not being a traditional student (married to a wife in the Air Force with 3 kids), I'm limited to my options of where I can go to school.  It will have to be somewhere fairly local to where we live. So, applying to Ohio State is kind of my only option for the Phd. If I don't get in, then that's fine and I'll go to my Plan B but it doesn't hurt to try, ya know?  =)",

So at this point, I don't see it as a problem to keep it as a possibility though.  \n\nAs for the age thing, since I started college at 30, I'm used to being one of the older students in the class.  I don't think that will bother me and I'm not one to dominate a conversation in general so this shouldn't be an issue.  \n\nStill, you bring up some good points.

But they also cost money (I was looking at 30k for a masters at the cheapest school) and take time (2 years minimum at a reputable state school, with student teaching, which is often the only coursework students could take in the spring semester of their final year). States do vary in their requirements though. The northeast is especially rigorous. \n\nWhat I am suggesting is alternative route. You finish with a full certification, but no masters degree, and the programs are designed for professionals with full time jobs who already have one or more degrees. In CT, I could\u2019ve gotten a certification to teach chemistry in 10 months, while working at a school as a full classroom teacher, and done my student teaching in my own classroom. For $6000. While pulling a salary. Show me a master\u2019s degree program that would match that. This program required a lot of night and weekend effort and requires that one apply in advance, but assuming a school wants you, is the fastest and cheapest way I know of to become public school teacher. \n\nI say could\u2019ve here\u2014I was planning to go this route in fall 2022, but things transpired that disrupted my plans. It worked out fine in the end, because private schools don\u2019t care about certifications. But I feel strongly that this is a great way to get into a classroom ASAP if you are passionate about teaching. And it is a route that absolutely respects second career educators without causing debt. The former is not true of a PhD program and the latter is not true of a master\u2019s degree program.",

You can do an alternative certification, but you eventually have to do most of the coursework for a masters anyway to get your permanent license in Ohio.  Personally, I don't think alternative certifications are great preparation, since you get thrown directly into running your own classroom with minimal experience while also jumping through various hoops like the edTPA to get your certification.  I've worked alongside teachers doing the alt cert route.  Several quit because they were ill-prepared and stressed out by the first year, which is generally hell for ALL teachers.\n\nI didn't mention it in my original post, but there are programs that will cover the cost of a masters in education if you meet certain criteria, especially in STEM subjects.  I had my masters in teaching completely paid for (including books, laptop, licensure exam fees, etc.) and got a 30K stipend for a one-year program (this was in NY state, which is similar in rigor to CT - many M.Ed and MAT programs are just a year long and are plenty rigorous).  There are also options for loan forgiveness if you teach in high-needs schools for a certain amount of time, and OP may have additional aid options as a vet and military spouse.\n\ntl;dr: Yes, alternative certifications can get you into a classroom fast but they don't necessarily prepare you for long-term success in teaching.  Personally, I'm glad I went the masters route instead.",

I have a PhD and a lot of non-degree teaching experience, so I am not your average candidate, and being thrown into a classroom is not for everyone. However, OP seems to have solid education experience. \n\nBut I am also not sure that a M.Ed is really that much help based on my own conversations with teachers in my decision process, including through an state run program to recruit teachers and help them chose the best preparation program for them. Anecdotally, it seems that most teachers figure it out year 1 on the job and do not even feel like their preparation prepared them for reality. Especially second career people. Similarly, student teaching experiences are hit or miss. Teaching is a trial by fire experience and a master\u2019s degree is no guarantee that you will survive that.",

I am a career changer who already had a MS and career experience in a STEM field, as well as experience as a TA and tutor, but it's still nothing like K-12 teaching.  I'm still really grateful to have had student teaching under experienced mentors before getting thrown all the way into the fire on my own (even if some of my mentors were...iffy).\n\nIf it sounds like I am down on alternative certification programs, I am, a little bit.  Teachers with alternative certifications often end up in \"high-needs\" schools, with students who have lower income and lots of trauma, which tends to correlate with higher incidence of discipline, attendance and student motivation issues.  The end result of this is often a teacher with great potential who hasn't been prepared to teach in this environment doing a poor job and leaving after a year or two, and in the meantime, the kids get a subpar education and the cycle continues.\n\nDon't get me wrong, that scenario can *absolutely* still happen with a master's in teaching!  But that additional preparation and support can make a huge difference in whether a teacher succeeds and sticks with it or not.  It also makes a difference financially - having a teaching master's when you start will put you on a higher salary path, which will give you a boost through your whole career and into retirement (and possibly make you more likely to stay in the field).\n\nIn any case, I suspect OP isn't reading this thread any more, but thanks for an interesting discussion!  It sounds like you are just getting started as a private school teacher, and I wish you the best of luck!  It really is one of the most rewarding career paths you can take.",

A few years before I retired I hired a PhD criminal justice TT faculty member who had been a cop for her career and earned her MA along the way before she retired. She then went to our state's best known R1 and did her PhD. She came to us with the intention of working for 7-8 years and then retiring. She has minimal research skills, no publications, nor any interest in research but is an outstanding instructor who can bring out the best in her students. That's a critical issue at our teaching college--can somebody really teach? I got no push-back, at all, from the dean nor VPAA's office in hiring her. So, older careers happen. But, in my experience it's rare-she was the only older person I ever hired as their first academic position.",

Even if you have to move for the job, it is likely you could still work on the dissertation remotely. I am in this sort of boat, as i began a part-time Humanities PhD program in a related field after starting my FT job as a CC professor, and so I have been doing the degree on a part-time basis.\n\nThat path isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s one way of trying to obtain both goals (a FT job in academia and a PhD).\n\nAs well, the job market for CC positions is highly competitive, but as I am not in STEM I do not feel like I can comment directly on your particular discipline. I would also consider other avenues to teach or tutor full time, as others have mentioned here\n\nOne thing at a time - focus on getting into a program first \u2014 but consider applying for teaching-focused roles as a tentative path if primarily working with students is your goal.",

For reference, I'm not in economics but in a related professional field where it is not uncommon for folks to come from the practitioner world. First, search committees will judge you because of your age. Younger folks get judged too but for different reasons. Hesitancy for older job candidates usually comes from concerns that if we were to hire you we aren't quite sure how long you would stay in the position (e.g. how soon would you retire, will this person actually be interested in staying long term, will this person unexpected die due to general propensity to die as we age). TT lines are HARD to keep now with a lot of universities preferring to use adjuncts and fixed-term positions. I've known a few folks in my field who were in their 40s and 50s that went out on the job market with mixed success after earning their PhD. Some managed to land TT positions while others only got fixed term. And yes one of them did die in the middle of a contract because of age-related heart failure. \n\nSecond, your previous job experience can be a benefit depending on the field you will be in. In my field there is a benefit to folks that have had careers in public service positions even if they jumped around every couple of years. Not sure how economics would be.\n\nAnd finally, economics is a crap shoot for quality positions and is likely going to be more challenging by the time you might finish your PhD. You'd have better luck with CC route as opposed to traditional 4-year institutions. Of the few TT econ positions I've seen open where I have worked, I've been told by the search committees that there were around 200-400 applicants for each position. Not sure if this is the norm in the field but it just further evidence of how hyper competitive professor positions have become.",

Admission into a Econ PhD program is very competitive, especially for OSU which is a Top 30 program.\n\nI also don't feel like you're not familar with what you need to be a competitive applicant for an Econ PhD program. It's good that you double majored in math and so likely have important math classes such as Real Analysis under your belt, but if you have 0 research experience, then it's unlikely you would be admitted. The programs are trying to determine whether you are capable of conducting original research and you are competing with applicants who likely have spent a few years working as Research Assistants for professors or at one of the Federal Reserves. The advice about pursuing a Masters degree first is okay but most Economics Masters programs in the US are very expensive and don't necessarily have a good track record in placing you in good PhD programs (for example, check out UT Austin and Duke's placement record for their Econ Masters students). And Econ is honestly a field where I don't think experience outside of Econ makes much of a difference. \n\nI also feel like you're unaware of the reality of living through an Econ PhD program. The first year is grueling, which is the uniformly the case across the entire field regardless of the program. If you haven't been a student for many years, it will likely be a tough adjustment, especially if you're rusty on your math. Mastering out is not an easy option by any means because it means you would've survived the first year classes and the following prelims.\n\nI honestly don't think age makes any difference, but my impression from your post and comments is that you could familiarize yourself better with field-specific information.

Papers can be much longer (10,000+ words) which leads to longer review times (if lucky, first round review takes below 5-6 months. Sometimes you might have to wait a whole year and then get several rounds of R&R that demand at least half year per revision. Also in my field, I've seen reviews that are ten single-spaced pages. I am not sure about engineering, but probably it's not that extreme- now imagine responding to five to ten single-spaced pages each from 3 reviewers). The pipeline can move very slow in some subfields of social sciences/econ. It's just a different game, where quality > quantity. If you can manage 4-5 solid papers in top outlets, you get tenure.",

But in my case I also started with the load (and pay, etc.) of a full professor, given my background.\n\nThe biggest challenge I think you'll face is that a lot of just-starting-out academics are pretty much assumed to be in their 20s or 30s, and at many schools are put through a wringer with higher teaching loads, etc. If you can do that for a few years, it can be a *great* career. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "\"I would be doing this with the goal of becoming a professor after getting my Phd.\"\n\nDon't do it, then. Ohio State is a great school, but look up their placement record for this program. Then consider that they are probably not listing people who started and dropped out partway through, etc. These days, there is a huge premium to being at one of the top schools, and I'm not sure where Ohio State ranks but I don't think it's one of the best of the best. So very carefully consider your job options. Would you be happy in the middle of nowhere? In a foreign country? Well, then, maybe it's okay... but if you want a choice over where to live, don't do it.",
