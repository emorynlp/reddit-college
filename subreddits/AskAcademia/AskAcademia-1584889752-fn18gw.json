      "text": "I am very disillusioned and bitter about my current job search so I will just comment on the PhD environment. \n\nWhen I first started, i was thinking people will be friendly and I would just find my fellow nerds super enthusiastic about our common area. In reality, especially in big departments with lots of competition, you will come across toxic people. My department is famous for being toxic, maybe 30% of the people were normal and the rest was just extremely gossipy, competitive and aggressive. They say one thing, do something completely different in front of professors, steal ideas, compete for and try to take over any teaching, marking or admin duties you might want, try to take all credit for shared projects and conferences. I even know some people that spread rumours about sexual orientation, pregnancy, aids, mental problems about fellow phds, just out of spite.\n\nSo how did I survive? Well, I did not. My name is not on three of the conferences I co-organised. I lost 2 different modules because someone told the professor I was too busy to do it so they can do it instead and I only found out after my contract was delayed. Lots of people think I am extremely cold because i kept my distance. Some of them think I am a lesbian. Its not worth tracking the source of that because I don't find it insulting. I am just glad to be done with my PhD.\n(Not sure if my comment above reads like I left the phd, i still completed it)",

Could be more positive, could be more negative.\n\nBeing a newly appointed assistant professor, they'll be driven and will be very hands on with the work and you'll get a lot of face time with them. You'll probably get a lot of experience with grant writing alongside them, which is good for your own long-term career. If the work they do ends up being significant, they'll be a fantastic point of contact and they'll be in your corner because your success is tied to their success. Moreover, you'll be one of the leaders in that specific subfield, and if the niche is something that changes the field/is growing but not yet well established or explored, you potentially have an easier path to professorship by virtue of the niche you're working in. If you do well, you'll be a core part of their network in academia or able to hit the ground running and implement their ideas in industry, whether as part of a startup branching from your research or by leveraging your expertise at an established company.\n\nBut as a new professor, they also need to take heavy 'credit' for the research. The research you do for them is what needs to get them their first fully independent grants and needs to lead to tenure, so they'll also push you harder. Because of this, you may have a worse than average work life balance, may need to take on extra TA duties as the only grad student, may not have the same access to expertise of more experienced grad students from other labs. The professor doesn't have much experience mentoring grad students, which may impact your own growth. They don't have the same network/history of success that an established professor does, which means that they may struggle to get grants and directly affects the success of your projects. They likely aren't in a good position for politicking within the university or giving you new opportunities due to their lack of status. And if they fail to get grants or tenure, that could effectively end your academic career before it's even started, and they likely don't have much in the way of industry contacts to help you pivot later (compared to established professors that have past students who've moved into industry, or even their own startups).\n\nWorking with a newly appointed professor can lead to either of these tracks (and plenty of others besides), but there are potential tradeoffs to working with more experienced professors as well. There's honestly not a clear path to success either way.",

Grad students are mostly a self-selecting group of over achievers who have learned that the easiest way to succeed in an inherently unfair system is to keep your head down and focus on your own work. Most people who make it to this level spend a whole lot of their time feeling like a.) they won the lottery, b.) they are there by mistake and can lose it all at any second, and c.) everyone else is secretly smarter/more capable/more deserving than they are. Or some horrible, absurd combination thereof. And of course the system of abuse depends on all of that and exploits those very facts to our collective disadvantage. So the clear answer is, I think, that graduate student unions are more important than ever!\n\ntl;dr:\nI think this is a particularly accurate take and also a very good argument for grad student unions!",

This professor immediately told everything to our supervisor who was really mad at us for months. \n\nThe dean etc has so many other things to worry about than toxic environment except for sending super general emails like \"you are all valuable to us\". Changing PhD supervisors usually cost you a year, if you can even change. Because it is cut throat, any kind of complaint hurts your career more and your fellow students just happily replace you in any project or teaching. Sure, you can go to general university mental welfare etc but they can only give you moral support, you then have to pick yourself up and go back to the office you share with the competitive idiots. \n\nIts very easy to feel helpless and on your own. Especially because I was 26 when I started and some of these phd students were much older. The one that stole the conferences was in his 40s and the one that stole my module was 58. I was not able to identify toxic behaviour or the little tricks at first, because I thought they would be mature.",

On the flip side, if another research group is putting out dozens of papers a month but they aren't bringing money/prestige into the uni, then their jobs are less safe than the above group's.     \nThis leads to a system where lots of lower people (PhD to associate prof) are very concerned about their outputs, while most of the higher ups are obsessed with bringing in the cash. How individual supervisors react to these perverse incentives determine how good they'll be for you. \n\nGood luck!",

In a very, very roundabout way that could be leveraged for money, but when governments/organisations are giving a university (rather than particular research groups within that university) they are choosing based on the institution's prestige, lobbying, and/or their business outputs (patents, spin outs, similar technologies, etc.)",

I've seen new assistant professors make exceptional, acceptable, and horrid mentors. It varies person-to-person and sometimes even within a lab. I've seen mentors (who have previously been great with students) let bigotry (e.g., sexism, xenophobia) impede their abilities to be a proper mentor to a new student. It happens.   \n\n\nOne of the best things you can do for yourself is to learn to recognize it as early as possible to pivot away whenever possible. To be clear: that change is easier said than done. Sometimes you don't see the beast for a while. Maybe you think the problem is you or that the professor is stressed and things will improve after XYZ grant is submitted or a specific experiment finishes. More than once I've seen a student choose a lab that multiple people warned against because the PI had a big name in research. It rarely results in a happy student.",

They should also be a lot more skilled in the technical stuff (since most of the profs have been out the lab for so long they only know how much things cost, but no idea how it works - the higher up academia you go the more it becomes admin...somehow?). You may find you're asked to do a lot of stuff that is technically not your job (because no human can really do ALL the work that is expected of most academics alone) and it is your choice (though it would honestly be good practice for a future career and excellent CV fodder - could be worth it, but only if it doesn't significantly detract from your work).\n\nBasically, do you like them and do you think they are competent?

Tenure and academic freedom make it hard to punish anyone for all but the most egregious abuses.\n\n\\- It is hard.  Succeeding in academia is hard work.  The work is relatively low paid, the competition is fierce, and it takes a lot of sacrifices to excel in that kind of environment.\n\n\\- It attracts extreme people.

Maybe they spin their research into a real product/business, maybe they explore something that's fallen to the wayside, maybe they just take bigger risks that potentially lead to bigger rewards.\n\nOne argument used to be that tenured professors handle the administrative/busywork like sitting on committees. By gaining tenure, they're now established/trusted to keep things running while freeing up new professors to explore their own ideas. With administrative bloat in the last couple decades, that doesn't really hold water anymore.",

However, plenty of full professors I know (in EE, CS, BME) really did their most impactful work after getting tenure, not before. A big part of that is that professors  on a 'traditional' path to success get tenure around the age of 35 or so. That means they have a good 10+ years of field specific experience under their belts and have started to build a name for themselves (easier to find collaborations, get grants), but still have a good 20+ years of their career left to leverage the expertise that they've developed. Or maybe they do switch to administration after getting tenure, but that theoretically means they have greater impact on a wider range of students.",

It is more heartbreaking when you spend an extra 3-5 years in a country and still have to leave at the end of it because you cannot find an employee to sponsor your visa - which is my current situation. I would be even worse if my PhD was not funded. \n\nIt should be fine if your area allows an easy switch to the industry but for my area, someone with a masters plus 5 years of practical work experience is way more employable than me outside the academia. I think that's why so many people stay in the academic job market for so long, we want to assume all of this effort has to mean something - but it doesn't.

There is a built in pecking order, and whenever power imbalances exist there is an opportunity to abuse those imbalances. The decentralization comes from the fact that each lab is basically its own little kingdom and, while there are certainly plenty of requirements and systems in place, many consequeantail interactions are merely at the whime of an individual professor who can often not be overuled by others (eg deans or dprtment chairs). This makes for a highly variable experience- so picking advisors widely is important. Talk to other grad students to get a good feeling for their experiences. Seek out experiences from people with similar backgrounds as you if that could be important (eg women or people of color should listen to experiences from those folks).",

          "text": "Out of all of the answers given, this one strikes me as most in line to why academia can be _particularly_ toxic. Because passionate people, ostensible meritocracies, etc., \u2014 these exist in all professions. But the hierarchy and the decentralization seem particular to academic life, _if_ you add one more factor to it: the lack of mobility.\n\nAcademics tend to stay not to move around that much once they get a secure job. They might make one or two moves over the course of a career after obtaining tenure \u2014 it's strange to see people who make more than that (it happens, but it stands out). It's not easy to change jobs once you have tenure: other tenured jobs are hard to get (there are only so many of them available) and they usually require total relocation of you and your family (there are only a few cities in the country where there are multiple universities of similar status to one another). Conversely, tenure makes it not only easy to stay, but near-impossible to dislodge someone. \n\nI feel like these are in stark contrast with most other jobs, which seem to have a lot more mobility than academia does, and where you can either flee toxicity, or truly toxic people get drummed out at some point. Academia not only has a power structure that seems almost designed to let toxic people be increasingly toxic, but it also has an employment structure that makes it hard to avoid toxic environments if you find yourself in them.",

I see that happen because any given job is unlikely to be available in any except a few other universities (this is worse in some fields than others I bet); and many folks see no way out of the system once they're on the tenure track. I think this is a major failing of the system. There are actually plenty of jobs available to PhDs, but many are outside of academia, which is very hard to imagine or see when one is in it. This adds to the cut throat culture and stress.",

When I go out with my colleagues we talk about the field and only the field, not just because it's what unites us but because we *love* talking about it. I know multiple academics who view their research as their hobby. They go home and read journal articles within the field that are unrelated to their own research because they just love it so much. \n\nBecause of this, I find people can very rapidly become defensive and gatekeepers of how to do things. I see it a lot where Professor A has an issue with Professor B because Professor A feels like Professor B doesn't respect the field enough, doesn't treat the material with enough reverence. Someone who doesn't appear to be putting their all into the field is often regarded as bluffing or faking and can be looked down upon. It's taken very personally by many of my colleagues when someone appears to not care enough. \n\nSo people get very wound up about what's the \"right\" way and what you \"should\" be doing and criticism of our work, our methodologies are taken as personal attacks instead of being viewed as just part of the work.",

Though in looking up who said this, I ran across [this page](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/08/18/acad-politics/) that showed a similar sentiment written in 1765. \n\nAs others have said, academics tend to have passion and are experts at defending ourselves.  Therefore, I'm right and you are wrong becomes ingrained.  \n\nAlso, we are fighting over an ever shrinking pie.  Academic budgets continue to be cut, pay line for granting agencies shrink, more faculty need to publish in the same reputable journals, enrollment demographics are trending down, etc. etc.  \n\nPlus, times change, but people don't.  Modern science is not the lone academic with a team of grad students hanging on his every word.  Modern science is collaborative and multidisciplinary, but tenure processes (plus the old grey hairs that sit on those tenure committees) have not changed.  So you get things like that one commenter who said a colleague would walk all over him, because the reward system is about how you show your intellectual worth, not how good of a team member you are.  In fact, working well with others could actually harm your ability to move forward.",

You are (at least depending on your field), entering into an apprenticeship. If you have a toxic advisor, your experience is going to be defined by this. If you have a good advisor (someone you can openly communicate with, establish boundaries, discuss well-being and mental health, etc) then your experience in your PhD will likely not be as toxic. Talk to other students in your program who have had the same advisor. A good advisor would encourage this!! They want a good fit too!",

It's also obsessed with personal reputation - your work is tied closely into your reputation and follows you throughout your career. \n\nBoth this things crank up the pressure and then they hit our modern system where grants and jobs are highly competitive and the vast majority will fail, which then reflect back on the whole \"everything is personal\" and you feel like shit.",

You don't have to answer e-mails from your friends at other McDonalds wanting to know how to clean their fry station. You might have on-call time which is its own thing, but generally your job ends as soon as you walk out the building.\n\nIn Academia, you're not paid for what you do inside the building. I mean, the teaching is there to justify your salary, but most professors have to secure external funding to pay for part of their salaries to keep their job in the long term. Often, if you don't secure funding, your contract will not get renewed, and you will face the dire prospect of applying for jobs when your output wasn't even good enough to keep the job you already had.\n\nIn a way, it really is 100% up to you what you do with your time. Not if you are a PhD student or a postdoc - then the person who funds you can tell you when to be in the lab and what to do. But even they can't command zeal and greater output out of you than you're willing to put out. But, you know that if you don't produce enough papers, apply to enough grants, present to enough conferences, you will lose your job. Or if you don't technically lose your job, you will no longer be competitive enough to advance or get hired elsewhere - so I hope you enjoy where you are, because that's where you're dying. \n\nSo you spend your evenings, your weekends on it. Your colleagues that are enjoying their lives and forming meaningful relationships with their offtime? Those are the people you'll be out-competing, so that you get to keep your job and they don't.\n\nOf course, no one can work 24/7. Everyone needs *some* downtime. The balance with creating enough work to keep going vs not killing yourself is something that is different for everyone. But in all likelihood, that balance will be greater than 40 hours a week.\n\nI technically have vacation time at my job. I have sick hours. But if I use them, no one comes in and runs my experiments and writes my papers for me. The work piles up and waits for me, so that I'm even busier than before. When I explain to people my predicament, they'll say \"it sounds like you need a vacation\". Why would I take a vacation when I already work 1-2 days on the weekend? I get those for free. I'll use those before I start using my vacation time.\n\nI've legit used vacation time so I didn't have to show up at the office and work more from home.",

Those types of publications are often lower impact and take more work.\nI see a lot of people trying to just think of some new gimmick or vague concept that would in no way be able to be used in clinic ultimately (which is really the main point of the field, to improve medical care). They aren't even thinking medium-term, ie this is a good idea let's explore it over a few months and assess its potential. They just try to chain up random unrelated quick studies and smash them out despite them being quite useless for the progression of the field. The other side of this is people lying about translatable work, ie this research will lead to innovation in x! Only experts in the area can see it is bs and unattainable, but there aren't enough of them to do anything about it.\n\nSpamming flashy nonsense of course improves CVs more than doing careful diligent and translatable work, so people are drawn towards it.\n\nI think the main issue with this is ultimately unresolvable though - you would realistically need a type of capitalism driving the demand, so only useful work is progressed. However, pure science approaches would then suffer and hence this can't be done.\n\nHappy to hear thoughts on how this type of nonsense can be resolved.",

It\u2019s a 9 month contract and I\u2019m paid well.\n\nThe top comment nails a lot of things, but I also think a lot of people in the profession have always been the smartest, privileged type person, who had never been told no. It\u2019s weird to say, but I have met a lot of terrible academics who basically just copy what their advisors have done for 30 years, but never do anything new. Depending on the group of co-authors they work with, some will become some of the biggest names in the field for contributing almost nothing to science. Outside of these extreme and arrogant people, the profession has what I consider to be the most important people on our planet aside from entrepreneurs and professionals (lawyers, doctors, engineers)...\n\nIf you actually sincerely enjoy science and don\u2019t beat yourself up from failure, you will love the job. There is a ton of rejection though and sometimes it is wrong... I\u2019ve had papers rejected for the weirdest reasons... gotta have a lot of resilience to make it at a research institution.",

They forget that while that\u2019s nice, if they don\u2019t have the publications and a clear area of programmatic research, they will very likely be cut / not granted a new contract.\n\nTo me, the whole point of academia is to actually be the leading expert on a topic. If you\u2019re not, then you likely will not be granted the necessary resources to rise in your career. While all those nice things we do for our university are critically important, publications will continue to be the currency of the field because we don\u2019t have a better way to assess what it means to be the expert as of yet... As an assistant professor you\u2019ll likely be told \u201cyou should do more service or teaching,\u201d but in reality you could be terrible at everything and an amazing researcher and the university will more than likely keep you. However, vice versa and you\u2019re guaranteed to be an adjunct for life or simply pushed out of academia. \n\nIt really is a cutthroat job, but I feel the ones who succeed are focused on delivering high quality science and being committed to building their field or multiple fields, not just focused on helping a single university.",

Maybe that makes him think he can do whatever he wants and nobody can do shit about it. Well... he is right, sadly.  \nRight before I left the program, I considered reporting him to the university for his misconducts. But a senior PhD advised me against it, saying that it's no use, because the school would try to protect its professors, and that many students have tried to sue their advisers before but no one won. Also, I did not have enough evidence (my adviser is smart and very cautious) so I gave up the idea.\n\nHe was the reason why I quit the program, but not the reason why I left academia. I did plan to hit the restart button and apply to other universities but decided not to in the end because I could not afford to waste another 2 years of my life if this were to happen again.\n\nI believe one important contributing factor for the toxicity in Academia is the abundance of labor force. Too many people want go for PhD and too many people want to become professors while there is just not enough demand from the society. As a results, the people at the top of the food chain can just abuse the shit out of the weaker ones. Basically, \"if you don't take the job, then someone else will; so why should I treat you nicely?\".\n\nI do not advise anyone to go for PhD unless they can afford to waste at least 2 years of their life. In Academia, there are so many things out of your control. If you land on a good adviser, that's wonderful. But if you don't, your life will become hell.",

      "text": "I'm a 5th year PhD student and I have never felt the environment that I am in is  toxic. I'm sure this varies based on departments, who is in your cohort, who is your advisor, etc. Mine is a relatively small department - we get about 15 students every year, 3-4 are usually PhD students and the rest are Masters. I have felt surrounded by supportive colleagues and faculty members, and it's an overall environment of cooperation and collaboration. In fact, back when I was deciding between departments, I chose this one because I \\~felt\\~ like it's going to be a nice fit because of the existing people and the other prospective students who were visiting with me. It turned out to be a good decision (at least on that account, lol).\n\nThe only negative thing I have heard of is one authorship dispute which imo was just a learning opportunity that these things need to be sorted out in writing from the beginning. This is not to say that this is a universal experience - it seems like a rarity based on the other comments - but I just wanted to share. I do have some ideas for how my department can do better, but \"toxic environment\" is nowhere on that list.\n\nI do, however, get really anxious thinking about the tenure process and whether it's worth it.",

      "text": "This ended up being longer than I expected. \n\nI can give an example from my research group. We are even for the most part very good friends. \n\nWe have two very different projects. \n\nOne is something our lab discovered. It is very important to our field of chemistry and several groups from other universities have jumped on it and started publishing work. All of the experiments take a lot of time. Since the field has become competitive there is a high likelihood that we will get scooped and there is a high requirement for publishing. \n\nThe second one is something that is less popular of a subject. We found a topic that had not been thoroughly explored and have done a lot of work on the subject. These experiments take way less time. The field is not as competitive so there is not really a chance of getting scooped and almost all discoveries are novel and worth getting published. \n\nPeople working on project 1 think they work harder and get less to show for it. They love their project, but feel like they are on a constant uphill climb and take it out on the people working on project 2, saying they don't really deserve all their publications. \n\nPeople from project 2 are constantly made to feel like they don't deserve their publications. At the same time, they see how disheartened people from project 1 are. So they tell them that if they don't love their research they probably should have picked a different project or not gone to grad school. \n\nSo people working on project 1 feel disheartened and like they aren't passionate enough about research. Or like they aren't good researchers because they don't get as many publications. \n\nThis is a group of people who are friends and generally respect each other as scientists. \n\nWe are taught that our self worth as scientists is directly related to both our passion and how hard we work. In theory publications reflect these factors, but in reality they may not. We have people always questioning how much we care and how hard we work, not to mention the severe inadequacy we feel if someone asks us a question we don't know the answer to. Some professors are forgiving. Other professors say that if we don't know the answer to one thing we probably don't even understand our research at all. \n\nThis turned into more of a rant than I intended. Basically we spend all our time focused on work. If we don't work enough, we feel like bad scientists. If we don't know something, we feel like bad scientists. If we get disheartened, we feel like bad scientists. If we give a bad presentation, we feel like bad scientists. If experiments fail, we feel like bad scientists. If we progress too slowly even if we work hard, we feel like bad scientists. \n\nBut of course, we love science and we love academia. It just doesn't love us back.",

      "text": "Simple supply and demand economics. Supply of PhDs far exceeds universities' demand. There's little motivation for universities to pay you fairly and treat you well If there are literally hundreds of similarly-qualified people ready and willing to take your job. \n\nAlso, the sunk cost fallacy plays a role. Generally speaking, it takes several years to get a PhD. After spending all that time and effort, a lot of PhDs (particularly the ones whose PhDs are not very marketable outside academia) are not going to be very willing to retrain/start over in a new career. So they chase VAPs and/or postdocs for years or languish as adjuncts so that they can stay affiliated with academia with the faint hope that one day, it'll all be worth it and they'll get that sweet tenure track job.",

The real issue is that a lot of people have somehow created this (quite frankly) delusional idea that academia is supposed to be a safe place where everything is easy when in reality it is quite the opposite. So, when they get in or start their journey through academia they get absolutely destroyed by the cold, harsh environment which plagues academia. \n\nDepending on your area of study, the competition for funding, teaching positions, placements, job market etc. can be brutal and, more often than not, can even go into the realm of illegal actions as these are very limited and do not open very often. You also have to face the challenge of senior researchers that get off by just brutalising and abusing the newcomers or that make it their sole life purpose to nitpick anything produced by aspiring students or junior professors.",
