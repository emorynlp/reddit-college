  "title:": "Is this normal?",
  "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nHope you're able to help with an advice - or a comment. I am curious if my situation is normal.\n\nI started my PhD early last year. For various reasons, (including starting without a funded project- which in my field is not a good idea, I am learning this the hard way) my dissertation hasn't moved forward at all. I haven't collected any data for my thesis, even now a year and a half later. I am supposed to be doing a 3yr program so I am supposed to be halfway done now.\n\nMy PI was new when I started so I couldn't talk to any of his previous students. My lab mate and I were his first PhD students and we started together. However, lab mate started with a funded project, and even before the project officially started my PI gave them a side project so they could learn the methods they needed to run the funded project. There was a period of time when lab mate would run 4 studies, at the same time, and I was told to sit at home, or take some time off, rest and wait for my projects to start. I mentioned to my supervisor that I wasn't okay with that and he then recommended that I start writing my thesis. Seriously - besides reading, listening to random webinars online I had nothing to do. I eventually completed a couple of courses on coursera, did a couple of free trainings offered through university but again, I was right back where I started - with pretty much not much to do.\n\nEventually he involved me a bit in one of the side projects my lab mate couldn't do anymore, this involved something I wasn't supposed to be involved in when we first talked about my PhD work but I don't mind - learning something new is great anyway. But he didn't really find the time to properly train me on stuff, didn't let me get access to where I had to collect samples from - because this wasn't supposed to be part of my PhD work. So, it took me quite a while to learn what the method was (with his help but it was scattered over weeks of learning because he didn't have the time to do it at once) and it took 3 months to receive keys to the location with the samples. But this project also wasn't happening that often, maybe once every \\~2 weeks so majority of the time I was still stuck at home with not-much other than reading to do.\n\nI wanted to learn the software needed for my own projects, I thought this would get taken a bit more seriously. I couldn't work on any new side projects happening but yes he was okay with giving me old data (this was 2 months after I told him I wanted to learn the software) to see how the software works (idea was to publish something if there was anything interesting). But was told to work outside office hours because lab mate who runs 4 5 projects needs the computer with that specific software. If I didn't understand something I was told to look at manuals online, which is great but the manuals tell you how to do certain things not whether or not I need to do those things. I just didn't have a good idea of how the method worked and so looking at the manuals was difficult because I didn't know what I was looking for. Should mentioned that of course I looked for courses online that would teach me about the method but this is specialized and quite expensive. Supervisor (who lives 5h away from uni) drove to uni when my lab mate first received their first data and they went over the procedure. He also brought them a teaching manual which he mentioned he was going to order during a lab meeting but never said when the manual would arrive nor where it would be kept. I randomly dropped something in front of my lab mate's desk and so I saw the manual on their desk. Was I supposed to be going through their stuff to figure out we had received the manual? I am not sure but this wasn't communicated.\n\nFast forward to now. We had a discussion on Wednesday and he made it explicitly clear that my project won't start soon, and even once they start they will move slow. He made it absolutely clear that I will not be involved in any other projects at all, and that if I so much want to be writing other papers than the ones that will go into my thesis that I should look at the old data they have collected and already published. Lab mate is currently involved in 5 side projects (on top of her thesis work) and I am not allowed to be a part of any of those, even if I want to work together with her and collaborate. Those projects have methods common to the two of us but my supervisor does not want us to be trained together. This is putting a huge strain on my motivation - am I out of line to ask to be involved in other things for the time being? Is this situation normal? Do you think it is worth staying in a place where the pace of the work does not match with what you're willing to put into it?",

He makes it seem like it is all normal...it is normal not to request keys because this wasn't the original plan for my PhD work so it is OK that it took 3 months; it is normal that he has a project now that uses 100% of the methods I will use too but is given to my lab mate again and only they receive the training relating to the methods (we work with radiation so our training happens with the projects running - otherwise there is no need to be exposed to it right..).\n\nOuuu and last week he so did not want me to come for the data collection of this new project that he decided to send me with one of the research assistants to learn the methods with the radiation. Except that it would just be done in empty tubes (don't even know what that would look like). I told him that I preferred to wait until there is a project happening, and his comment was \"well I can never make you happy\". I seriously have no idea who is right and wrong anymore.",

Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy and think you've committed too much time to quit - staying is just signing up for more of the same.

      "text": "I do find this very odd but not totally out of the realm of things I\u2019ve heard in academia (unfortunately). Do you have a committee? Have you written a thesis proposal and delineated the experiments that need to be done to answer those questions? And then discussed with the PI how to get them done? It\u2019s clear your PI isn\u2019t being super helpful but it does sound to me like you\u2019re giving them too much control over your dissertation and there are too many hard lines between what \u201cyour\u201d project is. I give the example that when I had started my PhD journey, my PI gave me some cells, a drug that was given to her by a collaborator (which she had no idea how it worked) and some old microarray data and said \u201cdo with this what you will\u201d. It also was not funded but I set up some preliminary experiments (limited by what I had access to and what I could self teach myself to do or find the resources to do myself), taught myself how to analyze the microarray data and looked for literally whatever was interesting in it, wrote up a grant and got my own funding for it. Of course there were things I couldn\u2019t do that had been part of my plan (like assaying human samples) but ultimately never got them. If I had sat around waiting for them before I just changed course I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve ever graduated (I only ended up getting only some of the human samples I had requested towards the end of my PhD and too few to get anything terribly meaningful from them). Other things I had planned, I had gone out of my way to find people on campus to teach me how to do but got little support from the PI so I had to change course again. I\u2019m not sure what your field is but I think a certain level of adaptability and resourcefulness is necessary in most STEM fields so ultimately I don\u2019t really get the \u201cwaiting for the project to begin\u201d thing. What are you waiting for cuz it kind of sounds like you\u2019re waiting for someone to tell you what to do and although some PhD labs are like that, not all are. You mentioned you read the manual but don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for. Sometimes you should read not to look for something specific but do any ideas come to you? Like you read the software manual and realized you could use it to\u2026analyze a population of cells for markers x,y,z etc. If you are coming up with new ideas, questions, experiments and the PI is blocking you at every path from getting any of it done, then I would highly suggest reaching out to your committee with a list of things you have approached the PI about doing and that they have blocked you from. I do agree with your PI that I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t go to training without a project? You should get as much training as possible because the methods begets the question. For example, I was once trained on Alphascreen technology even though I didn\u2019t have a project to apply it to yet. Once I knew the tech, I asked \u201cwhat questions can I answer with this tech?\u201d And then chose one of those questions to begin to work with. I did so blindedly but eventually got enough cool data to start a whole other project on it and ended up like your lab mate with more projects than I had time for. My last suggestion is to ask your lab mate what they are doing that they seem to be making progress while you\u2019re stuck.",

Since we are looking for people with a specific condition that is often unnoticed unless you specifically go search for it, I cannot just put flyers up hoping that people will volunteer to be part of my study. Why? Testing is expensive. I can have 20 random people come to the lab and we can do 20 tests but that is expensive. My PI doesn't want that, and I get it. \n\nOur nurse has a list with people she can contact that have had this condition in the past (so they still have to go through the test to see whether they have it but sine they've had it in the past the possibility of them still having it is high). My PI insists on the nurse calling these potential people, can't tell you why, it is just what he wants. She also has access to the schedule for all the other people that need to be involved, the machinery we need, etc. so maybe it does make sense why she would be the one reaching out to them. My PI told the nurse what my project is about 6 weeks after receiving ethics clearance. When he finally did, she went on a holiday for 2 weeks, came back and then the doctor went on a holiday. Now it is 2 months later, we haven't started testing - because all sorts of people just 'go on a holiday' yet I am being told that we will start any day now. \n\nMany of these examples, there are more things outside my hands than inside.",

              "text": "Yes, I see what you mean. Is there no way to get started on a side project in the realm of what you\u2019re doing while you wait? I specifically detest doing human subject research for this reason. Clinical collaborators are notoriously unreliable and unless you can try (without pissing off your PI) to form a relationship directly with the nurse/dr and take things into your own hands, there\u2019s not much you can do. I just wouldn\u2019t want you to wait so long and then realize you have nothing to show for your time. I had a friend drop out of her PhD in the 6th year because she didn\u2019t have enough to graduate. Does your lab mates project have as many issues? How do they handle slow clinical collaborations? And how does the lack of funding specifically slow you down here? What parts of the project can you advance without the clinical component? You mentioned samples being irradiated, I assume it wasn\u2019t patients being irradiated so there must be some component that can be spearheaded without the clinical part\u2026are their models (animal, cell, etc) that can be used instead? What about databases with clinical data that can be mined or data from similar studies that can be downloaded and re-analyzed? There is no easy solution to your dilemma. You can problem solve and try to get something done for you to have data enough to complete a dissertation or you can find a different lab with a more supportive mentor. What I will say is that if you\u2019re worried about lost time when switching labs, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. It took me 6 years to get my PhD (average for my field and country). I had a ton of data but really only the last couple years were included in my dissertation because the first few was so much optimizing and re-vamping of the project. A long learning curve probably because I didn\u2019t have a ton of help either and it was a struggle. With good mentorship and a straightforward project, you could finish quickly if needed and faster than if languishing in an unsupportive lab. I wish I had known that and I would have switched labs myself but I also feared lost time and having to start over. All of this depends on your career goals though and whether it\u2019s worth it for you to get the PhD at all. Perhaps you could find a job as a clinical coordinator or researcher and wait to complete the PhD when you have more experience corralling clinical collaborators and data and find a mentor and project conducive to your career goals? One thing to keep in mind also is that rarely is the PhD a straight line forward and often your dissertation or project will look nothing like it started out or what you expected. It\u2019s chaotic for sure but helps teach that adaptability that\u2019s necessary in science.",

Because my project was such a mess to start (and literally I had to change everything about it throughout the years for FEASIBILITY - aka can it be done successfully in an allotted period of time), my dissertation ended up being collected works of\u2026with my main project as one chapter and side projects as other chapters all linked together via a weak thread (aka they\u2019re all on the same cancer but that\u2019s pretty much it). My main project still hasn\u2019t been published, even though I wrote the manuscript, my PI took over a year to review it and then decided she wanted to take into a different direction. Fortunately, I had done enough and published side projects and so I was allowed to graduate. N = 6 is VERY few, will you even get statistical significance with that? It\u2019ll depend on your effect size and how confident you are that the data you will get will give you some publishable conclusion. Like I said, the clinical part of my project ended up with n=12 and I didn\u2019t get significance and could only show a trend aka a very soft conclusion. It all really depends on what you want to do with your career. In the US, publishing is (almost) everything. Since I want to stay in research, my goal was to publish as much as possible and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of job offers both in academia and industry because published works are the deliverables that show effective work. It sounds like all your eggs are in this one basket and that\u2019s a recipe for disaster if issues keep arising and you\u2019re sitting twiddling thumbs waiting for data and then find out the data is useless. I am extremely perturbed that your lack of experience with cells and animals is what is stopping you from doing these other things. What are you in a PhD for if not to GAIN experience? What experiences are you gaining that will be marketable when you\u2019re looking for a job? A PhD degree is not enough. There\u2019s too many phds and not enough jobs so if the end goal is just the degree, I am not sure what good that will do you if the product (your dissertation) isn\u2019t publishable, the skills you learned (or didn\u2019t learn) weren\u2019t marketable, etc. At this point, it sounds like the only thing you\u2019re becoming an expert in is patience and that doesn\u2019t seem to be a good thing. Bad lab fit is the death of any prospective PhD.",

Still, despite this he wants to do the bare minimum I need for the degree, last time I spoke to him he even said I can go for a traditional thesis and that it is not necessary that I publish all the work I will do and move on (I want to publish!). At the same time he says he wants to help me stay in academia. I think his actions are different than his words, or maybe I am interpreting it wrong but if you say you want to help me achieve my goals and then actively exclude me from ALL active side projects - then you don't really want to help me achieve my goals. You are in a PhD to gain experience - I am not sure what my supervisor wants.\n\nI sent him 1/2 article in Feb because he insisted on writing the other half. It is now mid July I still have not heard back from that. I asked a couple of times here and there whether to start writing but he kept refusing. \n\nWhen I brought up the idea with the side projects the last time I told him that it is good for both finding me work for now but also for publications. He said that if I am so concerned about publications, to come up with my own project and go analyze the old data they already have collected (the data is published already) so I am not exactly sure how much more I can get out of the data. But even if I do - it requires working after hours and weekends because as I mentioned lab mate runs 5 studies so they get priority with the software. And my supervisor in general is not excited for old data, it is not a priority, won't get looked at for weeks, if I need additional data again I will wait for weeks, etc. etc. \n\nn=6 is actually a pilot study. They want to use the data officially to apply for funding. n=12 isn't bad though! and n=6 is a mix of men/ women feels too little but I don't know. What we are looking for is exploratory so we don't really  know what we will get. I have no confidence - if we get something interesting great, if not - fine too but I have no expectations.",
