  "text": "I submitted a K award which is under review this week. I am in the process of likely leaving my current position to go elsewhere, which means I would have to turn down the K award if awarded. Of course I don\u2019t know for sure it will be well-received, but I am anticipating a pretty solid score. If I get a good score, can I list the K award on my CV in a way that shows I scored well but did not accept it? Thank you!",
