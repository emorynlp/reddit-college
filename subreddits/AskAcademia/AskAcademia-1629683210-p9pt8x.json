  "title:": "Negotiating a spousal hire with delayed start date",
  "text": "I\u00a0was recently offered a tenure-track position at an R2 institution.\u00a0 It seems like a really good fit for me, but it is in an isolated university town where the university itself makes up > 30% of the town's population. I'm very worried that my spouse won't be able to find employment there, and because he is also an academic, I'd like to negotiate a position for him as part of my hiring package.\u00a0 The position need not be a tenure track position; we were hoping for a Research Scientist position. However, it's somewhat awkward to make this request because my spouse is still finishing his PhD, and he would need a start date of about 14 months from now. Another complicating issue is that the university is currently in the process of executing major budget cuts and reorganizations, and so I'm wary about asking too much and delaying the negotiation phase in case it increases the odds of rescinding the offer. Does anyone have a sense of whether asking for such a delayed start date for my spouse is worth proposing?\u00a0 Or, should he just apply for a job at the university after he's completed his PhD?\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "One question to seriously ask yourself is whether you're willing to abandon the position if they turn you down for the spousal hire.\n\nDepartments are always much more likely to negotiate on one-time costs, and even if it's not a tenure track position, a new position is a recurring expense.\n\nDepartments are feeling the pinch right now, and a department chair would probably have to really, really want you to go to the mat for that kind of increased funding that would be necessary.\n\nDefinitely negotiate, and definitely bring it up, but recognize that other finalists for the position may not ask something similar, and if you are only slightly ahead of another finalist, setting a condition like this could knock you out of the running.",

It's hard to switch to that mindset after being in interview mode. You don't have to convince them anymore. They made the offer, you now have control of the outcome. \n\nHave a plan in mind for what to do if they say no (what are your other options?). You will be more credible in negotiations if you can afford to walk away.",

There was only an instructor position (teaching a 5/5) in my field, but ended up being a TT position in a semi-similar field. It was a bit frustrating that my position was not secure before we moved, especially because my husband\u2019s department chair and college dean were putting pressure on him to sign his contract first. It ended up working out, at least for the time being.",

      "text": "I was a chair at a 5000 student state teaching college. I was used to potential/new faculty attempting to negotiate. But, there was really nothing to negotiate. I couldn't hire somebody without a line and I'd not know a year in advance if that would happen. I always offered people the absolute max my dean gave me for a position so there was no salary negotiation room. We all teach the same number of courses so that wasn't something that could be negotiated. I always gave new faculty as few new preps as possible so there was nothing to negotiate there. Travel monies were strained so that was always a \"ask early and do your best to be presenting at a conference\" deal for all of the faculty.\n\nBut, having said all of that, I was never offended by people wanting to negotiate. And when a trailing spouse happened, I was always able to get the person an adjunct position, at least. And over the years I hired a couple of adjuncts into full time positions.\n\nSo, give it a shot; there might well be more negotiating room at an R2 than at our level. But, I would be careful about giving any sort of ultimatum. The 2 times I got an ultimatum I responded negatively to it and emailed back that perhaps we weren't a good fit for the person. One time the person withdrew and the other time the person dropped their ultimatum and is happily pursuing their TT career.",
