  "title:": "Is it normal to still make silly mistakes as a postdoc?",
  "text": "Started my first postdoc position three weeks ago. It's a bit of a shift for me; my PhD was in protein-RNA interaction biochemistry and crystallography, very in vitro, and I'm now shifting to a cell culture and bioinformatics lab. Well, I was doing great, but yesterday I made such a DUMB mistake...\n\nI generated six CRISPRi knockdown lines, and I was subculturing at the end of the day when I mixed two of them together in the same flask. So now I pretty much only have four CRISPRi lines for downstream experiments. I have lentivirus in the -80 so I can just reinfect and have the two lines ready within the upcoming week. But I just feel so dumb and so awful. I haven't told my PI yet as this happened Friday evening, I definitely will let him know on Monday.\n\nI don't know him that well and he is a little bit intimidating, which he is aware of and told me not to be intimidated by him. But I just feel so stupid and so scared to tell him. I know that he won't yell at me or anything, I just feel like he might regret hiring me.\n\nHow bad is this?",

          "text": "Agreed. \n\nI've never been yelled at for the first time I made a mistake. I've been yelled at for repeating the same mistake later on. Maybe more importantly, I've been yelled at for *not taking notes* while someone explained to me the mistake I made and how to avoid it moving forward (i.e. acting like \"I already knew\" when clearly I did not). \n\nSwallow pride, admit the mistake, and actively show you're not going to make it again. Use it as a learning experience. If your PI can't appreciate that simple mistakes happen (yes, even to postdocs, even to PIs), that's his problem and not yours.",

Just because you are a postdoc doesn't mean you are not a human being with flaws that can occasionally make mistakes.\n\nTo leave some very very hard won advice -  Get over yourself. Seriously, not in a bad way but to move forward. Embrace all the mistakes you are going to make, have made, and are making. I felt SO guilty every time my progress wasn't what I hoped and really thought my PI was going to fire me because I wasn't \"What they expected\". Not only has nobody ever said those words out loud, the fact that I kept saying them to myself made everything worse. You have to be your advocate: In your Lab, in your meetings, in your experiments, in your MIND. It sucks when you make mistakes in a new environment with a new boss and new co-workers while you learn new skills. But, the only thing that will keep you in this place is thinking you are stupid and that other people will regret being around you. Neither of these things are true - YOU ARE SMART. And you're worth the investment. Changes are hard and transitions are hard, but dont beat yourself down before you have a chance to thrive.\n\nWishing you the best of luck and productive communication. You've got this. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to say that I am still actively working on integrating this same advice, if you want some postdoc camaraderie, its hard and constant but I think it's helping!",

As the postdoc, it is your responsibility to keep your PI informed of any major setbacks. If you have regular meetings, you bring those up if they aren't urgent are the meetings. If it's an urgent mistake like equipment failure you bring it up asap. If it's minor and unimportant, just correct and move on. The tone of your disclosure should be appropriate. A student should to a certain extent be remorseful to show they understand the gravity of their mistakes. A postdoc need not apologize as much as acknowledge the consequences and either lay out their plan for fixing the mistake or explain how the mistake has already been fixed and will be avoided in the future. A PI that makes a mistake also needs to acknowledge and give clean plan for correction.",

Big takeaway here\u2014and advice from a molecular biologist\u2014when you\u2019re generating cell lines, ALWAYS keep the parental lines in culture even after expanding out lines, and ALWAYS freeze down as you go. It\u2019s annoying, but it means if you do something silly like mixing lines together, or if there is contamination, you have a parental line to go back to quickly.",

      "text": "A guy on third shift at my last job accidentally activated the overhead crane which then caught on a side loader and tipped it over. If I remember right, it was about $100,000 in damage. But the guy wasn't fired if I remember right. Accidents happen. Drug tested and maybe a disciplinary action, but I don't think he was fired. They just spent $100,000 training him not to do that, after all.\n\nWhat's important is that you can show the ability to learn from your mistakes. I screwed up all the time at one job (but to be fair, they were restarting a factory they bought and almost everyone was new). But I always tried to learn from my mistakes. I once caused production to be shut down because my pen got knocked into the industrial oven cooking food product and nobody could find it. Ruined thousands of pounds of chicken that had been stuck in the oven while we searched (it was a conveyor oven). Nobody had a problem with my paperwork next to the oven entrance before then. But I moved it after that to ensure it would not happen a second time. That kind of action is why I was not fired when I would screw up. I did not hide my mistakes.",

Also, don't hide your mistakes and don't delay telling someone no matter how intimidating or scary it feels, it can only make things seem worse, especially if they have time sensitive importance. \n\nI've found that the best way to handle it is to just approach whoever is in charge of me with something like:  \n\n>On [date] I made mistake X, it has/will have effect Y and Z. I will make changes A, B, C etc. to ensure that it does not happen again in the future. \n\nTry to avoid making excuses or shifting the blame, just own up to it and then move on. We have a tendency to magnify our own mistakes, but in like three weeks your supervisor will probably have forgotten that it ever happened.",

Your PI isn't there to punish you and let's not forget as a postdoc you bring a vast amount of experience and expertise - it's a two-way relationship.",
