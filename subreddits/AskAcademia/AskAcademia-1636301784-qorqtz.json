  "title:": "Writing passive and active voice in academic writing.",
  "text": "I'm a non-native English speaker/writer & researcher in the non-bio STEM field.\n\nMy English tutor strongly advocates the active voice in academic writing, saying the too much use of passive voice in academic writing may result from misguided English writing education in some nations. I'm not sure whether the comment about English education in some countries is true or not, but I partly agree that English education in my home country was not perfect. And she is a good English tutor. She is a native English speaker/writer and has a degree in statistics and education.\n\nOn the other hand, my academic advisor is also a native English speaker/writer with many publications in my field of study. He has a good number of experiences being an Editor in several peer-review journals. (He is old) He frequently uses passive voices in his writing. After his correction, my journal paper manuscript contains a \\~40% ratio of passive voice on average. Sometimes, I read that his paragraph includes 50% or slightly more than 50% passive voices. I think this may be my advisor's writing style or writing habit.\n\nBut my English tutor pushes me to use more active voices. She believes the active voice should be more than 90%, close to 95%. Naturally, she doesn't like my advisor's writing.\n\nMy advisor's passive voice is not hugely terrible. I or others can understand the meaning of the sentence after reading. But it seems that he prefers passive voices even if the active voice is possible.\n\nI think this may not be a serious issue. I kind of agree with my academic advisor. As long as the sentence describes the contents nicely and readers understand the explanation, I think passive voice is OK.\n\nBut still, I'm curious, are there any \"conventional & wide-spread preferable ratio\" of passive voice sentences in the paragraph for academic writing? If it is, approximately how much ratio of passive voice would be a proper ratio for academic writing?",

      "text": "Most modern scientific writing texts I've encountered recommend use of the active voice because it is often clearer, shorter, and more direct. I've also seen editors state they prefer authors to use active voice. The old idea that using passive makes you seem objective is a bit inaccurate to me. However, I think a careful mix of voices is OK when necessary to avoid overly redundant writing in some sections like the Methods.",

      "text": "This is an active debate in the US. Scientific papers have, for years, been written so as to remove the author from the paper. This was done in the name of removing the appearance of bias and making passive voice unavoidable. So researchers did not conduct experimnets, experiments were conducted (as if by magic).\n\nMore recently, modern scholarship has acknowledged that a bias-free paper is not possible. In fact, it is better to acknowledge one's biases openly, so the reader can evaluate the research with those biases in mind.  So the researcher, and the word \"I\" are making their way into academic writing.  You will fond younger scholars embracing this trend, while traditionalists still prefer third person and/or passive voice.",

      "text": "To summarize:\n\n* There was a good conversation about this [a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/qnq50z/whats_the_matter_with_passive_voice/)\n* Active voice is better for most writing applications, but passive voice is much more common in certain types of academic writing than it is in general writing\n* Passive voice is sometimes the preferred convention in specific circumstances by field, such as listing methodology or stating observations\n* Your English tutor is giving you advice which is good for writing English under most circumstances, and you should follow it most of the time.  Preparing technical documents is an example where you might deviate from standard general advice.\n* Your academic advisor is very possibly editing your text so that way it \"reads\" more like the technical documents already circulating in your field.  \n* In my experience,  your academic advisor will completely rewrite everything anyways, even if it was pretty good in the first place.  That's just what they do.  If you feel like you have a pretty good grasp on how things are typically written, you can make a decision to decline their advice or edits, but for the most part you just want to go along with them.",

      "text": "Rather than trying to conform to some predefined ratio of passive to active voice. It\u2019s much better to think functionally about why the use of the passive voice in certain cases would be more appropriate than active voice. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/OV5J6BfToSw) by linguist Steven Pinker where he explained very well. Anyone who argued that you should never write in passive voice obviously, I think, has not considered why passive voice exists in the first place.",

      "text": "It depends somewhat on your mother tongue. In German, for example, using passive voice is normative and good German. So, Germans often have difficulty accepting that good German is bad English (and vice versa). As I understand it, in Japanese, naming the subject \"I\" is even avoided in colloquial language.  \n\nThe difference between your tutor and your advisor could be a generational thing. Nowadays, it is recommended to use the authorial \"I\" and active voice by default. A good ballpark to aim for is around 30% passive voice. There are many English formulations that are awkward in passive voice, so it should not be totally eliminated, but you should always default to active.",

It will differ from field to field, and even within a field different types of publications will have different styles.\n\nBut there are two main reasons to avoid passive voice in (academic) writing:\n\n1)  It allows you to avoid the issue of agency. \n\nI mentioned this on another thread about the passive voice, but many American politicians have used the expression \"Mistakes were made,\" which allows them to avoid saying who made the mistakes. At best, it's sloppy; at worst it's disingenuous.\n\nLikewise, in my first sentence above \"is just going to be made up on the spot\" allows me to avoid saying who is making up such numbers.\n\n2) It's wordy.\n\nCompare \"The man was bitten by the dog\" with \"The dog bit the man.\" It may not seem like much, but it really adds up and can change the feel of a piece. Also, if you're worried about word count, using the active voice helps.\n\nUsing the active voice fosters a simple, yet forceful style.",

Conventions and norms in writing shift over time, in my view it is good to not have your writing style stand out *too much* from those of your peers when conveying technical information.  \"Bacteria exhibited 90% decreased survival when incubated with immune cells compared to incubation with media alone\" is actually preferable in my field rather than \"Immune cells killed 90% of the bacteria\" because we don't actually know that *all* the extra bacteria died due to immune cell killing, it is possible some of them died because the immune cells out-competed the bacteria for food. Rather than diving into all those technicalities which can get too wordy, it is better to just write the observation of bacteria at different *states* rather than declare a specific action caused something to happen.",

I read dozens of Masters coursework reports every year and the quality of writing is generally quite bad - largely because the students have been taught during undergrad to write exclusively in the third person and passive voice. To be fair the quality of most scientific papers - written in a similar manner - is not much better.\n\nOne trick that I think works quite well is to read your writing out loud. If it doesn\u2019t sound right, it probably doesn\u2019t read well either. I suspect if it sounds right when reading aloud the majority of the text will naturally be in the active voice (although there\u2019s nothing wrong with passive voice when required).",
