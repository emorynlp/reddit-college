      "text": "The analogy I often use is not a lottery but a career in entertainment. Like entertainment, the cost of entry is low enough that basically anyone can pursue it (pursue PhD). However, only a small percentage of those who pursue it will end up being able to make any money off of it at all (land post docs, adjunct positions, VAPs, etc.). An even smaller number will be able to live off of that money (full time teaching positions with benefits). And an exceedingly tiny share will land the roles/gigs/slots/positions that set them up for a lifetime (tenure/lifetime contracts). One could go even further with that and say there\u2019s an even smaller group among that tiny share who end up as the \u201csuperstars\u201d in their field, but that number is so small (at least in my field) that it would be hard to argue they comprise a group at all (people holding endowed chairs at the top PhD granting institutions). \n\nJust like in entertainment, it\u2019s not so much about who is best at the craft, but who is good enough, while also being good at cultivating a following, building a network of friends and colleagues, and willing/able to set out a plan and stick to it.",

You were first in your graduating class in high school. Your SAT scores were the subject of whispered reverie in your small town.

When I lead advanced studies orientations for my department, I often emphasize that being a good student all the way up through masters does not mean that you will necessarily succeed at your PhD. This is because the process of researching and writing a dissertation is entirely different from having been a student who paid attention in class, read the primary and secondary texts, and was able to gain mastery of the material. You now have to make your own arguments and support them in a convincing manner, often by developing not only your own conclusions, but the entire method by which you arrive at them. The result is that most of my colleagues who have actually succeeded, I think, were not at the top of their classes in high school or college, nor do I think that they tested exceptionally. Yes, they were all smart and got pretty good grades. But they weren\u2019t like the valedictorian. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019m ignorant of what CS dissertations look like, but are they akin to humanities PhDs, where you come up with original arguments and research and write a 200 page book? Or are they closer to dissertations in the hard sciences? If the latter, I could easily see how the ones who end up in PhD programs and then who end up succeeding are simply the ones who have mastered the material the best.",

It's generally true that graduate students beginning a doctoral program did very well in high school and college relative to the rest of their classes. They are likely in a PhD program because they were encouraged by some professor(s) who recognized their talent and supported them along the way.\n\nAlso, all dissertations are about coming up with original arguments. The length of the argument doesn't matter as much as the process you do to get there - in my field dissertations are frequently less than 100 pages, but that's because you usually don't need 200 pages to demonstrate the work done for dissertations in the field. It doesn't mean that they are less work or require less original thought, though.",

While there is meritocracy to an extent, the job goes to the person who has the right connections rather than the person who was the best. There's also just a lot of institutional knowledge you need to know to get a job, and by the time that you get a mentor who has that knowledge, you're probably in your PhD and it's too late to ensure you work with someone who can get you into the \"PI factory\" group in your field for a post doc. This can easily come across as randomness, but that's not really completely correct.\n\nAnd I should also say that I'd put lecturer above post doc and adjunct. Those positions tend to burn people out because there is zero upwards mobility, but ~$70k a year in a low cost of living college town is a significantly better gig than adjuncting or your typical dead end post doc.",

There are relatively few candidates, because most people that study accounting do so to make some money in industry. So, the supply of candidates is relatively low. Meanwhile, there are still a lot of students that want to study accounting (because it's an easy ticket to upper-middle class) so that the demand is relatively high. Together, that translates to fairly good chances for landing an academic job.  \n  \nHowever, it's still not a guarantee by any means, and when you move to similar academic fields that are slightly less boring (like Finance, which I like a lot) there is once again an oversupply of PhDs. I'm at a fairly good European university, and TT positions typically attract around 200-ish candidates that are reasonable (publications in reasonable journals, grants, promising research areas), of which say 50 are very good (A-journal publications).

If there is lots of easy movement between industry and the academic field without much loss to reputation (in some fields I guess it is even a bonus, like economics or law), then the rate of at least some level of success is likely much higher and closer to normal jobs. I used to think this was also true of hard sciences. But after talking to some of my friends in those fields, it seems like it is easy to get to the postdoc level, but then, if one wants to lead their own lab it gets just as competitive as many of the humanities. So, in that case the comparison would be slightly modified in that it\u2019s very easy for them to be steadily working like local comics/bands, or members of a small acting troupe that pays the bills, but then very hard to becoming touring headliners at known clubs that have some higher status.\n\nMy experience and comparison, though comes out of a handful of humanities fields where a small portion of those who graduate are able to get even short term research and/or teaching positions (50% or thereabouts), a much smaller portion of those will be willing/able to continue that grind for several post-docs/VAPs/adjunct gigs in a row to string together a semblance of a career (30% ?), a smaller portion of them will then get full time positions like lectureships with any real security (15-20% or thereabouts), and then a tiny percentage will get tenure/lifetime contracts (10-12%). For example, I know that in the largest of the professional societies that applies to my field, there are something like 9000 members annually, and I think something like 1000 to 1200 report being TT/tenured/lifetime contract. One could take it a step further and look at the number of those 1000-1200 who \u201cactually matter\u201d in the field (I.e. those who regularly publish, are invited for conferences and guest lectures and long term members of research projects, and are recognizable names to peers and upcoming students alike) and that would be like 200-300 people. This last group would represent the distinction between the touring bands who make a living by living out of their vans and getting out on the road to play like 200 dates a year, and those who put out and album and tour once every year or two. Both have \u201cmade it\u201d in a sense, but from the outside, it seems to most people that only the latter group has achieved success.",

And, I don\u2019t mean more qualified (a significant percentage of any candidate pool will have pubs, teaching, great letters) but they bring something singular to the table and it is reflected in the fact that they are part of small pool that is competitive at several universities simultaneously. After a decade and a half in, and looking at another brutal search season (the second in a row to cover retirements) what some folks don\u2019t want to deal with is that they are just not the best option for the gig.  It certainly does take some luck (defined as hard work and opportunity) but even a second tier teaching university like ours can get somebody special (compelling life experience, interesting project with clear publication potential, and lights up the room when they walk in to teach a sample class and the traditional job talk) for a tenure track job.

There are plenty of bands that can\u2019t get it together to play well in front of a club owner or crowd, and others who do it without problem. Same with comedians. This is not saying anything about their ability to act/songs/material overall (though there are many people who participate in these activities for fun and clearly have no hope to make money from it. Anywhere. Ever). But it does say something about their mastery or aptitude in a set of skills that translate well into selling themselves in high pressure situations.

In my corner of the humanities, I\u2019d say about 50% of those who graduate end up with (at least) a postdoc position within a year of graduating (in my field it is not a necessary stepping stone to a TT position at this point. Instead it\u2019s a place to go while you wait out a TT position). Those typically last from one to five years, with the most common length being one to two years. Unlike in the hard sciences (as I understand it, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) it is not a sustainable career path. You may end up getting two post docs in succession, and if very very fortunate (or unfortunate depending how you look at it) be able to get a third. But if you don\u2019t have a permanent position by that time, or something that at least levels you up (VAP/funded project/term position), your career is probably done within 4-10 years of graduating.",

You have to work with other people to make a department work, so of course people value your ability to make connections. Connections help get departments students, money, resources, clout, and status, which are all things they need to survive.\n\nOn the other hand, what makes it different is the ratio of job seekers to actual jobs. Neuroscience may be a little better, because there are many interesting neuroscience research jobs you can do outside of academia. But within academia, there are far more people seeking roles than there are roles for them to inhabit - so connections are *more* important than they would be in a field like accounting.",

Coming back to academics has been challenging. I wasn\u2019t initially interested in climbing professorial ranks, but was encouraged to do so based on my existing CV. It\u2019s been a PITA, frankly. While my CV is heavily weighted toward educational excellence, systems/quality changes and contributions to institution/region/national\u2026I have less citations. Less citations = less advacement. Even if you have low-grade case reports and existentialist editorial letters galore - you\u2019ll move upward. Despite my best efforts, getting things to publication still seems to be a bear, though somewhat better as of late. I think I have good support, but it is abundantly clear to me that even those with whom I trusted  to commiserate secretly pulled off publications on their own. I had enough swimming with the sharks in private practice. You\u2019d probably be correct in thinking that this is an institutional or divisional level issue, but it\u2019s wearing me out. There are others nearly a decade younger with questionable portfolios who have springboarded to vice chair positions and more. Medicine may be different, but in my opinion you will certainly get more bang for the buck if you\u2019re connected with your departmental ambitions (both stated and unstated) and those who lord over them. Maybe not a lottery *per se*, but certainly there is a component of nepotism and politics as usual. For myself and my stage in life, I\u2019m beginning to ask if it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m paid well. My school loans are done and mortgage (sorry, no McMansion) is almost done. What\u2019s the point in pursuing higher rank? As someone with HFA it\u2019s even more vexing as the whole process seems to some extent arbitrary despite being advertised otherwise. The pursuit of academic advancement is souring my view of the very field I\u2019ve spent most of my life treasuring.",

Take the time to get good at the game and stop whining. It\u2019s not a lottery, and I was not one of those gifted \u2018golden child\u2019 types. But you do have to be *good* and prove you are of significant value beyond simply what you did on your PhD. It takes time and critical mass, it does not happen for most of us 1-4 years post-PhD. \n\nI\u2019m in STEM so I doubt this would be the same in humanities or other fields. But good god Im tired of the whining and \u2018woe is me\u2019 mentality in academia.",

But here's where we must consider the difference between statistically significant differences and meaningful real-world differences.\n\nFirst of all, while they don't statistically control for it, they do address that in the article.  \n\n\n>Under a meritocracy, the observed placement rates would imply that faculty with doctorates from the top 10 units are inherently two to six times more productive than faculty with doctorates from the third 10 units. The magnitude of these differences makes a pure meritocracy seem implausible, suggesting the influence of nonmeritocratic factors like social status.\n\nand also  \n\n\n>Across disciplines, we find steep prestige hierarchies, in which only 9 to 14% of faculty are placed at institutions more prestigious than their doctorate (\u03c1 = 0.86 to 0.91). Furthermore, the extracted hierarchies are 19 to 33% stronger than expected from the observed inequality in faculty production rates alone (Monte Carlo, P < 10\u22125; see Supplementary Materials), indicating a specific and significant preference for hiring faculty with prestigious doctorates.\n\nIt's fairly implausible to believe that the doctoral students at the top 10 universities are *that* much more productive than students at just the next ten schools/programs. We're talking about schools/programs whose actual ratings, faculty productivity, grant $$$, etc., only vary by small amounts.\n\nSecond of all, if controlling for publication number and quality nullifies this effect, that would be because publication number and quality is positively correlated with the prestige of one's graduate institution. That could be for any number of reasons, but if it is true, that's actually a point in favor of attending a more prestigious institution to a certain degree, if one has a choice. If I say \"prestige doesn't matter if you have publications,\" but the people getting the most publications at the highest-impact journals are at more prestigious schools/programs...prestige then begins to matter again.\n\nIn other words: yes, in the relatively uncommon cases that someone from a program outside of the top 50 or so is just as productive as a student from a top 10 program, sure, they may get a top-tier TT academic job. But those cases don't happen very often.",

What, in such a case, is \"visible?\"  Just me, or some work I'm doing?  \n\nI know a lot of hard working people who haven't hit a great job, but all the people I work with that have jobs got their jobs by having done a very specific thing at a very specific time.  Some of them did that thing more or less on accident whereas some of them did that thing very purposively and made a good bet.\n\nYet, I'm not sure how educative that is in relation to other jobs.  Do folks not get other jobs the same way - by knowing people and/or by being the right candidate at the right time?  I've never had a job that was not like that.\n\nThe frustrating parts of the academic luck equation are that the ratio of job-seekers to jobs is very high, new jobs come quite slowly, and job-seekers have invested a lot of time and money in a way that makes changing plans challenging and dispiriting.  And, at least for me, the greatest insult is that lots of academics don't really get trained to very thoroughly in how to navigate the job market so the whole thing both seems and is harder than it should be.  I think it would still be dispiriting if folks knew what to do and didn't win good jobs, but some folks I talk to are dispirited because they think they're doing everything right and nothing is working out.
