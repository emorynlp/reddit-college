  "text": "Are there any books (or other references) you find yourself reaching for over and over again or recommending to your mentees? Alternatively, is there an activity that you personally find very useful (journal clubs, independent reviews, ect.) for newcomers to your field?\n\nI definitely fall into early career myself, but there's a few books I've collected that I can't help but recommend to anyone I think may benefit from them. \n\n* \"Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded\" by Joshua Schimel\n* \"The 2-Hour Job Search: Using Technology to Get the Right Job Faster\" by Steve Dalton\n* \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" by Rebecca Skloot \n* \"The Emperor of All Maladies\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee (I'm in cancer research)\n\nI'm hoping to expand this list, especially as I work with my postdoctoral and graduate student office to establish a lending library of sorts for our institution.",

      "text": "I have never read any books on how to write scientific papers. When you study history where I live, that's basically your entire education. So the books I always recommend are books that help any historian. They may not be useful to anyone who isn't interested in history or the social sciences though.\n\n- Logics of History - William H. Sewell Jr.\n\nI'm a historian. This book is technically sociology, but there is obviously a lot of overlap with history. The book gives a good oversight of social theory and how its intertwined with history. It's very theoretical, but that's what I love. It's a rather easy read considering the subject and I recommend it to anyone interested in social theory or historiography.\n\n- Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment - Joachim Radkau\n\nIt's one of the first cohesive global history books I've read. I loved it and it really changed my opinion on whether global history has a future. Such a good book. It's about the environment throughout history and its relationship to man. There are a lot of really interesting case studies discussed within this book, especially regarding symbiotic relationships between man and nature through history.",
