  "text": "To keep it short, I did a calculus test, was scrapped for time and I was scrambling to get my work from my scrap paper to my iPad to transfer the PDF to my computer so that I can hand in my test. I didn\u2019t realize my algebra looked funky and had a meeting with the dean for concerns about academic dishonesty. I explained my process and how I did my work. The dean said my work was not enough and that it still looked a bit funky. He explained that because my work was not the same as the way my professor answered it was also suspicious. Which I don\u2019t understand how that is a cause of concern. He said it\u2019s a first for him to have a test answer that\u2019s completely different from the answer key and different from online math calculator websites.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite fair for him to raise eyebrows for having a different process. Is this grounds for the dean to consider this as academic dishonesty?",

Stick to your guns and firmly insist that the burden of proof should fall to them to prove that you did cheat rather than to you to prove your innocence. You'll be tempted to provide excess detail, like the whole PDF thing at the start of your post, don't - it can only hurt you. Keep it focused on the facts. There's no evidence you cheated because you didn't cheat and that's the only thing that should matter here.",

In the only two cases where students didn't ultimately confess, the evidence was so overwhelming that their refusal to confess was literally laughable. \n\nExample: I had one where they obviously copied someone else's answers and they wrote me a written confession/apology. They were so contrite that I (very unusually) decided to give them a zero on the assignment but let them continue in the class. Then my TA witnessed them doing it again on the final exam and the student had the gall to contest it. They tearily claimed to the academic integrity review board that they would *never*, *ever* cheat and the board believed them ... right up until I produced the confession from the earlier incident. I guess she forgot about that, because she looked completely dumbfounded when I pulled it out.\n\nBUT, OP's story sound suspiciously similar to situations I have personally encountered before, where students don't copy the work right because they don't understand it, and can't explain it when asked, but still magically produce the correct answer anyway.",

      "text": "So, I presume your answer was correct but the process that you used to get there was different than that of your professor as well as online examples. It also sounds like this was an online test with your camera on. And that the real problem lies in the scrap paper work, iPad transfer and then further transfer to the computer. \n\nI took calculus decades before any of this technology (even calculators!) was available. For us, it was all paper. But, if my assumptions about your process are correct, then the suspicion might lie in the multiple transfers. I don't imagine most professors would be concerned about doing scratch paper work and then transfer to the computer where you save the work as a pdf and then send it in. But the iPad addition might just be the strange part of it. I don't know--I'm not a mathematician--but to me it seems that would be an odd thing. Why would a student need to take that intermediate step? Perhaps it was necessary, but if so, then what would be the source of the professor's complaint?\n\nBy the way, the process issue wouldn't bother me, at all. I used to do math sometimes following my own shortcut process that wasn't what the textbook nor professor used. I often couldn't explain exactly how I did it, but I was able to. Perhaps that's why I'm not a mathematician!\n\nI'd suggest you consider exactly why the issue arose and address that. If all of my assumptions, above, are correct, then the issue might lie in the multiple transfers and I'd have a reason for why you did that. If my assumption is incorrect and the multiple transfers were necessary, then I'd ask the dean whether it's reasonable to assume that the ONLY possible ways to solve the problem were by the process that the professor used and the alternatives that the online examples used. If the online examples use a different process than that of the professor it would seem likely that there are other ways to solve the problem. You might well have figured one out.",

I used a scrap paper  to quickly jot down any thinking. Scrap paper is allowed, but we will be handing in PDF of the tests! This is an online test, but not with our cameras on! Everything is opened book and we are allowed notes and textbooks. I know some classmates print their exam and then scan it afterwards but my printer is on the main floor while I\u2019m upstairs on my computer. But I believe most write their exams on a digital device to and some have to transfer PDF while others don\u2019t because they had those two in one laptops. \n\nI did ask my dean why having a different process than my professors rose suspicions and he explained that the fact that I\u2019m doing it differently than the way I was taught was of concern. Which I think isn\u2019t really fair, but other people might have different opinions, I don\u2019t know.\n\nEDIT: And yes my solution was right, but my process was different. My process mainly stems from the YouTuber, \u201cthe chemistry tutor\u201d(?)",

The dean was looking for you to start explaining your process when questioned on it being different; If you could do that you at least knew what you were doing and thus the chance that you cheated is low enough. If you couldn't explain it the chance you copied is high. \n\nAs for if they can prove it, if the dean asked you explicitly to explain the method and you couldn't in that first meeting, I would say the chances he can convince an academic honest panel you cheated is around 70%. If he didn't explicitly ask you to explain the method the chances are low.",

The risk here is if you are found guilt they are going to ask for a much harsher punishment, an F in the class or a permanent mark on your transcript. If you admit to cheating the punishment will be much less, this is why most people don't fight it.",
