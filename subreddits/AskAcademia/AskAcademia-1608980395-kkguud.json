  "text": "I'm a female first year PhD student in the Top 15 Economics programs in the United States. I have a partner (not in academia) whom I have been with for several years now. I am 27, so I m starting to naturally worry about the biological clock. I have a few questions about starting a family while doing Econ PhD (notorious for heavy coursework) as a **female** student. \n\n1. Would having a kid as a **female** **Econ** PhD student be a terrible idea? I would like to hear about other people's direct/indirect experience. I read somewhere that once you get pregnant, professors might consider that you are not serious about your work as much, and this is absolutely not true (at least for me). While it may be true that starting a family may take away some time, it does not mean that I don't take my work seriously. Successfully finishing the degree and getting a job is as important as starting a family on time (and not regret in the future for delaying) for me. \n2. If I were to have a kid, the timing would be of utmost importance. It would definitively not happen in the first two years of the program because of heavy coursework. I think I also read somewhere that it might not be wise to be pregnant while on the job market. Do you have any advice on what year might be the most optimal timing? \n3. I read that the support from advisors/department would be crucial. The thing is I would like to seek some advice from professors and upperclassmen. However, it has been difficult to connect with people this year with COVID-19 and everything being all online. Not only that, I'm afraid that asking what might be perceived as personal questions could offend others. Is there a smart way to approach others to seek advice on this issue? \n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "Not in econ but in a social science field. I waited until my 30s to have a kid (way after the PhD and once I settled into my career - husband is not an academic) and that's not unusual now days. I know some women did have kids during their PhD and managed it all just fine, but there are just as many of us that waited until we felt everything was more stable and we had time. A lack of nearby family members to help with childcare and general support makes the process difficult at times. I'll also add that even when you are established that your research will take a hit but at least you would be established at that point so a temporary dip in productivity isn't that detrimental depending on where you work. I'm not sure what I would have done if I had my kid in the middle of my PhD program. \n\nAlso (and apologies if this gets too personal), you seem to be making some assumptions that getting pregnant will be easy. You can try to plan all you want, but there are sometimes serious complications that can arise and just because you say you want to have a baby in your third year of your program doesn't mean it is going to happen. I'd consider what you plan to do if there are complications since all of it can be very unpredictable.",

      "text": "I had both my kids during my math PhD. My expert opinion is to finish your coursework and quals before having a kid. Look into your school\u2019s policies regarding taking a parental leave from your studies. Whether you take an official leave or not, you have to expect that having a kid will delay your work by at least 3 months or up to a year depending on how supportive your partner is. Can he support the family financially while you take a leave from your studies (also look into maternity pay options where you live).  Who will be handing childcare until the baby is old enough for daycare? Who will be the one who takes off from work every time the baby gets sick? Who is going to stay up at night? My kids weren\u2019t the best sleepers and my work took a major hit from the long term sleep deprivation. \n\nHaving a supportive advisor is essential as you noted. It is hard to gather this info while remote but do you know of any other students who have had kids while in the program? Do you already have an advisor chosen?",

The kid slept a big portion of the day and I used all of that time to write. My advisor was a very strong supporter of my family and backed me up 100%. That helped a lot. I was on the job market while pregnant with my second. I got a job in a department that values family and made it very clear how much they love babies and support women. I\u2019m having my third baby this summer, in between my first and second year as a prof. (Our family planning skills are questionable, I know). \n\nBut my point is, if you want a family you should go for it. There are no guarantees at the end of a PhD. If you sacrifice a family and thing don\u2019t work out the way you want them to career wise, it won\u2019t be worth it. I know tons of people who have kids in grad school and have been successful. \n\nA big key is, do you have a partner who understands? Will they be willing to take the kid for 4 hours on a Saturday so that you can write? Will they watch the kid after work so you can work? Your partner needs to know that at times, the parenting work load will fall fully on them. If you work as a team, it is completely possible.",

Your productivity may also be impacted by circumstances external to your professors' judgment. Child care is hard and exhausting and there's never enough of it and it's never affordable; also, some pregnancies are physically tough.",

They can point you to other women in the program who may have dealt with this. Also, if your department has a \u201cwomen in economics\u201d group or similar, that would be a great place to raise these concerns. Anecdotally, I know a handful of women in economics or economics-adjacent field in a top 15 department who have had children during the program. People seem to wait until their quals (end of second year) and then get pregnant during their third/fourth year. The idea with having a child during the PhD is that there won\u2019t be a visible \u201cgap\u201d in your CV, since time off can be seen as part of your PhD. No one in the job market really cares if you took an extra year to finish your PhD (you will probably need maternity leave so be prepared to take over 6 years if you do have a kid).\n\nThere is absolutely no good time to have a kid in economics if you stay in academia. I went to several women in economics mentoring programs (CSWEP organized one, watch out for it in future years), and all female professors agreed to this. You can\u2019t put your life on hold because of this career; if you do well and you get a great assistant professor job, having a kid will affect your tenure clock. \n\nBut it\u2019s worth thinking about whether you will go into industry. Industry is definitely a better place to have a kid, and you\u2019ll only be 33 or so, when you graduate. I don\u2019t think your fertility declines all that much at that age (you\u2019re not considered to be of \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d until 35). But of course if you want to have a kid sooner rather than later, then have a kid! You can\u2019t really time it perfectly even if there was a perfect time, sometimes (not uncommonly) fertility gets in the way. Good luck and I hope that was helpful.",

In my experience, and as I've heard from my colleagues, the first year was if not the hardest/ most stressful, it was definitely the most demanding time wise. Econ is a bit different than I think a lot of the experiences on this sub are because it's not a lab science at all ^((except maybe experimental, but even then)^). The second and third years will still be pretty structured, and after that your time becomes very fungible. In that sense, it may be easier to wait until after the \"weed out\" period (typically the first year or two) because once you complete the course work it's not nearly as daunting, and as long as you are showing progress to your advisors you will probably be given the time you need, within reason,  to succeed. \n\nAll that said, econ can be a bizarre place to address work/life concerns because many or most of your professors and potential employers will be aware of the effects of something like having a child have on academic success because it's a popular topic in labor studies (statistically it is depressing).

      "text": "https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24128176\n\nUnless you or your partner have a pre-existing condition that affects fertility you have plenty of time\n\nAre you really good at being interrupted at least 2-6 times an hour and being able to jump back in to work easily?  \n\nBabies are like any living creature, you never know what their health conditions or temperament will be. There is a good chance having a baby with health issues or even colic could detail your PhD completion. As a person who knows lots of people who have had multiple kids let me say. If your kid sleeps well, that\u2019s just the way they are wired, if they eat well same. People with easy well behaved kids (I\u2019m one of those) like to think they did something right, and the probably did do a lot right. But at-least 45% or more of that kids behavior is innate, and you can only push it one way or another by repetition and setting a good example.\n\n\nI had a baby at 27. Having a baby then was physically easier than if I were to do it now at 33. That being said I could have easily waited 3 more years.  I just returned to school\nTo get a BA in anthropology and move to a MA and Possibly and PhD if my carrier leads me there.   And it\u2019s difficult to find time for my school work without neglecting my sons needs (it\u2019s covid and he had no one to play with so it\u2019s a little unique, but you get the idea) \n\nChildren are insanely inconvenient. And put an immense strain on your relationship. My husband and I had been married for 7 years before we had our Son, our relationship was rock solid. But we struggled (like on the verge of divorce, nasty heart breaking divorce) and didn\u2019t get back to a good place in our marriage until our son was 4/5.  We forgot who we were and had literally fallen out of love\nWith each-other. I suggest to wait, but I also understand that no matter where you are in life there will always be a reason not to have a kid.  \n\nOne last example: when my son was a baby he slept like crap, every time we tried to get him on a sleep schedule he would be good for a\n Week then a tooth would come in or he would grow and be up all night.  He was a great eater, we gave him everything, and he ate everything.  He hated his car seat and screamed the entire time we were in the car! And he never latched properly and would pinch while breastfeeding. He never took a pacifier or bottle so my husband could never take over feeding times. \n\nToday, he is a scary intelligent kid who Is always well behaved, a good listener, he\u2019s considerate and has great observation skills. He sleeps like a champ, We read books and I sing songs and he is out within 5 min Max!!  He actually ask to go to bed when we let him stay up late. He gets car sick, and we still struggle with long drives (we like to travel and he has thrown up in the car many times including in US, France, Scotland, Italy and Germany). He\u2019s the worst eater imaginable! Like I can\u2019t even feed him pb&j or Mac and cheese.  He eats tons of fruits, oatmeal, and eggs, cereal. He is required to have 3 bites of a food before saying he doesn\u2019t like it. We try not to make him separate meals but provide him with things he dose like in the meal (plain bread, meat, noodles) \n\nSo raising kids is never smooth sailing, it changes daily and keeps you on your toes. But it\u2019s totally worth it! And you\u2019ll love every moment of it, but you need to be there for it,\nThey need to be your primary focus, and that takes a lot of balancing.",

I dont believe I would have been able to successfully have children if I didn't do it when I did. I strongly suggested discussing reproductive health with your doctor. I completed my program with excellence and in record time despite fertility issues and a highly complicated pregnancy. I sacrificed my mental and physical health though, and since I was on scholarship I didnt qualify for leave. It was, and never stopped being a fight. I chose to work with my advisor and plan ahead to maximize productivity and reduce complications. I encourage this collaborative approach, if you cant discuss this sort of thing with your advisor, you have a big problem that will only get worse.\n\nI nursed my 4 month old daughter in the car between experiments, my sister provided childcare, and my husband worked 2 jobs (still does 5 years later) 12-18 hour days 7 days a week to support us. I went into prelabour during my qualifying exam, and finished it anyways. I worked around the clock and slept in a random series of naps for over a year. If you decide to do it, t is going to be hard. I would do it all again if given the chance, I love being a mom, and have never regretted it.

      "text": "This is not going to be a popular opinion...\n\nSo I (male, humanities field) had my first kid post-tenure... and even though I'm an older parent (as is my spouse--we really pushed the biological limit), I am hugely grateful for this timing, given how exhausting the first two years of new-parenthood were.   I cannot imagine doing that while trying to do a PhD (or shooting for tenure).  I'm the primary caregiver.  There were weeks where I was so sleep-deprived that I couldn't even really *see* my students in classes I was teaching--as in, my vision was totally blurred, because my eyes were too tired to actually focus.  (!)  So, that's my experience. \n\nMeanwhile, as a professor with PhD students, I dread--*dread*--when my PhD students tell me cheerfully, \"we're expecting a baby!\"   \n\nBecause work and focus both drop off.  Female *or* male.  It just *does* and there's no escaping it.  Grad students will guarantee take an extra year (or two), drop out of communication, and just produce... weaker work.   Often half-assed work, that's just barely adequate.  Because the fact is, with a newborn or young child you are going to have at best 25% of the time to work that your fellow grads have.  It takes a very specific--very *focused*--person to overcome that time-deficit.  I myself am not that person.   (Then there's also the social isolation... PhD students with newborns aren't going to grad parties, conferences, talks, meet-and-greets, workshops, etc...  they're taking care of the kid.  Which means missed opportunities, not just to network, but just to talk about your work with other brilliant people.  Which means missed intellectual engagement.) \n\nYou write about \"support from advisors\" and \n\n>professors might consider that you are not serious about your work as much,\n\nBut in my experience, it's not about perception of professors or about \"support\" from them.  It's about realities of too little time.  The work slips.  It does.   Which is why I wince when my grads tell me this...though I hide it perfectly of course.  Because I know from experience what is coming.  In my experience, it almost always slows or derails their academic career.   Do I think less of them, take them less \"seriously\"?  No, not at all.  But do I know what's coming?  Yes, yes I do. \n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThere are many exceptions to this.   I've had female friends that had babies in grad school or pre-tenure, and just powered through it like the unstoppable juggernauts they are.   \n\nWhen I was a grad student, a newly-hired professor showed up with an unfinished dissertation and a newborn... and taught new classes, finished a dissertation, published a ton, and was a great mom to that kid.  How?  I have no idea.  \n\nAnd I was on a hiring committee a few years ago and we hired a brand new mother (made provisions for her to have hourly breaks to breastfeed on the campus visit, etc.).  She got the job, and she is just amazing.  So it can be done.   \n\nBut again, *I* couldn't do it.  Having had my kid (again, male, but primary caregiver) as a PhD would've killed my focus and my career.  But some people can.  Just not everyone.  Nor (i think) most.",

The specifics of that will depend a lot on your program, your partner, a lot of details that you will have to assess. I waited until I got a job, and now I regret it. I\u2019m 33 and dealing with infertility. Not trying to scare you, but if having a family is important to you, I would lean towards earlier. Alternatively, you can get some blood tests done that can go some way to assessing your fertility. Ask for \u2018day 3 blood work\u2019 - you want your AMH and FSH levels tested. Knowing this might allow you to know that you have a few more years and can afford to wait, and then you can breathe easier. Or it may make you realise that in your case there is no time to wait. Either way, having the information can\u2019t hurt.",

One when I was about 2.5 years in, and the other apprimately when I defended after 6 years. I'm from Western Europe, where society is very liberal on working 4 days and taking a daddy/mommy-day, and that's what my wife and I did.  \n  \nI took a huge hit in productivity, mostly because it became hard to work long hours. Rather than work from 8.30-18.30 5 days a week, I went back to something like 9.00-17.00 4 days a week, and because of kid-related exhaustion hardly worked on evenings and weekends. I was still able to finish the PhD, but my priorities shifted, research was no longer important enough to me to spend the hours on that I had before. Now my family came first.  \n  \nA friend's advisor told him an econ dissertation is three good papers, or two good papers and a kid and there is some truth to that.  \n  \nCurrently I'm in a teaching position at a good Finance departement.

      "text": "\"I am 27, so I m starting to naturally worry about the biological clock.\"\n\nHa, ha, ha. Sitting here about a decade older than you.\n\nI ended up freezing eggs a few months ago. It was unpleasant but I got loads, probably enough for two kids in fact, though of course no one ever knows how things will turn out. It's cheaper than you might think... costs have come way down. Would it be helpful to share more about that? I don't want to share if you're totally uninterested because it might be hijacking....\n\nBut my main impression from going through that process might be relevant regardless: that everyone is different. Some people have a hard time in their early 30s, some people are actually just fine in their late 30s (like me, seemingly - time will tell). You might want to get some tests done to more accurately judge where you might fall, bearing in mind there are no certainties in life. Most of the stats online about egg stuff is also from people with fertility problems going through IVF, so if you don't have fertility problems you're likely to do a bit better.\n\nI also assume you've heard that the 35 year old cliff myth is based on 300 year old French data? Here are some more recent papers with charts that I found when going through the process. They're based on IVF data, but should still give some idea about how fertility declines:\nhttps://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/32/4/853/2968357\nhttps://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)02037-3/fulltext\n\nBut everyone is different, so if you want info on yourself, you'll need to speak to a doctor. Personally, I'm not alarmed yet, and I froze eggs \"late\". There's a small chance it doesn't work, but given the huge number of eggs I have to work with it's small and I'm happy to take the risk, though I'll convert them to embryos soon for the information value and try to use them by 40 to give myself a fighting chance of having something else to try if that doesn't work. It was a horrible process, avoid it if you can, but sometimes it's the best one can do. I'd say the vast, vast majority of females I know in academia end up having kids in the 35-40 range (naturally) and I personally do not know of anyone who could not achieve at least one then, though I know it happens and if you want more you'll want to start earlier. My own doctor told me at an initial consult at 35 (I didn't do it then, I went away and thought about it): look, if you want to start trying right now, you shouldn't freeze eggs, I don't want your money, most likely you'll be fine. So you might have more time than you think. Or, less.\n\nAs for people who did have kids during the PhD - there was no way I could've done it during the PhD. The only person I know who did was male and took a teaching-track position after spending 2-3 extra years in the program. He had multiple kids and his wife stayed at home. I also know a female who was pregnant during the job market, but she cleverly / luckily timed it so that she wasn't showing during her interviews. It seemed fantastic timing. But I forget, she might have gone non-academic now that I think about it. Most people seem to do it as an AP and extend their clock if they can (warning: not all jobs will allow this. I think it's common in the US and Canada, but not sure about elsewhere). I know some people who waited until tenure. Obviously that's ideal from a career perspective, but not always possible, and it's your life. Second best from a career perspective is probably as an AP, after you have written and submitted new papers and are in the midst of revising them, especially as you get close to the end of your tenure clock. I honestly have never heard of a female who had kids during their PhD program and I imagine the typical prof would not think highly of it. (I know of one who had kids before it, and that was better.) But again, I'm not telling you what to pick. And the supportiveness of the faculty likely depends on the school. And everyone will say that of course they would be supportive, but there is probably a reason hardly anyone does it then.",

      "text": "Being a female doesn't matter much. Yeah, you have to deliver the baby, but nearly all the family help at universities is aimed at the mother. Being the mother actually helps you much more then being the father.\n\nYou would obviously be better off waiting until after or getting knocked up near the end. Having a baby in the final years (3 and 4) would be insanely difficult in terms of stress and mental health. \n\nYou are only 27, people have babies well into their 30s and 40s. You should be finished by 31-32, you could just have one then. I don't think waiting until post PhD, which isnt much time, will be bad.",
