  "title:": "Is a mid-tier, R1 university worth it for a PhD?",
  "text": "I am sure the knowledge that the entire PhD experience brings will be substantial: learning how to conduct high-quality research, interacting with academicians, delving deep into a subject I love for multiple years, etc. yet it feels like I am demotivating myself from going through with the process, simply because it's not the best of the best university. Another option is doing Master's, upping my skills/work/portfolio, and then trying my shot again. Anything but the best of the best feels like a cop out, but I am sure there is some weird obsession aspect of it.\n\nBackground: Senior BSc. Comp. Eng.  student from a non-US, non-European country.",

      "text": "I did my PhD at a R2 institution and now work at an R1. I feel as though my education was far Superior to that obtained by the students here at the R1. There are different opportunities at both places, and the R1 definitely has more money. I say this as an example of why the institution may not matter.\n\nUltimately the PI you work under matters as much as how much you put in. But the location doesn't actually contribute too much. My PhD advisor had a ton of philanthropy money so we could do literally anything we wanted, no restrictions, no need to follow the theme of a grant. I was trained much much better on a technical level compared to students at my current R1, BUT I was not trained well on hypothesis testing or grant writing. Since joining the R1 half my time is spent grant writing for which hypothesis testing is essential to successful grants. We outsource much of our work, deligate to designated technicians, and pay for core services so it frees up time to write.\n\n I am not sure if this is the best way to do things. It baffles me when students at the end of a PhD are asking me how to do something super fundamental and don't understand the theory of basic technical things. Even something as simple as making a common solution. Point is, if it's the education you are worried about, the limiting factor to how much you learn is how much you put in, just make sure the finances of your PI aren't restricting your potential. \n\nI wouldn't trade my PhD education obtained at the R2 for anywhere else. On one hand, it was less productive because we didn't outsource, on the other, the struggle to do literally everything on my own made me a far better technical scientist than what I'm seeing coming out of my current institution. \n\nKey points, work hard, get a well funded advisor, and try to make sure they are well networked. Don't take the easy way during the PhD if it sacrifices learning. The University you attend doesn't matter much. Some fields are, by nature, better suited for mid tier institutions so the world experts might not be found at top tier places.",

      "text": "If your long-term goal was an academic faculty position, I\u2019d tell you to get a Master\u2019s and try again. It\u2019s already quite hard to land a decent faculty position after coming from a top school, and requires extreme luck and talent coming from other places (but it\u2019s certainly not impossible!)\n\nIf your goal is industry research, you\u2019re good to go so long as your advisor is well-connected to industry, and on board with you doing research internships most summers to build a professional network. Good luck!",
