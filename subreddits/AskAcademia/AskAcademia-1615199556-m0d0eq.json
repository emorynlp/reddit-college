  "text": "\nI\u2019m in a quiet period since I\u2019ve submitted all that my supervisor asked for (I\u2019m a first year), I like to read as many articles as I can get my hands on. I\u2019ll use connected papers and google scholar (as well as Microsoft academic) to find all the associated articles I can and then import them into notability where I highlight, read and find good search terms for future papers. I also like to make notes and repeat any calculations I see so i can gain a deeper understanding. What should I be doing so that I can develop my skills as a researcher, my supervisor doesn\u2019t tend to interact much with me so I\u2019m kind of on my own for this.\n\nAm I doing this right, is it good practice do this?",

Don't let Google rule your research though: look at CrossRef and Web of Science too.\n\nOne of the most productive activities when I was researching my dissertation was chasing references back as far as I could.

They turned out to be enormously useful in the end.\n\nIf you run into references that aren't available online, ask your uni's research librarian! They will often be able to track down a physical copy and scan it for you.\n\nFinally, as you read it's worth keeping a central set of notes that relates topics/facts to articles, rather than vice versa. When I'm trying to cite a paper but can't remember specifically which one, it's useful to have an index of sorts.",

The most typical example is for PhD-students and researchers to stay physically fit. You can always read another book or paper, but if that hinders you from staying physically (and mentally) in shape, chances are you may pay for it down the road.\n\nOP was specifically about how to improve as a researcher when empty time showed up in the calendar. I stand by the idea that s/he should consider reading and studying stuff that may be long term beneficial as opposed to only attend to short term necessities... And, that this may need to be seen as non-work in the short term, and thus may have to compete with other non-work stuff that we do.",

And if you burn out on academic writings, you run the risk of not being able to force yourself to read something important when you need to.\n\nTake time to recharge. Whatever self care is for you, do it. You'll need it.\n\nTake the free time to get into a healthy routine. Balance is a huge challenge in grad school; having a routine of sleeping 8 hours a night, exercising, stretching (avoid that student posture!), resting your eyes periodically, cooking healthy meals, etc that you continue into the more stressful periods of your graduate career will be immeasurably beneficial. \n\nSimilarly, start taking a multivitamin. You wouldn't believe how much more energy and mental clarity you can get from nutritional balance. \n\n\nFind a therapist. This one was already said, but worth repeating. Do it now. Trust me. \n\nTake time to see/talk to friends. Don't neglect your friendships, both with labmates and non-grad school friends. This will help you recharge and will ensure you have strong friendships waiting waiting in the wings for that first (and fiftieth) grad school meltdown. \n\nAll of these practices will make you a healthier, more balanced person. And, contrary to popular media, health and balance are beneficial to being a scientist. *(Obviously getting nutrients from your diet is preferable, but not realistic for most people.)*",
