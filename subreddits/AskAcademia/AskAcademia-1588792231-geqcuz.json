  "text": "Hello guys, I am an applicant for a 1-year full time Master's Programme (Int. Relations/Politics), looking to study abroad and to settle there for good after my graduation.\n\nI got informed the other day that the University that I applied to (Dutch university, but I have also applied for a Scottish one and I have been accepted) will be switching to online teaching until January 2021, at least.\n\nSo, I really don't know what I should do here. I have been planning for this for 2 years now and I was really hoping to migrate abroad and start a new life there (obviously I need to network and find a job).\n\nWhat would you do if you were me? What will you do if you are already in a position like me?",

Secondly, a lot of universities are now making the decision to cut off deferrals for next year to 'make it fairer' for the next academic cohort. Time is not on your side for this decision and you need to consider these things before making a decision.",

      "text": "Hi there, as a lecturer at a Dutch university, it might be worth noting that online lecturing until January 2021 is the \u2018worst\u2019 case scenario. The joint position of the Dutch universities at the moment is that online teaching will happen if necessary - so as to prevent disruption for students - but on campus if this is possible, depending on the progression of the virus and government measures. The government has also just announced today that they will be loosening the current measures (high schools are reopening, restaurants gradually as well). This is not to say that there isn\u2019t still a high likelihood that teaching will be online at the start of the academic year, but hopefully things will continue to improve. It would seem unlikely that you will be able to completely escape having to take at least some online classes if you are set on starting in September - there will be a similar situation in Scotland, and most other countries in Europe most likely. I would let your choice be guided by the university which is the best fit for you based on the programme, and whether you see yourself settling in the country afterwards.",

Thesis supervision has been quite a bit more difficult - personal interaction just makes things so much easier. I've also noticed that certain students have been struggling more (those with disabilities, for example, or students that simply need a bit more support).",

Of course, this will all depend on what happens in the coming months, especially when high schools are set to open in June, so all is subject to change.",

      "text": "I studied in Glasgow and it was the best decision I ever made. Even if you don't end up studying there, please come and visit! I love Scotland, so obviously I'm a little biased ;)\n\nNicola Sturgeon (first minister of scotland) is pretty forward thinking when it comes to most things, I'm hoping that education is one of them as well. She is aware of the impact of online learning on universities, so hopefully they'll be making a few more measures clear in the near future on how to handle it. As far as I am aware, she was the first in the UK to plan an exit strategy, and is hoping to lift the lockdown in phased stages, so there is a possibility you may be able to migrate after all.\n\nThe only bad thing about Scotland is that it is still in the UK (for now, although I will be voting for independence when the time comes) and their bureaucracy might become a little more difficult to navigate for people coming in to the country. But honestly, the UK government is so incompetent and lazy I can't imagine this happening any time soon\n\nThe Netherlands is great: Leiden is a quieter area but its beautiful as well. Even if it is online learning, I'm sure that wouldn't be a barrier to still be able to move there and start to put down some new roots. Sure it'll be easier to stay home until January and you would probably save a lot of money, but there are still flights within the EU that means you can still move there and explore the country, even though it will be a weird first few months if you dont have any on-campus lectures\n\nAlso, I would argue that online teaching is largely redundant, not just because it's hard, but because teaching is only about 10% of a masters. Most of it will be your own research and readings, and how you decide to tie it together. I'm lucky that my masters is coursework-based, and I've actually been using the lectures as a VERY rough guide to what I actually want to research and what I actually want to say in my essays\n\nI moved to Belfast to do my 1-year MSc. I can't tell you what to do obviously, but what I will say is that a course that lasts only one year is really not a lot of time and it goes by way faster than you think it will. By this point I thought I would have done more, met more people, tasted more restaurants, but the truth is that you do get caught up in coursework and just trying to meet the new expectations. Be adventurous if you want to be! It's all about the chances you get and what you decide to do with them.",
