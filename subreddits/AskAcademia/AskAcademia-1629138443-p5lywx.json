  "text": "Last year I finished my (taught) masters degree, and am now finding myself missing the academic world and wanting to continue studying (or start working in academia). However, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here and would really appreciate some advice! \n\nNow with an undergrad and postgrad loan, I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for more degrees. However, I\u2019m unsure I\u2019d get a place on a funded PHD because my Masters was a taught one and not research based. I assume I\u2019m unable to start working in academia unless I have, or am completing, a PHD? \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here? \n\nIf relevant, my undergrad degree was a BA (Hons) in Early Childhood Education and my postgrad was a MA in Social and Public Policy. I currently work as a Family Support Coordinator. \n\nThanks in advance",
