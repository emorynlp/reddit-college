  "title:": "Any advice on what to do when you are scooped by a prominent historical writer in your field?",
  "text": "I've been working on a humanities research/writing project for a year and was planning to eventually bring it to publication. It's become clear later in the research process that a prominent 20th century writer in my field already published on very similar topics and made very similar claims and discussions. \n\nMy first impression was I could still publish, but would need to add a lot of \"Person X has also discussed this in Y\", focus more on how my account differs from Person Y's, and add many citations. \n\nWith that being said, I'm concerned that at this point it won't be clear I'm bringing anything new to the table. It will look like I read Person Y's account first and chose some quibbles to disagree on, rather than having constructed independently a theory which overlaps with his. Worse still, it might seem like I'm not attributing all of my thought processes to him when I should be, since people who don't know me may assume I didn't produce any of it originally.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on what to do in this situation?",

      "text": "To me, being scooped is when someone working at the same time as you publishes the same or closely similar findings just before you did. The title makes it sounds like a senior scholar is stealing your ideas, when that's obviously not what you mean from your description.\n\nSince you're understandably not giving any specific details about the idea/content/etc., it's not possible to give you specific advice about the situation. I'd recommend discussing this with your advisor or any collaborators that you have.",

      "text": "Well...it sounds like you've thought about the topic, and you've already read Person X, so that might be a starting point for a different project - depending on how things work in your field. \n\nOne idea is to write a super-narrow paper criticizing Person X's account and offering your alternative. This could be interesting, given that you have basically the same view: it could get to some very subtle nuances that allow you to build upon Person X's theory and improve it. \n\nIf Person X was around for a while (especially if they're dead), you could frame it as a piece of historical scholarship about Person X's view/texts.  In my field, there's now scholarship on authors that worked as late as the 1970s.",

It happened to me a long time ago, and it happened more recently to a colleague of mine.\n\nIn both cases, we just dropped the topic and moved on to something else. \n\nNeither of us could find an angle that was substantive enough to engage with the topic without being mostly a conversation with the person that \"scooped\" us - and that kind of conversation does not warrant a monograph.  But I was only at the beginning stages of archival research; my colleague was much further along, and had almost completed her archival work.",

      "text": "So just to start off, I'm not super clear re whether you are a student in a PhD program working on your PhD research under supervision of a senior scholar in your field, or if you are a hobbyist. Because a lot of the issues you raise would be covered in basic \"this is how academic research works\" mentorship.\n\n> It will look like I read Person Y's account first and chose some quibbles to disagree on\n\nSo, in the 21st century, most published research is basically this. In most fields, the Newtonian laws of motion and their equivalent have been discovered and heavily elaborated on by scientists in the 20th century, so today research takes the form of minute discoveries in increasingly esoteric subfields of subfields. In the humanities, a lot of it is reinterpreting, resynthesizing, maybe bringing to light some small fact that problematizes a prior interpretation.\n\nFrom an epistemological perspective, the notion that a researcher is some genius locked up in his ivory tower bringing forth world-breaking revelations is naive. Research is a productive conversation between professionals. The typical research contribution corrects the course of a field by a hair rather than charting a new one, and is understood and relevant to only a narrow group of fellow professionals. So if your \"quibbles\" are in any way salient, that's actually pretty good.\n\n> since people who don't know me may assume I didn't produce any of it originally.\n\nThey are more likely to assume that you are simply unfamiliar with the literature of your field. Why assume malice when ignorance will do?",
