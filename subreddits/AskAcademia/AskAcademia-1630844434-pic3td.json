  "text": "Henlo everyone! \n\nI'm a 22-year-old German M.Sc. (Industrial Management) Student with a B.A. in Media Management. My research field is pretty interdisciplinary (will explain in the following), hence my question above. It centres around the usage of chatbots as a communication tool *within* an editorial board or companies to improve workflows (you know, making life easier for Employees rather than an *outside* customer service FAQ-Bot e.g. as an Onboarding-Tool). \n\nThis research field  started as an \"innovation-accident\" in my second semester, because I just had the random idea that maybe this technology might help to eliminate some intersectional problems we had. Now, due to my knowledge of processes, communication and my hobby of coding, I was able to build a prototype and test it in my last thesis. My professor was very impressed by this and is now trying to get me into the \"science world\", meaning I have to write more papers, attend conferences and start my PhD about this topic.\n\nHowever, when looking at my degrees, you can tell I'm not a computer scientist. Neither am I a \"real\" linguist nor an expert in economics. I'm a manger, I know a bit of everything to coordinate and supervise, I'm a generalist not an expert. In addition to that, I'm pretty young and new in the science community. \n\nMy professor has so much trust in me and my topic, yet I feel like an imposter. I am really excited about this opportunity he has presented to me, however I have doubts if I should even be in this field. Maybe people with laugh at my research because it's too shallow and stupid (especially because of my background)? Did you guys feel the same when starting out?\n\nThank you for reading this wall of text, and I'd be very happy about comments! :) <3",

      "text": "So as an interdisciplinary researcher my advice is figure out what you are and don't pretend to be what you're not, you're not a CS person and don't pretend to be, you're approaching your problem from your field/methodology and the findings will be of interest and relevance to the CS community.\n\nWhenever I engage with engineers I do it as a lawyer and historian bringing a legal and historical perspective to an engineering issue rather than claiming I've got some great insight into engineering. The confidence to own your niche will take time but that's true of even 'pure' disciplinary scholarship.",

      "text": "Thank you for your comment! I think I\u2019m not far off with what you are saying regarding the \u201epoint of view of my profession\u201c\u2026 because in the end my main interest lies on the changes in (business-)processes within organization with a bot as a variable. However, I need to understand and use the technology to create a research framework\u2026 and maybe researchers other fields will judge my work negatively when it\u2019s rather \u201esuperficial\u201c to their field?? Maybe I\u2019m just too worried about people being mean\u2026",

          "text": "you probably are a bit too worried about people being mean, but I think it'd be a good idea to talk to your supervisor about your concerns because they can be more specific to your concerns\n\nWhat I mean is that generally your work in fields which you are not an expert in is generally going to be superficial, it can't otherwise be so, but its not the main focus of your work so as long as you are not misrepresenting yourself or your work you won't have a problem\n\nI used to do work on legal/ethical issues of driverless cars, I have a rudimentary working knowlege of the AI involved and my writing/presentations would have a short section giving an overview of that aspect and actual 'AI researchers' would find that element super superficial but I only covered that stuff to provide a context, the core of my work is the law and ethics which is my area of expertise, if I really wanted to delve into the 'science' of AI I did a collaboration with someone qualified to do that delving.\n\nOne thing to think about is how well would you expect a CS masters student with a Bsc in Maths to be versed in management studies?",
