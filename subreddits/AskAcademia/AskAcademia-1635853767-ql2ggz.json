  "title:": "How much time and effort should I expect to put into a 2 credit hour graduate course in comparison to an undergraduate course?",
  "text": "I\u2019m doing a postbacc right now and found out I might have the option to take grad coursework at the main school via the extension school if it\u2019s not full at semester start. It won\u2019t count toward my certificate but I don\u2019t really care since the goal is to get into grad school anyway so showing I can do grad level coursework will look good I think.\n\nIt\u2019s a cognitive neuroscience course and is only 2 credit hours. I\u2019m expecting it to be equivalent to about 6-8 credit hours of upper div undergrad in the same field but I\u2019m not sure what to expect.",

      "text": "I did an MS and PhD in plant ecology, and I found grad classes to have a lot less assigned work than undergrad. It was a rare class that had a test, for example. Usually discussions of papers each meeting, maybe a lab, and then a project at the end (like a draft manuscript of a project, a proposal on a topic, something like that). So each week I just spent, typically, an hour or two a week reading, plus some time working on the project.\n\nThe thing is, everyone in grad school has other shit to do that's more important than classes, at least in my departments. So coursework is a place to learn what's out there and develop professional skills rather than cramming content. There's a good chance you'll be surprised at how little work you need to do for a grad course.",

But those were also both cross-listed as undergrad courses -- a 700-level version of those courses I'd expect to be much higher-level and conceptual, more individualized to student interests, with a product at the end instead of a test.",

The answer is \"to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives of the course via the assessments provided\". \n\nIt could be a survey course with a few essays or presentations at surface depth.\n\n It could be a course requiring understanding of biochemistry, genetics and physiology of the brain (and expect you to come up to speed on all of those to the level of a grad student), and having you engage meaningfully with - and quantitatively analyze - the primary literature. If the population of the class is neuroscientists who are already at a high level, and you're expected to be there....and  you're weak on any of those, that could easily be 20+hrs a week of work.\n\nRead the syllabus and ask the instructor.",

I'm only a part-time student this time (day job and other commitments), but it feels like the workload per course has been much lighter with the exception of 1 class so far. As an online program through a major university (not some for-profit degree mill) the most time-consuming (and annoying) part is the discussion board posts and mandatory replies. I'd rather write papers than do those.",

The person who said they had read 500-1000 pages a week in their program sounded pretty wild, but PhD students don\u2019t work so it\u2019s probably not as crazy as I envision. \n\nHonestly I was always a big fan of professors who expected us to do readings and based their lecture around clarifying it. It was the ones that would base everything around their lecture which was only loosely based on an optional reading (if there even was one) who I would get lost with. Especially if I missed something in my notes leaving me without much reference to go back to.\n\nMaybe that still exists in grad school, but it sounds like a lot more self directed study is involved which is actually ideal to me.",
