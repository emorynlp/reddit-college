  "title:": "NIH Fellowship Reviewers: Innovation Section?",
  "text": "The official application guidelines for NIH individual fellowships/NRSA (F31, F32, etc) do not require/indicate an Innovation section in the Research Strategy. Should an applicant include this anyway because it's standard for R01 applications? The difference though is a Fellowship Research Strategy is only 6 pages, but R01 is 12 pages. Is it better to exclude or include Innovation relative to other sections (approach, potential problems/alternatives, etc) within the page limit?\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "The scope of a fellowship is quite different than the scope of an R01 - there's a reason they don't ask for it. Sure, you could write it, but they're not going to include it in their review.\n\nPro tip- don't include anything they don't ask for in applications. It's time you should be focusing on what they *are* asking for, which is ultimately what they are scoring you on.",
