  "text": "If you hold a PhD and were applying to non-academic jobs, would you include the title 'Dr.' before your name on the top of the resume? (Dr. John Doe)\n\nOr would you write as follows? (John Doe, PhD.)\n\nOr would you just list that you have a PhD in the education section? (John Doe)\n\nOn my academic CV I just write my name (John Doe) because education is the first item listed. From what I've seen my supervisors format their CVs the same way.\n\nFor a resume in a non-academic sector however, education is often listed further down the resume and is easily lost under nebulous headings like \"skills\".\n\nI couldn't find any authoritative take on the matter published online. Links or suggestions are welcome.\n\nI want to foreground the fact I have a PhD as this would likely separate me from many other candidates. However I am concerned about coming across as too formal or elitist.\n\nWith more PhD holders pushing non-academic careers I wonder what the convention is regarding this question.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone who replied. The most popular opinion is to write John Doe, PhD (when crafting a CV in North America).\n\nThat's also what I agree with and will do.",

From what they said, industry jobs often don't require that level of education and industry employers may be afraid to hire a PhD because they'll want a higher salary. If your degree is listed at the back at least they'll have to look at all your other credentials first rather than seeing your PhD and immediately passing you over. I have no idea if this is the norm or not since I haven't applied to anything non-academic but it does make intuitive sense.",
