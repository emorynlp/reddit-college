Professors only pursue a question in as much as it aligns with potential publications. That is the second.",

And at all levels there are resource limitations - at a small liberal arts college, e.g., you might not have access to the types of equipment or other resources (such as time, if teaching load is heavier) needed. There\u2019s always grants, but those also take time, and success can be greatly facilitated by institutional support.\n\nOverall, though, the autonomy is still quite high compared to many other professions, and even at the student level there is often (but not always) a high degree of schedule-setting and independent research. The goal of a PhD program in most cases is to prepare you for an independent research career, so good labs/schools/programs should increasingly allow greater autonomy over schedule and projects as you become more capable.",

Data Analysis: This is a very useful skill nowadays, and when you do a PhD, specially in STEM, Economics, and even some social sciences, you will have to filter, analyze, understand, extrapolate and present lots of data in order to validate you theories. \n2. Project Management: Your Phd is your own project, and you will learn how to manage your timelines, deadlines, constraints, responsibilities, prioritize\n3.

          "text": "Still in the process (nearing the end though), but adding to this:\n\n\n- in addition to travelling, you can get real international work experience by working with colleagues with all over the world, as equals, and navigating all sorts of cultural differences along the way. Personally, I love it, but it's also a real skill that has value in the \"outer world\"\n\n\n- as a researcher, you are by definition proficient in learning new skills and topics, rather independently, as you have to do it all the time. Many people hate arriving at a new job and having to learn the ropes (usually my favourite part of a job, oddly enough), and feel uncomfortable not knowing things. During a PhD, you generally have to either enjoy that feeling or find a way to make peace with it.\n\n\n- for women: we don't have to spend absurd time and money on personal appearance in academia if we don't want to. Recently realised that owning no make-up and no dresses would not fly in many private sector jobs, and the corporate world especially. Small thing, but I feel grateful for it. Still plenty of room for improvement for women's rights in academia, but it's actually not too bad compared to some other professions. (economic issues really need work though, way too much supporting your job out of pocket in academia, which is brutal for lower-income people)\n\n\n- lastly, freedom to build your own career, if you're into that. Not an easy path, but you can create your own job, with whatever mix of research, teaching, mentorship, outreach, industry involvement, government/policy work, art, writing, curriculum design, ??? you desire. Not without unpleasant elements, of course, but that's every job!",

It's a trial by fire against the capricious whims of Mother Nature, and you come out of it having extracted something original and valuable to at least a few people.  You walk the Earth for the rest of your days knowing you triumphed over an unpredictable and stubborn adversary.\n\nPart of what makes it hard is what makes it great.  A degree like a BS is mostly a structured tutorial in learning where the answers are already known by the human race, and can often times be found in the back of the book.  A PhD is a live fire battle with the unknown. You vs the wolves.  If you graduate, you at least scored a blow for humanity.  The sense of self you can get is indescribable.  It lasts a lifetime.",

During your viva, you'll be sat across from two experienced experts in the same field, who will devote at least 2 hours of their time to discussing the project that has swallowed up all of your attention, thoughts, passion and feelings for the previous years. You'll never ever have an opportunity like that again to discuss your passion at such length with such knowledgeable company.\n\n4. Your published work(s) will make a permanent contribution to your chosen field. Even if you deviate from that field after graduation, your mark will still have been made on that subject.\n\nThere are plenty of other pleasantries too. Do you want to become a nocturnal worker? Your supervisor might be happy with that, if you're prepared to put the work in. Do you fancy skipping the office on Wednesday, making up for it another day? Go ahead, your working time is 100% flexible during the course.\n\nIt's also hard work, it's not a qualification given out for free, but when you come out at the other side you'll potentially have far more to contribute to society than when you went in.",
