  "title:": "How to deal with imposter syndrome when getting \"grilled\"/critiqued",
  "text": "I am a STEM graduate student. I recently passed my oral comprehensive exam, so I have no more classes (yay) but I have realized that I am really lacking in responding to questions well orally--in other words, I suck at responding well when getting \"grilled\" by my committee/PI. I want to emphasize--these professors are in no shape or form being particularly mean or anything in their phrasing, I just freeze up. All that runs through my head when I get a question I don't know the answer to is \"I should know this,\" or \"Now they know that I'm actually a terrible student.\" Logically, I know this isn't true--I think I'm a decent student and my PI is very supportive. But in the moment, I tend to really suck at answering on my feet. \n\nI've also gotten the comment that while my breadth of knowledge and logic is decent, I need more \"depth.\"\n\nI guess my question is, what steps do I take to work on improving this skill? Has anyone else dealt with a similar issue and overcome it?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the feedback! I've read all of your comments and will take them to heart. Practice + a perspective change seems to be the reoccurring themes. Again, I appreciate it and hope you all have a great day.",

          "text": "Yeah, I want to emphasize your first point. Giving a talk where you have to present and defend your knowledge is a genre. It has its recurring elements that, if you haven't seen them before, take up a lot of your attention to figure out _while_ you're trying to articulate highly specialized concepts. It's really not fair to ask that of a brain.\n\nAnd by elements of the genre, I mean speaking to an audience who already knows your work, or, holding attention while the a/v bugs are worked out, or, \"that's an excellent question\". The academic presentation genre does get significantly easier the more you do it, and that frees up attention for the kind of information OP currently has trouble accessing in the moment.",

This is not a fitness sub, but a healthy lifestyle tends to decrease anxiety as well - even in the moment.\n\nThe process is supposed to be hard.

      "text": "Thinking on the spot is difficult, especially when you're in front of several people! \n\nIf you would ordinarily have a better answer but can't find it due to \"freezing up,\" I suggest taking a moment after every question to sort of repeat/rephrase the question and identify how it fits into what you're presenting. This can seem redundant, but it's also helpful to audience members; they might not understand what the other person asked or how it fits into what you've already said. Then, you could gradually build off with a couple related thoughts you already had but did not manage to fit into the presentation. That should give you enough time to feel calm before addressing the question.\n\nIf you don't have a good response due to a knowledge gap, there are a couple ways to help. When you're writing a presentation, I think it helps to make the gaps in your work apparent. Presumably you already have good reasons for those gaps, and when people ask about it, you will have plenty to say (avoiding nearly-off-topic questions). Digging into peripheral literature can also help. If someone worked on a similar topic in a completely different way, it might not be relevant to you now, but it likely answers questions that people will have about your work.\n\nMost importantly, you're still learning and it's okay if your responses aren't always great!",

      "text": "1. Before you answer, take a few seconds to go over the question in your mind to make sure you understand it.  Then take a few more seconds to roughly organize your thoughts.  Don't just begin speaking sentences as soon as they come into your head.\n2. Train yourself to avoid the human tendency to fill uncomfortable silences with meaningless talk.  People don't like pauses in a conversation, so they tend to fill them by rambling, often incoherently, in an effort to say something, *anything*, to fill the empty air.  Don't do this!  Not only does random babbling not fool anyone, it's also likely that people will come away with the impression that you actually know less than you really do.\n3. If you don't know the answer, just say so simply and directly.  There is no need to ramble on for 5 minutes about how sorry or ashamed you are that you don't know something.  It just isn't necessary, because your supervisors don't expect you to know everything.  If you have some idea of the answer, you should state what you do know, but then admit when you reach the limit of your understanding or knowledge. \n4. \"Depth\" comes with experience.  However, you don't gain experience merely by letting time pass; experience is gained by work and study.  So, if it really is true that you lack depth in an area important to your work, then it's up to *you* to remedy that situation *on your own time*.  Your professors can guide you, but they can't do it for you.  So if that means evenings and weekends reading textbooks or journal articles or watching instructional videos in order to remedy a weakness in a certain area, then that's what you have to do if you're serious about getting to where you need to be.\n\nWhat you describe seems like what almost every graduate student goes through at some point or another.  If they could overcome this obstacle, then you can too as long as you are willing to make the effort.\n\nGood luck.",

If you are a student it\u2019s more important to indicate a willingness to learn rather than to have all of the answers. Many of the questions raised may come from things learned after university that you haven\u2019t learnt yet\n\nThat said, you\u2019re probably the expert in your specific topic in comparison to your audience. Act accordingly\n\nOther things that improve confidence and reduce anxiety are just working hard, studying and preparing so you know the material well enough to have no insecurity over your efforts. Especially in ways that will expand the depth of your understanding (weird that that is a criticism given that comes with time and generally students need to study what\u2019s in front of them) - be an insatiable learner as a counter\n\nRemember to back yourself and be confident in your ability to learn and process information; you\u2019re a STEM graduate student. Everyone else knows you\u2019re intelligent. You\u2019ve forgotten\n\n(Bonus trick - my go to for imposter syndrome is to remind people here who seem to experience it a lot more than most, that anxiety probably drives people to be life long learners, is that Donald Trump is in the whitehouse - a life long anti learner. If he can get there knowing nothing and still be there giving a hundred interviews a month that prove this, you can give considered intelligent answers)\n\n(Double bonus - exercising before the presentation improves verbal recall, cognition and reduces anxiety.

      "text": "As well as the excellent advice from /u/ChemMJW , remember that the most liberating thing you can do in academia is be perfectly open and honest about when you don't know something. It's amazing how many other people don't know stuff either. If someone asks you something you don't know just go with \"I  don't know; on the basis of X and Y, I guess I might expect Z - what's your understanding of the problem?\" Turn it into a discussion. They are your peers, nothing more, and if they are willing to ask a question they should equally be able to answer or provide guidance. Often these kinds of questions are asked to see how you think about an issue; not because people are expecting a perfect answer; they may well not know the answer. There may not even be an answer.\n\nThe added bonus on the end is that when people appreciate that you are completely open about when you don't know things they are much more likely to approach you with their own items for discussion. And that is the key to building collaborations one new projects. Most of the workI've done in the last 10 years has stemmed from a conversation that goes something like\"huh, I don't know. Maybe we can find out by doing A, B, C\".",

      "text": "I felt the exact same way. My committee meetings and oral exam from MSc to PhD went pretty bad but I still passed it and made it out alive. I will say that I studied and practiced extra hard for my defense and it went very smoothly compared to my oral exam/committee meetings. I feel that the biggest culprit was not knowing enough background knowledge to form a concrete answer during these meetings on top of already being nervous. But for my defense, I made sure to critique every line in my thesis/manuscripts and data and that allowed me to form answers quickly on the spot.\n\nMy advice is to record the questions you get immediately after your committee meetings/oral exam and use that as practice throughout your PhD. For your defense, come up with a list of questions you think they will ask and practice using that as well. If you have time, import the list of questions into Matlab and allow matlab to randomly select questions for you and practice that way if you don't feel comfortable practicing with another person.",
