  "text": "I just finished a committee meeting to discuss when I can defend. My external mentioned that I should have 3 \"real\" journal publications before I am ready to defend. He said that my review paper doesn't count towards that. Are review papers seen as less than technical communications?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe funny thing is, my review paper is my highest cited paper, with over 40 citations since 2020.",

The goal is that your actual research is peer-reviewed, published, and available to the scientific community, not locked away in a dusty dissertation that few people will ever read.",

A PhD is training in producing novel research, so it shouldn't be surprising that a review paper doesn't count toward your dissertation chapters.\n\nOn the other hand, the intro for your dissertation should basically be done.",
