  "text": "Here I ask just about a [university's **internal password protected** discussion boards](https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/other/students-more-likely-to-post-to-discussion-boards-if-anonymous/), just for [university students and instructors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258340306_I%27d_be_so_much_more_comfortable_posting_anonymously_Identified_versus_anonymous_participation_in_student_discussion_boards). \n\nBecause you must log in with your university details and password, can't \"anonymous\" posts be traced and deanonymized, if the university had legal grounds? With the university's permission, PhD's in cybersecurity must know how to unmask the identities of these *\"anonymous\"* posters.",

There are likely multiple systems involved with different levels of users and admins.\n\n* Regular users: students who only see and post to the anonymous discussion.  Maybe they can report issues.\n* Power users: faculty who can do the above and probably also delete problematic posts.  Maybe they get a record of who was active during a given day/week, so that they can give participation credit.\n* Admins: system admins can see the raw database and log files.\n\nWhat's in the database and log files?  It depends entirely on how the system was written.  Each post could be tagged in the database with a userID (which is just not sent to regular and power users).  Maybe logins are logged, which could be cross-referenced to posts if only one person is active at a time.  Or it could be a truly unlogged system that doesn't record anything.  But this is unlikely.",

If you're logged in it isn't anonymous to the system since you had to provide login credentials.  \n\nThis article is referencing the built in \"anonymous\" options in discussion boards which likely means it is just hiding the person's name. I'd be curious to see how awareness of tracking options affects perceived anonymity. Do students with information security backgrounds feel the same level of anonymity using the system's anonymous option as the psychology students studied for the paper?",

For the \"rate strongly disagree to strongly agree\" questions, I only get aggregate data.  The number of \"strongly agree\" responses, the number of \"slightly agree\" responses,....  I do not have the raw data.  For the comments, unless *you* write something identifiable I have no way to discover who wrote what.  Used to be that I got scans of hand-written responses, which I could attempt to correlate to your handwriting, but I haven't gotten that in almost a decade.  If you complain that I wouldn't let you make up a test because your grandmother died, your cat ran away, your car caught on fire, and your boyfriend left you all in one weekend, I can probably figure out who you are.\n* On the faculty side, we get surveys as well.  The last one I got had my email address encoded in the URL and after I completed it I got a little \"gift\" in my mailbox thanking me for completing the survey.  Maybe the survey company strips out identifying information and only includes the fact that I completed the survey in the data they return to the school.  Maybe my email address appearing in the URL is just so that I can't complete the survey ten times.  But I don't do surveys anymore.",
