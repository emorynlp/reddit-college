  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI received a $12k grant a year ago, which was delayed due to covid. I'd like to get started buying research materials, but I'm wondering if I should try to delay the grant further, because travel still isn't happening and I don't really want to gamble on that fact changing.\n\nI can use a small portion of it for a summer stipend, but I cannot use it for a course release.\n\nI had $7k of the grant dedicated to travel.\n\nAre there any creative ways of spending grant money for folks in the humanities? If there were no restrictions, I'd spend it all on course release and research materials.",

      "text": "Depends on what youre field is, what materials you need, and what the current status of your research is.\n\nFor me in History, my current project still requires a bunch of access to non-digitized archives. With that kind of money and travel restrictions I would try to hire out a remote research assistant whose task was just digitize as much as they could lay their hands on and send it to me. If you still need to go somewhere to obtain materials or conduct data collection, and you are in a field where you can trust an assistant to do that collection, you can investigate the possibility of hiring someone for you. I've not done this personally, but because of recent events my department have all been investigating this possibility. Generally you may want to reach out to a local university department, preferably in your field, and see if they have any starving grad students who would take you up on the job. Then youd negotiate an hourly rate, provide them with some equipment (if youre making large PDF docs you might need to provide them with an HDD to load the materials onto and then physically mail that drive to you. Depending on volume you may be able to also use a cloud-based solution, but to my knowledge they also cost money for an enlarged storage option.), etc.\n\nConversely you could ask the institution directly to do the digitization for you. However in my experience, most institutions are reluctant to do big scanning jobs for researchers, paid or not. I asked two separate places this past summer and was told they were willing to do small scans for free but would not under any circumstances do a bigger projects. So YMMV. \n\nOutside of that a travel grant is hard money to spend when travel is so difficult. It really depends on the stipulations of the grant and how much theyre willing to work with you on spending the money. You may consider additional database access, 'would be nice' technology that would make collection and processing easier, a local assistant if data entry or coding is a potential hurdle, books or other published document collections where available, etc. \n\nBut I feel your pain. I let about half of a (much smaller) travel award expire over the summer because there just wasn't anywhere that I could go or that would even *let* someone in. Ive heard some places are already beginning to shut back down as well. Places like the National Archives may well not open back up for public access the rest of this year.",
