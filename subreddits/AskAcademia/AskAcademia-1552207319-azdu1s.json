  "title:": "I think I need to quit my PhD. How can I do this respectfully and professionally?",
  "text": "I am currently a first year PhD student and I think I need to quit my program. When I got to my senior year of undergrad I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. In a panic I applied to grad schools and somehow got accepted. I have no real research experience and had no idea what I was getting into. \n\nIn my first year my grades have been good and my PI is happy with my performance. However,  I\u2019m extremely unhappy. I dread going into the lab, I generally dislike the people I work with, and I just can\u2019t see myself doing this 10 years from now. I have no motivation to do work and that is something I\u2019ve never experienced before.  I sleep for a minimum of 10 hours at a time and I don\u2019t feel rested. I think I\u2019m becoming depressed, I feel myself beginning to slip and I need to leave.\n\nHow can I do this without burning bridges? I respect the hell out of  my PI, but this isn\u2019t for me. Any advice would help. \n\nThanks for reading.",

      "text": "Hey, I'm sorry you're struggling with your mental health so much. It's actually a great thing that you're deciding to put yourself first, so dont feel ashamed about that. Many postgraduates fall into the trap of thinking it's normal to feel that way and end up doing some damage to themselves, so yes absolutely take time for yourself to get better.\n\n\nAs for your programme, honesty is always the best way to handle this. Of course there's no need to say \"I hate everyone and dread coming in\" but sitting your PI down and saying that you are struggling with your mental health and you think you leaving would be best for both you and the lab is not you burning bridges by any means. Of course stay respectful and only reveal as much personal stuff as you feel comfortable to, but be honest. I think your PI may just suggest you take a sabbatical and then try to come back. As horrible as this situation is, unfortunately it just happens.",

      "text": "I want to add to everyone else's comments that people drop out of PhDs pretty frequently. It's practically impossible to really know what you're getting into and the first year shock is real. If you're polite and respectful I don't think you have to worry. I'm sure people will be disappointed, but they probably won't be upset and perhaps not even surprised. ",

          "text": "Agreed. Don't beat yourself up over quitting after your first year. It's far better to quit now than to spend precious years of your life doing something you hate. The PhD process is hard enough when you love it. A lot of folks who quit PhD programs don't do so until they're all the way through coursework. Do yourself a favor and move on now. \n\nBut first, make use of your campus health care and counseling services to get evaluated and treated for depression. Then make use of your campus career development office figure out some fields of work you might actually want to pursue.\n\nDon't think of this as a failure--think of it as an experiment that gave you information about what you do and don't want to do with your life.

      "text": "Honestly I'm half way through my PhD and feel incredibly stressed, depressed and drained all the time. I respect the hell out of someone who can, very early on, identify when a path isn't right for them. I'd agree that taking a break is good - often just stepping back and giving yourself time to not think about it either gives you renewed interest, or clarifies that your purpose is elsewhere. Any academic knows what it is like to feel as you feel, especially someone who has worked their way up the ladder to be a PI. I'd let them know you respect them and your work, but that issues in your personal life and/or mental health (however much you feel like sharing) mean you need to take a step back. It's important to remember that your *life* and *health* come before any 'career path.'",

After you have started to get help, really think about if it\u2019s your mental health that is making you hate your PhD or your PhD that is affecting your mental health. It sounds like you did not have a strong drive to get a PhD and you just did it because you didn\u2019t know what else to do. I did the EXACT same thing, and it\u2019s refreshing to hear I am not the only one.  I\u2019ve been on the verge of dropping out many times. For better or worse, I pushed through and am almost done. If you decide a PhD is really not for you, then you just go your advisor and tell them nicely that this is not for you. You do not have to tell her/him that it\u2019s because of mental health. If you truly think you would be happier doing something else, tell your adviser that",

Let me just add one thing you might want to consider:\n\nWhen we've had students decide they wanted to leave before finishing the PhD, a number have been able to transfer into the MA program. You might be able to get a master's in another year (maybe even less), and some programs have a 'non-thesis' master's option, where you'd take an exam or something similar rather than doing original research. Worth asking the administrator that supervises the graduate program you're in, at any rate. ",
