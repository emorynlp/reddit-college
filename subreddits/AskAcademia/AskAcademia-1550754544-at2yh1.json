  "text": "A lighter discussion for the afternoon. \n\nI wanted to put this question to you all. I feel that it's important to talk about what people enjoy outside their studies. I think it's important for younger graduate students (like myself) to understand that it's not all about studying. \n\nI only ask because I actually picked up cross stiching in the last year to help me relax. It really helps. I also go to the gym and (when I can) take part in historical re-enactment. However, the great thing about something like cross stiching is that you can actually see things coming together and having a end point is an imporant thinking. Especially when doing a PhD. \n\nSo what are your hobbies outside work? Feel free to give suggestions and tips. ",

Most people in my degree program have dogs, maybe it's doing our PhD at a University with a big vet school. A bunch of us get together often in the summer for pick-up soccer plus beer plus dogs, which is very delightful. It also gives me a solid excuse to leave lab, so I work more reasonable hours which has saved me from getting pretty burnt out, I think.",

Also important to have something reliably constructive with defined benchmarks/endpoints.

I get an opportunity to create new items from raw materials. I go through the process of planning out a project and then working through the unforeseen obstacles as I advance the project along. Then I get the joy and pride of sharing something I built with others.\n\nIt flexes the same mental muscles as research, but it's on a much shorter time horizon and I can reach the same endgame more quickly. In fact, when I'm struggling with research, I'll go build something just to remember how to finish a project. Finishing research is a habit and woodworking helps me remember how to close the deal.",

I used to be a massive gamer, but as I got older and had more responsibilities it had to go on the backburner. But now I'm playing that for some of the weekend. It's nice because my other \"hobbies\" are usually things like poker, which are things I also study for to get better.\n\nI play guitar and write songs, too, but that's had to take a backseat since the workload increased and I picked up these new hobbies.\n\nI'm finding that I only really have one night a week (if that) free to see friends and have a social life, if I do everything else that I want to in the week.
