If you're going to be wearing it often, then I would buy the hood (approximately $100) from your PhD institution, and a doctoral gown and tam (approximately $150) from Amazon, unless you wish to shell out upwards of $800 for the official custom regalia.",

The hood has the color for your degree on one side (dark blue for PhD, light blue for EdD, pink for DMA, green for MD, etc.) and the other side are your school colors.\n\nFor the robes, you can get the generic black (make sure they are doctoral robes and not MA or BA robes) or the robes that your university used.  I opted not to pay $1000 for our special robes and picked up a used rental one on ebay for about $30.  Our faculty senate has a closet of old robes that people donated when they retired so people could borrow them. \n\nThe upper, upper administrators often wear the doctoral regalia of the university they are the president/provost/regent of.  \n\nAll of that being said, so many people borrow from others or rent one from their university, that you get a good mix and people will often joke around about them.",

Seeing the tassel and insert colors for various fields is interesting as well.",
