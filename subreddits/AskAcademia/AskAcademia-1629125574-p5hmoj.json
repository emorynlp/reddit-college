  "text": "Apologies if this has been asked before. I want to know if it's possible for someone (with a PhD) to research and maybe publish even if they are not affiliated to a university/educational institution. One way that comes to mind, is to collaborate with someone who is affiliated somewhere, but I am unsure if people working in academia are allowed to collaborate with people who have no formal academic affiliation. I understand that being outside academia can mean lack of access to journals and literature but presumably a collaborator can help with that if necessary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this something that varies across region/field/area (I'm interested in physics, if that helps).",

Often it's just the one person working out of their house. But incorporating   \"Quanterion Research Associates\" or what ever, has benefits such as making it easier for colleagues at universities to use grant funds to work with you,  making it easier to deal with scientific supply/service companies which sometimes only deal with companies/universities, and possibly adding some impression of legitimacy when publishing or presenting. Probably not worth the hassle for the occasional collaboration, but if you plan on sustained collaboration worth a look. \n\nThe biggest factor though will be having an existing publication record/academic reputation (which hopefully you'd have by the end of the PhD).",

      "text": "Without being affiliated with a legitimate research institution of some type, you're likely to run into problems when you try to publish in STEM journals.\n\nOne reason is that STEM experiments are regulated by all kinds of governmental and institutional rules, and without that affiliation, the journals have no way to know whether you complied with applicable relevant safety and ethical guidelines.  For all they know, you could be some crackpot torturing animals in your garage and calling it an \"experiment.\"  Of course, being associated with a university doesn't absolutely guarantee that you've conducted ethical and safe research either, but the chance is much higher that you were subject to at least some reasonable degree of oversight and accountability.\n\nAnother reason that science journals can be hesitant to accept submissions from those not associated with legitimate institutions is that it prevents them from having to spend time evaluating tons of submissions to see whether they meet even a minimum threshold for legitimacy.  Otherwise, they'd have to wade through tons of papers from Joe Random Person claiming to have proven the Collatz conjecture or to have perfected cold fusion or to have invented a perpetual motion machine, etc.\n\nSo, for better or worse, being associated with a legitimate institution is taken as prima facie evidence that you're a legitimate researcher whose work in general meets a minimum standard of acceptability.  Journals receive far, far more submissions than they can actually publish, so taking a gamble on an unaffiliated researcher is often simply not worth the time and effort when there are plenty of other submissions around.\n\nStill, it's not absolutely impossible to publish without an affiliation.  If you intend to do so, the best strategy is to explain your background and qualifications in explicit detail in the cover letter you provide along with your submission.  You need to convince the editor who handles your submission that you have the training and expertise required to have done and understood the work you report in your manuscript.  If you can convince the editor that you're legit, your manuscript might get sent out for review.  If you just appear to be some random person who submitted a manuscript, the paper will likely be rejected without a second thought.\n\nGood luck.",

It is pretty hard to write a paper that passes even a cursory scan.  A random dude torturing animals in his basement is unlikely to have the intellectual rigour to generate a professional level manuscript.  And if it is not professional level, it gets booted immediately.\n\nThere are obstacles, such as requiring approved ethics for animal and human experiments, which can be difficult for an independent researcher, but the sheer fact of being independent is NOT an obstacle to doing valid research and getting it published.",

I cannotsay I even look at affiliation when assessing a manuscript.\n\nIt's hard to reconcile your statement with the demonstrated fact that well known researchers with prestigious affiliations are accepted to the best journals at elevated rates regardless of the quality of the particular manuscript in question.  So if you don't look at the affiliation, kudos to you, but you're in a group of 1.\n\nWith regard to the rest of your comment, I'm certainly willing to grant that this openness to independent researchers might vary from field to field (you didn't mention your field), but what you wrote would without doubt be sheer nonsense in my field, molecular bioscience.  A person without an affiliation barely gets a look, and rightly so, because their lack of affiliation automatically implies that the chance they were able to perform research to the required safety and quality standards of a professional lab is nearly zero.\n\nThat's the whole point: an official affiliation automatically grants the veneer of appropriateness / suitability / rigor that is not automatically available to those without an affiliation, and is exactly why those without an affiliation have a much harder time publishing, at least in STEM.  I don't know about the humanities or social science, but I assume that it would be much easier to publish without an affiliation in those fields.",
