  "title:": "I have an AI disease. Should I self-disclose my disability in a job application's diversity questionnaire?",
  "text": "Hey all, for some background, I'm an American academic in the Humanities who has an invisible disability\u2014 specifically, an autoimmune disease. I've been working the adjunct beat for about eight years and am fed up, so I'm casually looking for jobs. I'm applying for a FT job slightly out of my discipline\u2014 they prefer a M.L.S. degree but will take mine, too\u2014 so I'm nervous about giving the hiring committee any reason to boot me out.  Other than that, due to my training I'm pretty much an ideal fit, so I feel decently good about my chances nonetheless.\n\nSo, I'm filling out the diversity questionnaire as part of the application process and there's the dreaded question: \"do you declare or have a recorded history of a disability?\"\n\nSo, now I have to ask\u2014 What. Do. I. Choose?  My options are \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"I'm not telling.\"\n\nFor years I've dealt with the statement \"you don't look sick\" from professors and colleagues. When people talk about ADA accommodations, employers usually forget about any chronic disease that doesn't disfigure a person outwardly.  (Heck, I had to check just to see if the government even recognizes my condition. Yes, they do.) Hell, I've heard my own colleagues gripe and moan about dealing with teaching accommodations from students.\n\nYes, I know I have rights. But I also know that employers can find a thousand different reasons to toss an application on the reject pile that don't involve the words \"disability accommodations.\" At the same time, I can't exactly put \"no\" since my disease has been a problem ever since my MA program, can I?\n\nSo, what's the smart move here? I feel like the third option (not telling) is just a coy way of saying \"yes.\"  At some point, I will have to have a chat with the Disability Office about accommodations either way, so I can't keep it under wraps forever.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much to all of you for clarifying how applications are processed in regards to ADA accommodations! The application goes out tomorrow morning, and I'm choosing 'yes.' ",

I asked my students to raise their hand if they were immunocompromised. I waited a beat and raised *my* hand. I asked if anyone knew why I was in that category.   \nHalf of my class pointed toward the middle of their chests - where I keep my insulin pump.
