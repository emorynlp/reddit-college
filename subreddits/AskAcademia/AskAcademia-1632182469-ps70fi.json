      "text": "Best thing to improve writing is to actually start writing and get feedback. Start an academic blog and then ask your teachers for feedback so you can get better. It\u2019s a skill and you need a coach. If you wanted to learn how to swing a bat you might watch some people but you eventually have to start swinging and getting people to tell you what you are doing wrong.",

      "text": "'Grammarly' checks your grammar and spelling. As for writing, unfortunately, I do not know. Things like vocabulary and creating a flow comes only with practice and tons of reading. If you are not capable of creating a flow, start by using structures/subsections and connecting them to match your narrative. You'll start to notice how to arrange them, and later create/remove sentences to better connect them. Thats the basics for me.\n\nAs for vocab - read papers, write your own, and make a list of unique words/terms you find applicable. Good luck :)",
