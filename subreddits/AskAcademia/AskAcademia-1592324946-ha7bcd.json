  "title:": "Anthropology department and possible issue with Native American remains.",
  "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI am posting to get advice/resources on what to do. I just finished the second year of my masters as part of an Anthropology department. Recently, a professor in my department showed me a substantial collection of Native American remains the department has. When I started to ask questions about the collection, he told me that it was fine and legal for him to own the remains because \"the man who owned them before me gifted them to me when he died\". He never mentioned anything about attempting to repatriate the remains to the proper tribe(s).\n\nI don't know if I am over reacting but I don't want to stay silent if indeed these remains need to be repatriated. However, if I report my department I am worried that they will make the rest of my time at school a living hell. \n\nI am wondering if there are any ways to anonymously report this to either NAGPRA or a similar institution. I am not 100% positive that us having the collection at our university is wrong, but the whole thing feels very off to me and I think it warrants being checked on. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.",

If it is \"an open secret\" on the campus, then it is much less likely to be traced back to you, especially if you wait a few months before reporting it. It's a bit harder to protect yourself otherwise. \n\nIf your university has an ombuds office, you may be able to go there for some guidance on who you can reach out to while protecting yourself. If there are any non-university affiliated Native lobbying groups or activist organizations (or maybe even university affiliated ones), you may also be able to set a meeting with someone there to discuss the collection and find out whether the collection is known about outside of the university and if any efforts have been made in the past to repatriate the remains. You could also just start talking about it with other students that you think will care about it to start a movement to repatriate within student organizations.",

The only way I can think of these remains being 'legal' is that they were found on private property with owners permission in a state which doesn't protect human remains (there are several which unfortunately do not). I doubt each and every private collector who says they obtained their remains and funeral goods legally however and I doubt your professor has sufficient documentation. In some states, it is not even legal to receive human remains as a gift. \n\nEthically, this is a huge no for an Anthropology department. If it's not an official collection, it falls on your professor. If it is an official collection, then they should be at some stage of NAGPRA compliance at this point. If they are not at any stage, that is a problem.",

Last I had looked there was 245 federally un-recognized tribes not afforded protection under NAGPRA so you could always do some provenance digging on your own to see if this is the case. I still think you should absolutely make it known. The federal recognition aspect of NAGPRA is somewhat bullshit and should be expanded. There is precedent though that it applies to any tribe that has received federal funds regardless of current status. If you can figure out what cultural group they belong to and then reach out to that tribe to let them know, someone from the tribe can make a request via NAGPRA to have those remains returned. If they're a part of a collection I can guarantee that the data is somewhere, accessible through your University. You'd definitely need supporting documentation though to prove it.\n\nUnfortunately it looks like NAGPRA requests and backlogs don't seem to be any more expedient than when I was an undergrad. Someone correct me if that's not the case. Good luck. I know this is a tough position to be put in.",
