  "text": "I would like to start with this position as soon as possible since I\u2019m applying for grad school in 2 months and I have no references (dropped out a while due to medical issues). Initially I was going to help this professor but suddenly after months they let me know it\u2019s not possible.\n\nThe professor said I should mention: my interests, what type of tasks I would like to do, and a bit about myself and why I would like to do it.\n\nI\u2019m afraid that if I specify my interests that I\u2019m missing out on opportunities. If I don\u2019t specify it then I just won\u2019t look motivated.\n\nWhat would be the best way to phrase this email? Thank you",

          "text": "I would focus the list of research interests to topics in that the faculty are actively researching. Also, while a long list might be impressive in a breadth of knowledge, I feel a shorter list of focused interests can show that you have conducted prior research of the faculty and doesn't encourage eyes to glaze over when reading a long list.\n\nOtherwise this format is basically what got me my first RA position.",

      "text": "The suggestion from psychbxnbeyond is good for writing the email. I want to caution you about your expectations for a letter of recommendation for graduate school: even if you were to start working as a lab assistant today, that does not leave a lot of time for the professor to get to know you well enough to write a letter detailed and strong enough for graduate applications. After knowing you for less than two months, I also think it is likely that the professor will not yet feel comfortable writing the letter.\n\nYou should absolutely pursue this lab assistant position, but you might need to wait until the next application cycle so that you have strong letters.",

That will give you a sense of what your options are so that you can target your interests and skills accordingly. Since the email will be going out en masse, I don\u2019t recommend getting too narrow with your interests or goals, but also make sure you say things that align with the work of several people you are most interested in working with. If you don\u2019t get any responses, consider reaching out to individual faculty based on the research you do on the dept, which will allow you to write an even more targeted message.",

So use the opportunity to build your ability to do so. Decent \u201ctemplate\u201d that will surely suffice above. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, just remember the world can\u2019t see all you have to offer, at some point you\u2019ll have to be able to translate those abilities to the team :) now go get em\u2019",
