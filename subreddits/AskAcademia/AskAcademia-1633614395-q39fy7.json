  "title:": "Negotiating remote work for post-doc position",
  "text": "I am finishing my PhD in a few weeks and have been offered an amazing post-doc. However, the position requires me to move abroad for one year. However, my spouse would not move abroad with me. Standard leave for post-docs at the institution is two weeks, plus university holidays throughout the year (US Thanksgiving, New Years, etc.). Traveling home would require two days each way, so I would only be able to see my spouse 7-10 days per year. He gets similar leave, and could maybe visit me once for a week.\n\nI would like to negotiate a few weeks of remote work, which would enable me to see my spouse for more than a week once a year. 2-3 weeks remote work would be not ideal, but enough. I think I would take the position even without this, but it would make my year considerably less miserable.\n\nHow do I negotiate remote work? Do I need to justify myself, or is it better to leave out personal details? When in the hiring process do I need to negotiate this? Other advice?\n\nA few details:\n\n\\-I have not received a formal offer yet. I have interviewed and gotten verbal confirmation that I am an ideal fit and the only candidate being considered for the job. The next step is for the PI to create a position description tailored to my skillset, so I can formally apply.\n\n\\-A major role of the position is to mentor a team of researchers in a developing country. The team is quite experienced from previous projects and self-sufficient for data collection, but requires support for nuanced aspects of analysis and academic manuscript preparation. The goal is to mentor the team through writing first-author papers suitable for top-tier journals. While I see why the position needs to be in-country most of the time, it seems feasible that this type of support could be provided remotely for a few weeks without the team suffering too much.",

      "text": "Definitely discuss this sooner rather than later, but also be realistic with your spouse and their efforts/willingness to support your relationship.\n\nI would not be able to keep a relationship going on 10 days a year of contact, but some can and fair play to them.\n\nObviously some roles cannot be remote, but if they could negotiate a period for their own remote working then you'll be in a much better spot.\n\nPlenty of postdocs work remotely for extended periods, some even through the majority of their contract, but it's so variable with institutional rules,  funding rules, PI's preferences etc.",

      "text": "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I agree with mafiafish to talk about this with your potential advisor sooner rather than later. It's late to be bringing this up now if you already have a verbal offer. I would be a little annoyed that this had not been discussed earlier as the prof would have wasted time not looking for someone else and wasted time writing up the position and so on, if it is something they do not want to do or are not able to do. That said, some profs are comfortable with remote postdocs. Another issue is that some universities allow remote postdocs but many do not at all so it may not even be a choice for this professor even if they wanted to do it. Do you know if this is allowed are this unviersity? You should tell them about this immediately. In terms of why you want to be remote, honesty is always the best. Good luck. I hope this works out for you. Family and spouse issues for postdocs are so hard.",

      "text": "I'm going to go against the grain a bit: I think your negotiation tactic should be influenced by whether or not remote working is deal breaker.\n\nIf you won't take the position if you cannot work remotely occassionally, then yes, mention it as soon as possible or you'll be wasting everyone's time.\n\nIf you'll accept the position regardless, but would ideally want to work remotely, then wait until you have a formal job offer. Otherwise you risk having the offer withdrawn and the PI looking for someone else instead.\n\nI think you will need to justify yourself. It'll probably be difficult to demonstrate a real benefit for the PI in letting you work remotely, so I'd focus on minimising any concerns they might have: Have you previously demonstrated you can work from home effectively? Explaining to the PI which tasks you think you could do well from home might also help.\n\nAs for explaining the personal reasons why you want to work remotely: The PI I worked very much pro-flexible working, and ensuring that work was not at the detriment of family life. Other PIs, unfortunately, couldn't care less about helping their post docs have a good work-life balance. I'd say that whether you should explain your personal circumstances depends on which group this PI falls in.",

      "text": "Personally, I would not be willing to take a job that would only allow me to see my spouse for 2-4 weeks a year (which is the time period it sounds like you are working with in the best case outcome?). Even if it's just for one year...that's a long time. How does your spouse feel about this?\n\nPost-docs don't keep you warm at night. Or take care of you when you're sad or sick. Or laugh with you over a home-cooked meal. We have a finite amount of time on this Earth. We should spend it with the people we love. It makes me sad whenever I see academics sacrificing so much for jobs where their self-worth is rarely respected. \n\nJust think really hard about what your priorities are for yourself and your marriage before moving forward with this. Wishing you the best.",
