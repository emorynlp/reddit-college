  "text": "I was asked to adjunct teach a course for a university I am staff at. This course would force me to rearrange my entire schedule. They offered me $1600, plus the department head was very condescending. My other adjunct work pays $3500 at another university. Is this normal!?\n\nThankfully I have a clinical license that allows me to have other employment opportunities and the adjunct teaching I\u2019ve done supplements my income and gives me experience on my CV for when I complete my PhD. \n\nBut it is absolutely criminal what they pay! It comes to roughly 16$/hour that you\u2019re in class, not including the grading and office hours. ",

I guess turning it down is an option, but you've got to build up your CV if you want to move on to a better job.",
