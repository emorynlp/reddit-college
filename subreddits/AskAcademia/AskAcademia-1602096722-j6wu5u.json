  "title:": "Appropriate to a wine bottle as a undergrad research assistant?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a 21 junior undergrad research assistant, I get along really well with my research professor. I had to fly home this week to get my wisdom teeth, because of having to quarantine when I get back I essentially can\u2019t help him for 3 weeks. We do a lot of field work so 3 weeks is quite a long time to be out. He\u2019s letting me work remote by learning ArcGIS with a seminar he told me to attend, which has been a really big help with my finances. \n\nSince I\u2019m back home, there\u2019s a lot of local vineyards that have really good wine. We work in Alaska and he mentioned a few times about liking the local brewery\u2019s so I thought this would be a cool gift since he hasn\u2019t been around a lot of the United States. It\u2019ll be a cheap $30 bottle of wine, would this be ok? I\u2019ll be working with him for another 2 years including summer till o graduate.\n\nEdit: sorry for the misspelled title, I actually just got my wisdom teeth out this morning rip",

That article was also discussed in a (semester long) wine tasting course I took and nobody was really sure how they couldn't tell the difference between a white wine and a red wine - pretty big difference between the two.  \n\n\nTo the larger point, a trustworthy sommelier will tell you straight up that you can't tell the *price* difference between a well made cheap wine and an expensive one. However, you should be able to taste the difference between *types* of wine (e.g., chardonnay, reisling, merlot, etc.) which is something you can even try yourself by doing at tasting. In the United States the general range for well made wines is between $10 and $30, depending upon type, region, local taxes, etc.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to the expensive wines - you aren't always paying for the beverage and in some cases you are just paying for the marketing.",

When blinded to the pricing and marketing, we really cannot tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine. As you said, for expensive wines you are sometimes just paying for the marketing. Nothing wrong with this at all, it's just an interesting how it affects our minds.",

You should probably know this from your IRB training on human subjects/academic dishonesty.\n\nMost schools in the states use a total of 100$ yearly. Alcohol is fine because you are both of age.

Think of it not as an apology but more as a unique opportunity to give someone a gift they have previously stated enjoying, and I assume taxes on it in Alaska are quite high. This is akin to getting someone  really nice salt water taffy or something, totally appropriate.",

I went to a Halloween party with 10 or 12 of the professors in our department, graduate student, and undergraduates over age that worked in the labs. As long as you conduct your self in a mature manner. \n\nWe had perspective students come through a couple months later and one guy completely got plastered and revealed a checkered history. Needless to say I don't think an invite was extend to join us and professors definitely decided not to add him to their groups had he come. Ultimately, gave us a great story, and professors knew that he was a liability and weeded him out.",
