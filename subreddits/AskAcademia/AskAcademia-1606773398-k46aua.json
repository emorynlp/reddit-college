One problem seems to be the dinosaurs, despite official noises denying such a thing, still ultimately defaulting to using publishing in high-impact journals as a quality signifier, and the thing people are assumed to be aiming for, and thus having failed at if they don't have it.\n\nI do think we do need some kind of gatekeeping to signal quality beyond likes on Twitter and bullshit-artistry, and it needs to involve something like the ideal version of the current situation with gradations in selectivity of peer review controlled by respected academics, but it needs to be disentangled from the self-interest of journals and no longer perversely incentivized.",

I'm competing with them and their students for resources.\n\nThis is a big part of the problem: the changes need to be top-down, ERCs should not have to handicap themselves, while competing for resources with established, famous labs who also started out in an easier job market.",

As far as I can tell it's not self-correcting just from internal processes. I suspect it's thanks to public scandals like the Stapel affaire and the replication crisis showing the dirty laundry that there's even a chance at a shift.\n\n(There's also a whole other level that's more inner-circle than I have a clear view of, where I suspect publishing in certain journals is strongly linked to belonging to certain cliques and thus signaling that when applying for grants or jobs. At least, when I was working for a big lab with a powerful PI things were a loooot different in communications with editors etc.)",

The university also has deals with several publishers to waive all OA fees for university-affiliated authors; I guess in return university pays more for the subscriptions.\n\nIt doesn't solve the problem of outrageous fees in some journals, but it at least makes sure that (junior) researchers without big grants won't be at a disadvantage with regards to publications in high IF journals.

Precisely because of the open access license, university libraries are free to make copies for repository archiving and use the associated doi. In fact, they already do that with existing open access journals, and e.g. Google Scholar already prioritises the library archive versions in search results. So your concern about lost data is actually an argument to go open access.\n\nHigh rejection rates are a problem in general and generally waste millions of hours of people's time. I'd be all for having a model with higher acceptance rates where there is an interactive and open review forum. Perhaps a model where reviewer privelages are earned over time, in order to shut out trolls.\n\nI think you are so caught up in the academic mindset that you can't see the alternatives as better and viable, and dismiss them as soapbox pipe dreams. It's a shame, but not uncommon.\n\nAs for Apple and car companies, their profit margins are much, much lower than Elsevier and Springer Nature. Look it up.",

But unless your journal works differently than most, neither you nor the reviewers are getting paid for that labor. So what does the labor with the other 80-85 have to do with the problem of expensive APCs? Yes, there are some costs with administering the process. What are those costs? Additionally, what makes the \"factors\" an article publisher needs to consider more valid, more pressing, or more important than those if the academics themselves? Theoretically this is supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nI feel like if people involved in the system are going to use the \"but you just don't have all the ~context~\" argument, they should be at the ready to actually explain that context. Being dismissive of a pretty widely held industry concern isn't constructive or valid, either.\n\nAlso the fact that profit margins are also high on cars (which is actually not true) or iPhones is completely irrelevant. So what? Academic publishing is a different beast, and also, it sounds a lot like \"well everyone else is being exploitative too, so don't look over here!\"",

Another rule of thumb: do not pay money to submit to or publish in a journal that you were invited to submit to (e.g., with a targeted email); it is likely a money grab / scam, and if they genuinely want your submission they should not be asking you to pay.\n\nThere is some discipline-specific variance about how common it is to pay to publish. Within my discipline, it is quite rare, and when it happens, it is to make an article open-access or for an open-access journal. Within other disciplines, I know that it is quite common and there are reputable journals that charge to publish. This should be paid for with university funds or grant money.\n\nIn general, I do not like the idea, but there are degrees of how much I dislike it. $3000 to publish an article sounds outrageous. On the flip side, a nominal processing fee for an article that will be open access that covers the cost of running the journal is less outrageous.",

Unfortunately there is probably always some degree of skimming off the top happening, ranging from the wholly fraudulent journals pocketing almost all of the money to the legitimate journals taking a much lower proportion.

Most of the editors don't even produce a work of edition: they don't accept papers that aren't already perfectly publishable, conforming to the review's guidelines. That should be illegal AND as researchers, we shouldn't accept this anymore. Publishing in a top-10 review shouldn't be a criteria to be hired as a researcher.",

That genuinely covers their costs for running the journal.\n\nNature Communications charges $5k (you are essentially paying for prestige), and in an environment where there aren't enough jobs to go around, and where we are funded by taxpayers, that kind of fee cannot be justified. Unfortunately enough people are willing to put their own selfish interests ahead of the common good for Springer Nature to make a huge profit anyway.",
