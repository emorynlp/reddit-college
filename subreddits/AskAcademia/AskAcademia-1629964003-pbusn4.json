  "text": "Do you know any capable .pdf converter into MS Word for *macOS* that would keep the format of the converted file as much as possible?\n\nRecently, I came by some interesting articles, which are unfortunately written in Japanese and Chinese. By the abstract in English, I could tell that they address my research. Hence, I would like to convert these .pdfs into MS Word and then translate the whole file, but I would like to avoid online converters as I do not want to upload these articles on the internet.",
