You are telling this to someone who has gone to college library. Gone to all bookshops available in Nepal. And gone to all books in libgen. LOL. Yes it is my problem. How did I not born in USA or any developed countries . Hell yeah that's my problem, why didn't I born in India? What a big problem I have. Ohoo...:)\n\n\n> but there's at least one that had everything except the PCB layout in it.\n\nNo reason to believe in you unless you tell me book name. I legit have googled everything, gone to every library. There was 1 book that came close to my need it was microprocessor and interfacing by dv hall and sssp rao. Also chapter 6,7,8 are somewhat well covered by various EMC books. \n\nI am not trying to mock you or demean you but I am pretty frustrated with not finding any resources regarding this topic. I mean why would I lie??\n\n>I'm pretty sure the super common Electronics for Inventors (or something similar, never used it) at least touches on all these subjects.\n\nI will check that out.
