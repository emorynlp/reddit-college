  "text": "\n\nI\u2019m a PhD candidate in biology and in a research- focused university. I hope to seek some advice regarding  writing recommendation letter for my thesis advisor to the Vice Dean in charge of faculty. My advisor ( relatively young PI) is an exemplary mentor who has inspired me in many ways in terms of scientific thinking and she truly cares a lot about students progress/and gives us both the space and support to develop our scientific minds. Therefore, \nI would like to write a recommendation letter for her in hope that it will be beneficial for her tenure consideration.\n\n\nMy hesitation is that: how effective will this letter be in aiding her to get tenure? Or will it on the contrary, be something against her(?)- I am not sure how common is this practice of students writing recommendation letters for their advisors are in academia.",

      "text": "The best thing to do is ask the professor whether there is any way you can help her compile materials for her tenure application. While that conversation is taking place, ask whether there is any room for a student to write about how much she has helped as a mentor. \n\nThe guidelines are different at every university, but they are generally organized around teaching, research, and service. The mentorship/advising of a PhD student can often be bent and shaped to be included in any of the three sections. (There will always be a set place for it, but if she needs it to help support a weaker area of her application.) So, in summary, the best thing that you can do is make the offer directly to her and offer to do whatever she needs to help her case for tenure. If she doesn\u2019t need the help, she\u2019ll be happy that you asked because she\u2019ll know personally that she\u2019s doing a good job in that part of her job. If she does need help, she\u2019ll be glad to have an ally in presenting her case.",

      "text": "Definitely ask to see what would be helpful, but as a professor builds their portfolio, they will include any sort of thank you note/evaluation, etc., that shows that they have been an effective teacher.  So even if you don't write something specifically for her tenure, any letter of appreciation, especially one that says particularly what you have listed above in terms of how she was good at her job, will be helpful when she is applying for tenure or future jobs.",

      "text": " I\u2019ve been on tenure and promotion committees, and letters from students are a required part of the portfolio. Some are gathered by the applicant while others are selected semi-randomly by the registrar. A letter like yours would certainly be important if I were reading through all the materials; a significant part of a thesis advisor\u2019s job, after all, is directing student research well. Ask your prof if you could write a letter, as it will be one less thing she will need to worry about collecting when it\u2019s time to assemble her promotion packet. \n\nOne other thing: the rank and tenure committee is probably composed of faculty from all disciplines, so information about the candidate\u2019s teaching and mentorship will help the non-scientists reviewing the packet.",

Since it is (apparently) common to have notes from students in the portfolio that means that the professor will sometimes solicit those notes. It might be worth saying something to the effect of \"This letter was not solicited by anyone. I volunteered it because I feel so strongly about...\". If I were on the committee I would give an unsolicited letter a bit more weight than a solicited one because it is more likely to be sincere.",

      "text": "Not all places solicit letters from students for tenure packages; my current and past institution do not. I'm sure there is a place for you to offer a letter of support for your mentor in some fashion. One option is to look into professional awards through either your department/college, institution, or professional organizations that you belong to, and to nominate them for awards. Most professional awards require nomination from someone, and often those get submitted because a potential awardee asks someone to nominate them. This means the pool of nominees can be a bit small, so your prof has a good chance of getting an award. As a student you may have to work with another prof in your field to get this nomination rolling, this would be an excellent way to signal the excellence of your mentor.",

I wrote several for colleagues going up for a prestigious teaching awards, which are more helpful feathers in their cap (and occasionally with boosted funding) for T&P committees.  \n\nRather than writing the Vice Dean, I would approach your 1.) mentor about what will help their packet, and 2.) your dept. chair to say you want to nominate them for some award and contribute supporting material.\n\nAs an aside, my experience on 3 different T&P committees at an R1 (college + university level) is that teaching was *very* rarely mentioned in review of application materials, unless the decision was close. Most people sail through based on the strength of their external letters, their publications, and their funding. Service and teaching is really ancillary and used for deciding weaker overall packets.",
