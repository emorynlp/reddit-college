  "text": "More than a year ago, I submitted this post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/aqjvns/trying_to_finish_diss_need_to_be_done_in_june/\n\nAfter seeing my progress / hearing my sob story, my chair agreed to remain my chair as his original full retirement plans were changing. He ended up continuing with the university in a reduced capacity and was still chairing another student's committee. So, I scrambled like mad, abandoned the idea of using any editing  services, started with the unedited version of the thing, and defended it as a proposal last June. Also, the school I am working at agreed to a one-year \"stop the tenure clock\" arrangement for me with the understanding this was a one-time thing. \n\nLong story short, I got the data I needed in the fall, wrote up the analysis, conclusions, implications, and directions for future research and, despite the current state of the world (and the unexpected transition to online instruction just about everyone faced), I was able to defend remotely last week! \n\nI just wanted to say thank you to the folks here that took the time to respond to me back then, your advice helped a lot and I didn't get the chance to say thanks at the time. So, thank you all!",
