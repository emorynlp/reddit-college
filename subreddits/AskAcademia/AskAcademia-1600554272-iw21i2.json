  "title:": "Applying for TT jobs and can't get a letter from my grad school advisor - how to deal?",
  "text": "I went to grad school for physics, and after graduating started a postdoc. About a year into that, I came out as trans and started transitioning. Response from the people I knew in the physics community was.... not good, and a lot of people, including my doctoral advisor, totally cut me off. I ended up having to switch fields after it became clear I was persona non grata in the physics community.\n\nAfter that, I started postdoc #2 in a different field (materials science FWIW), which I'm now about 18 months into. This postdoc has been very successful, I have a couple of well-received publications already and I've won some pretty substantial grants, enough that I'm currently hiring a postdoc to work under me.\n\nI'm now applying for faculty positions for the first time, and at the point of picking letter writers. I can definitely get a couple of very strong letters from people I've worked with in this postdoc, and from one of my physics collaborators from postdoc #1, but my advisor hasn't responded to my emails in more than 2 years, so I almost certainly can't get one from him.\n\nWhat's the best way of dealing with this? I'm worried that the glaring absence of a letter from my advisor will be a huge red flag in my applications.\n\nShould I mention it in my cover letter? I feel like writing exactly why would be too much, but maybe a sentence addressing it and making clear it's nothing to do with my research? Another option would be to ask one of my letter writers to address it? Should I try to get a letter from someone else I worked with in grad school just to show that I was doing good work then?",

      "text": "You are best having a letters from people who are going to write strong letters, and not a bad letter from your former advisor just because they were your advisor.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that another letter writer might sensitively describe in their letter (and something to potentially talk about with a trusted letter writer). If you are openly trans in your application materials, the letter writer may be able to clearly state that your advisor discriminated against you when you came out; if you are not openly trans in your materials, a letter writer may still be able to note that there was a pattern of misbehavior on the part of the advisor thus no letter from them while also highlighting that you are a person who interpersonally is easy to get along with, etc.\n\nMy instinct (with the caveat that I haven't been in this or a similar situation) is not to mention it in your cover letter. In general, I think that mentioning any interpersonal challenges--even ones that are clearly not your fault like this one--has the potential to be read the wrong way by the committee, or even sound like excuse making. Instead, highlight your strengths--of which it sounds like you have many--and you can answer the question in a concise and professional way if asked in an interview. Other than that, let a letter writer go to bat for you--it will come across stronger / in a more sympathetic light if it comes from them.\n\nI'm sorry that you are in this position. I wish you all of the best with your applications!",

I'm happy that more people are coming out younger. \n\nI'm so sorry about your advisor and the physics community at large. Know that there are people working to eradicate bad behavior of those like your Ph.D. advisor.\n\nIt sounds like you've got great advice in here, so I've got nothing to add other than my support as one physicist with a mat.sci. focus to another. Wishing you the best!",

Life is already hard enough as it is for people to act like assholes.\n\nSecond, you're better off without his letter of support. You need strong letters. Find them. \n\nThird, changing fields seems like a lot. Im sure you have reasons for this, but a field won't shun you for a transition like yours.\n\nFinally, many TT positions will ask for a diversity statement. Your identity can be presented in a very strategic way as a resource to relate to undeserved students.\n\nBest of luck.",

First of all, I find it terrible that people in physics, and your advisor has cut you off \u2014 It is very sad and I can see why Physics is even less diverse than Computer Science, which we do a bad job already when it comes to diversity. \n\nSecond, yes have strong letters. Your question about the cover letter: \n\nOne option is to have one of the writers explain this in the letter. I have seen it done for other situations. This worked in that particular case and we gave the person an offer. \n\nYou could also write it. \n\nSaddest thing is that LBGTQ+ community, in particular the trans community is heavily discriminated. \n\nI wish you the best and we need you in academia. Maybe you could help students and other faculty once you become more senior. \n\nI do have a question: Is this a norm in physics to discriminate against people that are different than the majority in physics ?",
