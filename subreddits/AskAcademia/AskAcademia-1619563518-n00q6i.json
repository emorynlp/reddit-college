Public schools (in the US anyway) often require certification of some sort. But private schools do not. (My wife got a PhD in History but now teaches at an elite private school. She has never needed any kind of additional training or certification.)\n\nIt would help to know what flavor of humanities you are \u2014 the options can vary depending on it.",

              "text": "Gotcha! Among the historians I know who \"left\" academia:\n\n* Three became consultants at places like McKinsey or RAND. HARD WORK of a sometimes dubious moral character. Math skills typically required.\n\n* Two (a married couple) joined the Foreign Service and now live a pretty interesting life abroad on the policy track for the US State Department.\n\n* Two became consultants within industry or less-dubious think tanks relating to the subject matter of their research (e.g., they were historians of medicine, so they now do medicine-related consulting).\n\n* A few (including my wife) went into the world of private high school teaching. HARD WORK but can be relatively lucrative and rewarding. If you want to know more about that, feel free to PM me and I can tell you how this world works (at least in the USA).\n\n* One went into radio journalism and has been ridiculously successful there (this is both HARD and requires LUCK, because those jobs ain't exactly hanging on trees either).\n\n* One basically went into NTT academia, getting a long-term appointment running a teaching center (I think it is a program for first-gen students and things like that) at a prestigious university. Not adjunct hell but not a TT route. She teaches a class or two, but mostly runs the program.\n\n* One found his way into the museum world (also a competitive place!). It should be noted that he had interests in this area prior to finishing the PhD, and made sure to do lots of work (e.g., at the university museums) in this area prior to graduation.\n\n* One went to law school (on top of the PhD), got a law degree, worked at the Hague for awhile, then worked in corporate law for awhile (hated it), then worked at a law school legal clinic for awhile (low pay), eventually landed a TT job at a law school (verrrrry long path).\n\n* One bounced around a few different kinds of jobs writing copy of different sorts of private companies, and is now (I think) doing some kind of journalism/research. Not a lot of job security. (This person technically never finished the PhD, FWIW.)\n\nThis is not a complete list, just the people I know of off the top of my head from cohorts similar to mine (part of the dreaded \"graduated a couple years after the 2008 crash\" cohort). Only the last one has really struggled with job security. Most seem to like their jobs. (One of the McKinsey ones does NOT seem to like their job, but the RAND ones all seem to.) This is not exhaustive of the possibilities, just spinning out some actual things people I know first-hand did. None of them ended up as the proverbial barista at Starbucks.",

                  "text": "Since a number of people have asked about the private school path, here's my semi-standard spiel. Again, this is by proxy (my wife's experiences, not mine), but it's been a decade or so that she's been in this world and so I've gotten something of a sense of it.\n\nFirst, there are multiple \"tiers\" of private high schools in the USA. If you have a PhD you are aiming at the top ones, or to end up in those. The lower and middling ones don't necessarily find a PhD attractive, and they aren't places you probably want to work anyway. You want a school that is comfortable with its status and isn't worried about enrollments. If it gets worried about enrollments that means it will be hesitant to stand up to asshole students and parents, and will throw their teachers under the bus. Being able to stand up to rich, entitled parents (who think they know everything about education, since they once had one) is absolutely key for a teacher-friendly workplace. The best private schools have more resources than most university humanities departments (at my wife's school, they don't actually know what their annual book budget is because they've never come close enough to it to matter... imagine that!).\n\nSecond, the hardest thing will be getting your foot in the door. You will need to jettison all of your jargon, and any sense that you are \"settling\" for a private school job. These are good, fulfilling jobs. They are not academia. If you go into the interview (or the job) with a chip on your shoulder it will be completely visible to everyone else. If you go in with a sense of superiority, it will be completely visible. And the odds are that no matter how good of a college teacher you are, you will have a lot to learn when you go to a high school setting. It's not quite the same thing. You can't throw a lot of Foucault at your students and expect them to get it. They are not developmentally there yet. You _can_ give them a lot of really high-powered ideas, but you have to dress them up in the experiences and language that your students will already be familiar with. This is a skill that takes time to learn. (So you can't assign Foucault himself, in all of his badly-translated French glory, but you could, for example, introduce the idea of the panopticon in a very slow way and have them get it.) Private schools are going to be VERY wary of you at first, because they will fear that you think too highly of yourself to actually do the work of high school teaching.\n\nThird, it is a \"show up early in the morning on time\" kind of job. It is a \"get all of your grading in promptly\" kind of job. It is a \"you will be on your feet from the minute the kids arrive until you leave the door to go home\" kind of job. Which is to say, it's not flexible, in terms of time, like academia is. It's very regimented, though the class periods are divided up a lot smaller than college courses so the day goes by _very_ fast (in my experience, having guest taught at my wife's high schools a few times). You will not have time or energy to do research \u2014 you should just ditch that fantasy. Your summers are your own, and maybe you'll want to do that then. But I think a lot of recent PhDs harbor the idea that they'll be able to effectively be some kind of alt-ac and still keep a toe in the field (and maybe apply for a TT job someday if the perfect one comes up...). I wouldn't bet on it, realistically. It's a lot of work. Aside from a jam-packed workday, you also have to grade homework and prepare assignments for the next day. It is basically a 5.5 day workweek. But again, you do get your summers off. And other breaks, etc.\n\nFourth, the biggest and best of these schools tend to be in big cities. That's a perk and a punishment! High cost of living, etc. Not for everyone. There are a few that are more isolated, though they are often boarding schools (as opposed to \"day schools\"\u00a0\u2014 where students are just there for the day) and that's a different kettle of fish that I don't know much about. (We have some friends who now work at a boarding school and appear to love it. They basically get free housing, which counts for a lot these days, financially. The downside, of course, is that 90% of their life is school-related. But it's a different life either way from a day school.) \n\nFifth, one of the perks of the private school world, versus academia, is there is a lot more \"churn\" in the industry. Jobs come and go all the time. People transfer between schools all the time. There is a definite job \"season,\" but at any time of the year a place might need a fill-in position and if you do a good job at that, it might turn into a permanent position. I have never heard of a private school with something like tenure (doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but I haven't heard of it), but usually there is a \"probationary\" period in which you can be dismissed for any reason, but after that your job security is fine so long as you don't do something heinous. At my wife's school the turn-over rate for new faculty is HIGH because they (like a lot of elite schools) put a lot of emphasis on understanding the local culture (teaching effectively, dealing with parents well-enough, dealing with your colleagues well, etc.) and for whatever reason a good number of people (most with recent PhDs) just can't hack it. To be fair to the school, a lot of those people would have problems in a lot of non-academic jobs. Academia allows the eccentric to thrive (one of the reasons I thrive in it), but private school eccentricity has to be either tamped down or funneled into acceptable silos. Note that when you are a high school teacher in the USA you are held to an old-fashioned \"moral standard\" that is different than a college professor or graduate student. Scrub your social media and lock it down. No photos of you drinking with your pals. Nothing sexy. Is this bullshit? Yes. Is this the reality of how parents and thus administration views you? Yes. \n\nSixth, and finally, how do you get these jobs? There are basically two routes. One is to register with [Carney Sandoe](https://www.carneysandoe.com/) and if they take you as a client, they will try to match-make you with schools. There is really nothing to lose trying it this way, because it doesn't cost you anything (the schools end up paying for it, if they hire you). My wife and I both did this a bit early on, just to test the waters. It wasn't worthless but it didn't turn into anything for us, and frankly I don't think many of the colleagues she has got their jobs this way. But it's something to try and it can give you some interview experience at the least. They have regularly conferences in several big cities in the US and you can do some lightning interviewing rounds there. Can't hurt if you don't have to travel far.\n\nThe other way is to just apply to jobs out of the blue. The [National Association of Independent Schools](https://careers.nais.org/jobs) maintains a very active job list. Again, there is a \"season\" for these jobs (it's similar to the academic one, but a little later, I think), but jobs can pop up all the time. Most jobs won't be what you want, surprise surprise. But a lot of the people who end up in this world just do this approach. If you get an on-campus interview, be aware that you'll have to teach a sample class \u2014\u00a0one that you don't know, who doesn't know you, and so on. Probably the hardest part and the easiest part to screw up. My recommendation is to be warm and funny and confident (so easy, right?), and aim for a relatively low level of engagement but be ready to scale it up if the students actually are willing to work with you. You want to look like someone who sort of gets that high school students aren't college students, but you still would give them a quasi-college-like education (always the ambition of a prep school), and that you'd be a colleague they'd want to work with. \n\nIn terms of the actual job satisfaction, what my wife likes about the work is you form very deep bonds with the students (you see them almost every day, so it's a lot deeper than the college connections), at her schools she has been able to have a lot of latitude for course planning in the classroom (very different than most public schools), and there can be some cool perks (book budgets, outside speakers, etc.). If you're good at your job you'll have parents and students telling you how transformative you have been. Some of those students will stay in touch with you their whole lives. It's an incredible thing.\n\nWhat she doesn't like about it is that the workload can be grinding, you have very little free time for independent projects or growth outside of the school, there are some times very silly office politics (like everywhere), and the administrations are often not quite as enlightened as the faculty (a stark difference from our enlightened university administrators, I always agree). And the stuff about scrubbing your social media and all that (but I think she was actually pretty happy to abandon social media anyway). And of course even if you work at once of the top schools in the country, to some people you'll just be \"a high school teacher\" \u2014 it carries very little social capital with it for most people. \n\nOh, and you are, essentially, contributing to class inequality in this country, by giving the elite a huge leg up over everyone else. We always justify the latter by saying, well, shit, these people are going to be running things in a decade anyway, so they might as well get a real, myth-free, no-nonsense history education (one with full attention to the histories of racism, classism, sexism, you have it), and maybe they _won't_ turn into huge assholes down the line. But everyone sort of has to make their peace with this aspect of it in this world.",

Of the above, maybe one or two came from families one would describe as \"elite,\" and in none of the cases above was it a \"my roommate was Mark Zuckerberg and that's how I got the job\" scenario. Every one of the above absolutely worried about the job market, every one felt the need to really hustle to get anything after their PhD. Ditto those of us who did end up in academia in the end.

I don't recommend people doing a PhD in History (or really any humanities), for example, from a school without an amazing reputation both inside and outside the academy \u2014 whether you want to succeed in academia or outside of it, the degree reputation is going to be a huge differentiator in a world flooded in such PhDs.

I also went to and go to \"elite\" private institutions in the Northeast as an undergrad and as a Ph.D. student, and \"well-connected rich people\" really applies to undergraduate students. I mean, yes, rich (and driven) college students have a better opportunity to get into an elite Ph.D. since they can focus on their research and study, rather than worrying about paying tuition and bills. But it's not that some fancy volunteer work in the third-world country or some other fancy extracurricular activities and expensive tutoring get you into prestigious graduate schools. As a Ph.D. student, I've met two graduate students whose parents are super influential (a high-ranked politician and a super famous actor in their own respective countries), but other than those two, my colleagues are from a middle-class or working-class background. This is quite a contrast from my undergraduate school, where something like 60% of the student body was from the top 1% family income ladder in the U.S. \n\nAnd this is not to deny what you said about the companies. Those places want students from elite schools. All I'm saying is that that's not because the graduate students who go to elite schools are \"well-connected rich\" people. It just tells you the favoritism those companies have. There are a couple of students I know who ended up at McKinsey from a humanities discipline, but they did it through a hiring process, not through personal connections like their parents, relatives, or wealthy friends.",

(Cold War history > intelligence, contemporary political history > government, etc.) I think this was just the first step outside academia, and the the second and third step beyond that built on the former, and by then their different theses subjects were all a thing in the past.\n\nI don't think any of them looked for jobs on the open market. They were \"drafted\" more or less by chance at a time when they got to choose between a well paying steady job or stay in academia and get a similar job security some 10-15 years down the line.\n\nSorry for not having more concrete tips here, but all I can say that is that I don't think I have met a historian outside of academia who stayed unemployed for long or who had to do unqualified work after their PhD's.\n\nA PhD in Latin American history should be a type of expertise that is a super strong merit in government and NGO work alike. The tricky thing is for you and this \"market\" to find each other.",

Your state board of education should have a listing of similar programs - you do all of the education coursework (videos about how to teach) and study for your certification test, take the test, and then you can be hired as a teacher. During your first year, you have some assignments that you have to complete, but trust me, they were straightforward and not that difficult. You pay off the tuition fees during your first year, it comes out of your paycheck. Other programs may work differently, but the way my fianc\u00e9e did it, it was pretty easy. You might not want to do this after getting a PhD, but it at least isn\u2019t more school, just online requirements you have to complete.",

It is a quality highlighted by scholars advocating history\u2019s importance in contemporary life, the case being that critical historical thinking is a valuable resource for the informed exercise of agency, whether as a decision-maker at the highest levels or as an individual citizen.

The majority of them were tenured before I even started high school and were given their first TT position with only a Masters. The majority of them would not land a TT position in today's academic world and they really don't grasp that. \n\nThey are basically like \"what? Like it's hard.\" I can't even tell you the amount of bad advice I've gotten from faculty who have been around since the 80s who just love to say things like \"I got this job without any publications on my CV so you aren't going to have any trouble getting one. You probably just aren't applying enough places.\" (Meanwhile, I'm cringing knowing that I applied to over 100 positions over the last two years and got 2 interviews out of the hours and hours and hours of work that went into that). While I think they are well intentioned, they are also incredibly out of touch and while they *should* realize how deep the candidate pool is now given the fact that they serve on hiring committees, they really don't get it.",

The work was interesting but it didn't pay much. Decided I wanted to work in public policy. Through a connection (prof i had RAed for during phd) got a postdoc focused on public policy. Now I am working on getting into federal gov as a policy analyst but there are still some barriers. Just got to the final phase in one process and they asked for undergrad transcripts to check I have enough coursework in economics, which I do not (I was clear in the application about what I have). So now l am enrolling in some online 1st year undergrad economics courses this summer to avoid this in the future lol\n\nI have a couple of friends employed at the university as dedicated writers for research institutes.

Elite private boarding schools are harder to get in because they already have lots of applicants with a Ph.D. degree when there's a job opening, but most private schools will open their doors for you if you have a Ph.D. and some teaching experience (i.e., TAs).\n\nIt's definitely hard work as *restricteddata* said. Parents can be demanding because they're paying tens of thousands of dollars for tuition, and if you work at a boarding school, you'll likely have to take another role like taking care of them at a dorm or organize an extracurricular activity. If you end up at a smaller private school, they might ask you to teach Spanish or some type of a general humanities course (world civilization, etc) on top of a history course. But it pays well; you don't have pressure for tenure; you get to teach what you love (hey, it's like teaching at a liberal arts college without a tenure review!); and if you have a child, they'll attend the school for free. So most people I know who went into this field genuinely like their jobs though there are hard days for sure. But what jobs don't?\n\nSo if you're open to teaching secondary school students but getting another degree is a concern, definitely look into a private school. (I also went to a private boarding school in New England, and there were very few teachers with an Ed.M. or M.Ed. Most \"only\" had Ph.D. or regular Master's (M.A. or M.S.) in their respective field.",

Really excited because it offers the money my labour deserves and more opportunity for growth. More job availability. It's a win win for me, will have to adjust with the pace of work in corporate though, academia was snail paced.",

Even more important than that iss realising where you are isn't good enough and working to change that. Academia is so overrated that a lot people compromise beyond what they should.",

      "text": "Definitely looking into private school/boarding school teaching is a viable option. As comments said above, many private schools will open their doors to people who have PhDs, as there is not a requirement for private schools to hire candidates with a teaching license. That being said, teaching high school students will be definitely different from college students. High school students don't have the maturity as college students, but they are a fun group to work with.  A lot of private schools do allow teachers to create courses that suit their teaching interests, and a lot of elite private schools do allow teachers to create electives. That being said, teaching at a private school is a lot of work, as many private schools do ask teachers to participate in the school life outside of the classroom -- that could be being a coach, supervisor for a club, etc. But teaching can be rewarding and it is not a boring profession by any means.",

          "text": "And one reason to get into private school teaching is that kids typically will be more motivated and driven to learn. As many well-known NAIS schools have strict admission requirements, a lot of the students at these schools will be able to handle the workload and perform at a high level. And private schools look for teachers that truly enjoy teaching and connecting with adolescents. I did not have a teaching degree and I taught at a boarding school straight out of undergrad. Right now, I left that boarding school to go to graduate school, but the two years I spent teaching was rewarding.",
