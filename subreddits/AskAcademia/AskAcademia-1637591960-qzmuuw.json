  "text": "Hi, the core of my dissertation is not coding. However to do all the studies I had to write a series of scripts to handle the data for either visualizations or any sort of analysis. For the niche group of researchers in this topic, we consider these pieces of code could be useful. So, besides including a github repository with mys scripts, could anyone share tips on how to include this type of work? Is it an appendix the best alternative? Or is this worth a chapter?",

Then you can write a paper on your package and submit it for publication, fully documenting everything and advertising it in a space where someone might be able to find it and make use of it.",
