      "text": "I\u2019m surprised by the responses here. While humanities faculty are fine with being contacted by prospective students, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll respond unless you\u2019ve already been accepted into the program. I think those who do respond probably offer a general \u201cYour work sounds great; I encourage you to apply.\u201d Reaching out is certainly not required. Here\u2019s why:\n\n**1.** In the humanities, unlike STEM, students are mentored by professors, but they don\u2019t work alongside them. That is, students don\u2019t generally contribute to our research. So while you should only apply to programs where there are people who could guide you in your own project and speak to the originality of your contributions in a recommendation, the relationship is generally more one-sided and lacks the regular face time necessitated by (most) labs.\n\n**2.** Only a small number of faculty in a given department are on grad admissions. This committee changes every year. They determine who\u2019s accepted.\n\n**3.** On occasion a faculty member who knows a student (i.e. was impressed with them at a conference or perhaps worked with them as an undergrad or MA student at another institution) *might* remember to email someone on the committee and say, \u201cHey, by the way, I\u2019m a fan of this student for X reason.\u201d We\u2019ll give this application a closer look, but it doesn\u2019t offer any advantage beyond that. That\u2019s because the committee can\u2019t function by catering to faculty who aren\u2019t doing the work of reading 300-500 applications and seeing the whole pool.\n\n**4.** The key to point 3 is they \u201cknow\u201d the student\u2014they\u2019re familiar with their work in some capacity and were impressed. So, a conference presentation or a previous advising relationship can accomplish that, but an email from a stranger, no matter how well-written, just can\u2019t.\n\nGrad admissions is an extremely intensive and time-consuming process that happens at an awkward time (essentially spans the entire winter break). What this means is that admissions isn't that interested in input from non-committee faculty, because they have no sense of the **(300-500 applicant)** pool, and we\u2019re doing all the work. There are rare exceptions (mostly covered by the third point).\n\nI\u2019d be curious if those who advised you to contact faculty also think faculty would respond. Even in normal circumstances, I don\u2019t think so. But with the heightened workload that COVID 19 is demanding, I think it\u2019s even less likely.\n\n**If you reach out, make your email as brief as possible.** Aim for the length of a conference paper or article abstract--**250-350 words.** That would demonstrate both your awareness of their limited time ***and*** your ability to talk concisely about a complex project. That would leave a great impression. Good luck with everything!\n\nBackground: Young professor working at intersection of humanities and STEM. Earned doctorate from an Ivy in discipline A, held a fellowship at another Ivy in discipline B, currently a professor at a top public R1. Recently served on grad admissions.",

          "text": "I contacted my POIs in advance to the heavy suggestion of my advisors in my Master's program (both extremely accomplished academics in the field). Your points are completely valid, but my advisors told me to do this anyway because even if you don't get a meaningful response (or a response at all), it proves you have researched and are dedicated to the application process. You're not just some applicant who chose school A because school A is the best school. You understand that your research interests align with school A because professor X is there. \n\nAnd while admission committees might not weigh these emails or the input of their non-admission committee colleagues as vital to the final decisions, it DOES make you stand out from the pool of 300-500 applications. If anything, it's a foot in the door that will let admit committees take note of you even if the professor you emailed was not in the admissions committee. \n\nIn my case in particular (I am an incoming PhD student in the humanities), I reached out to professors in all the schools I applied to and typically received no answer. However, one of the professors (who was not in the school's admission committee that year, but had participated before) that did respond. He encouraged me to send over my application materials and advised me how to make my statement stronger. \n\nThat is to say, even if these emails lead to no boost in your application, you might end up with a professor who is particularly generous with their time to assist you on the application process and you won't know until you email them!",

It's extremely unlikely that any faculty member would mention to someone on admissions that a student they have no previous relationship with emailed to say they were interested. Most applications indicate prospective faculty advisors/mentors, which is a more effective way of demonstrating that you researched our program, since we definitely see all the application materials.\n\nI'm really glad to hear that one professor was a rare exception in your case and provided feedback on your application. I did mention in my initial response that if OP still wanted to contact faculty, they certainly could and that a concise email would make the best impression. Best of luck in your program!",

          "text": "While this is generally good advice, I think there are three things that need to be clarified here.   These things would ultimately lead me to change your overall point (that \"Reaching out is certainly not required.\")  Because I think it can be, at least in certain cases. \n\nFirst (and biggest):\n\n>2. Only a small number of faculty in a given department are on grad admissions. This committee changes every year. They determine who\u2019s accepted.\n\nYes, BUT...    While some departments do admissions this way (and leave everything up to the admissions committee) many others--including ours--have a two step process.   Because many subfields in the humanities are quite disparate, and having someone from one subfield admitting a student from a different one can be problematic.  (having historians of modern US history deciding which grads to admit in medieval Chinese history just doesn't work.)\n\n1)  In our department, the files are first sorted by field and/or potential advisor.  The subfield group (say, Early Modern European History, or Roman Archeology) then look through all of \"their\" files, and communicate among each other to rank these files.  Then, the admissions committee generally follows these rankings, but balances them out, i.e. evaluates candidate from subfield A vs. candidate from subfield B, and tries to come up with a balanced admissions picture. \n\nWhat this means, at least in our department, is that an email to a potential advisor i.e me, would be read by me, before I rank a file. \n\n2)  Second, while it's true we don't work as closely as in a lab, a PhD in my field is a seven or eight year commitment to work with that student.  (!)  So ability but also personality becomes important.  (as no one wants to have an insufferably arrogant or neurotically insecure PhD student for 7 years... it is draining.)   A personal communication can be a means for an applicant to convey that they are professional and decent to work with.  (or a warning sign...!  :-)   \n\n3) Finally, in admissions, a stellar file is a stellar file.  No contact necessary.  Similarly, a weak file is just not going to pass admissions, so a personal communication there won't help very much.  Where contact could be really useful--even necessary--is in the middle cases.  For instance, a file that's really borderline for some reason--maybe the student looks strong, but majored in a different field, and you don't know if they really have the background.  Or a research language doesn't look strong enough.   Or, there's some oddness in the file--the applicant has great recs, but was a chef for 6 years, only now wanting to come back to grad school.  In these situations, personal contact can really fill in extra information... and for me personally, that extra information might make me feel like I'm taking less of a 'risk' by admitting a borderline candidate.  \n\nSo, contact can be very useful.!!\n\n  But don't expect much by way of a reply--sometimes you'll be answered in detail, sometimes not at all.",

I wonder if the difference is the fact that in Australasia and Europe most PhD programs are straight research (i.e. no coursework), whereas in the US students have to take coursework before starting their dissertations. That difference might account for the difference in whether to contact potential advisers, since the need for an adviser is more immediate if you're going straight into research.",

I wouldn\u2019t want to go to those programs unless I knew there was a chance I could work/take classes with these people.
