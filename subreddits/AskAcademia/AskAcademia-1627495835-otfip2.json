  "title:": "Asking new PI for PTO only one month into first post-doc",
  "text": "I have just finished my PhD at an R1 university in the US (after 6 years of exhausting work) and had made summer plans to relax, spend quality time with my family and friends, and go to Europe to visit my father who I haven't had much time to spend with in the past 6 years of graduate school (exacerbated in the last year and half by COVID restrictions). Unfortunately, my summer plans got ruined as I caught COVID (one of the infamous breakthrough cases). I was pretty ill for the majority of July and under quarantine so I had to cancel my trip. I start my new postdoc at the end of August and will spend the entire beginning of August moving and prepping my new place as my new postdoc is on the other side of the country. \n\nMy dad wants me to come in October for a week (more than a week actually but I declined to ask for so much time), but I am nervous to ask my new PI for PTO so soon into just starting the new job. Of course, I am also disappointed that I will have to take PTO when I only get 12 days total all year (and 2 will be spent traveling). \n\nHow will this look to my new PI? Is this an understandable request? Is it possible to take the days without pay so I can keep the rest of my PTO? If I ask for slightly more than a week to accommodate the two days of travel, will this be excessive? He seems like a relatively relaxed guy and I don't think I'd be contributing that much in the beginning anyways while I read and learn and get a hang of things but I don't want to give off a bad impression so early into my new position that may come back to haunt me later on (I'm a big believer that first impressions can imprint people's view of you as a worker and affect how they interact with you moving forward).",

      "text": "I think there is no easy answer. You have to know yourself if your work at the moment allows for travel or not. For some topics the first months might be critical to others not. Some PI might get a bad image of you some do not. There is really no say without being in your shoes. \nI did not do my first vacation after I had set up all my experiments to a place where I know I could take some time off. Overall I spent very little personal time during my three year postdoctoral the work was so much. So you might as well go now as long as you can",

      "text": "There might be institution rules that prevent this. I know where I did my PhD did not allow any time off during the 3 month probationary period for postdocs. Beyond that, it varies. They might have some big experiment planned for that time that you should be around to learn from. They might have a grant deadline right then that they need your help with. They might just be a jerk. Ask them respectfully and as soon as possible with the understanding they may not allow it.",

      "text": "I think this really depends on your PI. Probably your best bet is an honest conversation where you discuss possibilities. \n\nI found myself in an awkward situation when I was transitioning from grad school to postdoc. I was planning a month break in between, including a family vacation. Then I was diagnosed with a chronic condition right at the end of grad school, and could no longer risk a month with no health insurance. I felt so uncomfortable talking to my PI about it, but he was very supportive. Managed to change my start date so I had insurance, and also bend the new hire rules a little so I still got a vacation. \n\nI hope your PI is supportive and you get the time you need.",

My current org we always ask new starters if they have any leave planned just to avoid this kind of awkwardness and we require staff to take a minimum of 10 days leave pa.  It should be fine but having worked in the US I know that being dicks about leave is a thing. The only way you'll know is by asking. If you're really that worried you could ask him to confirm his leave policy before asking.",
