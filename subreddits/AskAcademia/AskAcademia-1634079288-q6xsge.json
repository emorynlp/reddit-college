  "text": "Hello!\n\nI am working on a project where I plan to review papers written using a specific model and code on a few aspects of each paper. To be able to make my milestones and complete them on time, I only have one year to complete this project. It is tricky when the number of related articles is quite high. \n\nI'm looking for help in making this project a bit more feasible. I have the following questions: \n\n1. Has anyone completed a systematic review and coded a percentage of total articles published each year in an attempt to reduce the number of total papers coded while still trying to remain unbiased in which articles are selected?\n2. Has anyone used automation tools in their selection process? I am in the psychology field and would love any software that worked well for folks. \n3. Any other tips or issues that came up to manage a project with over 600 articles specifically related to your topic?",
