  "title:": "Who owns the data if an institute paid to have it digitized?",
  "text": "I have a friend who has systematically collected data on something happening where he lives. He's done it as a hobby, so no one paid him to do this. \n\nA local research institute wanted to use these data, but it was all written down. They have gotten hold of the original notebooks (but my friend has several copies and back-ups, and thinks the originals aren't readable anymore due to age) and paid someone to put it all in an excel file. My friend has this file as well. \n\nThe file is in a format that will need several days of work to get it all in a format that can be used for statistical analyses. \n\nMy question is; who owns the rights to use this file? Can my friend use it however he sees fit or does he have to ask the research institute for permission to use the file? They have not done anything with the data, except pay someone to put into excel.",

      "text": "No one can answer this for your friend since laws vary by countries and it seems parts of the story are missing, so we don't have the full picture or details. \n\nLike how did they even get his data? Did your friend gave it to them after they asked? Were the documents \"open source\" in a library? \n\n Was he affiliated with the research institute in any ways? Was he collecting data as a volunteer for the research institute (which is common in large environmental field studies sometimes)?\n\nIf not, how did they even found out your friend was collecting data in the first place? Is it because your friend reached out to them? If not, Where did they found the originals? \n\nIf he gave them the data, did he sign anything or went into a verbal agreement? What did they say they were going to do with the data?\n\nIf they are paying to get the data processed, there must have been a clear understanding that they could use this data. Did they bought the rights from your friend? Or is it because your friend's data is open sourced or he collected data freely for them?\n \nSo as you can see, the answers are very situation specific and too much details are missing to even say if your friend has rights anymore (or even if he ever had any rights) over the data he collected/handed off. Your friend should talk to the research institute to clear things up instead and if he is not satisfied with their answer, then he might need to lawyer up if he wants to use the data.",

          "text": "I think in this case it'd fall under EU copyright laws, but I'm not sure.\n\nHe was friends/acquaintances with the guy from the research institute. He wants his data to be used for scientific research, but I'm not sure how the data got to the research institute. I think this other guy sort of just took it without any formal agreement (e.g., can I take this? yeah sure). If he'd analysed and published something using the data, my friend would've been happy with it, but nothing has happened. I don't think the agreement would ever have been that they would now have sole access to the data.\n\nHe's a naturalist, so he just went out and looked at/measured stuff. He did it fully of his own accord, so no volunteer agreement or anything. \n\nI'm mainly wondering if I'd be 'allowed' to use this digital file instead of entering everything again, because that's what my friend asked me to do. I want to avoid any claims to the data by others. The original person at the institute has left and the new guy is not very easy to work with.",

Having said that, if there's some agreement between your point-of-contact and the university, then all bets are off.\n\nEdit: If there is no pre-emptive binding agreement between your POC and the university, they can just post something publicly verifiable online saying \"I publish this data under a CC0 license, it may be used by anyone for any purpose without restriction according to the terms of the license. I understand that this is an irrevocable license which will apply in perpetuity.\"",

Facts cannot be copyrighted and therefore data as a collection of facts is not copyrightable. A written description of the data could be copyrighted, as happens with publications. \n\nUnless this was a database or a manuscript, I'm not sure what legal recourse OP has but as any legal solution will necessitate significant expense I think they would be better off approaching the university with their preferred solution (be that collaboration, acknowledgement, payment) and negotiate with them.",
