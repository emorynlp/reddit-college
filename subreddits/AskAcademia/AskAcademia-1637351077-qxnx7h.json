  "text": "I am graduating university with a BA in philosophy (I\u2019ll have a 3.9+ GPA and Latin honors from the top university in my flyover state). Theoretically, and assuming a decent GRE score (which I have), what fields am I best qualified to apply to PhD programs in besides philosophy? Thanks!",

      "text": "Most PhD programs look for some sort of research experience vaguely related to the program you\u2019re interested in, or at least that will have transferable skills. Another important part Is fit. If you\u2019re not interested in a subject and you\u2019re just getting a PhD to get a PhD, even if you don\u2019t mean it to, it will come across in your application, and that will make most adcomms throw your application in the trash.",
