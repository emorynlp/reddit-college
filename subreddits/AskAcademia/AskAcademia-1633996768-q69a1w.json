  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm trying to submit my paper to a journal. However as I am preparing my tables for the journal submission requirements, I came across the line \" When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. \"\n\nI have no idea what this means and what they want me to do with my table grid. What would \"one grid for each individual table\" mean?",

Not a literal table that means grid.\n\nThat's my guess, because in most literature, anything that's not text is referred to as a table. But I would confirm with the journal.",
