  "title:": "Towards the end of a PhD and my job prospects seem to have disappeared",
  "text": "**EDIT:** I'm overwhelmed with the helpful and positive responses this got. I have read everything, but I'm afraid I won't be able to respond to everyone individually, at least not today. I've started to rework my CV and to put less emphasis on the academic work and more on the practical experience. I also no longer make reference to the PhD itself and just listed it as \"research assistant\". More than anything, I'm filled with a deep sense of gratitude over this outpouring of support y'all had for some rando on the interwebs. Thank you. \n\nTL;DR After spending a decade studying I can't find work and I don't know where I went wrong.\n\nDear Reddit\n\nI find myself in a curious situation and I don't quite know what to make of it.\n\nA few years ago I have finished a Masters degree (geared towards Computer Science). During my Master, I got the occassional job offer via a job platform I was listed on. When I applied for various positions post-Master, I got overwhelmingly positive responses, and basically had my pick what to do. I chose to go with a Human-Computer Interaction type CS PhD project. This project is now about to conclude. For the past month I have been writing job applications to everyone and their aunts, first extremely selective, but by now very liberally, to get \\*any\\* industry employment. And I'm getting nowhere.\n\nI have industry experience. I've been working next to my studies since my bachelors degree, in various notable companies (-- I had to, family can't support me financially, first generation college grad). Both my bachelors and masters degree have near perfect grades across the board. I have published various research articles. I have experience working abroad, in teams, under pressure, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nAnd now, at the end of an educational road that started with 16, with an IT-type apprenticeship, and now ends with 30, and (hopefully soon) a PhD, I find myself seemingly completely unemployable.\n\nI have started looking at untrained positions in my city, like stacking boxes in ware houses, because eventually I'll need to have \\*something\\* in order to keep the lights on. But so far I couldn't get myself to pull the trigger on that.\n\nI've done nothing but study for over a decade. I'm an expert in some areas, and quite competent in a few others. I have taught courses at a University level. I have dedicated so much of my life to becoming competent, and not done so many other things instead. Because I worked my way through University, at some points doing three jobs in parallel, next to studying, and keeping up perfect grades, I barely engaged with any of the social aspects of University. And here I am, after all of that, trying to cash out on my investment of time and effort, and I'm getting diddly-squat.\n\nIt gets increasingly difficult to write applications.\n\nIt gets increasingly difficult to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nWhat are my options here?",

I thought about cutting out references to the PhD and just list it as research assistant in CS. \n\nDo you know what the reasoning is to not hire someone with a PhD for entry or mid-level positions?

They make client products. Front end dev is a machine in this context. \n\nIt sounds like a wee panic attack. I\u2019m very similar in my story as yours, we are the same age too. But stay optimistic. Your skills are very solid. You don\u2019t need a job right away. Your an academic believe it or not, and you have that responsibility to get your phd finished and put out there. These framing you\u2019ve learned will forever be with you. With a little time, you can teach others and develop your other non academic skills. \n\nYour value is not in any way tied to how many applications you make nor any delay in obtaining a job. It may feel that way now, but once submission is done, and you gain a week holiday away, you will wake up one morning with huge clarity and know what to do immediately.\nJust give yourself time!",

      "text": "PhD in biomedical engineering. Despite the hype of the 2000s, a bioengineering industry has still yet to burgeon in my country, and I also had to move to a smaller city for personal reasons. I had to change my career path.\n\nI ended up taking a job in which the average age of my cohort was 11 years younger. I was only hired because the company liked to pretend they prefer smart, independent thinkers. Over time, I realized that PhDs in general are really hard to manage, as only highly competent and experienced managers know how to leverage better (at least on paper) talents than them while also being secure of themselves. I am convinced that nobody knows how to evaluate talent against their trainings meaningfully: otherwise, why are people so obsessed with years of experience?\n\nIn my experience, we have a reputation for being impractical, arrogant, perfectionist, and bafflingly unaware of what business needs (this was 200% true in my case -- I've never heard the word \"value prop\" in my life until my first day of work). OP, be encouraged that you have work experience to break this vicious reputation! Emphasize that you can deliver 80% of value in 50% of the effort you'd need to get to 99% _and_ be able to walk away happily. Put in a cover letter that in your work experience people describe you as someone who gets things done.\n\nKeep on keeping on. You need only _one_ to say yes. Even if it's a shitty job, as long as it's remotely in a similar line of work, think of it as enrolling into a professional Masters or something, except with a paycheque. I promise that, after a few years, it gets better. Good luck. I am rooting for you.",

Correct me if I am wrong!\n\nAnyway, I know what you are going through, because I was there just a couple of months ago, and I can give you the answers for what you could not understand.\n\n1. High number of rejections: It is completely normal in Germany, regardless of having a PhD or not. The German market is competitive, there are so many applications for a position (from within and outside Germany, yes), even without Covid. So, never lose hope and just keep applying. \n2. PhD over-qualification: If you want to work as a UI/UX designer, academia experience is probably not useful for the industry. With a PhD, they will have to **pay you more** for the same kind of taks that a bachelor/apprentice/master can also do. For such position, they will prefer those who have industry experience to those who only has academia experience because the skillsets required are completely different. Even for the position Product Owner/Product Manager, a PhD is not necessary. I would suggest you should look first for an internship, stating that you want to earn practical experiences in this field, and start from there. Transitioning from academia to industry is not easy as it seems, even in hot fields such as CS.\n3. Language: You don't mention, but do you speak German fluently? If yes, you should look into consulting industry, as those are the only companies that always welcome PhD graduates. \n4. It's normal to take a couple of months to find a job in the industry after your PhD. Not all companies need a researcher, so the number of vacancies is rare.",

The first place I would start for you is your CV: after all, it's the one thing all these applications have had in common.  Have you had your CV critiqued by anyone who actually does hiring outside of academia?  Not just an \"ok it looks fine\", but seriously *pulled apart*, with an eye to identifying every single line that could be better?\n\nSecond, you said you've been working throughout your studies.  Have you been working the hell out of those connections?  Have you emailed them all to say you're looking for work and wondering if they know of anyone who could use your skills?\n\nThe other thing I'd say is: you've only been applying for a month, and during a pandemic.  It's frustrating, but things may also change very quickly.  This is not in any way representative of normal times.  Hiring freezes are everywhere, economies are uncertain, and it's basically impossible for you or anyone to predict what things might be like in even a few months time.",

As you are so specifically qualified and will not fit to most standard job roles, it gives the company a chance to find something that fits. Alternatively, recruitment companies can be of massive support, and usually some sort of career service from your university can help make the transition into industry easier. \nJust out of curiousity, where are you trying to find employment? \n\nWith the demand for your skills I almost can't believe you won't find something somewhere, so keep faith!",

People in our family did not do such things. One of the things I did not learn in time due to that background is how important it is to build up a network.
