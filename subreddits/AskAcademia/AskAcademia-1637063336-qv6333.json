  "title:": "How to write a research proposal in a new area?(maybe within around 10 days)",
  "text": "### Background\nI am an undergraduate student who major in linguistics, and I have done some theoretical research on cognitive linguistics. I want to apply for the graduate(research) programme in cognitive sciences, and I need to write a detailed research proposal to reach out to my potential supervisor.\n\n### What I have already done\nI have focoused my topic into a specific question. And I have downloaded relevant literatures from google scholar. I have coding skills on Python, C and I have learned statistics lesson.\n\nUnfortunately, I have sent my potential supervisor an email before I have written a well-prepared research proposal. I provided my CV, talked about my difficulties and my general idea. And the supervisor did not reply anything.\n\n### What I feel difficult to do\nI need to do some psychological experiments in my research. However, I have never done experiements before(Our school has no relevant appliances). And I have no experience and knowledge about how to deal with experiement data on this topic, not to say how to plan the funding. I have no idea about that.\n\n### What I want to ask\n+ How can I plan for my experiment(time/funding/...) without any experience on it?\n\n+ Will my supervisor have a bad impression on my ill-preparation in the email?(Actually, the official website offers a link teaching us how to contact with the supervisor, but the link is broken, and I emailed the administrate officer, but he replied my a little bit late, so I sent my email before I was informed about how to contact with my supervisor)\n\n+ The time is too late now for a research graduate. I feel anxious about that, Could I finish my writing? (This question I need to ask myself, not on reddit)\n\nThanks for all of you reading this. Best wishes of you all.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sure others are going to ask the same thing, but what is the context for needing to send the potential adviser a full research proposal?  Did someone credible specifically advise you to do this?  It\u2019s not typical to reach out to potential advisers by sending them what amounts to an abbreviated grant proposal. Unless this has been specifically recommended by someone who knows the situation and the professor better than we do, I would worry this would not be perceived well and might make you seem like you only want to work on your ideas rather than being an open-minded grad student interested in the range of ideas/projects in your adviser\u2019s lab.",

First I would like to thank you for offering me the point,\n\n> this would not be perceived well and might make you seem like you only want to work on your ideas rather than being an open-minded grad student interested in the range of ideas/projects in your adviser\u2019s lab.\n\nIt is important, I will try not to behave like I am just interested in what I want to do. And yeah, it really have the context. I asked for the administrator of this program, and he told me that,\n\n(actually the content below is from our email contact, I'm not sure whether it will be OK to show it in public place. Yet this info also can be seen from the official website now. If it is not OK, I'll delete it ASAP),\n\n> If you would like to apply to do your Mphil/PhD in our department of ***, the first step is to identify a suitable supervisor in our department.  Please have a look at the Research Topics section of our website to find staff members with interests that may be similar to yours.   **Once you have identified a potential supervisor you should contact her/him directly, sending a copy of your CV and a brief research proposal**, (see below for some guidelines about writing a research proposal). If the supervisor is interested in supervising you, they will get back to you directly to discuss your possible project in more detail. Once a supervisor has agreed to take you on and a research topic has been agreed, you will need to submit a formal application form, see here for more details.\n\nand here is the guidline \n\n> A good proposal should have the following basic elements, though their order and weighting can vary. Aim for a maximum of about 1500 words (2 pages).\n> A clear and descriptive working title.\n> Aims and objectives of your research.\n> Your key research questions.\n> A description of the methods you anticipate using to answer your questions, with a rationale for your choice of methods.\n> An outline of your theoretical framework and explanation of its suitability for your topic.\n> A brief analytic discussion of the current research literature on your topic.\n> What is the current state of your field?\n> How would your research contribute to the advancement of your field?\n> It would also be useful to include a brief statement about research training you may need (e.g. statistics; qualitative analysis methods, etc).",

              "text": "Ahh okay, interesting. So that definitely answers my question. It doesn\u2019t sound to me like you need to worry about outlining your plan for timeline or funding on this research proposal, so I think you can eliminate those concerns.\n\nI think you probably already have more of the requirements for this proposal than you think. You say you have identified a research question and have done a literature review. So you\u2019ll want to state that research question and cite the relevant research articles to explain why your research is novel and how it fits in with existing knowledge and theory.\n\nThen you\u2019ll want to describe your methods (this can be general\u2014 it\u2019s only a 2 pg proposal). State your hypothesis and generally how you anticipate analyzing your results (again can be very general\u2014 it\u2019s a short proposal). Then add a section on the impact of your research to the field and why it\u2019s important.\n\nI\u2019d conclude with a section on the training you need to perform the research well and why you want to work with this particular professor and their lab. \n\nAnd that should take you to 2 pages pretty easily :)\n\nFor writing help, I think you should draft it first and then look for your writing center on campus and see if they have services to help you improve it. Most campuses have writing centers and people who are paid to help you improve writing\u2014 so you should take advantage of them!\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019d recommend using bolded subheadings in your research proposal. People tend to like having some obvious structure instead of a wall of text.",

This is a new field to me, and I'm not sure I have accumulated enough knowledge to do something  novel. So I guess what I only can do is, to clarify my idea based on my limited knowledge, and let my idea and methodology make sense. Actually I guess it might be the most difficult part for all of the new researchers.",

      "text": "People are busy and while ideally someone being approached as a potential supervisor should respond reasonably promptly, life happens and emails get lost in inboxes.\n\nI gently suggest you're overthinking things and you seem to be putting a lot of pressure on yourself over relatively minor issues. I would also guess based on what you wrote here, and your responses, you maybe wrote a quite long email overly focussed on the problems you think you perceive. New students are often tempted to point out all the flaws in their project thinking that they'll preempt any criticism and show that they know what the issues are. The reality is that it makes you look very negative and like you don't believe in your own work. That's not an attractive proposition for a potential supervisor. \n\nI would email the supervisor back, attach your proposal and suggest a meeting to discuss the proposal if they're interested. Keep the email brief and to the point and don't spend a lot of time pointing out all the problems you think there are.",
