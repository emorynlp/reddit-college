  "text": "I am a 22F prospective clinical psyc PHD student applying to programs this application cycle and was very enthusiastic about a particular program that I found to be a very good fit with my research goals.  \n\nSo I spoke with a clinical psychology grad student recently and one of her advices was to check the social media presence of the potential advisors you will be working with to get a feel of who they are. \n\nSo this program being my top choice, I looked at the social media of the PI who is a 40 something year old male and does research work with mothers and children. \n\nI came across his instagram to see who he follows (wanted to check he\u2019s not weird ) and shockingly saw that he follows about 5 different accounts that post super vulgar, revealing, and sexualized pictures and videos of young women in college(w names like Hot College Girls on TikTok) . I got super shocked and creeped out but don\u2019t know if I should revoke my application or what to do if I actually get an interview.\n\nI had previously contacted him through email and he was very kind and approachable and told me to definitely apply to his lab (but I just saw that as him being  being polite on email). \n\nI know that it\u2019s a MAJOR red flag so now I don\u2019t know if I should work with him if I get in\u2026 so sorry to send such a long message but I\u2019d be grateful if you have any advice or experience on what to do in such a situation. I feel really creeped out\u2026",

At my uni it is standard practice that every first-time supervisor gets a more senior co-supervisor to lend their experience. At least personally that would reassure me somewhat. That's something you can explore during a possible interview. Until then I don't see a problem in just letting your applicaton work it's way through the system and seeing what comes of it. Worst case scenario you get some application practice, even if you decide it isn't for you.",

While it's not the *greatest and most appealing* thing that this professor, apparently, likes to look at pictures of hot college girls...there's nothing terrible about it, it's actually pretty common, and quite frankly, I'm willing to bet that a significant chunk of the people you trust watch porn.

Those are completely different and incomparable situations.\n\nWould I be cool with a high school teacher who enjoys porn in which younger, but still adult, performers dressed up like high school students and played out hot for teacher fantasies? Yes. Because again, I understand that there's not a perfect correlation between a person's personal sexual fantasies and what they would do in a professional setting. Would I work for a principal who admitted liking (or, more analogously, was accidentally discovered to like) \"hot for teacher\" type porn? Yes, as long as they were an otherwise respectful individual.\n\nPeople are jumping to *a lot* of conclusions that I don't think are supportable by any of the evidence. Again I say: Liking something in your personal life does not necessarily have a bearing on how you comport yourself in your professional life.

There's a difference between having different types of things you enjoy or fetishes that may be out of the norm or off-putting to some people, versus fetishizing the very population of students you work with (or at least around half of them), and with whom you're in an institutionalized position of power and who are too frequently exploited by such relationships, all of which is even sort of normalized in our culture. And then add the layer of I'm someone considering cultivating a professional relationship with this person, yet I am part of that population who is being fetishized. And THEN consider that someone in this program warned you to check on this very problem you've now found. \n\nSure, some people might hide what they do for personal entertainment, and many may never act inappropriately as a result of their personal \"interests,\" but IMO if they are someone who can't or won't hide it, I would be concerned about the possibility that they could be the type who can't help but to act out on those interests or at the very least to make the people they fetishize very, very uncomfortable.\n\nAt the same time, I suppose this post speaks to how different people are willing to take different levels of risk, and who are willing to put up with different levels of objectification or insult, or are more or less comfortable with their ability to exit such a situation, which is all fair enough. \n\nI have just seen how frequently these problems really do come up and I've also seen how often and how significantly people struggle with getting out of toxic advising relationships (I mean, just scan through this sub). It's incredibly stressful and affects people's mental health. \n\nFor all these reasons, personally, it's not a risk I'd take, nor is it one that I would advise others to take. Not to mention, there are other many fantastic professors to work with in any field!",

For example, there are many women who have sexual fantasies about nonconsensual sexual behavior; none of those women *actually* want to be sexually assaulted. There are many people involved in BDSM or kink who would *never* want to do those things with partners who did not also enthusiastically want to in safe environments. \n\nKnowing that a person likes to look at pictures of attractive young women tells you nothing other than that they like to look at pictures of attractive young women, which probably makes up a significant proportion of the population, honestly. It's simplistic and unnecessarily paranoid to make the jump from \"likes to look at pictures of Girls Gone Wild\" to \"is probably fetishizing and exploiting the young women who take classes from him.\" And the idea that because someone didn't perfectly lock down their Instagram account they probably are a predator is *ludicrous*.

If there is even a 1% chance that might take the position, keep your name in the hat. Then if you get accepted you can later decline if you\u2019re still not convinced. It\u2019s also a much safer quieter way to bow out, and you never know who you might need to do you a favor later. \n\nRegarding your material concerns that\u2019s a lot thornier. On the one hand I feel for the profs position. I follow a number of pages myself which have a certain kind of content. Further what chaos might ensue if everyone\u2019s incognito mode browsing history were made public. At some point there ought to be an allowance for people to be real and human and that includes having certain\u2026.*interests.* But it\u2019s another thing to be the target of that kink. For some people it\u2019s easy to separate the professional and the private. For others, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of examples of this, they can\u2019t at all separate the two and let the private bleed into work spaces. \n\nMy suggestion would be to seek out lab grad students, especially former female students, who have worked with this person. It\u2019s not foolproof. Sometimes people arnt honest, sometimes one person doesn\u2019t see that side but another does, and sometimes life experiences change how that stuff is expressed for better and worse. But in my experience grad students talk, and female grad students are usually not quiet about when someone has harassed or been aggressive to them. You hear that this person has said that or they *really* like this kind of person in a creepy way. That dirt gets around, and in ways that make me feel like it\u2019s intentional. I myself have told female peers to watch out for certain problematic people. \n\nSo if you reach out you might hear back. You can even phrase it in a neutral way. \u201cI\u2019ve had bad experiences in the past and might be over concerned, what do you think about lab culture and what not.\u201d Then see what they say. Could be nothing. Could be a red road flair. You just don\u2019t know till you investigate. And until your more certain I would do something irreversible.",

I definitely want to investigate this more because this PI has very niche research interests that I am particularly interested in and have done research in BUT like you said, I do fall under the \"young college girl\" population which is what concerns me the most. However, this person has never worked with grad students until this year so that is also somewhat of a concern.",

I would contact other women in the same lab personally. Ask them who they\u2019ve had classes with, who they\u2019ve worked with, what they think of Prof X. Keep it vague but not, you know? In these situations it\u2019s so hard to know what could be smoke and what could be fire. Ultimately though you have to protect yourself. It\u2019s a sad reality, but it\u2019s the way of things. \n\nBest case would be to keep your options open and (here\u2019s to hoping) get acceptance at multiple places so you have multiple choices.",

If so, I would imagine that she led you to this guy's Twitter as a way of telling you what he's like without having to actually tell you. If that's the case, it's a warning I would take seriously. \n\nIf not, I'm not sure what my advice is. I do agree with those who suggest not withdrawing your application, but instead waiting to figure out what to do once you're accepted when you're actually in a position to choose. Most people are into some kind of porn, and a lot of people are into porn that would make people uncomfortable if they knew about it, but it has no bearing on how they treat people in real life. If  his women students don't report issues with him or seem cagey about questions on that front, I'd be inclined to just write it off as cluelessness and stay vigilant about any behavior that makes me feel uncomfortable. If they do seem cagey or report anything inappropriate, or if you get an interview and his behavior makes you feel uncomfortable, I'd stay away.",

Even if he never acts out on it, I personally would be very uncomfortable working for him. A phd advisor is a long term commitment. What happens if the first year he doesn\u2019t act out but then something happens a couple years in? Then you\u2019d need to sacrifice your research and start all over again in a different lab or just stomach it for the remainder of your PhD.",

I have a male advisor and a female co-advisor. My male advisor has never been anything but supportive and awesome but when I first started I\u2019d heard some horror stories from friends in other departments about legendary creeps in their fields so having a co-advisor allowed me to be more immediately trusting since I had another person that I could go to if there ever was an issue.",
