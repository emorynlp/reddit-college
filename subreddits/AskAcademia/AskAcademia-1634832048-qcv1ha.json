  "text": "Hello. I am a common lurker on r/Professors to see the complaints or vents professors have about students - however, the vast majority of posts about students there seem to be about undergrads.\n\nWhat would be some common problems or vents you face regarding your grad students (MS, PhD students)?\n\nI am an MS hopeful, from an Asian country very big on etiquette and harmony, so I want to research as much as possible which kind of things professors/PIs find annoying, so as to avoid these pitfalls. (Some of them are not intuitive for me, for cultural and also ASD reasons, so unfortunately I cannot rely on my \"common sense\" reliably here.)\n\nCreating the best possible relationships with future advisors and PIs is extremely important to me.\n\nThank you for your input.",

      "text": "The biggest issue I run into with students is perfectionism and (related) keeping to deadlines.  If I say I want a draft by Tuesday I want a draft,  no matter how rough, on Tuesday.  Often I have specific time each week that is free for reading/writing/editing so getting something on Wednesday morning doesn't work for me. I've moved on to something else until next week. What I find is that students want to send something really good (perfect) and will send it late as a (hopefully) better product. It takes years to get students to stop doing that and embrace the draft.  Sometimes I have to send them my own rough and partially completed drafts to show them that I don't mind.  \n\nNote: This is what bothers ME. You should ask your PI how she wants to operate (meeting frequency, draft stages, core working hours, # of papers) and then do that.  Clear expectations are nearly always the key to success.",

          "text": "I think ultimately this behavior arises because the academic world is so hyper competetive. Other than that, I think a lot of students encounter one or two really bad PIs that sort of ruin students ability to really trust that you would really actually want a draft. The last PI I had before leaving academia would publicly mock you, degrade you, berate you and just outright do everything he could to humiliate if you didn't hand in a draft where everything was perfect. So your mileage may vary with this. The university refused to do anything because he was too valuable. \n\nWhile he was definitely the worst in that respect, it was a common complaint that I heard from many graduate students where they were made to feel like they were wasting the pi's time if they didn't.\n\nI feel like this is a sentiment I see voiced on here fairly frequently",

One thing that my postdoc PI did that I've found helpful for some students is asking them to annotate their own drafts before they send them. This allows them to highlight any parts they're not yet happy with or point out something they're having difficulty with, or to explain what they're thinking on parts that might not yet be complete. On an emotional level, it functions as a hedge and they don't feel as much like they're being judged as if they're presenting this as a final work. And on a practical level, it provides me more context and direction as I'm reading their work, and it forces them to reread their own writing critically.",

I can't reschedule meetings nearly as well as I can flex my reading/editing times and it leaves a dead spot in my calendar since I like back-to-back meetings. \n\nGetting individual expectations is the best advice.",

      "text": "So I'm a postdoc, not a professor, and my only experience with mentorship is with advanced undergrads, writing some sort of thesis. My favorite type of student is one that takes initiative and thinks about things and problems that they come up against; it is the most frustrating when they just wait for instructions all the time and never see next steps. But it's a balance---I don't expect them to come up with all the answers by themselves, otherwise what am I there for?\n\nHowever, I wanted to pitch in my two cents which is that while there may be some common pitfalls (the literature comment was a good one, as is respecting people's time), a lot of people's pet peeves boil down to \"know exactly what your advisor's expectations are\". I've received basically every recommendation here and also its opposite.\n\nOn writing: I've had advisors that flat-out refused to read anything below a full draft, and others that would happily look over a detailed outline. One that wanted the draft a week in advance of the meeting so they could read it and another who would print it and read it in front of me IN our meeting, even if I sent it days in advance.\n\nOn learning: I've had advisors that wanted to give me pointers on how to get through problems, even if they didn't really know but could help me figure it out, and one who literally just told me to google it when they DID know exactly what the issues were. One advisor that encouraged talking through ideas and theory with them, one advisor that told me to just read what all the literature had to say and not bother them (not in those words, but that was the message), one that told me to just \"speak my truth\" and not worry about what other people's thoughts are, including theirs.\n\nOn reading: I mentioned that reading the literature is a good general one, but actually one of my advisors told us that they think reading other people's work is boring and a waste of time. On the other hand I also had a professor that refused to talk to me about a proposal I had until I read a particular book from cover to cover and could answer questions about miniscule details in it.\n\nOn progress: Good general advice to make progress. But this is specific as well. I had an advisor that would get upset if you didn't do MORE than you said you would. \n\nOn outside information: I had advisors that wanted to know what was going on with me and one that thought that I had a crush on them because I mentioned stuff outside of work.\n\nSo... yeah. My advice as a non-professor is to ask your advisors what their expectations are and respond accordingly. If you've got a choice of advisors/schools, it's good to try to get to know them a bit beforehand so you can see if your advising styles mesh well.",

In my country we are always expected to \"read the air\" without being told what are the expectations, and naturally understand expectations explicitly through observation and EQ. As an autist it is impossible for me.\n\nHowever, it seems, in my perception at least, profs/supervisors/PIs in the USA and UK are more open to being asked directly about their expectations? Or did you also have to learn all of the above expectations for each supervisor through \"reading the air\" and trial and error?",

              "text": "Haha, I actually almost considered including the fact that some advisors are very open to explicit discussions of expectations and some are not. For some of my advisors it was explicit (usually the younger ones), and for some it was trial and error. I haven't had any truly \"Asian style\" advisors with implicit expectations yet. And my mom is from east Asia so I have some experience with those expectations of reading the air! And failing due to mismatched cultural expectations between myself and my Asian family, but not finding out until later because they apparently complained to everyone BUT me. So I feel you. \n\nIn the US, at least in my circles, the idea of \"mentoring compacts\" is gaining some popularity. This is basically a document stating the advisor's expectations for the student, and the student's expectations for the advisor. Now there is some variability in the specificity; my current PI has more broad expectations (\"make progress\" or something along those lines, for example) but I have heard of others being far more detailed, e.g. laying out exactly how much they expect you to contribute to your first, second, and third+ published papers of the PhD. \n\nThere are certainly some professors that are less explicit, or just simply haven't really sat down to consider what their personal advising style is (or that it is, in fact, personal, and not universal). I think one major difference is probably that in the US, they are more likely to tell you that they don't like what you did, as opposed to silently disapproving. I think in general it's safer to be more explicit on YOUR end---you should be able to ask questions or indicate what your plans are, and they'll tell you if that's okay with them.\n\nAgain if you're choosing between advisors, if you can get a good feel for how explicit professors are, you can make that one of the things you consider for compatibility. Maybe you really want to work with someone who is good at being explicit in this way.  One good way to do this is to ask current students; they'll usually have better perspective than the professor themselves unless the professor is SUPER thoughtful.",

It is up to the academic to do the right thing, and I go out of my way to ensure ethically ambiguous students stay out of academia as much as possible.\n\nIn general, I don't have any complaints about my students, because I do not agree to advise potential students who do not meet the 2 requirements above. I enthusiastically take up any other gaps in my students' knowledge, skills, etc. as my own training task.",

      "text": "My number one complaint about some grad students is that some cannot seem to imagine  themselves (see themselves) as my future colleagues.   (note:  i'm in the Humanities.) \n\nThey instead act passively... like undergraduates.  They want to be given assignments.  They expect that, if they complete just the assigned tasks, they are doing well.  \n\nIn short, many grads just don't take responsibility for their own graduate education.  \n\nInstead, they want to be (still in undergrad mode) handed information, rather than dig up information on their own.  (For instance, if I mention an article in a seminar and say \"it's great--check it out\" but don't *assign it*,  many grads will not bother with it.  Then, four months later, they'll hand in an end-of-term paper where that article would have been *perfect*... but it wasn't assigned, so they never looked at it.  grrrr.) \n\nOr, if they have a question about the reading, they (if they're courageous) simply ask about it in seminar... rather than chasing after the answer themselves.   (and I don't mean google it!  I mean, dig into the scholarship to figure it out.  They know how to do that--because I taught them.  But they just don't.)\n\nI love what I do... it's just that I don't have nearly enough time to do it.  If I were a grad student again--without all my current teaching and service requirements and narrow publication deadlines--oh the books I would read...!!!!!      \n\nI guess I just want grad students to love what they are doing.  (just like I loved what I was doing, back in grad school.)  I want them to be insatiably curious.  I want them to disagree with me!  I want them to tell *me*, \"actually, professor, you *really need* to check out this article--it really speaks directly to what you're saying.\"  \n\nThat would make my day.",

      "text": "My biggest struggles, especially starting out with mentorship for graduate students, is that they *always* overstate their expertise. \"Do you know how to use \\[insert statistical package\\]\" does not mean \"I used it in a class once.\" At this point, I just assume that any graduate student I oversee knows nothing, and they can stop me if they feel like I am overexplaining. The same goes for data analysis and visualization. If you've only had experience taking data from a secondary source and running frequencies/descriptives and throwing those into an Excel bar graph (or, worse, Google Sheets), for the love of all, *just tell me that* instead of telling me that you have \"extensive experience in data visualization and presentation to community members.\" \n\nWhile I've learned this now, not understanding the baseline experience of graduate students was basically nil turned into so much heartache, especially around reporting season and in manuscript preparation. Giving grad students a dataset and telling them to clean it is often *way* over their heads, even if their degree program is directly applicable to data management and analytics. It's astounding. \n\nNowadays, my graduate students get frustrated with how slow training is, but if I ask them to do the task instead of going through a very slow, iterative training process first, it's a complete nightmare for me to try to correct issues and find out that they know nothing beyond basic commands. \n\nAlso, within the last few years, it seems that graduate students have no concept of computer directory file systems or cloud computing and storage management. I keep having graduate students try to assemble documents in Pages or Google Docs when I give them a Microsoft Word template that all they have to do is open it and it creates a new document in exactly the format the funder requires. Then I get these weird questions about why the document isn't formatted correctly, and inevitably, they're opening their browser to use the file. Relatedly, \"open the file from your computer,\" has absolutely no meaning to them. They'll invariably open Google Drive, or Dropbox, or whatever, and open the file in their browser. Basic file management and document types are completely absent for them, and I have no idea when or how that got lost in education. I've had to write very detailed protocols with screenshots. \n\nLast part of the rant: graduate students have *no concept* of basic data compliance. I know they had to take the training for human subjects and our basic IT training for data management, but I feel like they must have just clicked through and gotten the quiz questions right by trial and error. Restricted data *cannot be downloaded on some random library computer*, or when you're on wifi at your local coffee shop. It has to stay on the cloud system, which I personally installed and integrated with your computer, and cannot be accessed unless you do it through the VPN system that the University required you set up on your computer before you could even use the campus wifi. Yes, you have to do this *every single time*.",

      "text": "I wouldn't call it a complaint really, but sometimes PhD students are a bit too confident in the beginning (sometimes possibly an overreaction to imposter syndrome, I guess). It may take a year or two for them to gauge their own level of knowledge and understanding in the big scheme of things.\n\nOne way this manifests itself is that they sometimes think that everything they know is common knowledge in the field. This tells me that they may underestimate how much there is out there to know. It takes a while to come to understand this, and when they do they may become super stressed about it, leading them to \"rabbit hole research\". Ideally, they eventually understand that this isn't a problem. Senior researchers are typically aware of what they know and not, and are at peace with this fact.",

I have not supervised PhD students but I recently was one, snd figuring out what my advisor expected was way harder for me than it should have been, and made the first two years really bumpy. I was so terrified I would \u201cbother\u201d him with my \u201cstupid\u201d questions or problems that I wasted weeks sometimes banging my head against a table trying to figure stuff out that he could\u2019ve clarified in a fifteen minute conversation, and he would be frustrated with me for not having come to him sooner. \nAlternatively, sometimes I came to him for help too early in figuring out a problem and would be publically berated for not having figured it out on my own.  \nI was one of his first PhD students he had mentored and it kinda showed. I think it took him a few years to figure out his own expectations tbh, and it was a lot smoother by the end after we established a regular time line and framework for checking in. \nIt\u2019s honestly really, really hard because academia is so international (which is one of my favorite things about it!), but this also means we can misunderstand each other very easily if we don\u2019t explicitly communicate expectations. I\u2019m from the US and my advisor was Scottish and even that was enough for us to misunderstand each other sometimes. \n\nMy life saver was a post doc who had been working with my advisor for many years and really understood him. She basically helped me screen my issues and practice presenting them ahead of time so I would be ready when asking him for help. It was a huge kindness on her part, but really necessary in this case, where I couldn\u2019t figure out what the expectations where, despite honestly trying my best. It\u2019s not unusual and if it happens to you, know you aren\u2019t alone. If you can find other more senior students or post docs to help guide you, it\u2019s a big, big help.\n\nEdit to add: remember that they are sometimes learning too. Supervising is not something they\u2019ve usually had formal training on and it\u2019s not something you just naturally know. Try to have grace for each other. Now that I\u2019m in supervisory roles (not PhD students but field crews and other more junior biologists) I have an extra appreciation for how difficult it is to supervise truly well. I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve botched it myself more than once.",
