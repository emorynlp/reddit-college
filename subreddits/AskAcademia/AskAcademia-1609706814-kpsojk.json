  "title:": "How to tell my PhD advisor that I don't want to be a professor anymore?",
  "text": "In the beginning of my PhD program (Materials Science, R1) I told my PI of my ambition to be a faculty. I'm the first PhD student of my PI, so I know that they put lots of effort and resources for my research training. As a young PI, having a mentee who goes on becoming a faculty seems like a big achievement and a legacy to be proud of for the rest of their career.\n\nNow I'm nearing the end of my PhD and, after contemplating, I want to have a comfortable and stable life after PhD. I don't see doing postdoc(s) and looking for non-existent tenure-track faculty jobs as a comfortable/stable life. Although this may not be true if I decide to move elsewhere out of state.\n\nWith all the sacrifice my PI has given to me (resulting in my super productive outputs, a number of first-authored papers, as well as several fellowships in my belt), how should I respectfully tell my PI that I changed my mind about my future career? What is the best way to explain that I may no longer want to be a professor?\n\nI'm not really good at speaking and choosing the right words to say, so your suggestions are highly appreciated.",

Believe me, the mentors of our cohort don't blame a single person for where their path ended up taking them.

The system churns out too many PhDs, and only a fraction will make it to be a PI and professor. Yet this is often the only future that everyone tells us is worth having. This is not the case! Industry is not a secondary choice. Going out on your own, consulting, startups, these are all valid careers. You are not less worth than those that stay in academia. And PIs should nurture that diversity as well, in order for 99% of graduates not to feel like failures.",

In fact, in most cases, not doing a PhD is the best option. I don't know a single professor who disagrees. \n\nThe suggestion to the OP is not to beg, seek absolution, or defend their career goals. It was merely to talk to her advisor to before the final decision in order to make sure it's the best option for the OP. The default hypothesis is that the advisor is not the student's antagonist but is in fact the student's #1 career cheerleader and supporter. In my observation, grad students would do better on the whole if they assumed that about advisors (rather than the caricature of evil painted every day on this subreddit).\n\nConcluding, while maniacal insistence on academia is wrong and impractical, maniacal insistence on industry based on general statistics rather than the specific field and *individual* involved is also dubious.",

      "text": "Every PI dream is a lab tech who can do the work with minimal supervision. Who comes with such a mindset or who can be readily equipped with such a mentality? \n\n1. Minimal supervision: you need to read papers on your own, experiment multiple times until you succeed.\n2. Being productive: the more you work, the more data you provide. The more data you have, the better story you can setup to sell your work when it comes to publication. The more data you bring, the more opportunity to find another good project to work on. In all of these productivity, all your PI needs is \"He is a stellar graduate student\" one liner in his recommendation. Your stipend won't go up. But his tenure will be secured. His name will be on the paper. He can easily recruit another graduate students with your good project. The cycle continues. \n3. Graduate: Your PI job is to graduate a PhD. In their grant application, this is one of the criteria they need to provide. Lately funding agency starts using the work placement as one of the estimators to judge whether the PI is doing a good job at training their graduate students. For this, old PIs have a lot to write about because they have graduated many students while the younger PIs have nothing to write home about. So this criteria has become less of the indicators for the funding to the lab. \n4. The treatment: The PIs treatment to graduate and postdoc is different. Graduates are just a newbie in TT track while the postdocs are next in line. So the boundary between PI and graduate students is clear, but the one between postdocs can be vague because of the continuation of the projects by the postdoc once they get the TT positions and will compete against the very PI for the limited amount of funding resources. \n\nWhat you plan for your future for next 5 years can change. What do you think those PIs have never thought of leaving the academia in their PhD and postdoc years? Some have tried and left. Some tinkered with the idea. Some has tried and remained in academia for many different reasons. \n\nI can tell you any sane PIs will definitely understand. \n\nIf your PI don't, that's one of the indicators that you should avoid at all cost in the next step in your future career.",

She kept trying to push me into applying for postdocs, but I politely refused. Once I got my job, she stopped bothering me and honestly just checked out of my progress (she was and still is from what I hear from current students a shit advisor so no surprise there). She offered no help with any industry connections she may have had, so I leveraged connections I made with former students in industry from other groups. My friend and former coworker in our group suspects she didn't want to help us in an effort to get us to come back to academia, and she still emails us for help writing grant proposals (which we of course ignore and she wouldn't have the funding she does given that my friend and I wrote the entirety of the technical portion of her grant proposals, she just did some editing and the finance/logistics planning, which we didn't realize was not normal until well into the latter part of our time there).

      "text": "I just graduated, and I was in a similar position as you\u2014the first PhD student that my advisor had ever had, at a large R1. I did not do a postdoc, and will be starting a job soon that I guess technically is in industry? It doesn\u2019t involve any benchwork or data collection/analyzation. As I moved through grad school, I came to the conclusion that I just don\u2019t love the research side of things as much as I thought I did. I love the critical thinking, the big ideas, and learning new things, I just don\u2019t get joy from actual physical research. So I used the resources around me to search for alternative careers that fit my needs and interests, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m pursuing. What it comes down to is, you have to just be honest with your PI when it comes to what you want. You don\u2019t have to bash academia (not that you are\u2014just a helpful tip) but just emphasize that your preferred career plan will better fit your skills and desires. People are moving towards alt-ac careers more and more now, as fewer TT jobs are available and there are too many PhDs to fill them, so being that they\u2019re a new PI and presumably fairly young, they will probably understand. Just be prepared that your PI may not be able to provide as much help regarding industry connections as they would have been able to if you were looking to stay in academia. So it will mean you may have to work a little harder to make connections and network (LinkedIn is very helpful for this). But it absolutely can be done, and you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about it!",
