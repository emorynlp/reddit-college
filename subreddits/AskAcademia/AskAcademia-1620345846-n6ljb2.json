The next 1/3 is usually missing something big, like pubs or teaching experience. The last 1/3 are where most of the attention is focused, and the difference between those applicants is usually quite nuanced.",

But it also seems a little clueless sometimes and it is hard to not take it as dismissive of the qualifications that faculty members actually have.  \n\nSome of the noisiest complaints I have gotten from rejected candidates have been from this group as well.  A former lawyer once spent weeks writing to me with demands about his title and salary after we informed him that he was cut from the first round.  He couldn't fathom that there would be better candidates, people who met the actual qualifications listed in the job ad.  I think he thought this was some kind of playing hard to get negotiation.  We don't teach law, so there wasn't even a very strong argument to be made for the value of a practitioner's experience.  Amazing.",

I mentioned the lawyers who think they are historians elsewhere in this thread, but literally the *only* candidates that have complained to me about being cut from a search pool in the last 30 years have been lawyers. Totally unqualified lawyers in fact, who seem to think the JD means they are special enough to not need a Ph.D. even though it's a job requirement.",

Grants, awards, and teaching experience are usually also extra benefits that differentiate people after research is considered. Depending on your field, having professional non-academic work experience in the field could also be attractive. Of course, strong grammar, formatting, etc. in documents.

In a lot of cases you will have many applicants who if applied and no one else did, would be a perfectly reasonable candidate.\n\nHowever, maybe not in the case of Academia, but in many roles there are adverts put out and no one reasonable applies, and you hire no one, normally because the pay rate or location is no where near commensurate with the role, a concept that seems to baffle HR departments when they are advertising the literal lowest salaried job in multiple countries and no one relevant applies.",

People who have a grasp of what SLACs do and clearly explain why they want to work in one tend to rise up, while those who submit generic cover letters that are more suited to R1s are quickly tossed out. It's literally the interview question: \"Why do you want to work with *us* specifically?\" Good cover letters answer that question.",

They say \"I really want to teach in an SLAC environment because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" and have some reason that's not just \"because you are hiring.\"\n\nThey also have to avoid a lot of things, like rambling on for two pages about their research, or how they expect to have course releases their first year, or other things that immediately show they Don't Get What SLACs Do.  [Karen Kelsey's stuff on cover letters](https://theprofessorisin.com/2016/08/26/why-your-job-cover-letter-sucks/) is generally pretty good, worth reading for anyone applying to PUIs and unsure about what to include (and what not to say).\n\nIn my experience a significant number of committee members (especially senior faculty) are concerned that candidates might be \"settling\" for a teaching-focused position and if we hire them they'll just leave as soon as they can. So they use the cover letters to filter out anyone who isn't directly addressing the specific position and institution. A fair number just send us a generic cover letter so that's easy to drop-- if we have 30 people applying from top ten programs who *do* take the time to research who we are and what we do, why would we bother with anyone who does not? Others simply demonstrate that they just don't understand our mission or what it means to work at a PUI where teaching is the #1 job (even if publication requirements have moved well beyond \"modest\" over the last couple of decades).",

Two of the finalists had next to no teaching experience and the winner has next to none. They had quite a few publications though. \n\nSome of the phone interview finalists did not have many publications/came from lower ranking universities.\n\nIt all depends on the search and search committee on disqualifications.

If someone comes from a background where they weren't able to publish as much as it was hoped during their PhD due to several cirumstances (i.e. lack of funding, disseases, maternal leave, etc.), having good recommendation letters from advisors/collaborators would be the only way for this person to compete with those who didnt' face such problems during their PhD and managed to have a lot of publications.",

At my SLAC we simply don't hire people without direct teaching experience (being a TA doesn't count for anything; labs only count a little) except in a couple of fields where it's hard to compete with industry (like CS). Top candidates in the humanities and social sciences will have taught 3-6 courses entirely on their own, will have publications, and will have an extensive record of service as graduate students (mostly committees related to grad students, teaching, or things like advising, or with an external professional organization, or in the community). Of course lots of people apply without those things in their CVs but they aren't going to be competitive with those who do.\n\nThe reality is that the job market for the last 20+ years has produced candidates with records that would have been nearly good enough to secure tenure in the 1980s. Finalists in most searches I've been involved in (a lot, over three decades) all have outstanding teaching records, decent pubs and lots of potential for more, and have been deeply involved in service both in their own institutions and with regional/national organizations as well. Some of these folks build their records in post-docs or as VAPs for a year; others do it all in grad school. Given the market there's simply no reason for a committee to look hard at applicants who lack all this experience because so many are presenting with Ph.D.s from top programs *and* experience that clearly demonstrates they're ready to be an assistant professor on all three fronts (teaching, research, service).\n\nGrad advisors who don't explain this all to their students are doing them a disservice.",

They might know someone at a relevant school and pass on the message. Then again, they might not know anyone there or might not want to pass on the message, depending on the school and your profile. (If it's a low-ranked institution in a specific location, great - but don't say you have a geographic constraint in Cambridge, MA, and hope that will get you an interview at Harvard.) Often, supervisors will try to advertise you through their networks on their own without your saying anything. It's helpful to tell them your preferences or any other relevant info so that they can credibly signal on your behalf. Anything they say (this could be over the phone but could also be by email or might go into their letter... some departments even get together and devise a plan for which students they will pitch to which types of places) will be more credible than your saying it yourself. Some of this might be field-specific, but people talk... and especially towards the end of the job season, if you still don't have anything you'd better believe they'd be trying to make calls to find you something if they can, including in industry. More senior supervisors / people at higher-ranked places have better networks, of course, so ymmv.\n\nThere isn't much you can do about it other than to be upfront about your preferences and tell them if you are struggling to find a job - communicate regularly during applications.\n\nEdit: This does depend a lot on country and HR. I think the UK, for example, has strict HR procedures generally and would never follow informal advice, as the poster above notes. Three other countries I know would definitely consider it. It can be especially helpful if someone wants a job in a less-obvious place, like New Zealand - schools don't want to exert effort to get people who aren't serious about their application to begin with, so a message from your supervisor saying you are actually serious about NZ would help a lot. Actually, it can work both ways: a school in a far away location can themselves reach out to your supervisor, if they're interested, to verify that you would take the job.",

Most of the \"want X hire Y\" situations I've seen happened because a material factor changed between when the ad was published and when the hiring decision was made (e.g. change in leadership, change in budget, somebody else left or joined the department so department needs are now different). \n\n> a million stories of failed searches, where all the people they invited for campus visits ended up being really horrible\n\nidk if you are implying this or not, but for the ones in the back, searches actually rarely fail because all the candidates are horrible. usually it's that all the candidates are unsuitable for one reason or another (which doesn't make them horrible - just not the right fit), or, again, there was a leadership/budget change, or, actually, because all the invited candidates were really strong and got better offers elsewhere! But also, even in cases where a candidate is horrible - usually it's for stuff that isn't part of the written app, so it's not like someone could \"choose poorly\" based on information they don't have. Sometimes you invite someone who smells bad or makes racist jokes at dinner. Finding those things out is in fact why the campus visit exists. If committees could just find this holistic stuff out from a candidate's written materials, they wouldn't need to spend money on bringing people to campus.\n\n> people like to hire someone who will be fun and/or easy to work with.\n\nI don't think this is stupid or biased though. Someone who is hard to work with makes getting work done really hard (it's in the name lol). I've had multiple collaborations fail because people were lazy, unorganized, rude, condescending, stubborn over stupid shit... I'd rather not work with someone like that, not because I have some personal feeling about it, but because I'm at work to work, not to babysit another adult through their job. And when it's a TT situation, ie the person you're hiring will probably be around until you or they literally die, it's understandable that people are even more careful about personality and fit.",

However, the reality is of the 5 we choose for campus visits after video interviews, four of them were interviewing for 3 other jobs in 2 universities in our region - one much stronger than us, one much weaker. Frankly, that has happened more than not in the last decade, perhaps that is limited to our field that is dependent on an incredibly smart project that can get published and translate into original classes for undergraduates.

      "text": "(This is pertaining to searches in the humanities/social sciences, from a department within a STEM school.)\n\nWhen I have run searches I have each member on the committee go through and assign a simple number to each application. -1 means I actively don't like them as a candidate (terrible fit or whatever), 0 means I have no strong feelings either way, 1 means I sort of think they could be interesting, 2 means I am super enthusiastic about them.\n\nEveryone obviously has their own reasons for their votes and their own weighting of the numbers. Some people have hard no 2s and some people lean towards 0 where others might lean a 1, but in the end the results are remarkably in sync across the committee.\n\nIn general this turns about 50% of the people into the 0 or below category, and then a top 20% emerges of lots of 2s and 1s, and then a middle 30% of 1s and 0s. A not super surprising kind of result. (I will note that this method makes the committee discussions very easy \u2014 we can see where we agree and don't need to talk much about that, and if someone wants to make a strong case for someone who got left out, they can do so.)\n\nThe trends among the bottom 50% are pretty similar. Really not germane to the position, for example (someone from an adjacent or wrong field applying \u2014 happens constantly, because people are still advised that you should apply to every job no matter what because who knows if the listing is correct etc. etc.). Or dramatically under-performing in terms of productivity (often in a sad way, e.g. someone who has been an adjunct for 10 years and has not published anything in that time \u2014 I'm sorry but you're not competitive for a TT job at that point). Or they didn't write a cover letter (or include a CV or some other error \u2014 and I do follow up with anyone who doesn't appear to submit all of their materials because I know that online HR systems are crap, but even then). Exceptionally low-ranked universities coupled with everything else. (We're not all about ranking where I am, but if your entire academic career by that point has been at low-ranked places, that is telling.) Chemists who think they can be historians despite no training or relevant publications. Lawyers who think they can do everything, because they're lawyers. Etc.\n\nThe top 50% are more competitive but the top 20% are just more competitive than the rest. They have great academic pedigrees \u2014 not a requirement, but it helps, all other things considered. They wrote great cover letters that made it clear they really were interested in our school and our job. They have really promising publications already, and their research would interact really well with the others in our department. They are just great fits for our specific position. Things like that.\n\nWe usually manage to do a phone/Skype interview with the top 20% \u2014 a lot of interviews. That is just about sorting them into a smaller list of 4-5 to invite to campus. That's where you find out who is articulate, who comes across as engaging, whose enthusiasm is more genuine than others'. Sometimes the best \"on paper\" candidates fail here because it turns out they simply cannot help but act like they consider our school a \"safety\" choice and not a real job they want (heads' up, people: there are no safety choices in TT jobs). \n\nThe final choice after the campus visit is always a difficult one, and less a choice than a ranking, and one that usually requires reconciling a lot of different considerations, and usually has almost everything to do with what we feel we \"need\" at that moment, and not due to any benefit or defect in the candidate.\n\nI always tell graduate students that if it is a job you really are right for you should be able to get into the top 20% if you work at it. That's the result of you doing good on paper (and publications and teaching and a decent school and etc.), and taking the time with the application you need to to make it shine. Whether you can be in the top 10% is a lot harder to control, and whether you get the job will depend on a huge number of factors that are unknown to you and beyond your control. But you have a lot of control over the \"first cut.\" And for pete's sake please don't apply to jobs you are absolutely and objectively not qualified to do \u2014 it just wastes your time and everyone else's. If you really aren't sure if you should apply (e.g., if you do something close-enough to the job description to be plausible, but it's not obvious), e-mail the search chair \u2014\u00a0they will be able to tell you very quickly if it is worth your time to give it a shot.",

      "text": "SLAC chair here, with decades of hiring experience. I suspect this varies a lot between types of institution and between fields as well. In my case-- mostly humanities and interdisciplinary searches in the SLAC context --I'd say about 10-15% of the applicants in a typical pool are utterly unqualified. For example, in history we *always* get applications from idiot lawyers who are 100% confident that teaching/research is easier than being a lawyer, that their passion for the History Channel qualifies them, and that we'd be fools not to hire them immediately. (Like *every* search in US history, to the point that we'll say \"Oh look, here's our lawyer!\")\n\nWe will get 200 applications (or more) for a US position though. So of the 175 that are at least marginally qualified, I'd say half are easily dismissed for not having the right specializations or degrees. Then we can usually drop half of what remains for lacking appropriate experience (for example, we won't hire anyone who doesn't already have experience teaching as instructor of record) or because they have no evident scholarship (pubs & conferences) or because it's clear they have no idea what an SLAC faculty member actually does. So from 200 we might be seriously working with 50-60 applications.\n\nIn my (now pretty extensive) experience it's usually quite easy to cut a pool from 200 to \\~25 or so. Committee members will do that on their own after reading the full files (CV, cover letter, teaching file, LORs, pubs, etc.) then get together to compare lists. I've been involved in over two dozen searches and in almost all of them there was close to unanimous agreement on that first step, which I always take to mean committee members are applying the job description and qualifications fairly consistently as they review applications. Getting from 25 to an interview pool is a bit more challenging usually.",

      "text": "It varies from search to search depending on the specialization and discipline being sought. A narrower ad does narrow the applicant pool somewhat, and a field that is small to begin with does as well. \n\nBasically, in most searches in the humanities (including history) that I've seen in almost thirty years, somewhere between 5-30% of the pool have little to no chance of being considered for screening interviews. The major reason, by far, is that they are in the wrong specialization and sometimes even the wrong discipline entirely (without being a person who essentially practices the discipline being searched for inside another discipline--an anthropologist who works on the past or a literary critic who is basically a cultural historian might be considered in a history search in some cases). When I say wrong specialization, I mean not even slightly proximate--like, you searched for someone who works on early modern Europe and you got applicants who work on pre-Columbian archaeology. There are some people who apply for anything without even really looking at the field (often they're candidates from outside the US) and there are people who try really hard to make the case that they are somehow eligible--say someone who works on 20th Century US arguing that they know a little bit about the history of early modern Southeast Asia because of the Vietnam War. It's kind of astonishing sometimes how far people will try to stretch or to invent a new entirely-so-far hypothetical project in order to claim they are in a given specialized field; it makes feel bad because that's actually a lot of work to put into writing a customized cover letter that can't possibly convince anybody. \n\nThat's most of the easy eliminations. There's a very small but non-zero number of applications that aren't in consideration because the cover letter is incoherent, riddled with errors or comes off to everyone reading the dossiers as kind of scary or unhinged--maybe one or two in every 100 or so applications. \n\nBecause we're an undergraduate-only institution with a lot of attention to teaching, I think in most searches we see a very small number of applications (again, 1 or 2) where the candidate is just using the same cover letter everywhere and more or less expressly  says that they're not very interested in teaching or that research is their main focus, and that's usually enough to keep them from getting a closer look.\n\nPerceived rank of institution has never knocked anyone out of a search I've been involved in--at least no one has expressed that as their evaluative reasoning. There's no magic number of publications either, it's more a question of signs of scholarly ambition and activity appropriate to the stage of the career (e.g., it's different for a late-stage ABD than it is for a 3-year assistant professor). Occasionally you see an application from a doctoral student who isn't even ABD or who just started work on their dissertation a few months ago and those don't get a close look--they're just not ready.",

      "text": "I'm in political science, where the boundaries between fields and subfields are pretty strong -- someone specializing in Congress is not remotely qualified for a job in international relations.  I've been on low-dozens of search committees at a couple-few research-oriented schools in undesirable-to-most-people locations.\n\nIn the places I've been on search committees, we typically get ~75 applications for assistant lines -- schools in \"better\" locations get more than that.\n\nOf those, maybe 10-15 are comically unqualified, like semi-retired lawyers who think it would be a hoot.\n\nAnother 10-15 are people I would not hire for this job, ever, under any circumstances.  These are usually people with very bad field/subfield fit.  People with dissertations on Congress applying for a line where the ad is for \"American politics but not Congress.\"  People with a dissertation on Plato and LORs extolling their skill at political philosophy applying for a job in American politics.\n\nThis gets us down to maybe 40-ish people who are at least in the ballpark.  People with newish phds in political science (or very rarely a related discipline), whose dissertation or work shows that they are actually interested in the field/subfield we're searching for.  Of those, a quarter to a third are just unqualified.  Most of those people will eventually be qualified but are just applying too early.\n\nThe ones that are left we mostly sift through on the basis of their publications and other written work, looking for good skills and cool projects more than just numbers (tho numbers help).  Applicants who would help diversify our department or who can articulate some actual reason why they might want to live in our undesirable-to-most-people location(s) have a leg up.\n\nLow rank university doesn't really come up directly; I've never seen anyone say \"Oh, this would be a good candidate, but we're not hiring from LowRank.\"  ---BUT--- university/department prestige does correlate very highly with new phds who are doing good, interesting work.",
