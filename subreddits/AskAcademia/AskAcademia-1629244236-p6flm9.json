  "title:": "What is it like to work in academic publishing/science communication (STEM PhD)?",
  "text": "I'm curious if anyone with a PhD in STEM has any insider knowledge on what it's like to work in academic publishing (e.g., Assistant or Senior Editor at high impact journals like Nature):\n\n1. **How hard is it to get a job in science communication at the PhD level? (Do you even need a doctorate to be considered? Any jobs open at just the bachelor's or master's level?).** With there being such a scarcity of TT faculty positions and lots of people heading towards industry, will science communication jobs become increasingly competitive?\n2. **What is job security like?** If you landed a job as a full-time editor at a renowned journal, would you theoretically be employed for as long as you want to be there (assuming you perform well)?\n3. **What is the salary range like for editors in academic journals?**\n4. **What is the work life balance like?** Editorial work seems like a pretty straightforward desk job, but I imagine there would be a lot of pressure meeting deadlines, especially with a high volume of submissions. Does working as an editor allow for a 9-5 lifestyle? Or, do editors often work odd hours and weekends too?\n5. **How much of the job involves independent \"desk\" work, and how much of it involves conferencing, presenting, extroverted people skills?**\n\nI'm mostly interested in hearing about careers in academic publishing, but I'm also curious about less traditional routes where there is a focus on communicating scientific information to the general public in a \"pop science\" way.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019m an editor-in-chief at a high tier journal. Shortish answers:\n\n1. It\u2019s relative competitive. Not as bad as tenure track positions. If you get an interview, it\u2019ll be a half or full day, they will get you assess manuscripts on the spot, talk about hot topics in the field, etc. Typically a Ph.D. is required in the field of the journal (I.e., chemistry for, say, Nature Chemistry... usually they look for a more specific area... like carbon catalysis or something... depends how big the journal is). \n\n2. Job security is pretty good. Mostly lateral movements from journal to journal (or when new journals launch). \n\n3. Assistant editors start around the $70K range. Depends on the journal/publisher. \n\n4. Depends on the team. Close to a 9-5, but teams are typically spread out geographically, which leads to flexibility. Sometimes there\u2019s early morning meetings to chat with authors in China, Europe, etc. Work life balance is respected. Meet some deadlines, and no one expects to work more than 40 hours a week (approximately). \n\n5. About 50% of the job is handling papers, from submission through peer review to publication (or rejection). There\u2019s also the planning of events (webinars, symposia, etc.). Strategic meetings with other journals. Recently travel is waaaay down (I.e., COVID), but most journals have a healthy travel budget for conferences and site visits (travel to a university to give a talk and network with researchers). I\u2019d say 5-6 trips per year, some international, some domestic, conferences of different sizes.\n\nAny other questions, just ask!",

The elements of the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity tensor are calculated using the kernel polynomial method. What makes this approach interesting/unique is that one can calculate transport characteristics for huge systems because the computational complexity of the transport calculations scale approximately linearly with the system size. On our cluster, I've run the calculations for systems that were over 300k atoms, nearly 1 million orbitals. If I had access to a beefier cluster, I could easily do larger systems.

My team and I try to expose ourselves to as many sessions as possible and meet as many speakers and researchers as possible. Always something new and exciting!\n\nThe worst past is the minor conflicts that arise, sometimes between reviewers and authors, sometimes rebuttals, corrections, retractions, etc. Some authors take criticism VERY seriously, and don't like rejection.

              "text": "So speaking more generally first - there's a whole ecosystem of science education stuff and a lot of those people have STEM degrees (some PhDs, some not). I mistakenly thought basically everyone involved in science education had a teaching degree, until I met a woman working at a science museum who had a PhD in biology. The people who design exhibits and public programs at museums, people who create curriculum (textbooks etc), other organizations that run STEM programs and camp for kids (e.g. FIRST robotics), educational websites (I don't know if automod blocks URLs here, but for example code dot org or Khan Academy), sciencey toys, etc. \n\nIn my specific case, I work for a science education website (it's a small company so I can't name it without giving myself away on this account). I write instructions for projects, make how-to videos, and design kits of supplies that parents/teachers can buy if their kids want to do a project. So I'm not doing PhD-level research, but I need to be able to explain the science behind a variety of topics at a variety of difficulty levels (e.g. a simple activity for kindergarteners is different from an advanced high school project). In my experience a lot of academics are terrible at that because they spend all day around other people with PhDs in their highly specialized field, so they forget how to communicate with the general public (insert rant about how this should really be part of the training all grad students get, especially in the US where half the public doesn't believe in science). \n\nAnyway, for the most part I am entirely behind the scenes, which is what I meant by the Bill Nye comment. I did miss interacting with students and teaching in person, so I used to get out more often and volunteer at makerspaces/libraries/schools etc - but now I have my own kids and they keep my hands full :-). \n\nAs an example of what I mean, using a website that I DON'T work for - check out teachengineering dot org and look at some of their lesson plans. I write stuff like that. (in their case I think most of their content is written by faculty at universities who are part of the NSF grant funding the site, I don't know if they have their own in-house PhD level employees). And that reminds me that there are also careers like this in academia and industry that require PhD - many university departments and companies have an \"outreach coordinator,\" someone who is in charge of helping the research faculty - who as mentioned above, many times are not great at science outreach (but not always! some of them are great!) - with outreach programs (which for example are required by an NSF grant).\n\nHope that helps!",

              "text": "Like anything else - networking. Just a different type of networking that what you usually get by default in academia (research and attending conferences etc). In grad school I got heavily involved in science outreach - giving guest presentations at schools and science museums, attending science festivals (google \"USA Science and Engineering Festival,\" (USASEF) they also have smaller satellite events in cities around the country). For one job I literally just met someone at a booth at USASEF and that conversation led to a job. For another, a fellow grad student I met in a science outreach club (we gave free lectures to the public about our research) saw a job posting she thought I'd be interested in and forwarded it to me. Of course, this was ten years ago and I realize COVID probably makes this much harder. I'll talk more about my actual job in my reply to u/jdoe36.",
