  "title:": "Is it unusual to be asked to do a panel presentation at a conference AND be required to pay registration?",
  "text": "I've been invited to be on a panel, I agreed.  I was planning on going ahead and signing up for the conference and attending in person, but I'll have to pay full registration price.\n\nNow I'm told my session will be virtual, so I don't really even have to show up at the conference.  But they are requiring me to pay the 'virtual attendance' price of about $500.  If I'm virtual, I really would wind up not going to any of the other sessions virtually.  \n\nI think its odd, that I've been asked to sit on the panel, give a presentation and required to pay $500 to do so, especially when I wasn't seeking this organization, nor would get much value out of it.\n\nSo is this normal procedure to require presenters to pay full registration price?",

It could also possibly have been a mistake that they sent the registration instructions--that happened to a panel I was organizing one year with government speakers who were absolutely not required to pay, but someone accidentally sent the email to the full speakers list.",

I got tied up in admin stuff for the better part of a decade a while back and was *shocked* to learn that the registration fees for some of the conferences I was expected to attend were in the $1,000-1,500 per person range. And rooms in the hotels were $300-400 per night. Apparently that was just normal travel for the deans and other admins I was with (and my institution paid for it all) but like you I was used to $150 registration fees and hotel rooms in the same range. After a few of these I started talking with colleagues about it and found that in some academic fields (business/finance in particular) they were used to paying $1K to register as well, so it wasn't *just* the fact that I was hanging out with C-suite academics at the time.\n\nFWIW, humanities conferences are pretty much the cheapest thing going and always have been.",

The only exceptions have been outside keynote speakers who are being paid to do a talk. Even vendors are required to register. But yes, anyone who is presenting or on a panel is required to register as a matter of course.\n\nIn the case of my orgs this is required because they have no real budgets, so the registration fees are how they pay for the venue, catering, media, etc. They all keep these fees at a break-even level, bumped up a bit for professional members (i.e. faculty) in order to subsidize lower rates for students. But none of these are over $250 for a multi-day conference either. For a \"virtual\" meeting the fees have been more like $50.\n\nSince OP is not a member of this organization and wasn't planning to attend otherwise, I'd probably say no thanks in this case. Paying to do someone a favor is different from attending a regular meeting of one's professional association and giving a talk while there.",

      "text": "The national conference in my discipline hosts hundreds of paper presentations and panels every year. Panels are often put together by unit subgroups who may invite panelists. They are not the conference organizers, just the committee for that one subgroup. Everybody pays the registration fee: presenters, panelists, and subgroup organizers. Only 2-3 keynote speakers are exempt. Thousands of scholars attend. \n\nFor many, their university will pay that fee. But it is possible that someone else could sponsor you. I almost pulled out of my panel last year because I couldn't afford the fee and my university had cut funding due to the pandemic. The subgroup organizers had a small speaker budget from their university, so they paid my fee. You can always just tell the panel organizers you can't afford the fee. Maybe they can do something, maybe not, but no shame in being honest. Good luck!",

Indeed, commentators and chairs have been lost that way - they accept the invitation, but drop off the program after learning that there is an associated fee.  \n\nOne of my professional organizations dropped the registration fee by a very small amount for virtual conferences, using the excuse that running a virtual conference is expensive for them.\n\nThis may be true! It does not, however, change the fact that the registration fee for in-person conferences was already quite high, and the small savings for virtual make it a very poor value for my limited travel/professional development funds.",

The second is that all the speakers were planning on being at the conference anyway. \n\nThis approach works well in that the society is providing a venue for the membership to convene and converse. If speakers had their registration waived, the registration fee would have to be a lot higher and fewer people could attend. \n\nIf those assumptions apply to your conference, then the invitation is from a peer who wants to hear what you have to say and wants to give you a platform to make your work better known. \n\nIf this is a for-profit conference, or one  that you don't value personally, then you do want to be compensated.",

Its perfectly reasonable to not blow half a thousand dollars on a single presentation that *you're* giving to others.\n\nIf they're a legit conference, they should be in a position to waive the cost for you.
