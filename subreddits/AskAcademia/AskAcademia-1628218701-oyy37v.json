  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was shortlisted for a postdoc position, and the PI allowed me to have a chat with some of the lab members before the final panel interview. What kind of questions should I ask them to understand if the lab is a good fit for me? How can I make a good impression?\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude42",

      "text": "First and foremost, assure them of your discretion and ensure you stick to it no matter what. Then a few general questions about whether it's a happy place to work, what sort of hours are expected, what management style the PI has, whether the lab is social if that's what you want, what funding is like. At some point once you've connected sufficiently, ask them what the best and worst thing is about this lab. I find this question gives really insightful answers. What you want is to give them the space and confidence to warn you off if needed. In bad labs people will very much want to tip you off. Ensure you're listening.",

      "text": "PI style, typical week/lab environment, brush up on their research, ask them about their specific projects and ask good questions - see if you can contribute to their project. Every project has some roadblock, so it usually helps if you\u2019ve suggestions. But don\u2019t be pushy of course. Manners. Most importantly, be interested. \n\nI sat through a postdoc interview where the guy was dropping F bombs everywhere. Not against swearing but during his formal presentation, in front of the PI who\u2019s really not the type to swear, is just bad form. Also interviewees who say \u201cgood location\u201d when asked why they want to join the lab really do not help themselves.",

              "text": "This is excellent advice (and some candidates are a nightmare). The meet and greet, and actually the whole interview, is also for you to sound them out. Don't view the \"have you any questions\" as another moment where you have to impress them with a brilliant answer, but rather an opportunity to ask them about the things that matter to you. If academic career progression is important, ask them about what their track record is and what they can do to help you, if work-life balance is important ask about it. Obviously don't ask anything too personal or inappropriate but if it's a good match with you they aren't going to see your questions negatively and you can get a sense if this is somewhere that you'd like to work.",

                      "text": "I wouldn't ask - it's such a problematic area and every paper is different. Anything answer other than \"in peer reviewed journals\" is just ambition and outside their control.\n\nETA you can ask about how they go about deciding when to publish and how they choose where they publish. It's a slightly more neutral way of asking and you may get a sense of the lab values that way too. I did a postdoc in a lab where the PI basically decided all the figures of the paper on paper and where it was going to be published, and then sent everyone off to go do it. It was a very effective publishing strategy but was less great for postdocs looking to establish their own independent research. Depends what you want.",
