  "title:": "Is it still worth trying to become a professor?",
  "text": "I'm an undergraduate student in the U.S. double majoring in European Languages and History, and I'm on track to graduate in the spring of 2021. For years, my plan has been to work towards an eventual professorship. To that end, I spoke with one of my advisers about the viability of my career goals, and his answer was disheartening to say the least. \n\nTo him, seeking a professorship is no longer a realistic career option for hardly anyone. He cited decreased funding and enrollment as major factors and sees a downward trend in available jobs. While he recommended law school, archive studies, or library science as possible alternatives, none of them have quite the same appeal to me. \n\nI was wondering what the general consensus of academics is on the state of graduate studies and professorships? My plan was to work towards a masters in theology with an eventual PhD in either theology or Church history, but my adviser believes that at this point a masters/PhD is only worth pursuing as a factor of another job (such as a masters in history along with archive sciences) or as a means of self-fulfillment. I think I will likely still pursue at least my masters, but find it hard to plan for if it isn't career-oriented. \n\nI know this is a general question, but any thoughts on the practicality of  graduate school and the nature of the university job market would be greatly appreciated.",

There is a major surplus in candidates versus limited positions in most fields (for PhD trajectories and tenure positions). So, there is hyper-competitiveness (and it is incredibly damaging to academia, in my opinion).  \n  \nEdit: However, I don't enjoy being overtly negative, and I'd say ending up in academia these days should be seen more as something that happens along your path. There's no reason not to apply for tenure-- you might even get it.

      "text": "I think it depends on your definition of \"worth it.\"\n\nThis is an imperfect analogy, but for students that ask me this I often say that aspiring to be a professor is a little like aspiring to be a musician or artist. First of all, it's hard to parlay that skill into a job that supports you; second of all, there are lots of different ways to be a musician, from someone who writes jingles for regional commercials to someone who sells out football stadiums.\n\nFor some people, they'd rather have given it their all to give it a shot because otherwise, the \"what-if\" will haunt them forever. They want to be a professor *that badly* that not trying to do it is absurd, even if they know the likely outcome is a PhD and a job in something completely unrelated. I knew quite a few people like that in graduate school.\n\nSix to eight years of your life asking and answering your own questions in an area of deep passion for you is not a bad way to spend your twenties, particularly if you have funding sufficient to support a modest lifestyle, and most doctoral degree holders are gainfully employed making at least a middle-class salary. \n\nFor others, though, if they know that their chances are relatively slim up front, they'd rather spend their time in pursuit of another interest or skill that's more easily parlayed into paying work - and that's fine, too. Although it's not a bad way to spend one's twenties, there is definitely a cost (financial, social, career) to spending nearly a decade of one's prime earning years getting a doctoral degree.\n\nSo really, it's just up to what your values and dreams are.\n\nThat said, I definitely wouldn't consider law school, archive studies, or library science to be good 'sure bet' alternatives to academia. I mean, I think the same thing goes for those fields - if you are really passionate about it, and you want to try and have the support to do so, sure, as long as you have your eyes wide open about the market and your chances. But they're certainly not more \"wide open\" than academia is. *Lots* of academics think \"Well, if I can't be a professor, I'd love to be surrounded by books and research some other way!\" and mentally go to museums or libraries.\n\nI'd think instead of the things that you really like to do - what skills do you like to use? When you imagine a happy day of work for you that is *not* researching and writing about theology and church history, what would that look like? Writing all day? Reading? Solving problems? Mentoring and coaching others? Teaching workshops or classes?",

There are some folks who've done very well at making the transition from PhD to libraries/archives. But there are enough who are bitter\\* that it concerns me when I get application materials for someone where this appears to be the case that it concerns me. It doesn't mean they're out of the pool because they have a PhD, but it does mean that I want them to address their reasons for looking to move into libraries in some way. \n\nI love the work that libraries do. I believe we are an essential part of education. But when I changed careers (from corporate finance!), I set out to be a librarian, and I get frustrated when I see folks who see the library as a second choice career, because many of us chose libraries as the places we want to work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*bitter for not getting a TT position, for being ABD, for not getting tenure, whatever. Also people who look at working in libraries as a way to do their own research and not really pay attention to the work that libraries do.",

I knew I wanted to be finished absolutely before I reached 50 (I did). I knew the PhD would get my actual credentials in line with how I started to be perceived. I knew it would enhance my existing skill profile and allow me to market myself back to the industry I was in before working in research. I knew there was a pathway forward in research - academic, institutional and private. I didn't expect to be competitive on the tenure track market, but turns out I'm a finalist right now for a position.\n\nDo a PhD because you want to contribute to scholarship, are enthusiastic about your discipline and want the credential. Always keep a list of possible career outcomes, and be open to discovering new jobs that people with PhDs in your field have found fulfilling employment in. You're allowed to have preferences, of course, but take all of them seriously and retain at least 3 or 4 that you could see yourself lead a happy professional life in. At regular intervals, reassess. Have a strategy applying for jobs, and follow it.",

      "text": "Compare the number of PhD graduates ***per year*** with the number of Faculty jobs and it's not difficult to see why this is the case. Folks in STEM struggle to find work today and things are only getting more and more difficult over time. I have two friends with amazing academic backgrounds who applied for faculty jobs all over the US last year. Both applied to > 50 research universities. One got 2 job offers, the other got zero. They applied to engineering and biology departments all over the country.\n\nMy understanding is that faculty jobs in the humanities are no easier. I have a friend with an MA in history who can't even get into a PhD program and he has an abundance of experience working in museums, archives, and elsewhere. It's absurd but he doesn't have multiple languages or extraordinary skills to bring to a department. Odds are you'll be fortunate if you can get an adjunct position or find work at a community college. I have several friends who have taught at those levels. Those jobs aren't much better than minimum wage jobs in most states. They're underpaid, overworked, and treated like hell by the administrators.\n\nYou'd be best off looking for work in the real world before pursuing a PhD in the humanities. Those take a long time to finish, you earn nothing as a student, and there aren't many great opportunities after you finish. Take time to evaluate your commitment to that path before you go down it, because the average outcomes are far worse than the ones you idealize. And thank your professor for being honest in that fact.",

Unless your friend is applying to public history PhDs, his work experience is nice, but it's not research experience. He doesn't need multiple languages - he just needs the languages that are relevant to doing academic research in his subfield. If he doesn't have those, yeah, it's like he's applying to physics PhDs without having completed the calculus sequence. It's kind of a prerequisite for doing the work.",

In my field (teaching writing) there's been some opportunities in first-year writing lectureships, especially if you have experience with English Language Learners, technical/professional writing, science writing, or any kind of culture-related rhetorics. Writing centers are a stable field, too--I'm a WC assistant director with a lectureship tacked on.\n\nStill, universities are mostly happy to plug these positions with adjuncts and lectureships might pay as little as $40k/year--which would be tough to survive on in the city where I live. I myself make $37k for a *full-time job* and still have to adjunct on top of it. It's extremely stressful. Unlivable, in fact. I've applied for a better-paying FT lectureship and if this doesn't come through, I'm quitting my FT role to adjunct and freelance edit. \n\nThe only reason I'm still in the game is that I have a masochistic love of teaching at the college level. It's my drug of choice. I've never felt happier in my entire life than when I'm in the classroom, except maybe when I got married--and you only get married once!\n\nI think if anyone feels anything less than that level of stupid desire, all of academia's bullshit communicates real fast that it's not worth it. \n\nIt's a shame. In theory, I think academia is a marvelous idea, but the best version of that theory has never been realized. I used to think I'd stick around long enough to be the change, but after nearly 6 years of getting beat down I'm getting tired.

The whole system of adjunctification only works because we\u2019re foolishly passionate about our disciplines. \n\nWith that being said, it usually takes a unique personality to get to the top of academia. And, it\u2019s not necessarily a healthy/balanced one. It requires being entirely single-minded. That\u2019s hard to accomplish if you want a family or any semblance of work/life balance. \n\nI\u2019m an adjunct teaching FYW. What you and I have going for us is that almost every freshman and sophomore needs to learn how to write. We at least have some semblance of job security there, though yes, the pay is awful. I\u2019m worried that OP\u2019s field wouldn\u2019t have that sort of demand. \n\nOh, and full disclosure (mostly for OP\u2019s sake)\u2014the only way I can live with this career choice is because my wife\u2019s a pharmacist and is able to support us with just her income.",

I've met some brilliant and kind people, but I've also met people that regularly screwed over and gaslight the people around them to maintain (or attain) status. My favorite place to work has been community colleges--these are full of pragmatic, empathetic, competent people who work hard for their students and institutions.

Honestly, this is probably the #1 deal-breaker. \n\n* The volume of preps and grading. Just... how? \n\n* The lack of teaching freedom--It seems like K-12 teachers are beholden to sad, sad curricula and get stuck teaching for tests. I taught test prep independently for 9 years and while I'm good at it, I don't think it has a place in the classroom. I like showing *Full Metal Jacket* and talking about sexual consent too much to teach outside of college, lol. \n\n*  The lack of support. I see ELA teachers posting *constantly* in their subreddit to the tune of \"Help! I got assigned an AP Shakespeare class at the last minute and I've never read any of his books! What do I do???\" How does a thing like that even happen? Sure, in academia teaching standards can be low, but at least you generally have to have taught the class before or have a certain number of credit hours in the subject to get the class. I never want to be in a position to deliver poor instruction to students because I'm forced to teach a subject I have no experience with. \n\n* Parents. The worst thing about teaching test prep was dealing with the parents. They were largely chill, but it was a pain managing their expectations. At least in academia if a parent calls complaining about their child's grade we can politely cite FERPA/consent laws and hang up. \n\nAm I wrong?",

Tenure track positions have been drying up for some time; they've become much more difficult to find in the past decade - regardless of field, though Humanities, Social Sciences can be most difficult. It is even worse if you are in a more niche field, such as theology.\n\nUniversities have been turning to more adjuncts, most of whom have only MAs with some work towards a PhD (or two MAs). Pays less, no strings attached. PhDs can get these positions, but why? Often times now, a PhD makes positions *harder* to find because they are intimidating and employers are often afraid they'll be plucked up by a better job (that doesn't exist).\n\nOnline education is exploding. Someone with an MA can design a course, sell it... and have it taught en masse with thousands of students. It's opening a lot of new avenues for people to receive education - and more specialized certifications as well. Again, PhDs aren't the most likely to succeed here - they cost too much, compared to qualified MAs. \n\nAll this means universities are increasingly turning to research - and are shedding students (though this trend is only beginning). Money is dissipating (this has been going on for some time). They're working with private and public agencies - seeking highly esteemed, bit name 'professors' who 'teach' a class using a group of TAs.\n\nAll in all, I hate to say it (I wanted to teach; eventually left a PhD program earning myself a second MA, so two in the social sciences - makes me as competitive as a PhD for a lot of teaching positions now. \n\nOverall, the job market is awful - even before the pandemic. Especially in humanities. \n\nIt isn't just that there is no good incomes to have, it's that the positions are few, highly competitive and less focused on teaching than used to be the case. \n\nIt is sad - there is something unique about actually being in the classroom - online courses can be effective, but they lack some... je ne sais quoi.",

Start talking to potential advisors very soon--find the best schools and people for your interest area, and ask bluntly about placement (though see below, the game is changing again). \n\nWhere I teach we're mid-tier R1, and at 5 years post PhD we had (2018) nearly 50 percent of our grads with full time or TT positions. That was better than we expected, but still appalling. You need to work very hard to develop an unusual quality that will make you stand out, but even then it's a ton of luck too.

So this was a lot like your 'placement driven by 6-10 faculty members,' but reduce that number to 3-5.  It also allowed us to increase pay a little (too little) and assure that every grad is fully funded for at least six years (four for MA-PhD).  We could not in good conscience do otherwise, and it still doesn't feel like it's enough.  That five-year mark is important, too, because we had zero PhDs land a full-time or TT academic job in their first year on the market.  We got some one-years, and a few had fellowships, but no hires straight out of the gate.  We continue to follow the philosophy but we're much more direct about it with students.  Now, we produce maybe 2 PhDs a year at most; before 2000, I understand it was at least twice that.\n\nI agree that it will be disruptive.  We're being saddled with pay cuts, and our worry is that it won't be used to save existing jobs or support continuation of benefits, but to hire cheaper substitutes.  We'd feel better if our Board of Governors wasn't made up entirely of business figures famous for outsourcing because their first instinct in any crisis is to cut labor no matter how hard it will be to get that caliber of researchers and teachers back later.  I hope I am wrong, but we are being very watchful.",

The three authors did an analysis of three very disparate fields - history, computer science, and business - and used a network-based analysis to look at over 19,000 placements across those fields.\n\nAcross those three fields, they found that 25 percent of institutions produced between 71 and 86 percent of all tenure-track faculty in those fields.\n\nThe authors used several different analyses to show the inequality within the system, but I think this paragraph is one of the standouts that really illustrates it: \n\n>Strong inequality holds even among the top faculty producers: the top **10 units produce 1.6 to 3.0 times more faculty than the second 10, and 2.3 to 5.6 times more than the third 10.** ...Under a meritocracy, the observed placement rates would imply that faculty with doctorates from the top 10 units are inherently two to six times more productive than faculty with doctorates from the third 10 units. The magnitude of these differences makes a pure meritocracy seem implausible, suggesting the influence of nonmeritocratic factors like social status. \n\nI think it's pretty well-established that graduates of top-ranked doctoral programs have better chances on the academic market than those who went to less well-reputed programs (deserved or not). The size of the inequality varies by field, of course, as fields in which there is lots of industry demand for researchers will probably be less competitive. But it's still there - these authors chose (deliberately, I'd bet) two fields where doctoral degree holders very frequently work outside of academia.\n\nOf course professors who went to lower-ranked programs do still get faculty jobs - but generally speaking, they have a narrower set of options from which to choose in the first place.",

              "text": "I will say this:\n\nIf you are a total badass, and at the top of your game, the PhD track is still worthwhile with the goal of a professorship. It won't be tenure-track, and it won't have the same old-school job security, but there are jobs out there. But you have to be one of the top 1% of the top 1%.\n\nPeople with a PhD from Yale, Princeton, Duke, Notre Dame, et al., cannot land jobs. It's only the ultra top-of-the-top-of-the-top candidates who are considered. There's an entire ocean of candidates who apply to every opening, and you're even competing against people who not only have top-tier PhDs, but also have many years of teaching experience from prior departments, etc.\n\nThe master's is worth it, but even then, I would extremely strongly recommend an M.Div. rather than any M.A. or M.T.S. The MA/MTS track is preparation for PhD work, while the M.Div. can dual-function as both preparation for a PhD and/or equip you with tools for ministry.\n\nWhen people in academia talk about working in the academy or taking a job in \"the private sector,\" for us that means church work. The M.Div. will give you those extra tools and qualifications that you'll need to make it worthwhile.\n\nIf you're unmarried and without kids, et al., and the PhD is interesting enough in its own right, then you could still pursue it. Just don't get swept away in it consuming your identity, and you \"MUST\" be a professor, etc. I have a colleague who has a PhD and has been adjuncting *full-time* (just below the legal limit) for many, many, many years. It's exploitative, and it's the direction all institutions are going now. It's cheaper to hire an Uber-Lyft-professor (adjunct) than a real professor.\n\nAlso: In theology, you can look for jobs both at universities as well as seminaries. The problem with seminaries, though, is that the church in the U.S. is in decline, and seminaries are dying. Small institutions are closing shop, churches are closing, big institutions are expanding online programs, etc. Even pastors are having to have side-jobs in order to make ministry sustainable, because churches can't always support a pastor salary, etc.\n\nI know this all sounds doom-and-gloom, but it's just to give you realistic expectations. You can still have a perfectly fulfilling and great role in this field, etc. I'd be happy to chat more, as well. (Discord, etc.)",
