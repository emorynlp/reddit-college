  "title:": "Deans, department chairs, and others who have dealt with grievances against faculty: what is the most ridiculous complaint someone has made against a professor in your department? What did you think silently to yourself and how did you actually respond?",
  "text": "In asking this, I don't mean to disparage legitimate complaints about biased, abusive, harassment-prone, absent, incompetent, or otherwise unprofessional faculty. But I know a lot of academics have stories about a student with a completely ludicrous complaint or a time when something entirely innocuous got escalated to a higher administrative level. I'm thinking of emails to the department head or Dean that say things like: \"I didn't turn anything in all semester for no apparent reason and my professor won't accept an entire semester's worth of late work on the last week of the term!\" or \"My professor said the word 'shit' in class once and I think she should be fired!\" or \"My son's professor said he won't tell me my son's grade on the final exam because of some stupid privacy law!\" or \"My colleague insists on playing music while working in their office!! How can I get anything done with Britney Spears blaring in my ears all day?? I hate them and want them banned from the building!! Btw I am too shy to ask them to turn it down or use headphones, so they may have no idea this is even an issue\" or \"I AM INVESTIGATING THE THEFT OF A PEN FROM THE COPY MACHINE ROOM -- PLZ BAN GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM USING THE COPIER UNTIL THE CULPRIT IS APPREHENDED!\"\n\nSo, what are your stories? How did you actually handle the situation? What did you really think/how do you *wish* you could have responded?",

      "text": "I'm a chair...once had a pair of parents send a letter directly to the college president accusing one of my colleagues of \"not inspiring\" their son. Who was flunking out because he rarely went to class and didn't turn in much of the work the entire semester. But of course the president's office sent it to me for a response-- because they were donors. The letter was two pages of single-spaced text but it simply boiled down to \"you should fire this professor because our son told us he wasn't inspiring enough.\" We passed it around the department and framed a copy for the faculty member in person.\n\nI replied with a short note that basically said \"Please talk to your son about the choices he is making in life.\"",

      "text": "I teach in South Korea. So this story is all too real but never thought it would happen to me.\n\nI got an urgent email from my department head explaining that a mother went up to the president\u2019s office on the main campus and threatened to sue the school if I don\u2019t pass her son who is a senior and must graduate!\n\n(I should mention here that in South Korea 2nd semester senior have a lot of leniency for grades if they have a full time job. Long story short - this helps the university with getting in new freshman and looks real good for points with the Ministry of Education.)\n\nOf course, I immediately contacted my department chair and scheduled a meeting. I brought all the student\u2019s information, notes, grades from the current semester and last fall semester (when he failed miserably).\n\nAt the meeting, I explained I have a detailed, signed and dated contract with this student because he has a full time job and it is backed by the government and university. But he still must take the midterm, final exam and complete any and all homework assigned. He is excused from class attendance only. We both have original signed and dated copies.\n\nWhen my department chair read the contract, she just paused. She asked me- so what is the problem? I said, well he has never turned in any homework and he never showed up or contacted me about the midterm. So currently, he is failing.  I sent him an email to the registered email in the system explaining this and have no idea how or why his mom knows.\n\nShe called the president\u2019s office and it was clarified that the mom didn\u2019t show up, it was a phone call. Nobody was able to get ahold of the student. Just the mom. So they assumed I must be doing something wrong.....\n\nCome to find out not only did the student fail my class last fall but also winter term too. I taught the fall term and my colleague the winter term. \n\nI called my colleague and he said that the student never showed up to any class or exam, never replied or contacted him, so he failed him flat out. \n\nSo my department head then tried to contact the student with no success. After another 20 more minutes the student finally called back. He said he wanted to fail and already talked to his boss about taking the class again.  He has no idea why his mom called. He never told his parents and didn\u2019t want to embarrass himself again. He also was too embarrassed to contact me.\n\nCome to find out, the email provided for the student is accessible to the mom. So when she read my email explaining he was failing, she freaked out! Assumed her kid could not possibly fail a class 3 times in a row!\nOf course the mom never even talked to her son. \n\nIn her mind - It is his third time taking this class and its obvious the school and professors are against the son and don\u2019t want him to graduate!\n\nSo after all that, it was just a misunderstanding....\n\n\nSeriously! I was so pissed. I drove all the way back to campus for this. Sigh.....",

The advent of the internet as a crowd-sourcing hive mind wasn\u2019t realized until things like social media came about. Once that happened, the younger generation (then-millennials) had already been primed by popular media to identify gays and lesbians as sleek, cool, rebels who lived independent from \u201cthe system\u201d (Will and Grace, Queer as Folk, New Normal, Happy Endings, Glee, that one gay guy in every early 2000s sitcom who was *astonishingly* stereotypical)\u2014not to mention gay celebs in the spotlight (Ellen, NPH, David Hyde Pierce, Adam Lambert, Broadway actors\u2014like *all* the broadway actors).

It's easier to hate, fear, and believe negative stereotypes if the target of your bigotry is some unfamiliar other out there; it's harder to maintain that bigotry when you realize that the targets of that bigotry include your uncle, your nephew, your sister, your daughter. Of course, plenty of family members react badly when someone comes out to them, but even when the initial reaction is ugly, they may eventually make the journey to acceptance. Coming out seems to especially make an impact on people who were only casually bigoted or ignorant. In a sense, then, the cascade of tolerance in the 2000s is partially a product of the seeds planted by radical queer activism of the 1970s and 1980s coming to fruition, as younger generations followed their example of pride and openness rather than hiding who they were.",

      "text": "Leaving aside those genuinely affected by mental illness, the following comes to mind. As per the example in OP, a student last year decided to submit all his assessment months after it was due, having ignored the previous emails from course coordinator. She rejected it, telling student he would fail. Student emails program director with some story (doesn\u2019t copy course coordinator), who then contacts course coordinator. He finds out full story, so says, sorry you\u2019ll fail. Then student emails teaching dean (me) for our faculty, forwarding (half) an email chain from course coordinator claiming she failed to respond to his emails. Student claims didn\u2019t know when assignments due, he\u2019s part time, it\u2019s not fair etc. I email other staff, find out truth. Student fails. None of this is an official appeal as student presumably knows there are no grounds. \n\nStudent is now repeating course. The first assignment due date was three weeks ago. Course coordinator emails student asking whether they\u2019re planning to submit, and copies both program director and me in. Student emails back saying he wasn\u2019t sure how to submit assignment, as though this is the first time he\u2019s ever been asked to do it, instead of being a final year student. Apparently he\u2019s still too special to have to follow the same rules as everyone else, or bother to ask if he genuinely doesn\u2019t know.",

The transmitter type we were discussing was a \"vaginal-implant transmitter\" used for located deer fawns after being birthed. I'm not really sure what other word he could have used, and the diversity of transmitters and wildlife tracking devices are many, so he was just trying to expose us to as many as possible.\n\nA student complained to the dean so the professor had to go have a brief sit-down and discuss the situation and the absurdity of it all.",

At a conference, someone came up to him and asked him \"where is your harem?\".\n\nI posted this story a while back, and someone on this sub was *defending* this position, saying that the optics of having three women in your group as a middle-aged male professor makes it look like you are a pervert.",
