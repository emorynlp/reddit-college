  "text": "I've seen a lot of people on here ask questions that they should really be asking their advisors/professors because those are the people that you're working with/ being evaluated by. I'm not saying this because I think you're asking the wrong questions, I'm saying this because you might be getting good answers that still don't work for your situation. \n\nIt's also good for you. Especially in Grad school or those looking to enter grad school, you need to learn to build relationships with the faculty and communicate about what the expectations for projects, comps, publishing, etc. I've seen students struggle because they failed to ask the important questions of their advisors and then did things incorrectly. Don't let that be you! Always manage your expectations with the faculty you're working with. ",

Then leave. \n\nReally, that's it. Stay for 5 minutes, not 30. When the conversation is done, be on your way.\n\nYour faculty *really do* want you to come by. And then they also want you to leave. :)\n",

      "text": "I did an experiment one semester: a 5-10 minute office hours visit could count for a few points of credit. Talk about class, life, cats, anything; just come by. About 2/3 of the class took me up on it. Had a lot of conversations about life and cats that semester, and a few great ones about random interesting psychology stuff that wasn't part of the class. \n\nFinal average for the whole class (not counting the extra credit) was significantly higher than prior semesters. \n\nThere are so many little questions students forget to ask, or think aren't worth asking, but they will if they're in my office anyway. Sometimes it's one of those hand on the doorknob \"oh, and one other thing...\" Come by just to say hello and you will end up getting more out of it than you expected. ",

      "text": "As a current Master student I cannot STRESS how important this advice is. I know literally every faculty member in my department and have built positive relationships with them, even those whom I\u2019ve never had class with. \n\nThis is not an exaggeration, EVERY SINGLE opportunity I have been give is solely because of the faculty in my department and the rapport I have with them.  They are the reason I\u2019m a Master student right now. And if I do end up in a PhD program, I know they will be the reason I\u2019m there. So little of what I\u2019ve got on my CV, I feel, is because I\u2019ve done anything particularly spectacular. Rather, the opportunities and mentorship I\u2019ve received from the amazing faculty have given me the skills and know-how to navigate and obtain opportunities and CV-builders. No one knows this stuff coming into school. It\u2019s the educators who help you. So I urge any students reading this to not be afraid to ask for help, say hi, and build rapport. Even if you don\u2019t have strong rapport, if you have questions about the field, ask the professor who\u2019s class you\u2019re taking! They already have office hours for their students, use that time!  ",

      "text": "I feel like this varies from field to field. At my institution, professors in Computer Science, especially those with \"big\" names, have little time for undergrads and some did not even answer emails. They teach large classes with 200-900 students (many of which are recorded so some students they just never see) and advise large labs. One prof even rejected an invitation to a student event because there wasn't an audience of at least 300, and therefore not worth his time. As a result, students have a harder time developing faculty-student relationships compared to students in other fields. I found it easier to ask questions anonymously on the Internet or befriend professors in neighboring departments. ",

And I've gotten *many* questions that were answered on the syllabus.\n\nI don't think I'm an outlier in either of those experiences.\n\nCertainly, like other professors, I get tired of answering questions that are addressed in the syllabus. I wish more of my students would read the damn thing. Occasionally I'll gripe or joke about it with friends, and even more occasionally on a forum like this. I think that's quite common (honestly, a little too common, in my view).\n\nBut, it's a long bridge that goes from griping about student behavior to actually being an asshole to students. Sure, a few professors cross that bridge. And that sucks. But most never do or will. And that's important.",
