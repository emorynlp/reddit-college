  "text": "How do you all deal with lousy colleagues who always promise to dedicate the amount of time a project requires and sound \u201ceager\u201d to collaborate, but never deliver? The typical: \u201cI\u2019ll get you those results by Friday\u201d but then go radio silence for weeks and delay the project. I know finding good collaborators can be complicated, but getting tired of giving yet another chance to colleagues that continuously show lack of commitment to projects",

Do you have an updated date?\u201d Again, you don\u2019t want this to be you dictating a date, but collaborating with them on a date. \n3) If they go through multiple rounds of this, or they just don\u2019t update you at all, they may not be compatible with your research style. Discuss your issues with their work them, let them know you\u2019re going to demote them in the author list for this paper if there are other authors (don\u2019t remove them), and then never work with them again if you can help it.\n\nEdit: FWIW the last time I worked with someone like this, I also found their section of the paper was extensively plagiarized, so you might want to run their written contributions through TurnItIn (make sure to uncheck \u201csave to paper repository\u201d) just in case.",

              "text": "For me, same as with a student. First time, I give them some leniency in case it\u2019s legit (and for research I try to assign deadlines at the start that can afford such leniency). But if it keeps happening, well then they have to learn to come up with alternatives when this stuff happens. \n\nFor example, I actually make my online students come up with a technology backup plan in the first week of the class, and I share my own as well. (Note to self: do this for my remote students in the fall.) If my desktop computer explodes, I can use my laptop, my partner\u2019s laptop, or heck my cellphone at a lower level. If my internet service dies I can use cellphone tethering, or in normal times I could go to a library or Panera Bread with free WiFi. If your coauthors do keep having internet problems, go over this sort of thing with them. \n\nRegarding personal issues everyone\u2019s going to be less productive during a pandemic (family illness or deaths, providing childcare, etc.), but also many external deadlines are being pushed back. Work with your coauthors to set new deadlines, and if you need to, do the therapist thing: ask them what barriers they see to completing that goal, and ask them to give you a couple plans for how to get past that barrier. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important though to understand when the deadlines we (first authors) make are arbitrary. If we\u2019re just trying to get a paper out the door ASAP, with no specific deadline (like for a special issue of a journal), we can afford to give our coauthors a bit more time if they need it \u2014 so long as they\u2019re not making a habit of missing deadlines, and/or we have reason to believe they\u2019re making progress towards the goal.",

For example I am collaborating on a project with some Master's students. They are working on it as part of their final thesis from their parents homes (due to COVID). I work as a researcher full time in a foreign country and get to the project work after coming home typically after 8 pm. At the very start I said I would be able to send reports only on weekends. But repeatedly they have shown displeasure with me not answering or going on \"radio silence\" on weekdays. They have gone far enough to bad mouth me to the prof leading this work. The prof thankfully understands my predicament and gave me credit for contributions and insights I made to the project till date. \n\nTl;dr different people lead different lives.
