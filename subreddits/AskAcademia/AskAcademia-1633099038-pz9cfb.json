  "text": "I'm from China. got a bachelor's degree of Financial Management from a Chinese university.  However, my interest is in educational studies, especially in early childhood education. Then I went to University of Sydney for Master of Education (coursework).\n\nNow I'm a children's book editor in a Chinese publishing company. I always want to do academic research in education actually. Am I qualified to apply for Ph.D. in the educational field in European countries' universities? I really want to learn their educational system and methods, especially in north europe.\n\nMy GPA was not good in master of education, 72%. Bachelor-83%.\n\nI don't have journals or thesis. Just had some research proposal and master dissertation.",

      "text": "You can apply in the sense that you fulfill the formal requirement by having a Master of Education degree from a university they will recognize.\n\nBesides that, you have to realize that European countries are very heterogeneous in their university systems, especially when it comes to PhD programs. One university might have additional access rules while another has barely any. One challenge you might face is that in some European countries a good portion of research in the educational sector is done in the local language, not in English.",
