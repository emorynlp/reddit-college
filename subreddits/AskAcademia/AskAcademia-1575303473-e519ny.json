  "title:": "Mentioning being a stripper during undergrad in grad school personal statement --- Inappropriate or no?",
  "text": "Hi, I'm applying to social work programs and this is something I've been grappling with for awhile. **To clarify, I'm talking about for a \"personal history statement,\" asking about my experience or understanding of the challenges facing underrepresented/underprivileged communities.** For most of my apps so far, I've chosen to not mention the fact that I stripped during undergrad to support myself. But, as I'm doing my personal statement for UC Berkeley's Social Welfare PhD, I've started reconsidering since I know Berkeley tends to be very liberal and accepting of students who have backgrounds that may be controversial. Also, I think it is relevant to things I have come to understand about social work.\n\nI was hoping to get some advice/opinions on whether this is totally inappropriate or could be beneficial if worded correctly. Of course, I don't plan to center my whole statement around it, but just mention it where relevant. Thanks!",

There are a number of ways to go with that section of the personal statement; I doubt this is the only experience you can use. Your GPA and letters of recommendation carry more weight. \n\nDon\u2019t make yourself memorable in a way that draws concern. The fact that you were an adult entertainer wouldn\u2019t concern me, but the fact that you used something potentially controversial in a professional setting would concern me. In my department\u2019s gatekeeping process we identify over sharing as a mark of concern; it is a boundaries issue.",

Even so, applications are a time when you want to protect yourself from things people could bring against you, so if you have other options it's probably best to avoid mental health issues. \n\nAs far as oversharing, I would say it depends. If the question is about adversity and the basis for your adversity was your mental health (preferably something clearly identifiable) then it seems to me it would make sense. But if it's more of a result of a hard situation, then that might be more oversharing. For example, if the adversity you faced was your dad dying and you struggled with mental health after that, that may be not be the best approach. That's sharing your inner emotions in a place that's not really the best for it. \n\nBut if the issue were, for example, ADHD, and you trained yourself in techniques to overcome that difficulty and get medication, etc. Then that would be appropriate. \n\nThe second would demonstrate a good ability to overcome adversity and not overshare something too personal, while the first, even if there was more to the story and you got through it, would not show that as much and would be a very personal thing. \n\nI hope my distinction makes sense, and of course, I should mentiond that others will probably see this differently.",

She could frame it as lack of privilege just as effectively, for me, then outlining exactly what it is. And again, the main thing is what perspective this has given her.\n\nFor you I think being a veteran is a plus, and cynically I would be sure to mention it, but I would focus on the lessons and perspective that you gained from that experience instead of sharing too much about what you actually did. If you are applying for military history I would think a great angle would be that you know something about what military history doesn't tell us. Maybe you have an idea to add in the human factor in a new way, or something, based on your experience (just spitballing here).",

This has little to do with whether these professors or students are accepting of sex work on a theoretical level, and more to do with whether one of the less ethical members of the department might see your history of sex work as a sign that you might be open to their advances.
