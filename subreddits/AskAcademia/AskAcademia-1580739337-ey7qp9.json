  "text": "I used to be a work-for-the-deadline kind of student, but I think I'm getting too old (and too tired!) to pull all-nighters like an undergrad. I'm hoping to establish a regular study schedule - about *X* many hours of reading or writing per day, regardless of what papers are due. But now that I'm an adult, I'm finding it hard to figure out how much time I should dedicate to research vs. taking care of things at home, going to the gym, etc. How many hours do people usually spend working during the week (not including time in classes/meetings)?",

Pay me more. Electricians get overtime pay. \n\nThen I started my PhD with that ethos. Finished in sub-3 years.\n\nNowadays I'm 0830-1630 and generally do fine, although I am open to the university that the more they pile on me, the slightly lower quality they get.",

Students are happy, 3-ish star REF papers are churning away, grants are under review. \n\nI won't be mega-famous but everyone's happy. \n\nI think the trick is not doing everything to the absolute best of your ability, because there's not time. Admin, grants, supervision, undergrad projects, conferences, papers, reviewing, examiner work (etc. etc.) - you have to find the balance of doing something to 'good enough, quick enough'. I think academics are often conscientious to a fault - which is inherently good - but it can stress them out. I saw an early grave if I kept on like that. I found the limit.",

When you're grading ~100 papers on a given week, you learn how to compartmentalize your work life and home life for your own sanity. Work free weekends are important to me.\n\nI do attend some seminars during that time as well, but a standard workday is very achievable in grad school if you stick to a regimen and if you have a reasonable GA assignment.",

That\u2019s the kind of flexibility you need to build into your schedule. \n\nYou also will preserve personal time for the weekends and evenings that way, which especially evenings is garbage time for getting work done due to exhaustion",

First, I dedicate a day to not work at all (Saturday). No emails, no work-related reading, nada. On Sunday afternoons, I'll sit down and look at my weekly schedule of meetings/appointments/etc., and try to write in time blocks of specific tasks - e.g. 1-3 pm Writing; 3-4 pm Presentations. \n\nAnother thing I've done that has helped immensely is that I work on email once first thing in the morning for 30 mins, and once before I leave for 30 min. The rest of the time, I have my mail client offline so I don't get bombarded with bullshit notifications about some notice from some college whatever (or a collaborator who needs something \"as soon as possible\").

However, that doesn't count for the \"non-work\" time in between tracked work, where my day might start at 8am and end at midnight.  I also count social activities as work, because they are.\n\nIn the end though, I strongly recommend keeping some kind of schedule for yourself, in that it allows you to feel productive with the work you've done, and to relax without guilt.  \n\nI personally operate in 30 minute increments, so if i've worked 16/30 minutes, I count it, if not, I don't, on the presumption that it'll balance out, and that I as my own boss will sense when a lot of tiny microworks count up to a 30 min. block.",

The thing about hours worked though is I personally find that a bit of a meaningless metric, as everyone know successful in research knows some days you're on and super productive, and some days you're not.  I've gone as far as recognizing there are times of day I'm more productive than not- I get most of my serious research stuff done after lunch, so before lunch I'm usually checking out papers, scheduling my meetings, etc.  But everyone is different.  As such, I think it's better to look at things with a weekly goal in what you want to do over a daily one.\n\nAlso, be aware everyone over-estimates their hours looking back on things.  In my field a department famously recommended their PhD students should work 80-100 hours a week, based off what professors claimed they'd worked, and they got a ton of flak because that's basically impossible.",

I take two days off a week, one of which I spend doing brainless work in front of the tv like database stuff or making images etc.  Then I work 10-7:30 four nights a week and 11-4 one day.  I also take half hour breaks so it works out to ~40hrs a week.  I take Sunday and a random day in the middle of the week as my \u201coff\u201d days although I only spend one full day not thinking about work.  I don\u2019t track my hours or anything, this is just a schedule I\u2019ve noticed works for me - no early mornings (except for kolloquia) and working later when the lab is quieter.  I get a fair amount of really focused work out of my days so I feel like it\u2019s a fair work life balance.",

I work around 30-40 hours per week, going in on a pretty typical 9-5 schedule most days. Sometimes I'll come in around 8 and leave a little earlier, sometimes I'll come later and leave later. If there is a big deadline to push for, I will work longer or maybe on the weekend. I go to the gym three days a week and take a ballet class twice a week as well, it's very important for my sanity and productivity. \n\nI use the weekends to take care of things at home and work on my hobbies. Unless absolutely necessary, I don't work on the weekends, or even answer emails. My advisor encourages this and does the same thing.",

Weekends are no work, unless there's something very pressing (like a conference submission deadline I've forgotten about). I take a short break (10min) and a longer one (30ish) to walk outside and socialize with other PhDs daily (usually eating lunch at the desk while working, oops!) and I'll do some readings or checking email in the morning before work or after, but that's no more than an hour per day. \n\nI feel guilty sometimes that I'm not working insane hours, but I've noticed that this schedule actually works for me. When I am working, I'm really in the flow and actually working productively. It also helps that my supervisor is really for taking holidays, having a good work-life balance, preventing phd burnout, and discourages weekend work....and I'm not teaching, only supervising students (which takes time, but not a lot of preparation).",

      "text": "I'm a 50+ humanities prof and while I don't pull all-nighters any longer it's still common to see me working until 2-3am a few nights each semester grading. (I'm up at 6:30 most days and on campus by 8:30). It's just due to the cyclical nature of the workload and the patterns of the semester...sometimes a batch of essays simply must be returned by a certain date and other tasks get in the way.\n\nMy workdays/weeks vary wildly though. There are some weeks when I'm really only working about 30 hours, say when I'm not writing, my classes are all prepped, there's no grading, and none of my committees require anything. But there are other weeks-- every single semester --where I am on campus for 12+ hours a day and am working at home as well, so putting in 60-70+ hours. Which sucks, but after 25+ years I've still found no way around it in our campus culture -- that's life at an SLAC with extremely high expectations for teaching/mentoring, plus a huge service burden, plus modest expectations for continuing scholarship. Most of my peers see about the same, exceptions being largely in STEM fields where classes are more routinized and research is supported by many undergraduate assistants...but they tend to work all summer in the labs while I might be off in Alaska fishing and just reading/writing on the side.\n\nDaily: my teaching schedule changes every semester. This spring I'm teaching at 11:00 and 2:00 on MWF and at 8:30 on T/Th.  I'm in the office by 800 every day, and almost always leave by 4:30. But I work at home at night and one weekends about 50% of the time as well, mostly grading and course prep. Most everyone I know eats at their desks. About 1/3 to 1/2 of my work week is spent meeting with students individually; this week I have 12 hours of scheduled meetings related to my classes plus a few other appointments *before* any drop-ins. I might have a day in which I only talk to a couple of students for a few minutes, but tomorrow I have almost five hours of meetings booked to go over drafts. So it varies a lot.",

I will add the caveat that my research is not intensive in terms of data collection (I do online behavioral experiments), so I would probably be closer to 40 if I had regular \"lab work\" to do. I haven't found it necessary to work long hours to get stuff done, it's all about how productive you are when you are working! I'm starting a TT job in the fall and I doubt I will be able to keep up without bumping up my hours though :'(",

I did the constantly in lab till late hours all the time both in my undergrad research and when I was a tech after undergrad and it just burned me out and reduced the overall quality of pretty much everything I produced. \n\nI am a HUGE proponent of recognizing when you\u2019re not going to get any more meaningful work done on a certain day and resting your brain. I also found out in undergrad that all nighters really fuck up my mental health so I don\u2019t do them anymore at all. Rest is an important part of processing and learning.",
