  "title:": "Advice: Handling COVID gaps in employment in CV",
  "text": "Reentering the academic job market after a year+ on the sidelines (Digital arts + new media is my field.)  I won't get into the reasons why I sat out, but I am concerned about a gap in my resume.  In short, I was offered a full-time non-TT teaching post at Uni #1.  This was in early March 2020.  Then COVID hit us all and budgets fell.  The position and programmatic funding were altered.  given that this was cross-country move to an undesirable location, with the funding not there, I declined.  Uni #2 offered a scholar-in-residence appointment around the same time yet, owing to similar pandemicy reasons, the funding was pulled.  \n\nMy concern is whether I should list the offers on my CV.  And, if so, how to word them in a positive light?  An example of such is below.  Any thoughts and insight are most appreciated.\n\n*\"In the Spring of 2020 I was offered a full-time, teaching faculty post to design and launch the newly created digital arts pathway within the visual arts major at XYZ College in 123, 456. Due to COVID, the funding for said position and program was drastically altered and I declined the offer. I am happy to provide documentation upon request\"*  \n\n\n*In the Summer of 2020 I was offered a one-year 4/4 post as scholar-in-residence with the Design department at University XYZ. Funding for said position was subsequently pulled due to COVID related budget constraints. Documentation available upon request.*   \n\n\nTIA for your time and insights, hive mind!",

      "text": "Here (Sweden), they encourage applicants to have a 'pauses' section in their CVs for things like sick or parental leave. I would put a similar section and document it there. I think your text is good enough. \n\nAny hiring committee not being understanding of how COVID-19 affected employment, particularly for ECRs,  is the hiring committee of a department I wouldn't want to work at.",
