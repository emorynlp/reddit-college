  "text": " I am in the library writing my thesis. I am in 3rd year of my PhD and should be able to finish it by next year. I am not sure what is going to happen after that. I feel bored of my topic and also not sure if i am so passionate about it. What would you suggest in such scenario? I don't want to give up my PhD and wish to do good work.",

Make sure you don't miss out anything you have read. Try to meet your supervisor often and discuss your progress or problems you are facing in research. Also please pay attention to your physical and mental health. It is very important. \n  The thing one regrets most in PhD is the time they have lost. So maybe try to write a journal everyday in order to sort out your thoughts. For a PhD scholar life is full of obstacles preventing  from finishing PhD on time. My best wishes for you! :)",

After a few months of struggling to find a new topic, I discovered one website, where they provide you with original topics for a little fee. I was surprised how fast they worked, I just paid and in a few days I got the topics! Of course, I couldn't use those topics as my own, that would be illegal lol, I altered one of them, and I was super satisfied with my new topic. Guys from IvoryResearch, thank you!",
