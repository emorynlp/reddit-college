  "text": "I\u2019m a new doctoral student in physics. I\u2019m at a university ranked in the top 100 globally for the subject, but relatively low (around 80th). My supervisor seems very productive and has an h-index >70. \n\nI chose my university for this supervisor, and turned down another university ranked around 20th in the world for physics. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I made the wrong choice, especially considering that I want to continue on in academia after I get my PhD. Should I have chosen the ~20th ranked university instead?",

I mean, you can generally sort them into like \"top third\" \"middle\" and \"bottom tier\", but if you're trusting anything more detailed than that you're putting way too much trust into analysis based upon largely subjective criteria and weighting, evaluated with incomplete and biased data sets.",
