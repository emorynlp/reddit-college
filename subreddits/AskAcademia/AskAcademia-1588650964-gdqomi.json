If you're university has it, definitely look into counseling options. It does help. I'm more of an off and on user for it haha. Just take a chunk at a time. And don't expect perfection. Practice and revisions take time.",

          "text": "To tag onto the top comment (which I totally agree with!), in addition to general anxiety and counseling advice: anxiety when presented with a task that requires in depth analysis, concentration, and/or focus on minutia is one common symptom of ADHD. I only recently started medicating for mine, which I've known about for years, but had simply been struggling with on my own. Tasks like analyzing data in large spreadsheets, reading large manuscripts with fine details, and editing my own writing would often induce anxiety in me because of my brain's natural difficulty with focusing on the small portions of the larger whole. Learning more about ADHD and medicating has made these tasks vastly more accomplish-able and has greatly reduced my daily anxiety levels.",

A friend of mine gave me this excellent advice: your brain is a baby, baby it. \n\nThat is to say, take it one small step at a time, don't expect perfection, and just put one word in front of the other. As someone very rightly said, revisions take time. Just focus on hitting the word limit. You can fix a summary that's not up to the mark; you can't fix something if there's nothing to fix. Focus on getting *something* on the page that you can fix later. \n\nGood luck!",
