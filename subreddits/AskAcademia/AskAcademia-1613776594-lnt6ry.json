  "text": "\nI hear so many graduate school horror stories and I feel like those are the majority. Are there people who enjoyed their PhD experience? Had a good work life balance ? Did not overwork themselves to exhaustion? Took most weekends off ? Had good, supportive PIs ? \n\nI started a PhD in 2014 but quit after 2 years and left with my masters because of mental health problems. I\u2019ve been working in industry/ government since then, and I love it but I realized that my true passion is research and I am happiest doing experiments, and want to get back to grad school and apply to PhD programs. I sorely miss being in the lab doing experiments. I\u2019ll be quite a bit older (30-31 when I start) but I\u2019m not too concerned about that, in fact I think my experiences and perspective will help. My scientific skills are better than they were too so I feel ready. However, I\u2019m concerned about the transition to life back in academia, in terms of the lifestyle. Also long term, I\u2019m more inclined to an academic career although most don\u2019t recommend it - I have an open mind for sure but I\u2019ve realised in the 4 years of working in industry that it\u2019s not my thing. \nI\u2019m in USA and my field is biophysics/biochemistry. Many of my friends in Europe enjoyed their PhD experience but I know it\u2019s different in USA. \nI\u2019d love to hear about some good experiences! \n\nTLDR: looking to go back to get my PhD after 4 years in industry, want to hear about positive PhD experiences.",

I barely worked part-time hours, published 13 papers and had two kids during my PhD and I just got a TT job at a fairly famous university with 1 official day as a postdoc between PhD and professorship (none of this in the US though). And to top it off because of the way pay is structured at my university I went from a starting salary of 2400\u20ac/month to 3700\u20ac at the end of my PhD so it wasn't too financially draining either, just took a bit of gaming the system and always thinking of my CV when being presented with opportunities. My dissertation was article-based so the introduction part was only ~100 pages, which I did end up writing in two months while working 12h/day 7 days/week as I needed to submit a few months early because I knew there was a good chance I would get the professorship and they'd need me to have my diploma before the start date. This was the only time I was really stressed.\n\nI've actually been meaning to write a post here about what doctoral students should work on to increase their chances of getting academic jobs.",

I loved the research, enjoyed the company of my labmates, liked my advisors, and was close to my classmates. \n\nI don't think I had good work/life balance. I worked 6 days/week, I generally worked 10-12 hours/day. However, the 'pressure' or motivation to work was entirely self impossed. My advisors constantly told me to take time off and relax. \n\nI think the element that contributed most to 'my success' was that my advisors were extremely supportive of my research, while having virtually no expectations for me (I think my main advisor could afford this mentality due to being a tenured professor). This set the tone for a fun, stressless situation. I was pretty much a kid in a candy store.  \n\nRegarding work/life balance, it helpeeld that I took 1 month off for the Holidays and 2 weeks off in the summer. Advisors supported that and knew not to bother emailing me while I was on vacation.",

I\u2019m not concerned about my age but just wondering what your experience was like in that regard ?

But I think my age, maturity, and experience were actually very helpful for a number of reasons. I knew what I wanted and I know myself and my abilities. I have a strong work ethic and I\u2019m also really comfortable with myself (even if I\u2019m still an anxious perfectionist, but many in grad school are!). My age also may have helped my professors feel more comfortable working with me as a colleague, although I can never be sure of that. I skew a bit younger anyway (I take very good care of myself and make an effort to look good/ professional), but I don\u2019t think age is a detriment. I think I had more hang ups abt it than anyone else, and as soon as I got over this, I realized my age didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t really seem to matter at all in my field. I now have a nice group of scholar friends who are mostly almost a decade younger than me, but it\u2019s not a big deal. I also discovered many ECRs who are close to me in age, but like I said, age barely factors in to any part of my work life. I got so much out of my PhD because I was very well prepared to make the most of my time! Good luck with your studies!",

I think the most important thing is a good, understanding and experienced supervisor who you can be open with. My supervisor has been great and although she pushes us to succeed, there are no crazy deadlines or expectations as she recognises that our mental health is important. She often says that in the end we are here to learn, so it's natural to make mistakes. \n\nI personally keep a work life balance by doing the same hours as my partner. He also has a job with long hours so it works. I'm working longer now as I am writing up but exercise is keeping me sane through lockdowns!\n\nAlso (sounds obvious) but do something you love! It makes it so much easier to self motivate. I've met a lot of PhDs that slog through 4 years because they think the topic is important but the people that are genuinely excited by the area seem to happiest!\n\nGood luck, wish you all the best on your PhD journey!",

I heard he had been on a sabbatical when our year's applicants were being considered and he didn't get any grad students that year. So, he was hostile as hell. He didn't get rid of me and the couple of times he came after me, I'd trot on over to the dean of the grad school and ask whether X was a policy that the chair could put in place and the dean would say no and apparently call the chair by the time I had walked back to the department. The chair hated it and likely hated me, but, oh well! My PI was great; my colleagues were great; I met my eventual wife in the succeeding class. We were doing research at different sites that are part of the community (think zoos and animal parks) and so we'd meet nightly at a local pub as our unofficial daily lab meetings. My PI had (has) a remarkably expansive view of life and is very charismatic and appears regularly in the press in a major city. People like what we were doing and would contact him for community presentations and he'd suggest in the Q&A at the end that people could support what he and the grad students were doing by contributing to his lab. And people would do that because they wanted to support the research we were doing in support of the zoo's mission. The zoo didn't particularly like it because they'd prefer the money came through them and then they'd decide how to spend it on research but my PI was able to balance the conflicting demands of the university and the various sites where we did research. He also negotiated a no-overhead policy for contributed funds to his lab through the university (I brought that same policy to my college when I came here). So, we had just a couple of federal grants over my graduate years and didn't spend that ginormous amount of time dealing with grant issues that I saw in a different lab that I collaborated with. I decided toward the end of my graduate years that I didn't want to be a researcher who taught but rather a teacher who did research and so I looked for teaching positions. I grabbed one 80 miles from my graduate school; I was hired because I could teach in 2 different areas because of my academic background. I continued doing research at a couple of facilities back near my PhD university throughout my career. I collaborated with my old PI and his graduate students throughout my career since my college didn't have grad students. All in all, my PhD experiences (and career!) were great!",

Those moments where you realize you have really become an expert in something are priceless. My last 2 years were all research and I got the chance to travel to lots of cool places for conferences. I was very lucky to work with smart, motivated, and well funded advisors.\n\nI still get to do plenty of research and spend time talking to smart people. But I also have tons of service and much more challenging teaching assignments. So I definitely miss the opportunity to have uninterrupted research/creative time that I had as a PhD student. Life as a tenured professor is so much more of a grind. Of course the pay is 10x so I'm not able to complain. But there are enjoyable things about being a PhD student and I think finding and appreciating those things can help avoid some of the burnout that people experience.",

I imagine I might be working some weekends as I get closer to my defense but that\u2019ll all depend on my own time management skills rather than my PI or anything.

I also had a friend in IT so that I could have a bunch of unauthorized servers running out of the lab (those days are gone).

      "text": "I had a great PhD experience and won the Dean's award for excellence in research and my departmental award for outstanding graduate student.\n\nI took a post-doc in a top lab in my field at a top institution. My post-doc experience, however, broke me and destroyed my love for science and my passion for research. I found out I had been given a bait and switch of sorts on my first day -- everyone I met during interviews had since left and there were no plans to recruit new lab members because the head PI (there were two PIs) had started a new lab in a different country. I spent months trying to replicate work of recent lab members with little success due to nonexistent code and data documentation or archiving practices (and some misconduct that I identified clear evidence of only to have it swept under the rug). My PIs provided no mentorship and repeatedly made empty promises (including informing me only months after signing a contract that they didn't actually have funds for the full duration). I was pressured to use questionable research practices, and my attempts to raise objections were met with offense and rebukes for \"being too negative\". I spent over a year helping my PIs write grants that were destined to fail because the PI who had left and the PI who stayed (both still co-PIs) didn't plan or coordinate and kept making major and sweeping changes up until days before it was due (it was an incoherent wreck). I still published 3 first author papers (leaving me with 14 first author papers at the end of my post-doc), but I developed intractable migraines and IBS, had my well-managed cyclothymic tendencies escalate into full-blown bipolar disorder, and to top it all off, got diagnosed with cancer. \n\nAcademia is a labor exploitation trap that makes money for universities and publishing companies at the expense of the people who do all the work, and it sees you as an expandable source of cheap (or free) labor that it can squeeze dry and then discard. If you come from a low-income family and have student loan debt like I do (and/or chronic medical issues like cancer), then it isn't built for you to be able to succeed. It expects you to be able to have indefinite employment gaps while you tailor long-ass applications to dozens of institutions and wait for (if you're lucky) a response. \"Training\" is a euphemism for \"performing skilled labor on the cheap\". Strong science takes a back seat to good story telling, cutting corners, and charismatic personal brands. There is no correspondence between your effort (or even your productivity) and tangible rewards or career advancement. I had to take a second post doc because despite having 14 first author publications in good journals (even a Cell press paper), even more contributing author publications, and two open source software tools to my name, I only got a single interview out of the many non-short-term-contract academic and industry positions that I applied to over 6 months, and the position was subsequently withdrawn due to COVID.\n\nIf I could burn this whole institution of academic science to the ground, believe me, I would.\n\nIt's all bullshit and it's all broken.\n\nEdit: At the same time, I've seen my wife (who mastered out of our PhD program and took a job at a consulting company) be promoted multiple times and make 1.5x my salary with better benefits and strong job security, all the while accumulating time in a \"real\" (i.e. non-training) role that adds value to her resume.\n\nI'm also not the only person I know who had this type of experience. One of my friends from grad school who also received multiple accolades and dreamed of running his own lab quit his post-doc a year in to become an electrician. The system's fucked and it doesn't care about you, only what it can take from you.",

That was truly fun, and the best part was when I took a workshop from one of the other MFAs. My MFA is translation, so I took a workshop in poetry writing in Spanish, which is one of my languages I translate from. Best decision I made in grad school, just a beautiful and positive experience all around, and I wrote some poetry that I am truly proud of.",

Finished in 3.5 years, was paid sufficiently to live in one of the world's most expensive cities, found a postdoc in the US and my PhD supervisor kept me on as a research associate for a few months to fill the gap. 3.5 years abroad, back in Europe now (also had a good experience with my postdoc).\n\nIt's all swings and roundabouts, though. I wasn't a good academic. Learnt a lot but never really 'played the game'. Not a great publication record and knew I'd never make it in academia. Now in industry, but don't regret anything.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for whoever had a bad PhD and is downvoting this comment and many others describing their positive experience. Pretty sad, really!",

      "text": "I did my PhD in Materials Science at a top 10 (at the time, now top 15, for general reference) ranked university in the US. I first started research with an advisor that was notorious for creating a low quality of life work environment for the grad students. After a certain point, I gathered enough evidence of poor quality treatment (lab examples, email records, etc.), went to our department head and essentially asked \u201cI\u2019m new to this program, is this what it\u2019s supposed to be like as a Grad student or is this Professor treating us all pretty poorly?\u201d It turns out the Professor was treating everyone fairly poorly and I was given the Dept Heads blessing to transfer out to a new group. \nAt that point, I was being funded independently so I had great flexibility in which group I was eligible to work with. During my PhD, I did an internship with industry and my work life balance was literally no different between the two. My professor (now tenured but at the time working for it) consistently left at 5 to spend time with his family. He personally proved to me that, no matter how big or stressful your tasks may be, you don\u2019t need 80 hours a week to do a good job if you use your 40 efficiently. \nYes, there were crunch times, and some weekends I had to come in, but it was not the norm, and for the most part I wanted to be there. \nWhile I was enjoying my time, I saw a few people drop out or leave for various reasons. One was one of our brightest students; he was in the lab I previously left. \nGrad school doesn\u2019t have to suck and if you get a good advisor (asks the same questions you do, has a good reputation with the grad students, etc.) your experience could be wildly different from that of a bad advisor; I probably wouldn\u2019t have finished my PhD if I stuck around the old group. \nIf you can, either bring in your own funding, or do your research before hand to make sure you can land yourself in a good group and I think you will have a much better experience this go around! \n\nGood luck!",

I think that experience will help me. It\u2019s great that you actually brought your supervisor\u2019s treatment of students to the department head. It would take a lot of courage to do that.\nIn a previous masters program at a top institute (a different country), my PI was new and was certainly not a good mentor. She was downright abusive to the point that I had panic attacks and severe depression. I left her lab and quit the program. Turns out that every PhD or MS student she took on, except one, left her lab. Finally 5 years later she ended up with no publications (because she couldn\u2019t retain student) and did not get tenure, and then was fired. Unfortunately this toxic treatment is almost the norm and the rest of the department knew about it but turned a blind eye until they had to fire her for other reasons. In fact there were many like her. These experiences sometimes turn me off. \n\nGlad you had a great experience!",

And also, you are likely in a much better position to \u201cmanage your manager\u201d or have a generally good working relationship with your advisor. \nI think grad school is a lot like giant companies and small businesses, where your experience is going to depend on your direct manager. Much like small businesses and big companies alike, there are some horrible and some great \u201cbosses\u201d in Academia. I hope you don\u2019t feel too discouraged! \nI think if you apply for fellowships beforehand, you could also give yourself the upper hand in being able to pick a good advisor and hopefully have a much better experience! It\u2019s very doable I promise! :)",

You could get in touch with present and former students to get a better idea of that. I hope whatever you choose to do works out amazing for you! :)",
