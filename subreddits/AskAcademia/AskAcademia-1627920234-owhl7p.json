  "text": "One of the frustrating things about grad school is that you don\u2019t know how competitive you will be in the (academic) job market once you graduate before actually graduating and starting to look for jobs.\n\nAs I am approximately a third through my PhD I would like to know how realistic it seems for me to get a permanent academic job after finishing my PhD (and probably some postdoc experience after that) based on my profile so that I can have some realistic expectations.\n\n * Institution: A university in Hong Kong, ranked as one of the top-100 institutions according to the QS rankings\n * Publication: Three peer-reviewed journal articles so far, all first-author and in good journals\n * Teaching experience: Several years of part-time language teaching, but not at the university-level\n * Field: Linguistics\n * Willing to move anywhere in the world for a job\n\nBased on this profile, would you say that I have a chance for a \npermanent academic job (in certain countries at least)? I know that some countries greatly prefer (North-)American degrees, so I would like to know how my chances vary in different countries.\n\nSorry if this is a naive question.",

      "text": "I know how hard it is not to know where you stand and what will happen. It's like entering a black hole and having no idea what's on the other side. But unfortunately, that's how it is. This will be pretty much impossible for anyone here to tell you. The job market will be different in your field then than it is now, and every job is different. Every search committee is different. Some care a lot about \"fit,\" which is really hard to know from the outside. Some care a lot about publications, others care more about teaching, or diversity. The only thing you can do is just do the best work you can, lead a well-balanced, healthy life, and try not to worry about the rest... which is out of your hands.",

With their names and the year and school they graduated, also dissertation title, you should be able to track them down. If you can\u2019t track them down with all of this information, it\u2019s unlikely they are professors in academia. Schools usually keep faculty profiles very public. That will give you some idea how many are pursuing careers in academia.",

I couldn't find information about the remaining nine.",

                      "text": "> Out of fifteen alumni, five of them are now professors in China\n\nAlso, keep in mind that for various reasons, some people pursue PhDs with no intention of becoming professors. The denominator should therefore be fewer than fifteen. I'd talk to someone in an administration role to get a sense of what students in general want to pursue, in addition to talking to the alumni. This all of course has the side-effect of widening your network, which is invaluable in any job search.",

      "text": "This is a great question, not a na\u00efve one! Here's my perspective as someone who is pretty familiar with your field. First of all, it's great that you have three publications in good journals! As for the teaching experience, part-time experience is expected, but it might be nice if you could get some university teaching experience, since search committees often look for this. Lastly, your institution may matter, but it may not. Every committee has their preferences. Here in the U.S., Hong Kong universities are not well known, but if you've done good research and worked with well-known people, you've got a good shot at getting a tenure track job. In sum, I'm optimistic your impressive research record will get you an impressive job, and I would be even more optimistic if you had university teaching experience, which you still have time to get!",

It's certainly not impossible to get a job without this, but those who have it have a huge leg up.\n* Three publications in good journals by a doctoral student would look good by the end of the program, so long as there was also a plan for where the next 2-3 would be coming from\n* We'd want you to have experience teaching the kind of classes you'd be teaching at our institution.\n* You don't mention service. Most of the people we hire out of grad school have been on some committee for their university or professional organization, been involved in mentoring, or something similar.",
