  "text": "I always wanted to pursue a Ph.D (already have a Masters in the US). But I was never able to pull the trigger and sincerely apply to a Ph.D program since basically everyone I know who has a Ph.D became unemployed. They all had grand fantasy that their research was unique and necessary in academia to push its knowledge frontiers, and some hotshot professor in their department of choice would swoop them up and court them into their university. It was like destiny for them.\n\nBut it never happened. Personal friends who graduated from top programs in their field became either an \"Adjuncts\" with no pay or straight up unemployed. This was especially the case with Humanities Ph.Ds. Those from STEM did no better, and I saw many joining coding bootcamps to suddenly change their career to become a programmer that had nothing to do with their original dream of becoming a professor.\n\nI'm scared to wits about this happening to me. Spending 5-10 years commitment to a specialized research only to find that  no one would want me. Has anyone faced this situation? ",

I did some brief (very low skilled) tech work which, tbh, was a little humiliating. \nI ended up travelling internationally for a postdoc. I never really wanted to but i don\u2019t really regret it. Ended up going into industry after that. I could see my career trajectory was not what is required for success in academia. \nI\u2019m quite happy in industry. I feel less stressed about job security/career continuity. \nI hate to say it but I think post-degree employment should e a real consideration for people and some fields have more industry options than others.",

I like how your story challenges that. I know mine will, too. \n\nI think people should ask themselves why they want a PhD or why they want a career in academia. Be critical--is this the right path? Are there more appropriate ways to achieve what I ultimately want? \n\nEven then, I also agree that the PhD experience is transformative! Many people who went in thinking they wanted to be PIs and professors realize a different course suits them better and are glad to find their way.",

But there other options but you need to keep them in mind while you study.  I don't regret getting my PhD but I tried to keep in mind what I wanted next and would my skills translate.  During my postdoc, I had a better idea what I was missing skills wise since I knew I wouldn't go for a professorship so needed skills that I could take to industry mixed with my skills from PhD.  It's never fun to be unemployed.  But taking the time to explore and network is so important that many students and postdocs don't do until they need those connections and it's very late to develop them.  But there are jobs that don't require a PhD and a master's is fine.  And can serve you much better.  It all depends on where you want to end up and being realistic about the challenges getting there.",

      "text": "Academia is NOT the only path for a PhD.  And not every PhD is suited to become a professor.  There are many factors that play towards the final position a PhD gets in one\u2019s career. Namely, publications, data analysis expertise, experimental experience, proposal writing skills, just to name a few. If one does not have a good publication and citation history, perhaps academia is not the best choice, and other sector choices should be explored. The friends you mention are certainly outliers in the universe of PhDs, as it is usually straightforward to find a good paying job for a PhD.  A common mistake is to think that one is only good at what one did during the PhD studies, which is absolutely a big mistake. My PhD was focused in a device for vibration reduction with very special characteristics.  If I start looking for jobs in something related, probably I would end up working at Wendy\u2019s. So tell your friends to open their view when job searching and to be flexible and adaptive to the market.  The diploma says Doctor of Philosophy plain without any speciality. There is a reason for this.  I hope this helps.",

Big, name brand universities with history have alumni in companies (such as Dow, Intel, Corning in materials science) and thus are really good when it comes to employment prospects for their PhDs. For individual big guys, the best answer is to track what their alumni are doing. If all of that professor's alumni are in good companies, or are even professors it's great then.

My work entails teaching, curriculum design, and coordination of TAs. I do quite a bit of professional development for TAs as well. I got this job before defending and then I was on the market for the first 4 years of it trying to go for TT jobs. The market was also-fracking-lately brutal and broke my spine metaphorically speaking. My field is very narrow and I am lucky to just have the job I have. I\u2019m also doing a certificate in instructional design on the side because I never want to be again in the position to desperately look for a job in a dying field with a very narrow credential set that nobody in the real world values or respects. \nMy husband has a PhD in political science and had it worse. Adjuncted for a bit, then did a VAP that led nowhere, then unemployment, and he finally got an entry level corporate job that he hated (with valid reasons, pay and schedule REALLY sucked). He hang in there for a while until he eventually transitioned back in academia as an admin. It wasn\u2019t a walk in the park but now he\u2019s ok. However he could do his current job with a BA.\nIncidentally most of the people I met in grad school are NOT TT professors, at about a 50:2 ratio. Most have transitioned out. Some have landed great alternative jobs while others had to eat some humble pie. I think it depends on the field , but mostly on the amount of strategy thinking ahead. Some humanities people did amazingly well because they had a plan B from the  start. Those who really struggled were  the ones who assumed they would just be professors, then panicked at the end and just tried to waltz in careers for which they had no training or experience. 100% do not recommend.\nGrad school was fun but a gamble I wouldn\u2019t make right now. However back in 2009 right after the recession it seemed a good idea -especially as markets collapsed. Kept me afloat for a few years while I regrouped. I bet that after this COVID-19 recession hits, lots of new graduates will try the same - do a PhD while figuring out what to do with their lives. It makes sense and can work only if you do it with your eyes open.",

You spend those \"5-10 years\" because you're interested in the research and you can't see yourself doing anything else. Depending on what you pick, you can prepare along the way to transition smoothly to an industry job if academia doesn't pan out (which it most likely won't).

It's been 10 month's and nothing. I got down to the final two for a non-tenured teaching position right after graduation but my less than stellar responses to the questions about diversity and inclusion in the classroom cost me. I decided I wanted to shift gears into data science, and made plans to do a 1 year master of data science program starting in September 2021. How's that for intelligent thinking- I can't get a job with three degrees... so I guess I'd better.... go get another one! Anyways, to be eligible for this master's program I had to take two calculus prerequisites. Take two lower-level math classes while I keep hard on the job hunt? Sounds like a breezy couple of months right. Not really, the classes were way harder than I anticipated. Probably because I didn't have the prerequisite to the prequisits... but I was too impatient to go that route.... who needs prereq's when you've got a PhDeeeee right? Well I failed the midterm and had to literally to go full steam ahead with all my energy just to keep my head above water. Nothing bursts your post-PhD bubble like getting a 55 in Math 100. But who cares right, I passed the class, and I have a PhD, so I should be on easy street until September when I'll start my one little victory lap of a masters program and then my career will be off like gangbusters, no big deal, just a forgettable 18 month delay that i'll be able to pontificate over to my students when they need a lesson in resiliance. I'll be able to gently scold them that sometimes in life we have hiccups and it's important we learn from them. Well... I didn't get into the program. T'was a bit of a kick in the balls to be honest. On that same day I found out that the undergraduate co-op position I'd gotten down to the last two on went to the other person. So needless to say i'm in a bit of a weird place right now. Mostly cringing at the blythe and dismissive attitude I had for five years about the realities of the post-graduation job market. I always chuckled and said yea it looks tough, but you know, that sort of thing will never happen to meee- I'm too smart and brilliant and any faculty would be lucky to have me. I fell hook line and sinker for that story line. I'm coming to the point where I just consider the PhD a sunk cost and not to go throw good years after bad trying to justify my decision to get a doctorate and thus reclaim those years from the nothing pile. I'm about a week away from pulling the trigger on a standing job opening at a woodchip plant near by. Won't have f all to do with my 7 years of graduate education but at least you get to drive big trucks and sometimes a little tugboat. I honestly don't know whether it's better to put down my degrees or just pretend they don't ask about the 8 year blank spot on my resume and zero in on how thoroughly I nailed the screening criteria. grade 12 education? check ability to lift 20 pounds? hah! try 40! Check and check. So anyways, how bout that coronavirus hey?",

          "text": "One of the things I often hear people say is \"...well, how old will you then if you *didn't* get the PhD?\"\n\nI mean...I think it just depends on what you want to do and how content you could be doing something else. You're probably already aware that museum roles are very competitive, and that the likelihood of ending up either in academia or a museum role is probably small even at a top program. So knowing that - how passionate are you about it? How badly would you feel if you never gave yourself a shot at it? And how bitter would you be if you tried and decided (or were forced to decide) that Plan B is a better option?\n\nThe truth is, though, the unemployment rate is low for PhDs. Yes, some of that is taken up by people who adjunct, or are in postdocs or VAP positions - but it's low even when you move a few years out from graduate school. Most doctoral degree holders can find something to do that pays their bills and doesn't make them want to pull their hair out. The question is - do you want to take a chance and spend 6-8 years studying for the PhD for the outside chance of becoming a professor or a museum curator? Will you be restless unless you give it a shot?",

Even in a boring office job, you should be able to get a slightly more interesting office job once you have a PhD. \n\nThat being said, I am fully funded and didn\u2019t take a paycut from my last job to my stipend.
