  "title:": "Is writing reviews a good way to get published for someone with virtually no experience and resources?",
  "text": "I've recently finished my masters in neuropsychology and I would like to become a researcher in the future. However, I'm struggling to get a position at a lab or university and I'm already feeling the famous \"pressure to publish\". I'm already working on trying to publish my thesis, but I'm also thinking of how I will publish in the future.\n\nMy field of interest is quite niche and very scarcely researched where I live in. I personally know less than a handful of people interested in it, so far. Doing actual experiments in this topic is completely impossible right now, outside of, say, observational studies using surveys, but even then I'm not in a position to get such a study funded.\n\nAll I can think of is reviews. These I can do on my own at home and all it requires is my own brain and time. Even finding a corresponding author somewhere for a systematic review seems more feasible.\n\nI'm not trying to find an \"easy way\" of doing things, rather something I can do with what I currently have that will get me published. Is this a realistic way of seeing things?",

      "text": "It is possible.  The hard part is that in many fields reviews are written by established experts, usually after they have done a lot of independent publishing.  In some cases, they have to be invited. \n\nDoes your field do meta analysis? That would be a more accepted option for non funded research but again depends on your field.",

Maybe he or she had a big run and did a lot of groundbreaking work back in the day but haven\u2019t had the resources lately to continue.  \n\nRead a dozen of their papers. Find their most recent review\u2014these people write a lot of reviews. They will cite themselves in said review.  Go read a few of those papers.  Now you are ready.\n\nMeet with this person. You want to collaborate and write a review with them. Have a related topic or area in mind and a writing sample.",
