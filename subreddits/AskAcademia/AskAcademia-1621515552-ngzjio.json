  "title:": "Losing hope in a successful academic career",
  "text": "This is my first post in Reddit. Not sure how to start. Let me start with some context.\n\nI always was the top student in my class, after graduation I got a lot of academic awards in my home country (even from the government) for having the best academic records in the country (all them with nice cash prizes attached), I finished my PhD in 3.5 years (working like hell) with about 10 journal publications (most of them top journals) and almost 20 conferences (many of them quite good as well). I got my first and only postdoc job before graduating from my PhD, and two years later I finally got my first academic job in the UK as assistant professor in a Russell group university. So far so good.\n\nI have now been between 5-10 years in this department (not saying the exact number for privacy reasons), got a promotion to associate professor a couple of years ago. I have got several grants (some of them from prestigious funders, the other successfull applicants being from Oxford and Cambridge) and have done ok in publications. However I feel like the \"good luck\" (if I can call it that way) is coming to an end and I don't see good prospects for the future because of the following reasons:\n\n\\- There is little to no support from the department. We don't get any PhD scholarships to recruit PhD students. The only way I got one (1) PhD studentship from my department all this time was conditioned on a grant application being successful, which thankfully was, and I still had to request additional funding from the grant budget to give a stipend to the PhD student. All my other PhD students have been self-funded (and I got two of them because they were neglected by their supervisors and came to me to take them, which I had to do as I didn't really have many options to choose from).\n\n\\- I only have two PhD students now and won't have any other next year. I don't have money to recruit any PhD students so I can only accept self-funded students. Good self-funded students will go to USA or other higher ranked universities in UK. I only get odd emails from poor candidates who lack even basic skills from undegraduate level.\n\n\\- Despite trying to work hard in research, getting grants, papers in top journals, being editor in good journals, organise workshops and other staff, I have been overloaded with teaching and admin duties, way more than any other colleague in my department, some of them who have less than half my teaching load. I have talked to the HoD about this and in the last two years I had to keep going with my heavy teaching load under the promise of being the last year. The next academic year will be again \"the last year\" (for the third time) before my teaching and admin load decreases. This year there was an opportunity to get a course in my area of research (all my teaching is outside my area of research, to make things worse) and the course I wanted was given to another academic staff in HoD's own research group. I feel unfairly loaded, doing roles in the department that have historically been for staff in teaching and scholarship track (I'm in teaching and research track according to my contract, but effectively working as T&S). Teaching load is extremely unfairly distributed (we can see each other's courses online). All my research has been done in evenings, weekends, and holidays, so effectively unpaid labour, and even in these conditions I have done better in research than other colleague with lower teaching and admin load. I have been unable to explore other research topics I liked because I couldn't find time to read a paper, so I have been working too long in the same research are, now kind of outdated... I have started to think that the HoD doesn't like me for some reason (I can think of a few reasons but I won't say them here because then it would be easy to identify me) and this may be the result of some kind of conspiracy from HoD against me.\n\nSo here I am, with a huge teaching load, no time to do research under good conditions and with no PhD students and any prospects of having anything that looks like a research group. I wonder whether is there anything I have done wrongly, or simply I have had bad luck, or maybe this is just the norm, or maybe the unfair treatment of a HoD for some reason.\n\nI came to academia because I wanted to do research, but I not only didn't get any support for this (despite having promising potentials to succeed) but also got obstacles from the department in the form of an unfair heavy teaching load. I look at colleagues in other places and feel like I'm well behind all them after so many years of suffering this huge teaching load. I have now lost all kind of motivation to even get up from bed every day and read/reply to my emails (mostly from some of my more than 300 students that I teach).",

          "text": "Makes sense to be. The Academic career trajectory is going from active researcher (peaking during PhD) to becoming a supervisor for the next generation. So as soon as you get your PhD, other responsibilities take over, reducing your research load because you are now on track to becoming a group leader, which is just a supportive role.  \nIn industry in the other hand you get hired exclusively to get research done. You might also go on a leadership track, but it's not your only option, they also love having specialised researchers.\n\nI personally think Academia would absolutely benefit from offering more career tracks, but I guess as long as you can milk one guy for literally doing at least three jobs there won't be much incentive to instead hire three specialists.",

We would be much better off if there were permanent jobs for people who actually do their own research instead of universities expecting all of their faculty to be group leaders. Of course, this is unlikely because they can hire one person with the expectation that this person acquires third-party funding and uses it to hire a bunch of people that the university doesn't have to pay for.",

The demographic downturn in students of traditional college age has hit many universities extremely hard, and many departments are now shrinking instead of growing - and not even replacing retired faculty. My department hasn\u2019t been able to hire anyone in close to a decade, even though we\u2019ve had multiple retirements.\n\nSee the OP\u2019s response below for more perspective (e.g., even if you are one of the lucky ones who finds work elsewhere - and has a life situation that lends itself to moving - the grass isn\u2019t necessarily greener). I hate to be gloomy, but the sad truth is that this is not the best of times to be in academia, and definitely not the best of times to be aiming to enter it. \n\nI wish you the best of luck though, and I also sympathize (and empathize) with the OP.",

Quite a few people in this department have left in this time I have been here - the most recent one extremely productive in grants and research publications who is leaving after almost 20 years without getting professorship.

However there is no guarantee that moving somehwere else is going to improve things as you don't really know what you are going to find in another place until you are there - and I don't think things are much better in other UK universities. In addition to the fact that academic jobs don't get offered very often, tend to be in very specific areas (high probability of not matching your profile) and are highly competitive (140 other people applied to my position). Now I feel I'm behind where I should be and that would put me in disadvantage with other candidates.

R1 schools usually have profs teach 2 classes a semester so you have (theoretically) 50% of your time free for research. \n\n[You can also buy your way out of teaching through grants, where the grant pays the school to hire someone else to teach one of your classes so you have more time for research. \n\nThis is pretty common, to the point where my department put its foot down and said that certain undergrad classes HAD to be taught by a prof (not a Ph.D student) from the department because there were like 10 years in a row where undergrads were all taught by Ph.D TAs or post-docs because everyone kept buying their way out of classes.]\n\nInstitutions where profs aren't expected to do much research teach 3-4 classes per semester, but they also don't have mentoring responsibilities because this type of school doesn't usually have a Ph.D program.\n\nI will say that I don't know any friends at R1 institutions who work less than 50-60 hours a week, so it's not great, but at least everyone is in the same boat, unlike OP's situation where they seem to be doing more for the school than the other profs in their department.",

I'm going to be direct, so I apologize if it comes off as rude.\n\nYour dissatisfaction seems to becoming from the following:\n\n1. You aren't getting to do as much research.\n   1. Implication: teaching and administrative work aren't fulfilling or are aggravating.\n2. You're comparing yourself to other colleagues in your department (who have less teaching or admin shitwork).\n3. You're comparing yourself to colleagues outside your university.\n4. You feel you're being treated unfairly.\n\nSome of this is external. And for that, you're gonna have to play a tough game against the admin. You should start seeing if any of your friends at other places would be open to hiring someone like you. Even getting an offer can sometimes be leverage for your present department to pay you more or to lessen your responsibilities. Additionally, you're going to have to come up with actual demands (e.g., I want my teaching load to be such-and-such, and I only want the following administrative duties). And you're going to have to threaten to walk away. Basically, you need to be incredibly savvy here.\n\nBut a lot of this looks internal too. This isn't medical advice, but you look depressed to me, and probably burnt out. This job is eating you alive. So, if you want to survive, it's either you get out of this situation (or change it), or you change something internally. Sometimes, it can be as easy as working with a therapist to find your reason for why you do what you do. Sometimes, it can be working with a therapist to let go of expectations (e.g., the comparisons you make with others). Sometimes, it can be finding ways to cut corners on the admin and teaching stuff to pursue research that is accomplishable only by you.\n\nThis profession is fucking terrible. And it's not your fault it's come to this. Academia is built on exploitation of the competent and non-wealthy. And if it's simply not your fight any more, it's not your fight. You have to ask: can I keep living under these conditions?\n\nI've had friends who left academia, and they end up loving the decision--less stress, more time for family and friends, more financial security, more autonomy for where they live and what they do. But they also have a couple years of mourning where they left all their work behind and grieved the loss of that part of their lives. But they came out whole and better for it.\n\nI'm sorry things are shit, OP. I wish you the courage to introspect on the hard questions, the tenacity for negotiations, and the luck to find better working conditions.",

          "text": "Thank you for your comments. I actually appreciate honest feedback. I'm sad to admit that I feel burnt out which I never thought would be aproblem as I have always learn to deal with this pretty well (somehow I was prepared for some level of burnt out when I got into academia). I tend to be the optimistic person that thinks \"this won't be like this forever, at some point it will have to change\" while waiting for things to change. However I have learnt that I need to take a proactive attitude to change things myself. I learnt this leasson late in my life but I'm glad I learnt it. Usually I didn't care much about having to deal with the teaching and admin bullshit as long as I had my time for research, but this last year with the pandemic  and the required changes (I'm in charge of a very important part of the department's teaching provision, let's say this way) most of time has been taken by teaching and admin (and in part to make other people's management duties easier, as I should have said no and they should have had to find other solutions). I guess life is a constant learning process.",

They put me (as a junior faculty) in a director of programme role, which was completely ridiculous. I was only a few years in as an assistant prof, and this was around the time of Brexit, so I left for a position in North America. If you have the mobility, keep your eyes open for positions in Canada. They pay A LOT more than the UK. I went from a Russell Group school to a lower tier school, but my salary (in terms of spending power) easily doubled (from \u00a342k to $120k CAD). Feel free to DM me.",

The few occasions (I remember 2 incidents) where students weren\u2019t respectful there was good reason. With all due respect if you don\u2019t have experience working inside a university department it is difficult to understand and judge what\u2019s normal. So you\u2019re gonna just have to trust me when I say that department chairs take the words their professors use seriously. OP calling their professorial contact a \u201cslavery contract\u201d is a red flag, and this kind of defamatory language is likely to be (imho) the cause of some of OPs problems.",

None of this is her fault.  The faculty member they are talking about cares deeply about her students... I can tell from her PowerPoints how much work she does.  She gives lots of feedback which must take hours.  She often gives examples of how counselors must be able to critically evaluate research in order to ethically work with clients.  The students complain because they want easy work like reflection papers that only include their opinion.  They don\u2019t want to think or read, they don\u2019t even attempt to critically evaluate what we read for class.  It makes me mad... that\u2019s why so many faculty don\u2019t push students... there is no incentive to do so because when you do, you generally have to deal with entitled students who can\u2019t appreciate how lucky they are.

Is it possible to have a conversation with HoD about your unbalanced resposibilities? perhaps even reread them with a laywer.

As is the case with any career trajectory, luck is always a major factor alongside privilege, discrimination, etc., so we can isolate the unique challenges to academia. One is the imbalance between experience/expertise and mobility/control: despite years and, in some cases, decades at the research frontiers - learning niche skills, developing a strong portfolio and even establishing a useful network with colleagues and collaborators - critical decisions regarding your own career trajectory are largely out of your hands.\n\nSo after doing some \u201cmeta research\u201d about life in academia, I purposefully declined postdoctoral offers and I also avoided lectureship applications because I realised that most academics rarely ever do direct research since their roles become increasingly managerial and administrative. That is not to say that there are not excellent professors but the vast majority appear to be chasing grants and funding in order to build their research empire; it is the postgraduate students are slave labourers who drive the research, and it is somewhat futile without this slave labour army.\n\nAs I have always been more interested in research, I found that independent scholarship (outside traditional universities) is much more satisfying; it is definitely not so stable but there is more freedom in pursuing passion projects, and actually putting your research credentials to good use.\n\nEdit: I am sure you are aware of this infamous [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Grimm) in the recent past, so it is a sad state regarding how difficult it is for the academics who are struggling at a certain stages in their career.",

Assuming it's hard to fire you for being \"meh\" at secondary duties (it normally is in the UK), maybe just turn up the incompetence meter a little bit?

It sounds like you might find it hard to negotiate, say \"no,\" risk mildly upsetting some people for the sake of excellence in a particular area, etc.\n\nOn career/focus you might find Cal Newport's \"Deep Questions\" podcast helpful: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-questions-with-cal-newport/id1515786216](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deep-questions-with-cal-newport/id1515786216)\n\nIt also sounds like you have become discouraged / depressed and this means that even the things you used to do and enjoy have become hard/overwhelming. I don't know your overall life situation but do you reckon the main source of this is your career or do you think there are other factors in your life which might be leading to this too?",

      "text": "On the positive side, you have a permanent contract. That is worth a lot, many young academics envy you (me as well because i have been doing temp contracts for the past 5 years).   \nNegative: you feel stalled. At a certain point you have to ask yourself whether it is worth to stay in academia. Maybe a sabbatical would work but also with 5-10 years under your belt, you hopefully have been able to save some money that you could use to move out of academia. Not sure what exactly you do, but there are avenues outside academia: setting up your own company, that can be a dev development company or consultancy, a research company, or something completely separated from your academic background. I myself am working in humanities but got involved with a tech startup. It won't make money for the near future but I am preparing to leave academia and certainly the temporality of it behind. Yes, a company has risks but you are more in command than in a University where you answer to the HoD and other admin staff. Pretty sure your competences are well capable of making that jump to the non-academic sector.",

And I feel like posting potentially inflammatory stuff like this on Reddit is likely to make your current situation worse, and make future employment more difficult. If you don\u2019t like one university, then make moves towards another. Your HOD may behave differently when you have an offer letter in your hand, or he may want you to leave?... You\u2019re complaining about a situation a lot of people would be very happy to have and deal with, so my sympathy for you is limited. However, I do feel for you as I understand it is not easy to navigate this kind of situation. In my own experience I ended up leaving academia. I wish you success and happiness in whatever path you ultimately choose.",
