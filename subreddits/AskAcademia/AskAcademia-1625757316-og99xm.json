  "text": "I was talking to a fellow grad student recently and she told me she\u2019s been planning to buy herself a really nice pair of shoes when she defends, as a gift to herself for making it through. I defend in a little over a month and I can\u2019t stop thinking about this. I feel like I should commemorate this milestone with something that I can hold onto forever but I\u2019m at a loss for ideas. Have you ever given yourself a really nice gift either for defending or reaching some other academic milestone? If so, what was it?",

My wife is quite the artist and she did my front cover for instance. Was nice that we could both contribute to my thesis. =)",

Already have a career outside of academia so I will most likely never ever need it again, but goddamnit I wanted it. Might buy myself an owl mask and wear it all at Halloween. \n\n(Caveat: I did not buy the super expensive Herff Jones bullshit, but found a decent quality off- brand supplier. Still wasn't cheap, but it was a fraction of the price of the official ones. I also didn't wear it for the actual ceremony (still had to rent) because I didn't want to stick out in case it wasn't identical, but in retrospect I think it would've been fine. Point is, it was 100% frivolous.)",
