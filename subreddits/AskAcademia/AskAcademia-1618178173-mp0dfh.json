  "text": "Hello Academic community. I have been thinking a lot lately about what I wan to do after my PhD. I am still in my second year of graduate school in a STEM field, but I always have a feeling that I don't know what exactly I would like to do in the future. I think it is better to be more oriented towards a goal to try and acquire the skills that suits it. I fear that not having a direction will dissipate my skills and give me a broad range of skills but none is strong enough to have a meaningful successful career. I am not sure if I will stay in academia, I am more inclined not to, but if I end up in industry I still want to do research. What are your ideas/experience with this? How did you know what you want to do after your PhD? What resources do you suggest looking at? Thanks a lot if you read my post!\n\nTLDR: I feel disoriented and don't know what I want to do after grad school. I am asking for advice on how to figure that out.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the replies! They are really helpful.",

      "text": "Second the suggestion to go to career services.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll add if you are at all entertaining the possibility of industry try to do an externship or coop with a company prior to graduating. Many universities now allow this. It\u2019s important because proving your interest to industry hiring managers can be tricky \u2014 I\u2019ve been exploring that transition (as a postdoc) and convincing them I want to make the leap has proven difficult.\n\nBooks to read:\n- The professor is in \n- the academic job search \n- career opportunities in biotech (by Toby Freeman)",

I\u2019m not sure about other industries, but if you want to work in tech, it will be immensely helpful to have some internships under you belt. \n\nI do UX research myself. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: your supervisor knows nothing about industry so they can\u2019t help. Publications don\u2019t matter, at all. Experience matters. Networking matters. You don\u2019t apply for jobs, you get referred by someone who already works there. There\u2019s no difference between people who work at companies like google, and me and you. The biggest and most well established tech corps like Google and Facebook like to hire PhDs.",

I haven't been to a career office since sophomore year of college, when I realized that career offices are some sort of money laundering operation staffed by incompetents.\n\nNo but seriously, unless you need someone to proofread your cover letter or do a mock interview, the career office is unlikely to have the expertise to help you with a niche PhD job search. You are better off speaking to your mentors, other students in the program, older students who have graduated and are working, or even just contacting alumni in jobs that interest you for informational interviews. You could try the career office for a list of alumni in your field of interest, but I find that it's the departments that keep those, not the bureaucrats.",

I'm saying this from the computer science Ph.D. perspective, at least, as someone who worked at Google Research -- my team, at least, was still focused on product and not on research. Maybe in other STEM fields it's easier to find meaningful research roles outside of academia; e.g., in various national labs etc.\n\nMy goal was always to stay in academia, I just got burnt out at the end of my Ph.D. and didn't feel like I had the energy to start an academic job search, so I ended up in industry instead, and so far, didn't find a way back in to academia after that.\n\nI agree with the other post here saying an internship is a good idea to try out something different in industry, which still in grad school.",
