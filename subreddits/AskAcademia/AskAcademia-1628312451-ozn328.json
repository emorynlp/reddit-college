  "title:": "Got a big fellowship at uni I have an adjunct position in and wondering what position I should negotiate for",
  "text": "I recently got a big fellowship that essentially covers my salary and a handful of PhD students for the next few years.  I applied through a university that I already have an adjunct/honorary associate professor equivalent position in.\n\nPeople with this fellowship place minimum at assistant Prof (senior lecturer) and max at full Prof so there's a lot of variability.\n\nBut I'm wondering if anyone in a university knows whether they will just use my current rank or if I will have negotiate from scratch? By age I would be assistant Prof level but by papers and all that I'm easily associate, hence they placed me at associate originally when they just scored on metrics and didn't have to worry about paying me.\n\n\nSorry if the question isn't perfectly clear or explained, any thoughts are appreciated.",

      "text": "You tell them nicely and professionally that your track record is appropriate for associate and negotiate hard for it. You're in a very strong position to negotiate, but don't be afraid to research your options elsewhere as well, having an offer in hand is very powerful and also helps you see what level others see you at. Don't settle for less than you're worth, and remember all's fair in love and negotiation, some places tell incumbents all sorts of things to get them to accept less than they're worth.",

Fortunately the fellowship is federal, and I theoretically can take it anywhere in that country, so I think the universities understand the need to be reasonable at this stage.  But like you said, I've seen heaps of promises in universities, and anything I writing disappears.  \n\nNot to mention the constant churn of department heads and the such, so even if they remember their promise for a year, they're gone the next.",

It's not saying you have to move jobs but having an offer from elsewhere both strengthens your hand, gives you a backup and saves you time if it doesn't work out with your current place. \n\nA good university will see your achievement and recognise your value and negotiate with you. A bad university will see what they're paying you now and try their damnedest to make sure that's all they ever pay you.  It's always worth looking about. You might be pleasantly surprised.",

          "text": "Yeah, this would be a reasonable push on their side for the most part. However, the country this is in has salary levels and tiers and universities give 2% cost of living increases every year with decent retirement fund contributions. So they'll still have to cover about 40% more than my salary in overheads and everything else no matter what. If I'm associate professor the difference would be just over 50%, so not a crazy difference between the two considering what they get (a new lab head and multiple students with their costs covered.\n\nI'm also wondering about already being in their system at a higher level than the fellowship. I couldn't find anything in their enterprise agreements on this scenario, so it seems like I could default into the higher position but not positive.\n\nThanks for the thoughts.",

My adjunct associate prof position was based on merit and expectations at that time since they could be pretty objective as the cost was zero.\n\nBased on expectations I'm easily a full professor almost anywhere in the world and was in the top 1% of scientists in 2019 from that recent Stanford study. Solid international reputation, and my citations, h index, etc are all above an average full Prof in that department. And even at Harvard/MIT equivalents would be associate professor level.\n\nSadly, I really don't know many countries that do it by pure merit, there are almost always caveats like \"you're too young, you wouldn't understand our grant and publishing system, maybe the last 10 years were just luck or your supervisors, etc.\"   \n\nI'm not bitter about it, just some observations. And if there wasn't a pay difference I would really care about the title etc. As that country has good labor laws.\n\nThanks again and I'll pull out specifics for each level from their enterprise agreement.",

So that's why I tossed that out there. \n\n This grant is supposed to lead to permanent positions and universities can be penalized for not offering them on completion (assuming the candidate didn't fully duck out and not do anything for 5 years). And that aspect is in writing to secure the grant. So I have some peace of mind, but there is always wiggle room for th\n\nBut as I have a good 20-30 years of work left and starting at let's say $10k higher now is a lifetime difference of $200-300k. That's a huge difference, especially if by most standards I would be deserving of it (and even their independent assessment 2 years ago thought that).  \n\nAnyways. The negotiations should start in a month or so. So I really appreciate the thoughts and feedback as it let's me formulate my arguments for my position much more clearly. And of course there are lots of other stuff that has to be negotiated too, lab space, office space, IP, students admittance, etc.   \n\nThanks again.",
