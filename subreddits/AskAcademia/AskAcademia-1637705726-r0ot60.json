          "text": ">So even if it was published in a top-tier journal, can a co-author say that this is their paper too or no in an official document, this is what truely the question was for me.\n\nYou need to think about the reasons why people are reading your CV, and what information is being portrayed.\n\nIf you are (eg) applying for your first faculty job then people will want to see that you have your own independent research agenda and are capable of generating your own ideas and research projects. In this context, being a random middle author on a 5+ author paper doesnt really show this. Most of these authors will have made relatively minimal contributions and probably just made a routine technical contribution that \"anyone else\" could have equally done if they were part of the research group. As such, its important for your CV to also have papers where you were clearly the main driver behind the research since this shows that you have your own agenda and are capable of conducting unsupervised research projects rather than just doing what youve been told.\n\nHowever, getting your name on top papers (even as a middle author) also shows that you have done well in forming collaborations with top people who trust you, and is predictive of the fact that you will continue to be part of successful research projects in the future. It will also give your citation count a substantial boost.\n\nThe \"best\" CV at junior level is probably some mixture of first author papers in decent/good journals, and a few papers in top journals (regardless of authorship order). This shows that you have your own independent research agenda, but are also a good collaborator who works with other people doing good work.\n\nAs you get more senior, people will be extracting different information from your CV, and demonstrating that you can do self-directed research becomes less important (since its already assumed that you can do this), so authorship order starts to matter less. At senior levels, having a wide network of collaborators/grad students/etc becomes more important. Once you have a few first author papers in top journals on your CV, everyone knows you are capable of publishing at that level, and noone is going to care whether your 7th Nature paper has you as first author or 5th author.\n\n\n(this will also be somewhat field dependent).",
