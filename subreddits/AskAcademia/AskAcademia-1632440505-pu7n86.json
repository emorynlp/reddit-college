  "text": "Hi everyone, I am starting my third year as a postdoc and am on the job market. My field is psychology, if it matters. I am hoping to land on a tenure-track position in an R1/R2 institution, at a location that works for my spouse's career. This limits my job search to a few cities/states and around 30 schools, of which about 10 have job openings relevant to my field this year. Consequently, my number of job applications is much lower compared to other people on the job market, and I know chances are high that I may end up with no job offers this year.\n\nThat said, I do have a few advantages in job hunting. My postdoc position is in a lab with very high reputation in my field. I was slow to publish in my PhD years, but have been very productive since starting the postdoc. Currently, the quantity and quality of my publications are comparable to the average level of young scholars who were hired for R1 tenure-track jobs in recent years (but of course, I am aware that job offers depend on a lot of other factors, not just the number or quality of publications). My PI has sufficient funding and is willing to support me for a few more years should my job market attempts fail this year. My spouse is very supportive of my career goals and understands the challenges I am facing. The only thing that I am unsatisfied with is my location -- a college town far away from major metropolitan areas. I love the life here, but there is no job opportunity for my spouse. We have been in long distance for the past two years, which I hope to end as soon as possible.\n\nI am wondering what the best approaches are in my case. For example, should I apply for TT positions outside the target locations? It would be long distance anyway, and maybe being already on tenure-track can help me get a second TT position at a better location? However, what if I get stuck on the TT position and cannot find a second job? How do people plan for applying for their second TT position and make the move happen? If I do not apply to extra places, I can still continue my postdoc, and may have more flexibility -- for example, I may be able to negotiate for working remotely for a few months every year, or do a second postdoc at a better location, and then keep applying for TT jobs while enjoying the reunion. However, I am not sure how helpful this is for my job applications -- my current position is fabulous research-wise, and moving to another place likely will not boost (and in some ways, may hurt) my productivity. There could be other options/caveats that I missed, too. Anyway, those who successfully landed on R1/R2 TT positions despite geographic restrictions, what did you do right? What would you have done differently?\n\nThank you for reading this. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.",

Think of it as teaching-focused and research-focused. \n\nIf you\u2019re at a research-focused school and rocking the research publications and grant funding you might be a competitive candidate at another research-focused school, but if you\u2019re mediocre in either they\u2019d probably prefer to roll the dice with someone fresh out of a postdoc. \n\nIf you\u2019re at a teaching-focused school and have great references, evaluations, specific accomplishments you can point to you may be competitive at another teaching-focused school, but if you\u2019re not demonstrably great they\u2019re probably going to prefer another candidate.\n\nIf you\u2019re currently TT at a research-focused school and applying for TT at a teaching-focused school you likely won\u2019t make it to the interview list at all, and vice-versa, because they will assume you\u2019re skills and interests don\u2019t line up.\n\nYou really should assume that whatever TT job you get is the only one you\u2019re ever going to get.",

              "text": "> moving to another tt position is easier after you get the first job \n\nEh, it may vary by field (I'm in math) but in my experience this isn't true. Being on the \"standard track\" that successful applicants usually come from is almost always better. In your case, the standard track is a prestigious postdoc. Applying from another TT position isn't exactly stigmatized, especially since you have a two-body problem which is seen as a very normal reason to want to move, but it still requires schools to say \"oh yeah, I guess we could also look at someone in this unusual category\" which many people don't want to do, even on a subconscious level.\n\nI also think since you have the ability to stay at your prestigious postdoc a few more years, this changes the calculation for you. The choice most people face is between a non-ideal TT job or leaving academia.\n\nBut you should also run this question by your current mentors, because they know the trends and norms in your corner of academia better than we do, and this stuff can vary a lot.",

You will still be able to get research done and potentially be at a school with a better startup potential. \n\n2. If location is important to you, say that in the cover letter. You have to make sure your reason for the location sounds legitimate. From my experience, search committees like strong candidates with secondary reasons for wanting to work at a particular institution (in addition to primary reasons). \n\n3. If your work is related to DEI, definitely mention it.",
