  "title:": "Did I cheat in my masters thesis?",
  "text": "Some years ago I finished my degree, did I unintentionally plagiarize?   \n\n\nHere is the story, I've been working for the past years with my degree in a field, which went great until I decided to take a break. However during my break period, I started wondering if what I did was cheating, and now I feel awful, because I am sure what I did was academic misconduct, and if found out my degree will be revoked. Which I am not interested in.  \n\n\nWe were encouraged to read other peoples master thesis, and I in fact decided to do that, I read the master thesis of several previous students within the same field as me and used 3-4 of these in terms of figuring out how I could construct my own thesis. One of them was VERY good, it was not only within the same field but also a very relatable topic and this is where it starts to get messy.   \n\n\nOur method and theory sections are looking very alike.   \nI use the same research method as theirs, and likewise the same theory, I even recall taking a reference from their thesis, as it was a really good one, and was basically all I needed to reference through my thesis. As we have the same educational background with the same lectures, a lot of the references they used were from the classes, and therefore some of those I would naturally have used with or without the inspiration of that thesis. However my theory section is structured just like theirs, I have naturally added something to mine, as it was not entirely a relatable topic, and naturally, I added some theories that they did not use, and I did not use all the same theories as they did, but it was darn close. So generally my thesis is structured like theirs, and if they compare the two of those, they would, without doubt, see the similarities.   \n\n\nThe major problem you ask?  \nI never cited them, and this is where it gets tricky for me, whether or not I did the right thing.  \n\n\nYes, I looked at the sources they used, and yes I read the thesis they wrote, but after doing so, I always went back to the original source that they used and read what that said, and then I wrote my own. I did not try to copy-paste theirs, and therefore i only cited the original source that they used. As it was empirical studies both of them, the way we conducted it was similar, and I was inspired by them in terms of what was relevant to take into consideration, but I only cited the original source. Was this wrong? Should I have cited the others?  \n\n\nTL;DR - I took the method/theory of how others conducted their master thesis and replicated it towards my own master's thesis, and only cited the original source and not the thesis which I found it in.   \nWhy is my text a mess? Because it is like my current state of mind, I feel like a nobody, a cheating pig, a girl/guy why cheated his way into his degree. No plagiarism checker such as Turinit found anything wrong with it, but I am so afraid that someone will figure out and report me, even though my thesis is not public.   \n\n\nSomebody lynch me for being a shitty person.",

My worry is that the first 20 pages are identical in terms of structure the things within it, is not the same, as my wording is like a 15-year-old, and theirs were more academic. The content was to some extent not the same either, however, the methods were 5-7 pages, so I doubt it can actually differ that much. But if I found something they had used, i naturally went directly to the source and paraphrased and included it, and where i paraphrased it kinda looks like each other, as we are using the same 2-3 lines and trying to paraphrase those, while trying to be true to the original author and using the theoretical terms they were using.",

Yeah, probably, but nobody really cares about how many citations a masters' thesis has and thus would probably rate somewhere around \"accidentally bumped into me on the subway\" levels of harm.

Still, it's more a thing to learn from and to keep in mind for next time, given that it's now locked away.  At the very least, assuming you continue in academia, you can learn from this and do things differently.    \n\n\nWhat would have been best for you was to cite the other thesis with a brief statement of how you are working with their concepts and methods, but also differentiating your work from theirs.  Such a statement would only be a few lines, but is not only ethical, it will protect you from claims of plagarism (keep in mind that plagarism need not be simply copy-paste) . It then shows you are conversant not just with original sources, but also in conversation with the work of contemporaries.    \n\n\nIn the math world, for instance, we sometimes write proofs whose structure is nearly identical to other proofs, but just in a different context.  When I did something like that, I would say something like, \"the terms and structure of the following proof are based on Theorem 2.3 in \\[X\\]: \"  Even if  X was more \"intermediate.\"",

I am currently dealing with a professor who is taken a literature review I wrote and has now included it in what seems to be a publication where he will be sole author. He might have now, after being showed how it all fits together, read the originals. I would say this is maybe not plagiarism but it\u2019s far from good.",

They came from the same institution, there was likely influence from how they were taught the material. The methods and the theory provide the context for the current investigation (whether that is in a unique application in a different population or further developing the methodology). I take it you are also a student in a Master's or PhD degree program. As your career develops and you have more exposure to the literature you see very similar reporting of theory/methods because... it is what it is. Read 5 books on a topic and compare their indices, 9/10 they follow the same structure establishing the theory and methods. Conveying theory is hard, trying to vary on sequences of communicating that theory is even harder. I would argue is not relevant to the study at hand for intellectual contributions to the field. Plagiarism is not meant to impose constraints on HOW it is reported, but WHAT is being reported and deter people from taking credit for works they did not generate. In this case, it's clear that the student had an understanding of the theory and methods, otherwise it would be abundantly clear to the examiners evaluating their results, conclusions and discussion. My take - sounds like a case of insecurity/ imposter syndrome than any failing of academic obligations.",

      "text": "I'm going to disagree with the majority here. OP you absolutely should have cited the thesis you read. It doesn't matter if you ultimately found the original material. That original thesis was your pathway to said material.\n\nCitation and Plagiarism are not narrow technical things. Its about giving credit to those who have helped you on your journey. All research is achieved by standing on the shoulders of giants. And nothing ever is really unique. The point of referencing and citations is to give credit where its due. You might not have technically cheated by institutional standards. But you owed the person who helped you the necessary acknowledgment.\n\nAnd that's where your guilt is stemming from I think.\n\nAll that said, I think the issue here is to use this experience as a learning lesson. If you'd like to try and make amends, consider looking up the thesis and maybe sending an email to the author. Its been many years sure, but a simple note explaining that you wanted to thank them for how helpful their thesis was when you were a student is hardly a big deal. And try and make sure you're being thorough with giving credit going forward. And if you're in a position to help explain this to others, your actions can help others learn too.\n\nWe don't really ever teach academic ethic with this sort of nuance. We just expect people to pick this stuff up, or do it informally from advisor to student. And something can be unethical and yet be on the right side of formal rules. What you did was, IMO, unethical. But its also an understandable mistake to make. Don't beat yourself up over it. Don't forget about it, but certainly don't let it haunt you. You're not a shitty person, just someone who made a mistake and wasn't as thorough in recognizing credit as you could have been. Use it to grow as a scholar and help others too.",

OP's attitude of inviting everyone to attack and suggest they should have their degree revoked rubs me up the wrong way - it strikes me as disingenuous because if he truly believed he plagiarised he wouldn't be here asking us, so I feel that he's really asking us to make him feel better.  OP did wrong, but rather than seeking to get their degree revoked - which I don't believe they'd actually try to do - they should be doing what you say, which is seeking to do better in future and ensuring that those they mentor formally or informally also learns these things.",

      "text": "I'm with u/boringhistoryfan on this topic.\n\nThere are generally two reasons to cite something in any academic work. The first is if you use  someone else's work directly: you quote it, you rely directly on conclusions they reached to build your own, you directly rely upon an experimental method that comes from a prior study.\n\nThe second is when you are significantly influenced by a prior scholarly work. It doesn't even have to be \"my work is like that prior work in some important ways\", it could be \"I disliked this work so much that I decided to do research against that prior work's conclusions or methods\". If you actually read something closely and thought, \"I really find this approach useful and I'm going to do it myself\", it's important to cite that work as an influence. In STEM work, in fact, you're doing another researcher a favor if you robustly demonstrate the replicability of their research by doing some of the same research they did with different goals or end conclusions in mind. \n\nFailing to do the first is generally going to be regarded as academic dishonesty without much debate--if you directly reproduce or tightly paraphrase the words and ideas of another scholar without attribution, you've made a serious mistake.\n\nFailing to do the second is a grey area, however. For one, scholars sometimes follow a similar research design because that's the only way to do it--e.g., their resemblance is convergent rather than lineal (e.g., they have a similar problem to resolve within the same disciplinary space and they just happen to do the same things). It's actually important to know that when you read two similar studies--if they're convergent rather than one study being influenced by the other, the results are arguably even more robust. (Kind of like Darwin and Wallace hitting on the idea of natural selection independently from one another.) But there's nothing *wrong* with looking at a study and saying, \"I want to do a lot of what that scholar did\". You just have to say so--it's about acknowledging the road you travelled to do your work and highlighting specifically where you think your original contributions to the field are. We put citations in our works for a reason: so that others can read what we read, consult what we consulted. \n\nThat said, it's slightly bad form--not, I think, academic dishonesty--to largely limit yourself to someone else's citations even IF you cite their work, and somewhat worse if you do that without even saying you did. You are trying to show a committee with a master's or doctoral thesis that you know your field well enough that you composed your own range of references in doing research. You can look at everything another researcher relied upon, but you want to show that you looked at other things beyond that too. Generally, scholars do try to do something that is \"value added\", to go beyond a previous study; part of the job of any dissertation or thesis is to clearly underline what that is. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, but if what you've done is primarily to add a new hubcap and deeper treads on the tires, that should be made clear to any reader of any research work.",

      "text": "UPDATE:\n\nI have reread the whole thing, and I've come to the conclusion that around 1% of the entire thesis would likely stem from the plagiarism of the other thesis. Its one of the methods i have, where there are some parts i think i might accidentally have plagarized.  \nThey are not worded the same way, but they mean the same thing, I searched it up, and it looks to me that I perhaps made some mosaic plagiarism. And now I'm in the gutter, how do i move on from this?   \n\n\nTalked to my wife, she said i should just let it go and be happy about the degree while i feel like i am a lying cheat. The only issue is, coming clean does not really seem like an option for me, i feel ashamed already now, and once i have to tell my family i would be even more ashamed. Can I move on from this and count it as a \"mistake\", or should i just come clean and see my life fall apart?  \nNo one will never figure it out as it is not public, and i doubt anyone even has a copy (Perhaps the school)",

I am not an academic but I have OCD and I have struggled for many years with reviewing past potential wrongdoings and worrying myself into oblivion about what harm/ repercussions I may have caused. I would never attempt to diagnose someone else but your thought process sounds an awful lot like mine. And I also tend to come up with/remember new past wrongdoings to worry about when I have a break. I think it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional (perhaps with some knowledge of OCD?) to help you manage your worrying. I hope you can find some peace about this.",

What tends to change is participant population, a certain control variable, etc.\n\nKeep in mind, you\u2019re research is SUPPOSED to be built off of the research of others. The future research section of papers is literally a roadmap for others to use. If the other person says that a change in population age might be in order, then that technically opens the door for others to try the same test with a different aged population.",
