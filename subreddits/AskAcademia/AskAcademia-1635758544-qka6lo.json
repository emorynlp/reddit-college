  "title:": "Confused on my Prospective Supervisor (USA)",
  "text": "The PhD program requires getting a supervisor before applying. I established contact with a prospective supervisor who is about to experiment with a new research field. The project he had in mind was a perfect match and he scheduled an interview. My master thesis and internship were in the same field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the interview, he made it known he was hoping to work with master students as he only has two years of guaranteed funding. He also mentioned that \"the project has the potential to generate future funding for the remaining years\". I don't understand if he was subtly rejecting me or otherwise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, twenty minutes into the zoom interview, my Internet cut off. I had to change from a PC to mobile after about 7 minutes to be able to continue with the interview. At the end of the interview, he sent me some of his publications (which I didn't read earlier because they were in a different field) and asked that we continue further communication by email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe deadline is approaching now and the university requires a credential evaluation which I'm not sure how long it may take. I don't want to waste extra cash for the credential evaluation if it's not certain I will be accepted. I'm confused on whether to go ahead with the application, ask that I apply for the Masters program first (and transfer to PhD later) or directly seek clarification on from him on whether to apply or not.",

It's not a requirement but it is good practice.",
