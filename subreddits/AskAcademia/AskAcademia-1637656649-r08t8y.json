Whatever you do, make it consistent throughout the paper.\n\nI would say just use Latino or Latina (whichever is appropriate for the gender context). Those are the preferred terms used by the Latin Americans and Latin American-descended people in my life. But, an academic journal might not accept using those terms anymore. Unfortunately, academia seems to have neglected to center the voices of Latin Americans when imposing terms to describe them. The Latin Americans in my family won\u2019t use Latinx or Latine because those words make no sense according to the grammatical rules of Spanish. They actually laugh that US Americans have tried to impose these words on them. Despite the protestations of a vocal few, \u201cLatino\u201d is already gender-inclusive according to Spanish grammatical conventions. My impression is that, outside of academic circles seeking US connections, Latinx/Latine are not really used in Latin America.\n\nIn summary, I wish people would consult the people they are referring to and honor the rules of their language when making up new labels for them. That could have avoided all this Latinx/e/@ mess.",

      "text": "LatinX is not a popular term amongst Latin Americans and I have only ever heard it used from white Americans or 2nd/3rd generation Hispanics. It\u2019s definitely a term that was made up without input from the community it tried to describe and has become quite controversial despite it being so easily picked up by academia. Latinos is gender inclusive but I have swayed towards using Latin Americans as it was already an established and used English term for describing people from that region while also removing the -o and -a that seems to be problematic for non-Spanish speaking people concerned about gender inclusivity of the Spanish language. Kind of begs the question why this term was made to begin with if gender inclusive words to describe this population already exists but I suppose it\u2019s a fad. A shame really as transphobia in Latin American communities is a big problem and it has very little to do with wording. One would wish they would do more to combat transphobia than trying to make up a completely useless word and then force it down their throats? Almost seems more harmful to the cause than helpful which is sad because I do think trans rights is a worthy cause. I just disagree with the strategy and terminology chosen.",
