              "text": "I actually had the opposite problem in my undergrad \u2013\u00a0despite the fact that I was in a \"discovery\" major (most people started college not even knowing what the field was), the four foundational classes of my major all assumed that you were already interested in and committed to the field, and focused on equipping you with the skills you needed to be able to do upper-level coursework without ever actually telling students why the field is interesting. It drove me absolutely crazy because, while I was lucky enough to come in already knowing for certain what I wanted to study, I think our intro-level classes probably turned a lot of potential majors off of the subject because they were very technical and not terribly engaging.  \n\n\nWe then had the fun bonus problem that our mid-level classes were open to students of any major with no prereqs, so in any given class about half of the students didn't actually know any of the fundamental skills that students in the major had been told were so essential to be able to take any non-intro-level classes. During my undergrad I probably sat through half a dozen different two-week crash courses in the fundamental skills that were taught in our four-class intro sequence, because every mid-level elective had to do something to get the non-majors up to speed, which made the intro sequence feel like even more of a waste of time.  \n\n\nEven now I'm in an MA program and I'm encountering the same problem \u2013\u00a0I'm currently in a lecture that is in my area of specialization but most of the students are in different degree programs within my department and have zero background in the area. The lectures are doing a great job of explaining *how* to do research in this area, but haven't touched on *why* that research is interesting and valuable even a little bit. I often chat with the people who sit near me before and after class and when I tell them what I find so exciting about this area of research, they're always like, \"wow, this is actually so cool!!\" and they're not getting that from the lectures at all.  \n\n\ntl;dr I have very strong feelings about how classes that welcome people from outside the field/specialization need to be structured to actually get people excited about that field before they jump right into theory and skill-building.",

      "text": "This is a cool initiative. Graduated with a BA in the social sciences in the last few years and happy to share one of the best things of my experience + something that was not so great for my peers. I was lucky to be in a unique program where every semester I had a one-on-one tutorial with a professor (largely on a topic broadly of my choosing, with the specifics hashed out based on a given profs research area. Incredible opportunity but partly an aside). As part of this, I also had an overall advisor who remained the same throughout the program, and who helped me liaise with the profs and plan out the semesters. As a result, I had a solid advisor the entire program, and essentially weekly 1-on-1 interaction with professors for the entire 4 years. Obviously, this really helped me become a knowledgeable and specialized student who regularly had their judgement and arguments critiqued. But more than that alone, I think this amount of exposure to professors was fundamental in helping me gain a solid foundation for why I was doing the major I was, and gaining a sense of vision for where to go with the field and whether or not I wanted to go to grad school / start working / do policy vs. research vs. academia, etc. Our 1-on-1 conversations helped build a casual relationship that made exploring my own professors interests in the field and their career tracks more accessible. I definitely learned more about their own intellectual and career development through these meetings than they would share with classes.  But most of my peers had almost no regular interaction with professors on this level (of course, they probably rarely went to office hours if ever), and had advisors who changed frequently and often could only meet with them for what seemed like 15 or 20 minutes per semester. I think I was a hardworking and forward thinking student, and this surely benefited me in having a good head for making future life plans, but I think I probably wouldn't have been half as far along if I didn't have that 1-on-1 exposure with professors and the close conversations about what career + future study prospects look like. All of this is to essentially say, I think too little of the typical undergraduate experience focuses on the question of why we study a given major, and there is too little discussion of what we can actually do with it after leaving university. Almost everything, maybe rightfully, seems to be focused in the middle, just memorizing and internalizing knowledge - take this textbook and read, take good notes in lecture, actually fix your writing as I recommend to you in your paper's comments, and off you go. I know it is not exactly a professors job to get students a job, nor do I think that's what the sole goal of universities should be, but if you were to take the typical undergrad and ask them: did your professors prepare you to work after graduation? They would probably say no, the word job was never even mentioned in class. Possible jobs, possible places of work, the day to day reality of what those positions look like - in my experience (in normal lectures) almost none of that is ever discussed by a professor. Indeed, beyond a brief 2-3 minutes explanation at the beginning of syllabus week, professors barely seem to address why they even became a professor or what they may have done beforehand - information that I think would be invaluable to most undergrads. The same goes for grad schools - professors will kind of offhandedly say \"if you're thinking about grad school, this is good to know\" or \"this name will come up a lot\", etc. but never did a professor mention postgraduate studies more than just in passing. Idk, perhaps some of these observations are a result of my not fully understanding the role of professors, moreso failings on the universities part, failure of students to go to office hours, or the nature of attending a public rather than private institution. This may be unnecessarily long-winded but regardless, I think one of my biggest takeaways from undergrad and my unique track was that my professors themselves, rather than simply the books and articles they had me read, were the most essential resource for my success. And not just in attaining knowledge, but also in knowing what to do with it after. Share more of your own experience with us.",

I may have 60 students and I simply can't spend an hour with each one every week.  Although most semesters I only have one student actually come by my office hours.  Most students don't care about more in depth learning, they just want to check off a requirement and get out, which is sad.  I love learning and don't really get students who don't care.  That said, I think it's great when colleges offer some sort of optional program where a student can work with a professor one on one, or in a small group of 2-3 students, and engage with the subject on a more personal level.",

So do cultural factors in some students from other countries, oh and let's not forget intercollegiate athletics and the crap positions they can put students in. My point is there are lots of reasons.\n\nStudents face lots of pressures and may be arriving poorly prepared. If cheating or erosion of standards is a concern, discuss the problems not the people. There was a thread recently about the serious erosion of standards in PhD and EdD programs and it's also a huge issue. Degree bloat and lower standards can be found lots and lots of places, but don't throw specific groups of students under the bus as if they're causing it.",

The phenomenon is this: as more and more people go to college (higher supply) the value of a degree goes down. This is the actual side effect of capitalism - meaning that it actually has nothing to do with qualifying attributes, or actual skill or competence. Rather, companies move the goalposts for what is considered qualifying. Where a bachelors used to be considered qualification enough, now a graduate degree is required. A person with a bachelors (assuming the education remains of the same quality) could do the job, but if a company can hire someone with an advanced/graduate degree, especially because they are in higher supply, why should they hire an undergrad? Essentially, companies reap the rewards of people becoming more and more educated, and education gets you less and less far - even if you are skilled.",

They are suited to professions which do not require a college degree (sometimes associated, sometimes none). That should not be frowned upon, and we should not incentivize schools to put these students into college track courses or incentivize college track as the \"best\" option.",

Many parents see a college education as the best hope for their children. The glut of college-educated applicants means many of those students graduate to become baristas, cash register attendants, burger flippers. If they had gone to technical school they could be mechanics, welders, dental hygienists, physical therapy assistants,  and so many more career options. College is not for everyone, and some people should choose a different path - not because they are stupid, but because their career goals do not mesh with college.\n\nCollege education has been idolized because many careers prioritize it, but many do not require it. It does, therefore,  select for students who have not identified a specific field to specialize in. Students who may flunk out in their first year, may complete their degree and still be unable to get a job, may change or make up their minds midway through their degree. \n\nWe should encourage other pathways - incentivizing school districts for AP/DE enrollment is ridiculous. I've had incoming college freshmen who took AP biology (and failed) and childcare classes (which they passed). Why are they then going on to major in biology in college? There are pressures influencing - teachers, family, friends, society, probably others.",

On one hand, I can understand why professors may not like technology as it can serve as a distraction and be abused by students. However, I think it works better for students who have poor penmanship or write slowly. Also, digital notes can be backed up via a cloud service whereas if you lose your notebook, you've just lost your notes for an entire semester. Therefore, my suggestion is to allow technology in classrooms. If you find repetitive abuse, then inform your class that they will no longer be able to utilize their laptops or tablets.",

It\u2019s not just about banning technology, but also about encouraging a positive practice. \n\nIf people have bad handwriting or write slowly, some probably need to spend more time writing by hand and developing that skill, just like any other. Some are maybe just not good at it, like how some people are not good at pronouncing the letter \u201cr\u201d in French, or making microscope slides, or any other skill a course might require. It\u2019s not always possible to artificially create a level playing field for everyone, in every respect, in a college classroom. \n\nAs for allowing technology unless/until \u201crepetitive abuse,\u201d you\u2019re underestimating how difficult it is to make that call, and to take away a \u201cprivilege\u201d once students are used to having it. That\u2019s a recipe for mutiny. And it\u2019s definitely not a matter of \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d Technology is distracting by design. There is no way that a visible screen is not distracting someone in the room. \n\nSome instructors are okay with that, or don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the case (probably because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have ADHD or sensory disorders), and so students think, well if Professor A is fine with it, then Professor B must be uptight and controlling for not allowing it. It\u2019s unusual for them to presume that Professor B might actually have the more well-considered or student-centric policy, since it doesn\u2019t immediately feel gratifying. It\u2019s also fairly typical for younger adults to take any restrictions on their behavior as an intolerable exercise of unearned power, it\u2019s later, through experience, that some will come to understand why those policies exist. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about losing your handwritten notes, digitize them after class. Office Lens is one good app for that; I\u2019m sure there are others.",

This includes what some consider to be \"grey area\" cheating, such as sharing info from previous semesters, excessive collaboration, and undeserved academic considerations like ILPs.\n\nAt the risk of worsening the above issue, please post as much course material as possible online. Some of us work jobs and any schedule flexibility helps. Avoiding posting your slides is not going to help increase class engagement or participation.\n\nGrades mean very little anymore (I say that as someone with good grades). There are a lot of unskilled, dumb people battering their way through high school and undergrad in spite of their low intelligence and mediocre abilities, because they're good at parroting textbooks and have no hobbies or commitments outside of university.\nGoodhart's Law comes to mind. A handful of people in my graduating undergrad class, including one who I genuinely believe was mentally handicapped, got into very good professional or grad programs. Grades are simply no longer an accurate assessment of academic potential, because given enough time and money, any idiot can hammer their way through a degree.\n\nAt the same time, a lot of upper year science courses seem to be purposely misleading, with cryptic, hard to understand slides and lectures. Lots of concepts that stumped me in upper year chemistry and math courses were, in retrospect, very simple to understand, but poorly explained.\n\nNatural sciences has a ridiculous amount of gatekeeping now, particularly by TAs (friends at several universities have had similar experiences). Please be specific with TAs about how to mark. Don't leave it up to their interpretation, I don't want to have to argue against their personal judgments about what constitutes decent work.\n\nTL;DR: lots of academics are worried about their institutions becoming degree mills, but neither academic selectivity, nor hard marking, nor withholding information, nor anti-cheating measures can guarantee that. The only way to guarantee that is assessing students, on a personal level, for academic aptitude (things like confidence in the lab, writing and presentation ability, competent problem solving, all alongside grades), to accurately judge who has the potential to be successful in their chosen field.",

It's true for grad degrees as well-I'm no genius by any means yet I met plenty of people with PhDs who I thought were complete idiots. But if you mean academic potential in terms of potential to succeed in academia- they still aren't a good indicator but they are much better than say GRE scores for example \n\nUpper level science courses are not *purposely* misleading. It's just that a lot of professors are bad teachers because they never get any real training on how to teach. All their training is focused on being a researcher. And the way tenure works, teaching isn't really incentivised. They want to give tenure to professors who research will bring in money and prestige to the university.

      "text": "A couple of quick things. (STEM Major here)\n\n1.) Please put full lecture slides online, preferably ahead of time. I understand that some professors put fillable slides or no slides at all because they want to increase attendance. Ultimately though, having notes that we can go back and reference against our own is extremely helpful when studying for upcoming exams or we're looking back through our notes and things are still unclear. The same can be said for posting them ahead of time. It allows students to have the slides ahead of time so that we can spend more time listening to you and taking notes on what you say rather than what you put on the slides. Lastly, sometimes we have to miss class. Everyone gets sick sometimes and other times we have to travel for family, personal, or academic reasons. It's hard to catch back up before the next class if we don't have notes that we can access online. \n\n2.) I dislike that many professors are anti-chegg and similar services. I completely understand that some students copy straight from chegg. That sucks. I don't know a way to stop that. Generally those students perform poorly on exams. If they don't, then they must have still learned the material, which is the goal, right? That said, as someone who does take the time to do all of the homework, I use chegg. It's a great resource for me when I get stuck or don't understand why something was done a certain way in the in class examples (if the professors do them at all). \nBeing able to see an example step by step helps me understand far more than a single example on some slides in class. Plus, chegg isn't always right, so it still forces me to work through the problem, check their work, and figure out where and why they were wrong. Additionally, sometimes I don't understand what the textbook problems are asking me to solve for. In any event, I think Chegg is a great tool when used appropriately.",

Not necessarily stumble into it, but plenty of my classmates who did \"useless\" social science degrees now work well-paying jobs in government or NGOs. Lots of people get lucky in the job search and land good positions simply due to searching at the right time, and lots of ambitious people who extensively plan out their career paths have those plans derailed by issues that are out of their control.\n\n> I don't need the perfect ultra-fulfilling job that fills me with joy every day\n\nThat's a pragmatic attitude to have. \"Passion\" or \"doing what you love\" is a bad way to assess career paths because every profession eventually becomes work. No one loves what they do 100% of the time, especially when they have to get up at 7 or 8 AM every day to do it.\n\nThat said, academics tend to be people from the top 10% of their field, so obviously they are going to suggest \"doing what you love,\" since they are the part of their field for whom doing what they love is a realistic career. The people who need to hear the harsh reality that their dream careers aren't realistic are the 90 IQ high school hotshots, not someone who's got top marks.",
