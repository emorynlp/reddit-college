  "title:": "Anxious before math PhD",
  "text": "Im going to be starting my math PhD soon and I feel woefully unprepared. I don\u2019t even have a bachelors in math (although bachelors was in a math related field). Admittedly, I don\u2019t even have the suggested prereqs that the department stipulates. Somehow I was able to be admitted based on my past research experience: I have published three papers in somewhat-good applied math/operations research journals, two with a professor and one by myself. I studied the necessary math by myself, and just had some ideas based on some connections I saw between different papers that I read. However, looking back at those papers, they honestly seem trivial and like \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d.\n\nI am rather nervous about having to do a thesis at the PhD level - I\u2019ve tried reading theses of past students in my department and I hardly understand them. On the other hand, I know my sub field (in which I published those papers) very well. Overall, I\u2019m anxious that I won\u2019t be able to write my thesis, or that those earlier papers I wrote were flukes.\n\nHas anyone experienced feeling like this before? How did you get past it?",

Give yourself a break and try to remember that mostly everyone else in your cohort is also starting at the same place.",
