  "title:": "Junior Research Group Leader in Germany",
  "text": "I\u2019ve read that one of the paths that lead to professorship in Germany is becoming a leader of a junior research group (Nachwuchsgruppenleiter), generally after a few years of postdoc. There seems to be several types of funding available, such as the Emmy Noether Program.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve did my googling on this position, I would like to ask some more questions:\n\n1. It seems that after completing leading your junior research group, you have a promising prospect to a professorship in Germany. But, suppose that things don\u2019t work out well and you cannot find a professor job in Germany in the end. What would then be your alternatives? Would you still be competitive for a professor position in another country?\n\n2. What does it take to have a realistic chance of becoming a JRG leader? If your H-index is over 5 by the time of application (field: linguistics), would you be competitive enough? (Knowing that, of course, your research plans are just as important)\n\n3. Is it any harder for non-EU nationals to work as a JRG leader?",

      "text": "I have had the privilege of setting up and organising a funding programme to establish such junior research groups at different universities in a region (it was a specific program set up by the state ministry). Without going too much into detail, those groups were exactly the same as those of the Emmy-Noether programme of the DFG. One thing I came to understand and which is something I\u2019d like to share is that every university implements those groups differently. Some turn the leader position into a junior professorship (equivalent to assistant professor) most of which are not tenure track. But they all were independent groups at the departments with the explicit permission to teach and to supervise and examine at PhD level. Others, however, were assigned to existing chairs with no independent supervision rights. Given that the purpose of such positions is also to gain experiences and independence in research and especially in teaching, hence qualifying the holder for tenured associate professorships and full professorships, I\u2019d like to recommend checking the details of how the groups are organised at department level in advance.",
