  "title:": "Considering quitting and doing a 180",
  "text": "I need some advice and don't exactly know where to go. I am going into my 4th year of my PhD program but got behind with covid and failed my qualifying exam so have to retake it again soon if I plan to follow out and commit for another 3 years. Frankly I am tired and worn out from all the extra stuff I had needed to do for my dept. without due credit and bored with my research and lack of support from my committee. That said, I also worked really hard to get to this point in life but have since decided I won't use my PhD if I complete it because I want to do something completely different and open a new business which I am passionate about and have thought about for years. How do I approach quitting? Like who do I even tell first? And how long is the process to quit? For those who have tried to quit and successfully did, did you have any lash back at first or did your committee try to convince you to stay? How do I know I am really sure to make this jump? Is it bad if I quit at the end of the semester because I have already committed to firm engagements this semester and no one that can fill my spot to do the work for my dept/advisors? Someone please help!",

      "text": "Two of my closest friends made the decision not to continue with their PhDs. Both were in the later stages of the program. They are both now very happy with their decision. \n\nPlease do not consider it as giving up or quitting. Knowledge and experience is never a waste. You have to do what is right for you. Only you can determine that. However, considering his dismal the job market is, unless you really have your heart in this, it may be worth rethinking your future sooner rather than later. As for how to tell people\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. Good people will respect your decision and wish you all the best. You have to take care of yourself. I think once you open up to even one person you respect and trust you\u2019ll find people understand and will give you the support you need. You\u2019ve got this!",

          "text": "Thanks for this. I also think one of my biggest fears is coming out to my close family and friends/peers that I have struggled when I have pretended that this was what I wanted for so long and that I could handle it. I feel like I am still young enough that I can quit now and go off and do what I really want and have the passion for. I've discussed it with my best friend who isn't in academia but is successful in industry and my husband thus far. I've just lost interest in the politics of academia and don't see myself continuing to bow down to these established faculty with no guaranteed prospects at the end if that makes sense. And it's not that I can't work hard it's just that my research topic doesn't excite me as it once did and I don't have a strong support system in the area if that makes sense? Part of what also makes me want to quit is the pettiness and jealousy of faculty/grad students over publications/books and awards and the drama...it's just not me. I'm not willing to put other people down for my own academic gain. Life is just too short...",

          "text": "Thanks for this! Yeah what scares me too is seeing some of my peers who are further along and recently graduated have to take shit jobs in the middle of no where for 1-2 years with no guarantees of a job offer after. Eventually my husband and I want to have kids and settle down somewhere and I just can't see myself finishing the course and then picking up to go somewhere for 1-2 years with no guarantee and putting my husband and his/our mutual goals behind mine too after he's already been so supportive.",

      "text": "I'm sorry that your PhD program is not working out.  \n\nMany people experience a mid-degree low and then things start clicking again. If that is your situation, look at  the long-term goals (post PhD) that drive you to take this long and difficult journey. Also look at the immediate progress that gives you satisfaction and starts your research clicking again.\n\nIf that is not your situation, you should discuss it with your major advisor and your director of graduate studies. You are not the first to discover that the PhD is not actually the right path for your life. That is perfectly OK. They can help you sort out what to try next, and whether withdrawing is the right thing. If it is, they can work out a timeline. Students decline teaching assistantships and other commitments at the last minute quite often. Don't make that a major deciding factor.\n\nAt my institution, withdrawing is a matter of filling out an online form in the student portal. It may be that easy at yours. But you may also have the option of leaving with a non-thesis masters. You director of graduate studies will know whether that is the case and how to go about awarding it.",
