  "text": "I'm 26, and I've been studying chemistry on and off since high-school. My dream was always to be a lecturer... but as I get older the more I realize that academia isn't for me. It was attractive because I could spend my days plodding about a lab, creating new things that could potentially help the world. But I've spent *8 years* sitting at my desk studying and I'm starting to just want to go outside and enjoy my life! I'm still studying part time, and will be for another 3.5 years!!\n\nI started at UNSW part time and did really very well there, but they went to trimesters, so I picked up at left to Sydney University. Then COVID hit. I've met close to none of my professors and my third year plummeted. Also, UNSW requires one major to graduate, while USYD requires two, and it's taken me some time to find something else I love (apparently, it's Spanish... hola!).\n\nBy the end of my degree (with honors) it will have taken me ELEVEN YEARS to get a BSc Adv. Science with a double major. I'm broke, and will be for the foreseeable future, and even then to get anywhere significant with chemistry requires a PhD.\n\nI'm afraid that I've wasted my life studying, and just desperately want to can the degree altogether for a full-time job in the industry (if anyone will hire me, I have ALL the chem qualifications but my second major is holding me back from that pretty piece of paper).\n\nI'm also jealous because some of my friends picked a trade (massage... lift building... agricultural science), studied for a year, and now they have a job and a nice paycheck. I'm getting anxious for it to be my turn.\n\nI think I made a mistake falling in love with chemistry.",

Edit: even talking to a careers advisor now might be a good shout to help you see what options you have. It might reassure you about your current path too.\n\nDo you have a good feel about what a PhD would entail and whether it'd suit you? It's very different from undergrad!\n\nAs for peers having well paid jobs and settling down, I know that feel. Would you be happy in their jobs? Are your future plans worth it for you? It's not an easy equation to balance out, and a lot of personal choices about what you prioritise.",

      "text": "I can't give you practical advice, but I can say this:\n\nI'm almost 30, and I haven't had the chance to even start undergraduate education at a college yet due to a string of family/housing issues over the past 10 years. My interest and what I've spent most of what time I have on professional/educational stuff in my free time is Mesoamerican archeology and history, something assuredly far more niche and with less prospects for an academic or private/commercial careers, and I also have no real safety net financially and have no clue what i'm going to do or if pursuing it is worth it.\n\nMy point being this: Regardless of what descision you come to for what you want to do, you are *always* going to be behind or seem late compared to somebody else, and compared to yet another person you will seem years and years ahead. It's really, really easy to wallow in despair of what chances you've missed out on or what could have been, but ultimately it's not productive to deciding what you should be actually doing.\n\n(Also I'm not trying to be high and mighty about this, I'm guilty as hell for thinking it's too late and being upset about that instead of focusing on what my next steps should be)",

          "text": "Awesome comment. Been feeling behind myself at 25 and hearing this definitely puts things into perspective. I agree that OP just needs to decide what their next step is, and follow through. Dwelling (which I am also guilty of) is not going to get us anywhere. \n\nI also think at 26 OP is still extremely young and has plenty of life left to experience things. The fear of missing out is a waste of time. I respect the hustle of studying so long, and staying committed even when you are feeling burnt out. Not many people have that amount of discipline. Its an attribute that will get you far in life with whatever it is you end up pursuing.",

Never had the discipline to stick out my studies when I was younger, and now I am desperately getting my act together. I am considering switching from computer science to chemistry or biology next year and would most likely go on to get my PhD. Seeing what you have achieved is very motivating to me and I am very pleased to have stumbled upon your post.\n\nKeep up the hard work. Don\u2019t worry too much about feeling as though you\u2019ve missed out. I\u2019ve had a lot of social experiences and honestly, it\u2019s all overrated. I would trade it all to have taken my education seriously earlier in life. All we can do is move forward with the lessons we learn. \n\nGood luck with whatever you decide to do next.

          "text": "Yeah. Bane of my existence.\n\nI started at UNSW part-time in 2014. I was 18/19 and my dad had just passed away so I took 2015 off and came back in 2016 for part-time until mid 2019.\n\nSecond year chem was 2016 and 2017 and did so well I got two scholarships for it. I started a project on creating a third year module for f-block in the second half of 2017 and it split the faculty: some thought it was great that I wanted to learn about something not on the syllabus, and put it together in such a way that others could learn from it too... some thought I was ridiculous. I was cc'd in on a few e-mails and long story short I didn't feel at home anymore, so I took 2018 off chemistry to do my electives.\n\n2019 rolls around and I'm in third year chem at UNSW but the university went from semesters to trimesters and I couldn't work and keep up, so I jumped ship to another university (USYD).\n\nIt's worth mentioning here that UNSW requires ONE major to graduate with a BSc, but USYD requires TWO.\n\nI joined USYD second semester of 2019 and not all of my credits transferred to USYD (USYD had an extra 4 weeks of phys chem in second year that UNSW don't do) so I had to wait 6 months for that course to roll around again and repeat the first half of second year chem at USYD in semester 1 2020.\n\nSo semester 1 2020 I finish second year chem at USYD and then completed all my third year chem courses by semester 1 2021 (which was a couple months ago).\n\nBUT I STILL NEEDED A SECOND MAJOR. I'd known from all my random electives at UNSW that they weren't for me (so I'd already ruled out biology, physics, astronomy (the concepts are fascinating but the maths was beyond me), statistics, creative writing and philosophy), and I fluffed around with pharmacology, neuroscience, psychology and hell, even design at USYD until I found Spanish.\n\nI found Spanish last semester (semester 1 2021) and the university requires me to finish that major (which you can't speed up because its a language) BEFORE I can reach chemistry honors. So...\n\nIncluding this semester, its 2.5 more years of Spanish part-time, and THEN a year of honors in chemistry, and THEN I get to graduate at the end of 2024... 11 years after I started :')",

A delay because of a bereavement is totally understandable. \n\nGently though, since then it seems like you've made a lot of decisions without thinking through the consequences. You took on these scholarships and decided to deviate from the regular BSc route. I don't quite understand what happened next but it's evident you were warned what you were doing wasn't a great idea but you did it anyway. That's fine but it caused another delay, and I'm wondering if you learnt anything from it. \n\nThen you jumped to another university but it seems like you didn't do your research, or if you did you didn't prepare because you then had to find another major and it took you another two years to resolve that. \n\nThere are always students who feel the need to do everything their own way, which is usually the hard way. It's fine to march to the beat of your own drum but be careful not to do it just because it's not the usual way. \n\nI think you need to focus on what you're doing. It's great to enjoy the journey but you have to have some sense of the destination and not forget about getting there. It's important to do what interests you, and taking deviations from the plan is good, but you have to think about why you're deviating and whether the deviation is taking you too far away from your goal. You don't need to do everything that comes your way, and it's fine to say no or put something off for another time. And try to think ahead, not years and years but at least know what the next step is supposed to be.",

On the topic of the f-block course, I had the head of chemistry supporting me, but when I was halfway through creating it and I heard the rest of the faculty laughing at me, it was time to go for a while.\n\nThe biggest problem is that I've always enjoyed learning, so *time didn't matter.* I knew what I wanted (to be a lecturer) and I didn't care how long it would take. It didn't occur to me that 11 years in a BSc would ever happen, and wear me down to the point that is has.\n\nI admit that changing universities was a big mistake. I did it because the trimesters meant that I couldn't work and study efficiently, and I was getting more and more migraines. I thought the change would be better for my health, but it added *years* to my degree and I'm miserable in a whole new way. On the plus side, me siento alegre porque puedo entender un poco de espanol.\n\nI think there's actually a chance I could *transfer back* to UNSW. I'd have everything to get accepted into and complete my honors in a year and graduate with a single major. But I'm not sure if that's a step forward anymore. I'd be embarrassed to show up again in the faculty 2 and a half years after transferring and still having not completed my honours. Everyone from my classes there would be doing their PhD.",

I think this was a very serious mistake on your part, for really not doing any homework on the degree at all before you transferred. This isn't a standard degree and never has been for any university anywhere. Were you enrolled in the joint BSc + BSc Adv. St. at UNSW, or did you transfer from a plain BSc?\n\nEdit: also, [I don't think it's correct that you need 2 majors to do Honours](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/study/undergraduate-courses/honours-in-science.html). There are two different paths you can take:\n\n - 2 majors: enter the Bachelor of Advanced Studies\n\n - 1 major: enter the standard Bachelor of Science (Honours) \n\nThe [page for students](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/honours/science.html) also says:\n\n> Our appended honours degree, the Bachelor of Science (Honours), is an option for students who commenced their studies prior to 2018 or who have not completed or are not on track to complete two majors in their single bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nYou are going to have to take extra time, so by definition you are not \"on track to complete two majors\"",

That's massive, and my academic advisor agreed that I should complete it in full rather than drop down to a minor and an appended honors.\n\nThe issue is the extra 3.5 years. When I transferred my credits had not been finalized. I was in no way aware that it would take this amount of time. Nor was I aware that they'd make me redo second year. I admit I should have made sure everything was in place before I moved but having said that I felt it was the best option at the time. I felt that UNSW was no longer for me, so I chose to move to the best place possible, with the best degree possible, thinking it would be a better option for myself. I apologize for not understanding the system better and knowing where I'd end up.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel so strongly and are so angry with me. I agree that I've jumped into a lot of things in my life by 'feel alone'. Of course I think about all my decisions strongly (I'm actually quite neurotic in weighing up the pros and cons), but I always go with my gut in the end, and what I think is the right thing to do at the time.\n\nNo one ever makes a decision where they think they'll be worse off.\n\nAnd I would be surprised if you've never made a decision for yourself that you thought was best but unfortunately turned out to be a shit fight (in relationships, job opportunities and the like).\n\nMistakes are made, I think we can all agree on that. And to be fair I have had my pity party but I am doing my best to amend it as we speak.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Edit: It's not even 6 months difference between the single and double degree. For reasons I don't fully understand my academic advisor stressed that it was 1 semester, so 3 months! I think you would agree that 3 months difference means just go for the double.",

      "text": "Let's start with this. In this world you will have to work for a living. Period. It's better to work forward than to work in place.\n\nWith that said, PhDs often get stipends and free tuition so while you work towards that goal you at least will be supported. It's not a good paycheck but being paid to get educated is amazing.\n\nJob prospects will likely be better with the PhD. You don't realize how little you know until you do a PhD. This period of time is where you actually learn and refine cognitive and technical skills that will make you marketable. \n\nGetting through the BSc is probably the worst part, not the hardest. The PhD is definitely harder, but it's significantly more enjoyable. There isn't too much different about how you will spend your day getting a PhD compared to jumping into the job now (except pay). Only you will have a better skill set with better job prospects and career advancement potential after 4 more years. You might sink more time into work during the PhD, but maybe not, it depends on who you work under. \n\nI understand you are burnt out, but going to get a job in chemistry vs getting a PhD in chemistry gives the same outcome; you will spend your days in the next 4 years doing chemistry either way. One advances your career more and gives more opportunity, the other might pay better sooner, if you can find a job.\n\nNow alternatively, getting a job in industry and putting in 4-6 years with a BSc there might actually give the same prospects to advance in industry related positions. Maybe, maybe not. I don't say this often, but I vote for the PhD. If it was any other scientific field I would say bail out now, but chemists are insanely valuable to a wide array of industries. \n\nRecognize that no matter what you are probably stuck working regardless of the direction you choose. One path moves you forward faster and opens doors. Best of luck.\n\nAnd may I ask why you think a second major is necessary or helpful? Once you get through a PhD you see how useless most of undergrad actually is. I would vote to bail out now and dive right into the PhD you would be almost done with that by the time this second major is over. Start applying now and abandon ship when you get accepted.",

If I had stayed at my first university, I would have completed a single major (and probably my honors year, and graduated) by now. But I guess I wouldn't know how to speak Spanish.\n\nI feel like Spanish will actually be very useful for my job prospects. It opens up many more companies worldwide, and gives me a leg up in companies in my own country where things are quite competitive (having language skills is highly valued where ever you go).\n\n\"Recognize that no matter what you are probably stuck working regardless of the direction you choose\". If I choose to jump ship and work a 9 - 5, I'll finally have some cash and be able to afford the things I want, but I'll be indoors all day anyway, and if I ditch the degree for a job, I may never be able to move up. At least with study I can choose to take a break for a surf or a walk - I might be broke but the sun is free. And at the end of a PhD I may be able to fulfil my dream of lecturing.\n\nHowever, I'm very concerned because I know how competitive it is to be an academic. I'm not sure I'm prepared to put those hours in anymore. I don't want to work 80 hours a week. I want to travel the god damn world.\n\nAlso, I hear that getting a PhD actually makes you *less* marketable in industry because you're almost 'over-qualified' for any job.\n\nFinish the degree and work part-time where I can find work or try get a full time job in chemistry now and abandon the degree if I get accepted? One leads to broke years and a good degree and a job down the line... and the other leads to actually being able to afford to fix my teeth and buy a van before I'm 30 but I'll never be able to do research again, even if I wanted to. \n\nI guess, at least for now, I'll keep studying.",

If that's the case then unfortunately you have to finish, there is very little job opportunities for someone in chemistry without a degree. Jobs are already few and competitive. A lot of entry jobs are taken by people with MS nowadays. We get a lot of MS holders applying for our entry level tech positions which start at 30-40k per year at my company. This is in the US btw.\n\nThat's not to say you can't get a job with just a BS in chemistry. If I were you I would finish undergrad, work in industry for a year or two and then decide ixf you want to do the PhD. It's what I wish I've done. \n\nFor the record, my personal perspective is that have a grad degree helps a lot but the difference between MS and PhD is really blurry.\n\nEdit: Also consider if you want to go into academia you will likely have to post doc after your PhD",

There are rare exceptions, such as graduates who had lots of internships as work experience netting them a higher starting salary. But overall, what you're working for is a potential higher pay in the much longer run.\n\nAdditionally, I understand the argument for being overqualified with a PhD rather than a BSc or Master's for most fields, but isn't chemistry not one of them?
