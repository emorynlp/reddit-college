  "title:": "Completing a PhD Full-time While Working Part-time: Doable or A Silly Idea for Silly People?",
  "text": "Me: Early 30s and currently work in child welfare in what is essentially my dream job; I do lots of research and evaluation but also build programs to support youth in the institutional care system. Also make a good salary and benefits. My other dream job would be to be a professor.\n\nSituation: I\u2019ve always wanted to do a PhD. I really enjoy theory; learning theories, building my own, contributing to existing etc. I love learning new things, teaching, researching and writing. I\u2019m interested in either a PhD in sociology or social work (currently have a BA Psych, BSW, MSW, and a grad dip in research/evaluation), and my dissertation would be on a child welfare topic, but have diverse interests and have published in other topics. **However**, I really do have the best job; if I can avoid leaving it, I would. Also, a PhD would benefit me in my current job.\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering: If my job agreed to allow me to return to school for a PhD at reduced hours (e.g. 2-3 FT days a week), would this be manageable? My employer would likely support this and my dissertation work could be done to benefit the organization.\n\nTL;DR: Does anyone have experience doing a PhD and working (either combination of FT/PT PhD and FT/PT work)? How did it go?\n\nAny feedback would be very much appreciated!\n\n**Update:** Thanks everyone for your feedback, this was much more than I was expecting!  I read through everything this AM and have a lot to think about; apologies that I can't reply to everyone, but did read everyone so far.  Expanding on my own post:\n\n\\-I live in the People\u2019s Republic of Canada.\n\n\\-My job has been remote since before the pandy and will stay that way; this I think would help manage the two endeavors (i.e. less time in the to and fro).\n\n\\-Money is not the primary driver in wanting to keep my job; I love my work and would like to see the work benefit my sector in tangible ways \u2013 I\u2019m wondering if staying connected to work might help facilitate this.",

      "text": "I'm doing a PhD in Special Education, which is close enough to your fields that I feel alright weighing in.\n\nI've been FT since I started, but a lot of my peers are part-time, taking 1-2 classes at a time while they continue their FT jobs. A few PT students have switched over to FT, and the PTers frequently raise a few issues with their situation, which lead me to recommend against it:\n\n1) Far fewer opportunities to publish, present, and conduct research, since a lot of our opportunity comes from the work we do for our advisors as Grad Assistants.\n\n2) Relative social isolation compared to FT students, especially before COVID. A lot of what I've learned was informal learning from hanging out in the lab with more experienced students, and those relationships have also resulted in more opportunity to collaborate, network, even to find small jobs here and there.\n\n3) Along the same lines, PT students report that they feel like they receive less departmental support. They spend less time with their advisor, have a harder time getting help, etc.\n\n4) It takes a lot longer, which eventually gets to people. Doing a PhD sucks, but at least for FT students it will be over soon. PT students are working more hours (including their FT job) for a longer period with less support. Also take note of the increased burnout and higher likelihood of dropping out.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a \"silly idea for silly people,\" but I would recommend doing your PhD full-time or not at all. It sounds like you've got a good thing going right now. You're happy with your job, and it sounds like you're good at it. There are two kinds of people that I'd recommend do a PhD: people that *absolutely need it* to get their dream job, and those who are so dead-set on getting a PhD that they can't be dissuaded. I'm not sure that you fall into either category. If you really have nothing to lose, you might as well try, but I'd recommend having a Plan B if your first semester/year are unsustainable. Either be ready to commit to the PhD full-time, or be mentally prepared to drop out to prioritize your career.",

I'm not so worried about social isolation, I'm pretty well set up socially - but was wondering about how a decision to do the program PT might effect my access to interesting opportunities (i.e. publishing, presenting etc.).  Can't have it all I suppose.  I've also gotten lots of feedback about a protracted experience leading to burnout; I might have options for a sabbatical/education leave that might help if timed properly.",

      "text": "I'm working on my PhD in social work part-ish time (probably 75% of the time of my cohort mates) while working full-ish time (30-32 hours a week). It hasn't been amazingly fun, but it's been do-able. If I knew what I know now, I'd probably do it again. \n\nWhen I started my program, my job was really poorly aligned with my studies and it was really, really hard to shift my brain between work and school constantly. I have since switched jobs and am now doing research on related topics for work, so my brain doesn't have to work as hard to manage both. It's made a world of difference.  If your work is aligned with what you'd like to study and is supportive, I'd guess you'd find it challenging, but manageable. \n\nThe other piece I wish I had done differently at the beginning is making sure my program had a solid plan connecting part-time students with faculty. Because I didn't have a research assistantship or anything like that, my program kind of forgot that I'd still need an advisor. I had an advisor of record, but no one who had really felt that I was \"theirs\" so to speak. I've made it work, but it's been challenging at times. There's a big difference between programs that accept part time students and those that know how to support part-time students. You want the latter. If you have the former, know you'll need to do extra work to be successful.\n\nEdited to add: I found the coursework phase easier to do while working than the candidacy/dissertation phase has been. I can make deadlines when they're given to me by others. I can't make them when I set them myself.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any specific questions!",

I said in another comment that I suspected the synergy between work and school (i.e. similar topics/tasks) would simplify things at least a little; glad to hear that may be the case.  I also suspected that I'd take on coursework while working, and perhaps take a sabbatical/education leave to focus on writing later on; based on what you've said here that might be a good idea for me to pursue.  Thanks for the nugget about being a part-time student and needing an advisor; I will definitely keep this in mind.

I think it's very doable as long as you're good with time management and organization. I.e., I'm always completing work and homework tasks before the deadline when I can, because it gives me flexibility to address anything that pops up and takes the stress out of it all. It's definitely a lot of effort, I put in at least 12 hours of productive time a day on weekdays and 6-8 on weekends right now, but I also don't have kids and it's a good time in my life to focus on advancement.

Note that if you want to be a.professor you'll need research/ teaching experience, published work, many.implications in the network, etc. All of this takes a LOT of time so this will require you to leave this job unless you don't need sleep. People who wanted to keep their job either wish to go back and get a better job there or get time off for the phd duration and work at uni. \n\nA supportive partner who shares the domestic work and understands WHY you put so much work, time and money on this project is also key.  I know many couple who broke up during a phd because of the very limited free time they ended up with :/ people who manage better have support from friends and family, no matter it they have kids.\n\nSo overall it's possible but you need to keep your schedule realistic because a lot of people fall in the trap and work 17/7, see no one, don't do anything for fun and forget their family and friends. Depression and anxiety is a real epidemic in grad school, so just make sure if you decide to go foward that it's a marathon. \n\nLittle tip for the program you choose: check the funding, the research centers and the view the industry has on your field because you may very well end up looking for projects outside academia.",

Because of this I was able to pack extra classes and certificates into my masters that ended up counting towards my PhD. I worked 3 part-time jobs during my masters program. It was awful but I made it. \n\nThis helped me because when I moved into my PhD I only needed to complete about a year and a half of full-time required classes. I also took as many directed research and independent study hours as possible and focused on publishing like crazy. This meant by the time I got to my proposal, I was pretty prepared. I defended my proposal while working full-time and I worked full-time through my dissertation. Although it was awful, I managed to graduate in December. \n\nIt really depends on the department, your chair, and your committee. You NEED a supportive chair. My chair HATED the fact I worked full-time and tried to punish me for it on multiple occasions. My only saving grace was that I landed a prestigious postdoc and it made me force his hand so he couldn\u2019t keep me stuck doing my dissertation forever. It\u2019s definitely doable but it absolutely sucks. 10/10 do not recommend. \n\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t have children of my own to take care of.

If you want to become a tenure-track prof at a highly-ranked research university, you may need to spend your time researching and publishing, not working at a job you've been at for some years and thus are getting diminishing returns from in terms of learning. On the other hand if you're interested in becoming a prof at a teaching-focused university, or a non-TT prof (like a professor of practice, or an adjunct), then staying closely involved in your field might serve you well.",

Depending on your field it wouldn't be hard at all to *schedule* around significant work hours; in my program virtually all the courses in my major field were evening seminars (four hours once a week). I also took classes in the law school and several other areas that were in the daytime, but they were electives so I had choices. It would have been fairly easy to schedule 20+ hours/week in a job off campus...I never had class on Friday, for example, and often none on Tuesday. My first year (the only one I didn't teach) I got a 1/2 time job in a research institute to help pay the bills...since it was on campus they were always cool about scheduling around my classes.\n\nBUT: there were times when I was way too busy with my own coursework to do much else...when papers were due, or later when studying for comps. So you'd want a very flexible employer willing to give you a week off when needed, and able to change your schedule each semester as your classes shifted around.  Might be a lot harder in a lab field, but for me in the humanities I could do my work any time I was free since it was almost entirely reading/writing during the three years of coursework. Once I started dissertation research, however, it would have been different as I had to travel and often spent months away from home doing archival work.\n\nI wrote about 90% of my dissertation while working full time as well. So that's possible, but I wouldn't advise it. Basically meant working nights and weekends for two years while putting in 50+ hours at work during the days. Didn't see a lot of my partner during that time.",

I know I could not have completed my thesis if I had a job while attending grad school; I am in a different field, though. When you say you want to be a professor, I am not sure if you mean getting a tenure-track position or teaching a college course every once in a while. If you want a tenure-track position, your graduate work and research should be your main focus. In the US, the number of PhDs granted is MUCH larger than the number of tenure-track positions available.\n\nHonestly, I would try to find someone doing what you want to do (grad students or early-career professors) and pick their brain about this. Often, people are very happy to talk to curious strangers about their career path and answer questions.",

So there is fair amount of overlap, but its quite different to your field so YMMV.\n\nI'm 1.5 years into my PhD and it has been relatively stable so far, however, I'm not taking for granted that this will last. I make sure to keep track of my time (I use Toggl) so that I can see the balance. I try to reassess my situation frequently. I'm balancing my workload as well as deciding whether or not I'm still getting enough out of my job. \n\nI've had some problems with work - but there were a variety of factors (personal issues, covid lockdowns) so it's not possible to pin the blame on my PhD. Otherwise, I had my year-end review in December and my manager said that *on average* I was doing good (between highs and lows).\n\nAt university, I had to write and defend a report on my progress and plans a couple weeks ago. The panel was satisfied with my progress, but was wary that I will need to \"focus\" my work (my work so far has been quite broad). Additionally, I've done a substantial side project with another student and presented it at a workshop in a top conference. \n\nI hope you find my experience useful.",

My job had condensed hours (32hrs/2 days), so it was exhausting but doable.\nThe plan was for me to continue FT work (in mental health because I'm a social worker in clinical supervision) during the early part of my PhD since my program was not funded. I would get through my supervision and sit for my LCSW, then could move to PT status doing individual counseling that would let me focus on the dissertation, etc.\nThat plan lasted exactly a semester because of the work environment. If you have a supportive environment and they will work with you on schedules, it's totally possible (depending on school expectations as well). If your school expects a lot of research and deliverables, it's a lot harder. I still need to finish up my first year and do my qualifying exams to proceed, but after exams, I'm sure there will be more pressure on me to produce outside work. \n(I'm noticing the number of social workers in the comments, which makes me happy)",

So you need to find a methodology that allows that and you need to find a supervisor and university that buys into YOUR project. Because if you have to put up with silly advisors and their silly demands (plenty of those abound) you'll just suffer pointlessly. If you can show how this research can contribute to your work goals then you could get support from your employer too. \n\nYour project sounds really amazing but really be very careful and prepare it very well and don't just jump into things because academia is full of abusive assholes who enjoy destroying people's dreams. Be very careful and strategic but I do hope you can pull it off!!!!",

I still have a year to go. \n\nFrom experience I can say it's possible but extremely time-consuming and stressful. Whenever people said that its taking time from your life and general freetime I did not belive it. But it's true. You have to keep in mind that there is always this big project in the back of your head and although you'd rather do some hobbies or hang out with friends you can't do it as before. Obviously, you'll find slots for them and they are absolutely necessary, but they will become very less and you will become very picky when to use them.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the beginning is the hardest. Bringing you to the level which is required and as everything is new you will spend a good time on learning and acquiring everything. Also be prepared that you do many tasks which will not be relevant for your work e.g researching stuff, reading papers or doing analysis which you may not use in your paper. This is hard sometimes because you invest a week for something just to find out that it was a waste of time. You will become so resilient after time and I suppose it's a good thing. There will be up and downs and times where you want to quit and also times where you don't do anything for weeks but then there is this point where you just become stubborn and realize that you just have to do it and finish it. \n\nYour set up seems to be okay to me and if you are - and this is the absolute prerequisite - interested and have an intrinsic motivation to do it, then do it. You will learn so much and your character will extremely develop positively. Make sure you have a good environment (your partner and family) who support you all the way. Make sure they absolutely know what it means and tell them very realistic that you may be becoming somebody who has no time, can't do stuff for them but on the other hand you need their help and support for this project. The balance may not be even anymore. Consider that the project will take up at least 3,5 to 5,5 years. \n\nHope that helps.",
