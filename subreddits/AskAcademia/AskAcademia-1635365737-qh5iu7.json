  "text": "Without being specific (although I understand the exact nature of the comments obviously matter) are negative written comments in the file from teaching evaluations extremely uncommon?\n\nIf you get comments recommending changes to your teaching in your file, is that in and of itself a significant sign that tenure is unlikely?",

      "text": "I don't think there's any \"one size fits all\" answer to this. But as someone who is now engaged in writing pre-tenure evaluations, if we say, \"you should make some changes,\" what we're hoping is, you'll make those changes, see great success, get tenure, hooray. It's not a setup. \n\nWe advise candidates to \"close the loop\" on negative evaluations: show that you recognize them, take them seriously enough, and can make changes if necessary. Nobody is born a good teacher; we're all always making changes, if we care about being more effective. Integrate that into your narrative on teaching and it'll be even better than if you always had perfect scores, because it'll show adaptability and growth.",

      "text": "Extremely common. Whether this is a real problem will depend on how negative. If we get a P&T package with no weaknesses and all sunshine and bunnies, it looks like the candidate was not fully vetted and maybe there is something to hide. Listing mild weaknesses is common and not a problem. I recommend you talk with your chair about the specific comments and how to address.",
