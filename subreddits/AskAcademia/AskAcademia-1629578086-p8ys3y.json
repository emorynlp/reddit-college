  "title:": "Question about Conference Submission",
  "text": "Hello\n\nI'm currently a senior in high school, and I've recently learned about an upcoming conference that perfectly aligns with some research I've been doing. I have been considering submitting my paper to this conference, but I was wondering if my relative inexperience and age might work against me. For journals, this isn't usually a big deal because I only chose double-blind review journals, but for this conference, they specifically ask for your academic affiliation and degree, and I see no mention of blind review.\n\nDo you think it's worth it to submit the paper, especially given that the conference will take about two months to make decisions?\n\nIf this would be better suited for r/college, please tell me.",

All too often we rule ourselves out of things because we assume we won't be considered. Unless you have to pay to submit, I'd say go for it. The worst that happens is you had an experience and didn't get in.",
