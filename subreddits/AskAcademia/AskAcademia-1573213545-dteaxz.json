  "title:": "A detailed checklist to write thesis introduction.",
  "text": "Currently, I am writing my Ph.D. thesis. For that purpose, I am creating a detailed checklist for each chapter of my thesis. This is the checklist that I prepared for my introduction chapter,\n\n \n\n* Is the opening sentence of my introduction sparks interest in the reader?\n* Is the opening sentence the suitable starting point and fits well with the rest of the Introduction?\n* Did I provide a strong problem statement (general) in the opening statement?\n* After the opening statement, did I provide enough citations to support the problem statement presented in the opening statement?\n* After the citations, did I provide enough information/progress and citations about the efforts that have been taken already to address the problem statement (i.e. literature review)?\n* Did I manage to clearly show the research gap based on the literature review?\n* Did I present the significance of investigating that research gap?\n* Did I present the research questions that I am going to address in my thesis? Did you mention how solving those research questions would fill the research gap?\n* Are the research gap and research questions defined are clear and concise?\n* Do my introduction answers how the research was conducted and why the way it was conducted?\n* Did I present a clear outline of my thesis?\n* Do I think that the reader will be confident after he or she has read my introduction, that I have interpreted the title sensibly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI posted here as it could be useful for others as well. Please feel free to share your feedback.",
