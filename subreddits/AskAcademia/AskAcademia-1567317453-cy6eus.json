  "title:": "PhD advisor published my work without my knowledge after I left academia",
  "text": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons...\n\nI finished my Ph.D. in 2019 and left academia for a career in tech. \n\nTonight I just discovered that my PhD advisor published work from my dissertation without adding me as a co-author or mentioning me in the acknowledgments. \n\nI actually knew about this paper a few months ago, but I didn\u2019t realize it actually got published. In my gmail history, the last message about the manuscript left off with me asking if my advisor had any questions about the paper and included the paper as an attachment. In the original draft, both of our names were on the paper with my name listed first \u2014 since the work came from my dissertation. \n\nAt first I thought, \u201chey, maybe this paper is completely different from the earlier draft.\u201d But full sentences were lifted from the original draft and from my dissertation. \n\nSince I left academia, this doesn\u2019t affect my now non-existent academic career. But I\u2019m still kinda bothered that my advisor published from my dissertation without mentioning me at all in the paper. \n\nTIL; I left academia and later found out my PhD advisor published from my dissertation without including me as co-author or adding me to the acknowledgements. \n\nAny advice?\n\n\u2014\nUpdates:\n\nSo I decided to go ahead an email my advisor. Maybe this was an oversight (albeit a pretty large oversight) and by reaching out to my advisor it can be resolved quickly. \n\nThis paper is part of a book. I reached out to a couple colleagues who also published in the book. They said that the editor mentioned I was no longer interested in being a co-author since I left academia. I am awaiting a paper trail of this conversation. Since the original drafts had me listed as a co-author, I\u2019m not sure at what point in time I allegedly gave up authorship.",

After it was published by my former lab without my knowledge, the journal editor said \"contact the University, not our problem and out of our control\" and the University said \"the researcher has moved to another institution, contact their new employer\". The new institution said they wouldn't do anything. I also had a lawyer send a letter, but it got nowhere.\n\nSo at least in my case, there were no penalties for the plagiarism. Of course that was long ago, maybe social media and the internet can help to shame some of these people into doing the right thing. But the bottom line is it comes down to $$$, if the researcher is bringing in million dollar grants, the institutions aren't going to sanction them, withdraw a publication, or fire them because a former colleague was left off a paper.",

I feel next to falsifying data, plagiarism is the most serious professional misconduct in academia.

I agree this is some obscene plagiarism, but the misconduct seems to reach beyond just OP's advisor being a little punk. \n\nIdk about legal advice, I would reach out to the University. They seem like the most likely party to swiftly take action. Such a flagrant and obviously malicious case of academic misconduct being traced back to their school, impacting their recruitment, enrollment, retention, how their research programs are perceived in the academic community, and most of all their funding?

I wasn't even acknowledged on the second.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, I did not contribute any data to the second paper apart from teaching someone to run some basic analysis and telling them based on that analysis that their story didn't make sense to me and eventually working out what the issue was from coming across some literature in another context, which led to the paper being totally changed to what I suggested might be happening. \n\nUltimately, I decided it wasn't worth my time because it struck me that ultimately this had such little influence on my career going forward that I could not be bothered chasing this up or kicking up a fuss.",

It seems like you left on bad terms. do you need this publication to advance your career? If not, I'd say let it go. It's probably not worth your time to try to figure this out.",

This is not \"theoretically\" plagiarism, it is unquestionably plagiarism, and is one of the most serious cases of misconduct an academic can commit without getting arrested.  I also feel like if someone is willing to do this once, they are likely to do it again.  I think OP has a responsibility to at least report this to the professor's chair and/or Dean, as well as the editors of the book.",
