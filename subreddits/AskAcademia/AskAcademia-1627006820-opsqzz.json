  "title:": "Thinking about quitting my PhD program and I haven\u2019t started yet",
  "text": "\nTo give backstory, I am an incoming first year grad student who is considering staying in the program for 2 years to get a masters or taking a year off after getting a PhD to focus on building a fashion career. It has always been something that I excel in, as well as in science but recently I\u2019ve been more aware of my desire to be in the fashion industry. \n\nI recently thought that maybe I should just consider not getting a PhD all together and working as a technician. I love research but not as much a fashion. I feel so unappreciative that I even got accepted into the program, but I know it\u2019s a stable career. \n\nI feel so silly any advice for me?! \ud83e\udd74",

      "text": "If you would be happy with a technician job, then you should do that and focus on fashion. A PhD is a very long and very difficult process with very little in terms of job prospect or monetary reward. A PhD is not a stable career, very much the opposite, in fact. The only reason to do a PhD is if you want to be a professor. If this isn't your endgame, then the decision has already been made.",

          "text": "As an artist myself I would recommend you finish your degree, if you have the time follow some classes or courses about fashion design. It's important to follow your heart for sure, but working in fashion is not as romantic as pop culture makes it out to be.. Intensely competitive, low pay, there is only a very select few people who make a life long career out of fashion... Perhaps you can use your academic skills as well. It's not silly but you can do this side by side with your academic work for sure. Also as an artist, the advice I would give any future artist .. Pump out work. Draw all you can, make sketches, design patterns, learn how to draw sewing patterns, read about art history, sew your own clothing. Perhaps approach it as you would your academic work. Follow your heart, but being stressed because of money will kill your creativit. So again, fashion and science can for sure exist side by side, even go hand in hand. :) Good luck.",

              "text": "Thank you for your advice. Unfortunately, most of what I\u2019ve seen has me to believe I would not be able to just pause to work in fashion or work side by side. Most researchers keep up day and night outside of work hours to stay relevant and competitive in the industry. That would leave me no time after and/or burnt out.",

These would provide less glory and less academic freedom, but often more free time and less of an expectation to work 80 hours per week. The jobs available absolutely depends on your subfield, however.",

Go for it if you\u2019re pretty confident of being productive. You have to be very interested in your interests and have strong determination.",
