  "text": "I am currently working on my application for a research based PhD in the UK. I have been trying to find examples of successful CVs but there aren\u2019t that many examples available. \n\nI was just wondering if any successful PhD students/academics could give me some advice as to what section is the most important to get right? I know that in general you should include a personal profile, education, research experience and references. \n\nIs it important to include interpersonal skills like problem solving, time management, independence etc. or should I focus on lab skills only? At the moment I have a separate section outlining my lab/bioinformatics skills and a separate section outlining my completed research projects and what transferrable skills I have gained from them. \n\nThank you in advance:)",

      "text": "My advice for any CV is focus on achievements. Listing stuff you did or skills you claim to have isn't very helpful. Saying you have excellent time management tells me you know some buzzwords. Telling me you completed a research project in 6mo and were second author on a paper from it, tells me you can do research, you can work in a team, you can work effectively, you understand the research process and that you actually can deliver. \n\nI've learnt to be very wary when UG list skills on their CV as they often don't really know what they're talking about. I had a student confidently assert multiple times she could do qPCR. Turns out she didn't know the difference between qPCR and PCR and she only knew the theory of how a PCR works. She wasn't lying she just didn't have the experience to correctly assess her skills. The same is true of interpersonal skills, generally you've never had to use them in anger as an UG, working on a group project is nothing like navigating a lab full of students and postdocs all having to share equipment and knowledge while managing your own project which is tied to other people's.",

      "text": "In my personal experience, prior lab experiences are quite important (if you have publications great, if not it\u2019s ok too). Otherwise, demonstrate enthusiasm, hard work ethics, creativity. May be hard to come across from a CV but just to keep in mind. Bioinformatics as a skill is very nice to have\n\nEdit: phd in US so not too sure about if it\u2019s the same in UK",

      "text": "Make sure you also add in any work experience.  \n\nYou *can* include some interpersonal skills but only if (a) you think you're actually meaningfully better at this skill than a random other recent grad, and (b) you have actual experiences and evidence to back up your claim.  Personally, though, I'd say it's probably better to emphasize these skills in your other application material, where you can focus on providing evidence rather than just listing \"skills\".  For example, when you describe a research project in your cover letter or other application document, you can provide a description of how finishing this work required you to independently solve specific problems.",
