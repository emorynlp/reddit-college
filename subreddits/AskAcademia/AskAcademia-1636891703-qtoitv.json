      "text": "The Ongoing History of New Music by Alan Cross is my favourite podcast of all time. It's a Canadian show that originated as a radio show that I grew up with. It focuses on alt rock but dabbles in music in general, especially since alt rock is so heavily intertwined with basically every other genre except maybe EDM and hip-hop.\n\nThe episodes are short, unlike most podcasts that like to run 1-2 hours, but they're so interesting and of such high quality you won't mind the wait.\n\nDon't be concerned with the \"new\" part of it, there's no limitation to any timeline.\n\nHere's some sample subjects: What does the 'Foo' in 'Foo fighters' mean? (Nothing, it was completely random and meaningless); What the hell was the story with Sid Vicious? (He didn't actually know how to play and had a stagehand play all his music, also he was probably the most self-destructive musician of all time); and the various hobbies of musicians (Did you know, a member of the Offspring has a Ph.D?)\n\nRandom fun fact: his name is in the liner notes for a Muse album that they did without his consent or knowledge, but he's cool with it.  \n\n\nedit: just saw the sub this was posted in and you probably are asking about academic podcasts. I'll leave it here anyway. You can consider it educational for music academics?",

Which is a human bio/health/medical podcast.\n\nIf I need something shorter I pull up The Magnus Archives which is a very excellent horror/mystery fiction podcast. I would highly recommend only listening to this during daytime hours when other people are around, because it\u2019s really good at being a horror podcast.",
