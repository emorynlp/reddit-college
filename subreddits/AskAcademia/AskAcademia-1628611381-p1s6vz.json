  "text": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI would appreciate some advice on my situation. I am about to submit my thesis in a few days and my defence is already scheduled for November.\n\nMy SV's have been wonderful and have even recommended me to one of the faculty members for some work on a recently funded project. Said member has reached out and we've scheduled a call to begin discussing the work in the next week.\n\nNow this is my issue: I have not been able to take any time off (not even a weekend) in the past two years because of my PhD work. My svs were very demanding in terms of publications etc but I didn't complain since they were also very supportive and available when I needed them. \n\nHowever, I am burnt out and just the thought of having to work on anything right now, even if its sending out an email, is giving me constant panic attacks. On top of that, I am currently doing work for another faculty member which won't be complete before October. \n\nI don't know what to do. I need rest because I can't function right now and won't be able to deliver on even the simplest tasks. But i also don't want to lose this opportunity or seem ungrateful - I know how difficult it is to secure work in academia and I don't want to come off as 'not really that interested in getting started right away' during the call. I will have let down my svs who have put in effort to help me find work and who don't really acknowledge \"burn out\". They're well-accomplished in their fields and that's one of the reasons I was always too scared to ask for holiday, since they never took it. \n\nI don't how to balance worrying about my upcoming defence, continuing my current work, taking on more work, and also finding time to just switch off. \n\nI am not sure how to approach this situation or what to say during the call. Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer some advice?",

      "text": "How long do you think you need off? Tell the new PI that have other commitments immediately after your defend and won't be able to start for two weeks/a month and ask them if that's an issue. Chances are they'll say that's fine but if not you can decide based on actual evidence rather than what you fear about whether to take the job. \n\nTo some extent you need to learn to set boundaries about this kind of thing - pushing back on difficult deadlines and carving out personal time. Some PIs will look out for your mental health and push you take time off but many are under such pressure themselves they're not going to look a gift postdoc in the mouth and will happily let you continue working all hours. However, many also won't say a peep if you don't work weekends or long nights. If the work is getting done they generally don't care and you should be negotiating the time lines as part of working independently. \n\nYour mental health is like an elastic band. You can stretch it so far and it will spring back but stretch it too hard and it won't go back.",

          "text": "Thank you for this.  I do, I struggle to say no to people and I think this is probably a good time to start learning.\n\nI wasn't thinking too long, I do want to take a week off after I submit before getting back to the work commitments that I have at the moment. But in terms of the new PI, I would prefer to start after my defence (which would be in 2 months). I guess I am just so worked up about losing the opportunity, but I also think my mental health should take priority.",

              "text": "I don't know if this will help you, but I recently had a conversation with someone in my team where I framed her inability to say no as a problem and a performance issue she needs to address in order to progress with her career. I wanted her to see saying no and pushing back as a good thing to do and as the mark of someone who is owning their projects.\n\nWhen I see my team discussing the amount of work something will take and calculating a sensible time frame it gives me confidence in their abilities and I believe it also gives other people confidence too; they're reassured that this person understands the project and the work that needs doing. \n\nSome people are just awful and suggest short deadlines just for shits and giggles, but for the most part I've found when people are suggesting deadlines they are actually seeking your feedback and if it's a self-imposed deadline they are happy to be flexible.\n\nETA taking time off before a new job, or delays to starting dates are very common and only an idiot restarts a recruitment process resulting in further delays to starting rather than flex on the start date with their chosen candidate. Unless the PI is an ass, they won't bat an eyelid.  Good luck!",

                  "text": "This is such a wonderful way of looking at it. It's actually made me feel a lot less panicked about my decision. \n\nI think its also one of the reasons I've been slowly losing confidence over the past couple of weeks. Just setting deadlines I know I can't meet, and when I don't, I blame it on incompetence instead of proper time management skills. \n\nThank you, your advice has really helped me!",
