There were crucifixes in the classrooms and we canceled class for mass on holidays I didn't know existed. But otherwise, the Jesuit mission was framed in ways a non-religious person could support: educate the whole person, use knowledge in service to local or global communities, etc. A lot of the faculty were nuns, monks, and priests. Many of them were on the more liberal end of the spectrum. You can't get away from the fact that it's a Catholic institution, but there weren't a lot of constraints on academic freedom or being open about personal beliefs.  What I hear from friends and colleagues who've been at some of the other larger, urban research-focused Jesuit universities is similar. \n\nI don't think that necessarily holds true for the smaller Jesuit colleges.",

One nun said \u201csome of our students are too religious\u201d and talked a lot about justice in education. \n\nThe only bad part was a theology professor who seems to have appointed himself the commissar of Catholicism for the school and hinted heavily that the school should directly ask faculty about their religious affiliation and that psychology and sociology shouldn\u2019t teach from a hard materialist standpoint so as not to offend theology. \n\nThe Provost heard about that one and scheduled a follow up meeting with new faculty to make sure we knew to ignore that dude.",

It's an altogether different dynamic from what we typically call \"denominations\" in a religious context (e.g., Southern Baptists, United Methodists, Episcopalians, etc.). The Catholic orders are mostly groups of priests, monks, or nuns who differ from each other in their specific types of service and some of their spiritual exercises, but they're all part of the exact same church.\n\nThe closest equivalent to \"denominations\" in the Catholic Church wouldn't be religious orders but the so-called particular churches: e.g., the Latin Church, the Maronite Church, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, and so forth. These are the more full-fledged \"branches\" of the Catholic church with their own clerical hierarchies, lay members, liturgical rites, and so forth, though all under the final authority of the Pope (patriarch of the Latin Church).\n\nMost of the best known religious orders, including the Jesuits, are technically under the auspices of the Latin Church, though some (again like the Jesuits) have special tracks for priests from the the various Eastern churches as well.",

I know my father's department really well, and there are very few actual Jesuits among the faculty, though he did tell me there are a couple of priests who are also PhDs who teach on campus.  That said, you should get comfortable with prayer at faculty meetings and events (if this bothers you), and (this is more important IMO), I taught a public health course and was explicitly told by the chair that I am not to mention contraception or abortion in the course. Luckily, I was teaching a statistics course, so it wasn't an issue, but there is some limit on academic freedom (and maybe even the kind of research you can do? Not sure).

A lecturer in the dept I taught at for a year was, and a number of admin. \n\nThey are generally open-minded, and where I taught they said they were open to people of all faiths, and those with no faith. The latter was a big deal, and they commented on it frequently. The Jesuits have some ideas about community involvement and social justice that are good to understand if you are in the social sciences/humanities. They told me stories of being involved in civil rights marches, but they did not get gender issues. Many faculty found it difficult to engage as they wanted to around this issue and most did not talk about abortion and contraception, even if it was relevant to their discipline. \n\nFor my annual review, I was asked about my understanding of what it meant to be Jesuit - not that I personally was, but to reflect on the identity of a Jesuit institution and how I fit in there, what I brought to it, etc. \n\nOn a lighter note, the food at receptions and events was always great. The joke was that since the jesuits (allegedly) were abstinent they emphasized other sensual pleasures.",

I actually love the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm, which encourages experiential learning and reflective practices.

Birth control was excluded from my medical plan and had to come separately since they claimed religious exemption. I also do not think IVF is covered at a lot of institutions. The health center doesn't give out condoms (but the Biology department does!). You'll also unexpectedly find out your colleague is anti-choice when it comes to abortion, and that's a topic of conversation that might casually come up in a meeting.
