  "title:": "What motivates you to write journal papers?",
  "text": "One major hangup that I'm still dealing with is finding the interest, let alone motivation, to actually write journal papers. What I do find motivating is discovery and creation, and then getting that knowledge and those tools that I find/create into the hands of \"the masses\".\n\nI personally am more interested in actually improving lives than getting recognition for that fact from academia. And knowing that any given journal paper (even the most cited ones) will be read by, comparatively, no one, just sucks the remaining life out of the task.\n\nYes, it's the coin of the realm, and necessary for advancement/tenure/prestige. But lots of things are necessary in anyones life, that no one likes doing\u2014and some things are only done under the threat of punishment (taxes, anyone?).\n\nSo, how do you motivate yourself to -want- to write journal papers?\n\n**(Minor clarification for the few that have been misreading this:** I am not against publishing in any way. I'm seeking the perspective of others, to get a sense of what motivates you, either intrinsically (or extrinsically), in the hopes of finding a change in perspective for myself.)",

Academic research is collaborative by necessity, and publication is part of that collaborative nature. Think about all of the papers you have read which have formed the basis of knowledge for your own research - without all of that work done before your own work, you would have been forced to start from scratch and would probably have accomplished nothing besides replicating work already done. In the same way, your own work needs to be published not to \"get recognition\" but to contribute to the broad base of scientific knowledge which other researchers can use to conduct their own work. \n\nYou complain about publication record being \"the coin of the realm\", and that is true to a degree which is almost certainly overrated (as with most easily-measurable metrics), but this the reason *why* publications are considered so critical - as a tangible record of your contribution to the broader advancement of knowledge which others can use to make their own future contributions.\n\nOf course this is a rather idealistic conception of publication, and the reality is (as with all things in life) much messier and frequently obscured by inanities - nasty reviewers, salami-slicing, fabrication, and so on. But beneath the messy reality there *is* a purpose to the whole affair which is worth keeping in mind.",

I got into academia -after- creating a product.

However, then you open the whole can of worms that is (still 95+% of) published science: the whole analysis chain, and even raw data to get to those graphs and tables, is never even reviewed by the peer reviewers (if they would even fully understand all of it anyways), let alone the ultimate readers of the paper. Yes, replication attempts can catch the bad actors, but with millions of papers published each year, most experiments will never receive that treatment, and are way too often taken on face value (if it fits the researcher's preconceived notions, and dismissed, if it does not).",

And even within the same field, there are regular stories of papers that gathered dust until decades later when someone finally understood how important the finding was.\n\nMy thinking has been if it's between knowing that my co-authors and peer reviewers are the the only people who will certainly (maybe) mostly read the papers I write, versus me getting a product into hands that I can see... well, one seems like it would be more gratifying than the other.",

And in some fields advertisement over e.g. Twitter is also becoming more and more important, which is nice because it creates a bit more direct feedback.  \nOverall I think, while you of course can't get rid of publishing, maybe part of the solution for you would trying to find out, if you find any other way to \"spread your science\" more satisfying, which of course would also have a positive impact on your papers and possibly help with motivation because you can see how much buzz they create?",

I am not sure how things work for you but what you described is pretty much how I and many of my colleagues work. You have a problem, you come up with ideas, you test the ideas and if they don't work you try a different idea.

Similar with you, my personal motivation in working as researcher is to improve my quality of life (financial, peaceful life, etc).\n\nDue to my past experience, I am aiming to have a life with a bit of more freedom, which I find to be there more for researchers/uni lecturers rather than in the industry (although the payment would be much better, though). However, I realize that in order to achieve that \"freedom\", I must climb up through the ladder and obtain a certain level of rank (degree, professorship, etc), and to climb that ladder, I need to understand and follow the \"currency\" that matters there.\n\nFor better or worse, academia nowadays still places journal papers as one of the better currencies (alongside grants, patent, etc). That is what motivates me to write as better as I can right now.",

      "text": "As an engineer, I wasn\u2019t really taught how to write and then suddenly grad school demanded I write a lot. It was torture. I approached it like a chore, and my drafts were ramblings that took forever to edit. \n\nI determined that if I was going to do research, I had to learn how to write. I read several books on writing, including \u201chow to write a lot\u201d and \u201con writing well\u201d. I went to seminars and watched YouTube videos. That\u2019s when I learned I didn\u2019t previously actually know how to write, I just thought I did. I came to see that writing is more about arguments, ideas, and conversations rather than just the chore of scribbling down results. \n\nI genuinely like writing now. It\u2019s so creative and helps me explore my ideas. I never really understand and fully develop my arguments until I write them out. It\u2019s also kinda algorithmic (it uses story structure, topic sentences, etc.) which really appeals to my engineering brain. I write every morning! It\u2019s fun.\n\nIf you find it a bummer that nobody would read your paper, it\u2019s probably because you write it boring. If you think it\u2019s boring, the reader will definitely find it boring. Some papers and unintelligible mush that are very technical and clearly had a lot of work behind them, but are not well written and do not make it accessible for a reader. No matter what the field, there are ways to setup the arguments of why you did your experiment, and what your interpretation of the results are that are very compelling to read. There are awesome papers out there that are easy to ready and easy to follow their arguments.",
