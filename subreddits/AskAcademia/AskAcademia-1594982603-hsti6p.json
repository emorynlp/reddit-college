          "text": "I've heard about this paper for a while, since it's always garnered some attention for its unconventional pairing of topics (e.g. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/qa-author-feminist-glaciology-study-reflects-sudden-appearance-culture-wars](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/qa-author-feminist-glaciology-study-reflects-sudden-appearance-culture-wars)). So I finally decided to take a look at it, with focus on \"alternative representations of glaciers\" as mentioned below. A lot of the paper is couched in theory and discourse that's far removed from my own academic field (and personal priorities), but I found some good food for thought in there.  \n\n\n\"\\[...\\] feminist glaciology framework asks that researchers accept a plurality of knowledges and recognize embedded systems of domination. The goal is neither to force glaciologists to believe that glaciers listen nor to make indigenous peoples put their full faith in scientists\u2019 mathematical equations and computer-generated models (devoid of meaning, spirituality, and reciprocal human-nature relationships).  Rather, the goal is to understand that environmental knowledge is always based in systems of power discrepancies and unequal social relations, and overcoming these disparities requires accepting that multiple knowledges exist and are valid within their own contexts. \"  \n\n\nIt's something worth chewing on as we, hopefully now more than ever, reconsider the implicit biases and hegemonic discourses that persist in many scientific fields (especially in the natural sciences) as legacies of their colonialist histories.",

Scientific knowledge is so valuable precisely because it is culture-agnostic and accessible to anyone who puts in the work to apply the models. The roots of the scientific method and its foundational knowledge didn't emerge solely from European countries, either. \n\nWhatever \"implicit biases\" science has, it has far fewer than these \"critical theoretic\" approaches have, entirely because the scientific method is a methodology created over many centuries based on the way humans think at a pretty rudimentary level (cause and effect, proof, etc.). It is so reliable and useful because it generates provably shareable knowledge that can be applied towards tangible outcomes in the form of engineering. It is so reliable and useful because it has a built-in mechanism for identifying and correcting its own mistakes and internal contradictions over time - this doesn't appear to be the case with \"theory.\"\n\nEdit - whoever downvoted me is welcome to explain how forager societies develop knowledge about how to exploit their ecosystem in a way that is not essentially scientific in nature",
