  "text": "Here is mine.\n\nI spent three months abroad at a laboratory in Spain. The experiments required that I was there on the weekends. I only spoke a little Spanish and on weekends the university was practically empty except security, so I was often there alone.\n\nOne weekend the security guard came down to the lab and started talking in Spanish to me. I couldn't follow everything he said, but I thought he said that he had to inspect a nearby building so my building would be empty for a while.\n\nA couple hours later I had finished for the day and went to the security desk. They have to lock you out - if I left at my own volition the doors unlock behind me and anyone can enter.\n\nThe desk was empty. No security guard.\n\nI looked around and down the hall was an open door with light coming out. I presumed it was the security offices or something. I peered around the corner and this is what I saw:\nThe security guard from earlier sat naked on a chair, legs crossed, staring into space. The chair was in the middle of the room. It was an office, not a changing room.\n\nEmbarassed, I walked away and was to about leave, but remembered I couldn't. I waited a few minutes and then approached again, this time making loud footsteps and knocking the wall. When I looked this time, the guard had gotten dressed and was buttoning his shirt. He asked if I was leaving and I said yes. He let me out and I left.\n\nI told my colleagues this, and now this is has become the highlight of my stay abroad. Even my hosts and colleagues in Spain first and foremost remember this incident better than anything else from my stay. The host professor wanted to know who it was, but I only saw the guard once after this, and none of my Spanish colleagues were with me that time.\n\nTL;DR walked in on naked security guard during stay abroad.",

I started trying to convince everyone that I thought someone was living in the building.  There were private showers in the building, empty offices, it was perfect.  No one believes me until we walked around and opened all the empty offices.  There it was, a room filled with axe body spray, clothes, a computer, etc.  An undergrad had been living in our locked building.",

(We didn't really speak at first as our schedules were a bit different but I saw their lanyards lying around.) The third one was a regular tourist.\n\nOne of the two fellow scientists was an man in his forties, a quiet fellow and seemingly pleasant. One evening we started talking before going to sleep. We were sitting on our beds, discussing the struggles of working in academia, me in my PJs, him in his underwear (he had been quite comfortable shuffling around the room like that all week, though not in a creepy way). The next day, I wandered around the conference halls thinking about how I'd feel if I met him again, back in a professional context, and the whole thing felt absolutely comical. I didn't see him again, though, but I still think of him as the Prof-I-Saw-In-Underpants and it brightens my day.",

      "text": "When I started my PhD there was a first-year guy from Nicaragua who I shared some classes with.  He seemed smart but was a very odd fellow, he never talked to anybody outside of the classroom and inside it it seemed he felt he knew more than the professors. Entire class periods wasted on him arguing random shit with the professor in turn. He was extremely stubborn; if he had a preconceived concept or opinion no amount of evidence would change his mind.\n\nOne day halfway into our first semester a couple of students and I finally managed to make some small talk with him. We asked him what were his goals and fields of interest. He said \"I will not stop until I win the Nobel Prize for Computer Science\". When we told him there was no such prize, he did not believe us (obviously). After like 20 minutes of arguing we showed him online that it, in fact, did not exist. He was SHOOK. His life mission cut short because he did not bother to do basic research before declaring it. Oh, and he did not care one bit for the Turing Award. It was Nobel or bust. \n\nThat conversation was the last time any of us saw him.",

      "text": "Throw away because people that know me would recognize this list immediately!\n\n1) During my first month as a lab tech a very prominent researcher in a neighboring lab became infected with the BSL2 pathogen they were working with and died within 24 hours. The floor was closed and we were under investigation by multiple agencies and eventually they found there were no systemic issues with safety. Unofficially it's assumed the pathogen entered their body while they took a medication in the lab.  Their family visited and we had on campus services eulogies etc. Horrible for everyone in every way.\n\n2) My second lab tech job, the professor \"forgot\" my agreement for employment was 20 months (not 24 months, because I would want to start graduate school after my second summer in the lab) so when I asked for a recommendation letter to apply to grad school he basically said no because he \"only hires people who guarantee two full years in the lab, and if you go to grad school it will only be 20 months\". Multiple post-docs in the lab (who I worked under) had to basically convince him that he was wrong and just didn't remember that he said that \"I seemed so capable that I wouldn't need a lot of training time, so 20 months instead of 24 months isn't a big deal\" when he hired me. Almost didn't get into grad school.\n\n3) My first day as a rotation student in my PhD program there was a bomb threat on campus, while we were in lab meeting.  The professor told us not to worry about it,  it was probably just someone who didn't want to take their first exam of the semester, and we kept meeting!  The entire campus was closed and evacuated, we could see the streets flooding with people from our office window, and no one said anything.  As a the new guy I couldn't speak up.  Someone's spouse saw it on the news and called/texted them basically demanding they leave. The prof. said \"OK fine\" and that one person left, no one else got up.  Lab meeting ended and the professor said we could leave campus if we wanted to.  Everyone left. Basically could have gotten blown up because the professor didn't want to obey a bomb threat evacuation order and no one else in the lab would stand up to say we should leave. I didn't join that lab.\n\n4) Two members of this lab divorced their spouse/broke up with significant other to be together and are now married.\n\n4) During one of my rotations one of the graduate students in the lab committed suicide in their home, unrelated to their PhD work. We found out when lab members went to check on them when they didn't show up to the lab. Family visited the lab, on and off campus services. Horrible for everyone.\n\n5) In the lab I ended up joining, the professor got a new prof. job in a different state and moved mid-way during my PhD.\n\n6) The first post-doc lab I joined, which I moved across the country for...the full tenured professor was \"let go\" with absolutely zero reason given to us as to why, which no amount of demanding to the prof, department, and president would reveal (private institution). The whole lab of almost 20 people shut down within 9 months of me joining. \n\n7) Moved across the country again for my current and technically \"second\" post-doc and now there's a global pandemic. \n\nTLDR: I. AM. CURSED. People literally are dying or losing their jobs everywhere I go.",

We got the emergency alerts and told the professor, but he didn't take it seriously and continued teaching. We sat there and watched all the other classes let out and get directed into the inner hallways by campus security. He finally let us leave after a student panicked and ran out, but he acted like we were being dramatic. I'm not sure why people like your professor and mine are willing to risk injury or worse for stuff that can easily be rescheduled.",

That\u2019s not BSL2.\n\nBeyond underlying health conditions that might make someone more susceptible to a BSL2 like above,  that's just not true, many BSL2 pathogens can cause blood infections if they access your bloodstream which can kill much faster than 24 hours. This is why contaminated sharps are the biggest hazard for BSL2 work, Beyond blood infections, S. aureus (BSL2) can cause rapid lethal pneumonia where death occurs within 12 hours of symptoms appearing.  Obviously if you follow safety protocols there's nothing to worry about! But just because it's BSL2 doesn't mean it's not deadly.",

It sounded like two intoxicated people. This was a random Tuesday night in the middle of the semester, so there was no one else around. I take a peek outside and I see the grad student from the next-door lab, and he was talking with a woman who also looked around the same age. \n\nI couldn't tell what was going on because they seemed intoxicated, but it didn't appear anyone was in danger and it seemed like he was trying to tell her to keep it down. She seemed to be explaining something while almost yelling. \n\nSo, not concerned (and they didn't notice me) so I went back to work. A few minutes later I hear giggling and what I think is muffled moaning. At first, I thought my ears are playing tricks on me. Then it gets louder and louder. This was all clearly in the hallway btw.\n\n I didn't poke my head outside my lab again because I was in the middle of a procedure. So there I was, trying to concentrate on the work in front of me, while two people are, what it sounds like, loudly shagging outside in the hallway about 10 ft from my lab.\n\nWhen I left to go home later, no one was around and I didn't really want to inspect the hallway too closely.

The office had a closing/lockable door from our lab and also had several bookshelves that lined the room. 12\u2019 ceilings. Our lab had three total of these offices. Carpeted floors. \n\nOne day I came in around 10am and people were in a panic in specifically our office. The flat surfaces of the entire room had been covered in... oil? There are 6+ grad students and post docs who couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. We also didn\u2019t know what kind of oil or where it came from, but it was definitely oil and it was definitely on all the flat surfaces. Talking a few hundred mL in total, so not a small amount either.\n\nThe options for where it came from were the door itself, the air ducts, the sprinkler system and the lights, none of which made sense for the location of the most oil spots, spray pattern or amounts.\n\nThat office had a locked door in a locked vestibule accessed by a separate key, so there were two locked doors to get into in our office and you could only get in our building/hallway via keycard access at two separate points.\n\nOur literal best guess was someone took some sort of oil, put it in a turkey basted or syringe and spun around in a Rollie-chair in the middle of the room while spraying a significant amount of oil everywhere. They were at least nice enough to roll the rest of the chairs out first since they were all clean? Still not likely, but yeah we had everything else ruled out for various reasons.\n\nAlso, had I left my laptop there that night, it would have been oiled like everything else... and I defended later that summer. So glad I carted that sucker home.\n\nTl;dr: our office got sprayed with oil and there\u2019s no viable explanation for it",

I will also admit that when it happened I did think perhaps it was a cultural thing, but it clearly wasn't. Not to mention that this story circulated around the entire department of the Spanish university and everyone thought it was so bizarre.\n\nSo no, this is not normal :) if you disagree and think its okay to walk around your workplace naked, thats fine and you are entitled to your opinion.
