  "text": "Hey guys, I have written and submitted a 20,000-word dissertation for my master in Computer Science. I forgot to remove three revision comments from my supervisor in the word document, and I'm going insane about it as now I'm past submission. I'm just wondering how severe is the consequence of this mistake?",

I looked at it after I got my results back, and yup...I'd left a whole sentence unfinished in the introduction. I remember thinking \"I'll come back and finish this paragraph later\" and apparently I never did, so there's just a sentence that ends halfway through, right there in the intro. But I still got a distinction, and a distinction overall for my MSc.\n\nIt'll be fine. No one expects 100% perfection with no mistakes for an MSc or undergrad dissertation. Chill and relax, you've done the hard work :)",
