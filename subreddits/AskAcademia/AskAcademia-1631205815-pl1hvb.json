  "text": "Let me preface this by saying I am a senior undergraduate student in the medical engineering area, leaning heavily on neuroengineering and microtechnologies.\n\nAs I near the end of my degree, I see two paths I want to follow: R&D, or academia. I have little experience in both, so it's not like both are completely unexplored (fortunately) for me. \n\nI want to make educated decisions, such as what type of masters to pursue, where I want to live, how it would be best to handle personal finances, etc. And to do this, I would like to decide what I want to do long term. I understand that these two paths are not mutually exclusive, nor is it impossible to transition from one to the other.\n\nHaving said that, I wanted to ask you as a community, what have you sacrificed (at any level) to have a career in academia?",

      "text": "Lucrative programming career. I was a self taught coder back in 2013, found a job even. Found out capitalist work for profit was not for me, and developed an interest in social sciences. Fall 19 I was starting a programme in literature. From there on it's been a rocky road, with lots of exploration and self doubting and searching where to express myself, yet fulfilling. But if I hadn't left programming I'd have lifted myself out of poverty and would probably be making a lot of money and would not have this much debt. Not having money is annoying sometimes but personally IDGAF, and family have been supportive within their means. Tho for PhD I'll be depending on institutional money, either wages or scholarship/stipend or whatever.\n\nOther stuff IMO depends on what you're after. If you are after competitive positions, likely life will be harder as they are very demanding. If you don't care about names of institutions and looking for a decent place to just do science, I suppose it should be easier. Personally I am shooting for more northern parts of Europe as my academic interests are popular and well funded there and in most places they seem to take stability and work-life balance as seriously as they do research itself, and I really care about that personally. I don't mind if my uni is among top 10, 50 or 100, so long as I am not consumed by it.",

              "text": "Thanks :)\n\nSadly there's a lot of hustle culture in academia, and I see people pushing for academic positions despite having no scientific drive, and pushing on despite seeming to not want to. Now academia is a seriously abrasive place that has attracted a lot of abusers and in dire need of reforms and improvements so that the power imbalances are dealt with and hierarchies are removed, but I am not referring to people who suffer from the effects and externalities of this situation. I mean there are a lot of people who apparently don't want to learn, research nor teach, but still stay in academia for reasons unknown to me.\n\nTo me, academia is a means to an end, the end being, I enjoy learning researching and teaching and I hope that academia can allow me to do that. And for me it's strong enough that I don't worry about giving up a thing or two to arrive there. I guess another source of frustration is that people don't make that decision that \"I give up these things because I will pursue those things\" *before* their foray into postgrad and academia, and the challenges are a surprise. For me, I didn't know it sucked *this much*, but I know what I would give up and what challenges I'd take on, and that helps a lot. Should those challenges exist? No of course. But I'd rather chase my dreams *and* aspire to help remove those challenges rather than wait around. But if you or someone else feel differently about it, it's equally valid IMO. People like attaching nonsensical stigma to everything but life is a series of trade offs and we gotta do those so that we're harming nobody, we're in peace internally and we're happy. At least that's how I approach life.\n\nWishing you success in whatever goals you're pursuing! :)",

              "text": "Yes. You do have more say in what you research as a professor. With the caveat that you need to apply for funding from grant agencies, which does affect the research that you propose to a degree. With industry, a lot of the choice of what you research happens when you apply for jobs .. you look for a research team that's a good fit for you to be a part of / you agree with their mission. \n\nIt depends on the research field too. In certain areas the cutting edge research does not happen at universities.\n\nThe point I was making was don't fall into the trap that universities are the only good research environments out there. If you care a lot about higher education teaching too, then being a professor is clearly the better choice.",

Nothing wrong with administrative jobs, I worked a part-time HR job for a year and learnt a lot, everyone seemed happy and relaxed. I tried really hard, but I could not for the love of me find motivation or meaning in what I did. The research projects I have been involved in have been the opposite for me, thrilling!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, the main reason for making my choice between academia and industry is the type of masters that will be the most useful, and the type of entry jobs I will be searching. I have already been thinking about it for a couple months, and I feel confident right now in taking a shot, at least for a decade or two, at industry career...",
