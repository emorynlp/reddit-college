  "text": "I\u2019m hoping someone can advise on my situation. I started an unfunded PhD in the UK 3.5 years ago and have submitted my thesis yesterday. I was told multiple times to not accept an unfunded PhD, but I did not heed that advice. Instead, I took on multiple jobs in addition to TAing throughout the three years, before finally securing funding from a few sources during my final year.\n\nI was also offered two jobs a month ago at my University. Both are research assistant positions for two funded projects. However, the PI\u2019s have been vague about how long they plan on employing me for. Everything seems up in the air and work deadlines keep changing. \n\nI realise how lucky I am to have received these opportunities, but I am in a very awkward position. I am completely burnt out and exhausted. For nearly three years I haven\u2019t been able to get more than 5 hours of sleep, juggling both my PhD work and any employment to keep me afloat. This also made it very hard to apply for postdoc positions before submitting my thesis (i have read you should start applying at least 6 months before submitting your thesis), but I was not motivated, I just wanted to make it to the end of the day alive. I\u2019ve developed some medical issues due to stress over the same period, which hasn\u2019t made it easy. \n\nI feel lost. I enjoy research but my exhaustion has left me unable to apply for jobs. I can\u2019t even bear to look for postdoc opportunities or reach out to potential PIs. I also feel like I have let myself down by not applying for postdocs at the beginning of this year and waiting till after I had submitted to start thinking about my future. I feel like a failure who, unlike other PhD graduates, was unable to secure an academic job and is no longer passionate about anything. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what my question is\u2026 maybe a little perspective will help?",

      "text": "OK, breathe.\n\nI too ended up self funding my PhD, and paid my way through by picking up visiting lecturer status at the department (I had a lot of existing experience and a teaching qualification - this isn't a route I've seen anyone else succesfully navigate, so if you're a drive-by reader don't get your hopes up).\n\nI too burnt out a bit, and in the race to finish botched the postdoc application window. You are not a failure - it is a simple result of trying to push through without the structured support of a funded DTP etc.\n\nSome things you need to know:\n\n1. This situation is recoverable\n2. This situation is difficult. Academic momentum is real.\n\nIt seems to me like the solution to your situation is actually sat right in front of you though. You don't ned to be in love with either of the projects you've been offered, but working on another PIs project will be a nice change of suject area (that in itself is quite refreshing), provides an opportunity for more future collaboration and breadth in your expertise, and also gives you a window of time where you can step back a little and start to think about seriously applying for postdocs. You don't need to do that right away - these jobs will fill that gap for you. The added bonus is that if they haven't got a strict timeline in view, no-one is going to be upset if you turn around in 3 or 6 months with a sudden offer in hand to go elsewhere.\n\nSome things to consider when talking to these 2 PI's - have they got a firm idea of what it is you would be doing? What are they like to work with? Find the project with the PI that you think is most understanding of your situation, and who hasn't got tons of other demands on their time.",

          "text": "It's worth adding that, all RA jobs have a fixed contract. This is because they are paid for by a funder as part a fixed term project. HR won't let the position exist without a fixed contract. Find out how long the contracts are for. If the PI is vague it's probably because he or she thinks that they might be able to get follow on funding to extend the position. However the PI is only placing a bet on that happening. They can't guarantee it. You need to know how long the basic contract will be. This is your worst case scenario. If the PI still won't tell you, then HR will, but that in itself might be a red flag.",

              "text": "This isn't totally correct. RA positions at universities are generally fixed contract, although not even then because once the contract has been renewed a number of times it becomes permanent I believe, or at least you have to be made redundant when the funding runs out. However, RA positions at research institutes can be permanent jobs. We have hundreds of RAs where I work and the majority are permanent. But they're also junior roles and the majority don't hold PhDs. There are good career prospects for RAs with ambition but not in the academic track and for most middle management type level is really the ceiling. \n\nPersonally I don't think OP should take an RA role. I think it will be harder to get a postdoc from there and they'll struggle to recover from the burnout. If they really want an academic career they might just be better taking time out and recovering. I took a job working in a school office for 6 months and landed a good postdoc when I was ready.",

People I know had plenty of publication by year 4, which is our main requirement\u2026 but they won\u2019t let us leave at least until 5.5 years in. Most of us will be done in 6 years.\n\nI honestly think the system here just uses us as cheap labor. I absolutely could have left in 4.4 years when I got my shit together but am now aiming for 6 with pubs and my PI is coaxing me to stay til year 7. It\u2019s fffcked.\n\nIf we all aimed for 4 years we could absolutely do it. I honestly have felt like a postdoc in terms of my skill level for the last 1.5 years but without the salary.",

It just feels like your brains all foggy, and I think that\u2019s when you\u2019re at most risk of making terrible, terrible decisions.\r  \n\r  \nBut yes, as others have said, it is different in the UK because you do come in with a (more or less) defined project and are expected to jump straight into it.
