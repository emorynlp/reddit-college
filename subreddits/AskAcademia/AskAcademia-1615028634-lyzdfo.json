  "title:": "Is it insane to withdraw my first authorship on a submitted (not yet accepted) manuscript because I want to dissociate myself from my toxic ex-PI?",
  "text": "I have a personal bond with the last chapter of my PhD thesis\u2014I pulled it out of my ass during a make-it-or-break-it time of my degree, and I view it as the project where I gained the most amount of independence in science.\n\nI did not leave on good terms with my PI.  She was toxic.  In the end, I had to choose between finishing my project and leaving the lab with my sanity intact.  It was difficult but ultimately I chose the latter, even though I wanted really badly to finish developing the last bits of my story.\n\nFast forward two years later: my ex-PI has reached out with a manuscript.  She has added a few new authors, to which I have no objection.  What I do object to is that one of the new authors has been made a co-first author (I am first co-first author), when the manuscript still appears to look very similar to the chapter that\u2019s already in my (publicly available, \u201cpublished\u201d) thesis.  How similar?  In my thesis I had at least 4 full-page figures, and these were all reused, with maybe a few quants redone and a couple of single-quant supplementary figures added.  I asked why I wasn\u2019t informed of the addition of the co-first author and was dismissed with a non-answer.  Fine, it\u2019s your lab, do what you want.  It\u2019s not even that I\u2019m objecting to this addition necessarily.  It\u2019s that I had no say nor was I ever informed of this, not even in the body of the email in which the manuscript was sent.  I have even reached out to the other co-first author and even they said that they were under the impression that they would have second authorship until days before the manuscript was sent to me.  This is an example of the toxicity that I am thankful to have escaped.\n\nMy ex-PI rushed me to give my consent for submission, which happened this week.  I now wonder if it\u2019s completely stupid for me to withdraw my name from the paper?  My reasoning:\n\n1) The two years since cutting my PI out of my life have been liberating, and my mental health has never been better.  She gets back in touch this week and has already wreaked this much havoc.  Withdrawing my name means I cut off my last tie with her forever, sparing me of having to be in touch with her during the revision/resubmission period.  \n\n2) I have successfully transitioned myself out of academia.  I do not necessarily need this publication on my CV.\n\n3) As I mentioned, I do have a personal connection with the story.  If I withdraw, then my name is associated only with the version of the story I really care about, which is the version in my thesis (of which, of course, I am rightfully sole first author).\n\n4) Everyone else gets a bump in authorship so it\u2019s not like their work goes unnoticed\u2014maybe even the opposite?\n\nAm I missing something?  Is this a stupid thing to do?  Is it even possible to do at this point?  Are there any glaringly obvious negatives (outside of me missing out on this publication)?  Thanks for sticking with me to the end of this post\u2014appreciate it!",

And even if OP doesn't return to academia, there are some industry careers (more research-based) that also care about publications.\n\nAlso check who the corresponding author is, OP, and figure out if you want that to be you or someone else. If someone reaches out about the paper, that could cause more discussions that might loop in your icky PI depending how that's constructed. If she gets a question/comment she doesn't know, is she going to ask you? Or can you request your co-first author to handle all that. Or if you're corresp author and you get questions about this work, will that bring up bad memories?",

Being co-first has not hurt me one bit. So this may be field dependent, dependent on whether your PI/mentor promotes your work/efforts, and also dependent on what you do after the paper comes out, since the first co-first went to establish her lab and moved on to a different field. As a result of this experience I encourage all my trainees to collaborate more and to partner with individuals with complementary expertise to make better and more impactful papers. What you\u2019ve mentioned here is quite old school and does not really apply to clinical departments anymore where collaboration and big papers and team science are more highly prized (since they also justify bringing in bigger U and P grants).",

Also, there is a big difference between being second/third/whatever co-first author and second authorship.

You shouldn't phrase it this way, ever. She is doing HERSELF a favor. She needs the pub, not OP. She IS trying to do it the \"right\" way, by making sure she bounces this off OP, but she's essentially wrenching control from them by including her own co-author.\n\n u/cilantrobomb I see no problem with walking away and leaving it in her lap. It really won't hurt you. I think people saying this are still stuck in that \"but it's a publication!\" mode.\n\nThere's very little cost in either direction materially, that is true. If the mental cost is large, just walk away. This is the thing folks in academia are trained to ignore, and it actually costs us more than we realize.",

PI is acting in her own self-interest. OP should NOT have taken care of this a while ago. They left the lab, and they left those responsibilities. That's actually on toxic PI. PI had the chance to help the student to do it and they failed. PI can certainly still work to get the pub out, that's fine. But it need have nothing to do with OP except that PI acknowledge the work OP did. And OP does have the power to disavow the work and take their name off the paper. No one can force you to publish. PI has gotten themselves, ethically, into a tight spot and is trying to squeeze out. That's fine, that's the right move for her, but OP owes them nothing.  \n\n\nThis is that weird holdover attitude in academia that you somehow need to keep doing work you're not being paid for. That works if you're continuing on in academia, because those papers benefit you, but not if you've left.  \n\n\nOP has essentially uncovered a flaw in the system, and I think it's messing with people here a bit.

It doesn't sound like they're asking for the OP to do anything or much of anything.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, a dissertation is the last step in a phd, and publishing it yourself shows that you've moved from student to the next step.  I don't think it is in the PIs responsibility to take it across the finish line.  It isn't uncommon for a PhD to publish after graduation, but after a couple years it isn't crazy for the PI to give a nudge to get it done.\n\n\nTo me, it seems like the OPs real objection here is the second author, likely suffering under the same PI, who has done what the OP should have done in the name of professionalism.  Certainly they can take their name off it/etc, but it strikes me as petty and fails to give any credit to the 2nd author who probably got this back on track.",

In my former lab there was a pretty bad conflict with a PI and a student who contributed to a paper that resulted in the student withdrawing from the paper. The paper had to be reworked to exclude their contributions in order for the PI to still publish it.\n\nTalk to somebody who is knowledgable on this (maybe a professor you are still on good terms with). If your withdrawal would prevent the paper from being published, it sounds like your PI might throw a fit resulting in even more conflict.

If you\u2019re not involved at all in finishing it, I\u2019d bring in another author to be co (or even sole) first author. Its a bummer communication wasn\u2019t good around the decision, but to some extent you didn\u2019t communicate at all so.... I don\u2019t think you have a lot to stand on here. Again it\u2019s really terrible it was so toxic, but in this case particularly I don\u2019t think the PI did much wrong. It seems best just to go with it (and let the other co deal with revisions). Best wishes.\n\nEdit: alternatively, I think pulling your name is totally fine if you want to simply dissociate from toxic PI. My original point is mostly - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to pull your name for a perceived injustice on this particular instance (because I don\u2019t think what they did, on this particular instance, is that bad)",

I struggle with the idea that co-firsts should be putting in an equal amount of work, and right now it\u2019s not there.  My chapter was missing maybe 1-3 experiments, but they were by no means key.  I do think it was publishable in lesser journals, which wasn\u2019t what my PI had wanted\u2014fair, and understood, and again, I\u2019m fully grateful for the work that the co-first has done to bring it to where it is.  The other issue was the lack of communication.  Honestly if it had been brought up to me during revisions and we had decided as a group to promote the other co-first then, then this would hurt much less.  But in line with what others and you have both said, maybe this is the eventual outcome anyways and ten years down the line this would just be a minor blip.  Thank you for your input and your well wishes =)",

I have been tasked with compiling data from various sources, reanalyzing data, generating figures, editing/writing the manuscript, running final experiments, doing revisions when the reviewer comments come back, etc. It's a lot of work,  and I definitely deserve co-first authorship. Especially since you aren't around to run the revision experiments from the reviewers, someone else deserves recognition for the work they are doing. And the experiments that were missing from your paper were not key, in your opinion. Clearly the professor figured that some extra experiments would get the paper more impact, so it makes sense that there would be another co fist author, since you are unavailable. The projects of the PI must continue after you leave, and this way you get the authorship and none of the headache of rivisions. \n\nAs for the lack of communication, what did you expect the authorship to look like? You left the project before it was completed, and someone else had to compile everything and bring it over the finish line. It sucks that you feel blindsided, but what could you have expected your prof to do? Let a publication (which equals grant money in PI's eyes) die because you are gone? At least you're getting positive output from your toxic experience, right?",

From the PI perspective it's not just a want about lesser vs. higher journals -- it's whether I can get tenure and keep my job, whether I'll get my next grant and be able to keep the lights on. I totally believe you that your PI is toxic and you made the right choice for you, but it's also toxic for the rest of the lab to not finish the paper as high as possible and keep everyone employed. This needs \\*someone\\* to volunteer to finish it and if the only way that would happen is with co-first, that's how it should go. They \\*absolutely\\* should have discussed it with you, but I think the authorship is valid. (I have seen many posts like this in PI-only forums that would argue that you should be demoted to second author because you don't \"need\" this paper and the first author's job is to carry the post over the finish line.  I disagree with that, but think co-first is important).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, you're not playing the academic game right now so don't let your toxic PI hurt you. A co-first author paper is great, you deserve it, don't cut off your nose to spite your face and let your co-first tank the PI's toxicity.",

At least you are still the first of a co-first in a to be submitted manuscript. \n\nI was the 3rd co-first in my first publication. First author started the project and left for industry without wrapping up or add any new novelty to the field, second co-first had a few piece of data that will help to strengthen the paper and he also left for industry. And then there was me who had to painstakingly repeat some of the crucial experiments by 1 and 2, write the manuscript to fit the model that we proposed and did the entire reviewing and the list of experiments attached to it. My PI noticed that I intentionally swapped the co-first authorship order in the revised draft and we sat down and talked. He offered me the spot as first but somehow at that instant I have a conscience and didnt accept it. I was just under a lot of stress at the time revising the paper all by myself when author 1 and 2 ceased all communication and only showed up for self-applause after the paper was accepted.  So the authorship list stays. I became the person that people will contact whenever there's questions about the paper (sharing of reagents, protocols etc). \n\nI've seen PIs who intentionally swap the order of the co-first  after the revision process so that the person who did the current work gets to be bumped up and remain loyal. So that might be something that you might need to make a mental note about. \n\nOn a separate note, when I see papers with very few authors list, I grew very suspicious of the ability of a person to function cohesively in a team. Once saw a Cancer Cell (IF 26.6) paper with only 2 names (postdoc and PI) and my red flag sensors automatically light up.",

I see it very frequently in the field I copyedit for, which also routinely provides specific author contributions so it's very clear who did what. I see it less often in the field I publish in, but as far as I can tell, it's regarded in my field as a first-author paper for CV purposes even if you're the second \"co-first.\"\n\nPublishing norms differ a LOT from one field to another. Some side-eye CVs that only have papers with lots of authors, on the premise that it's hard to tell if you have your own ideas; other people in these comments apparently look with suspicion on papers with only one or two authors because maybe you're not a team player; some fields have the whole range.",

      "text": "So, a similar situation happened in a neighboring laboratory when I was in my postdoc. The toxic PI changed author order without consulting the authors. So, the first author (who had left and started his own faculty position) basically said, \u201cfuck you, that\u2019s unethical\u201d and killed the manuscript so it wouldn\u2019t be published ever. You can do the same. It\u2019s your data, your writing, and you can tell the publisher that it\u2019s plagiarism and provide evidence if the PI tries. Before all that, tell the PI under no uncertain terms that you, and only you wrote this and did the majority of work, so you\u2019re the first author alone. Also say that if that\u2019s not to their liking, that you will inform the publisher and kill the manuscript. \n\nThe reason to do this is because although you lose a paper, this very negatively affects your ex-PI\u2019s career at the university and with grants. If they can\u2019t produce, they might lose their next raise/ promotion. If they don\u2019t publish on their grants, then it will prevent them from getting funding. One paper doesn\u2019t ruin them, but it sends a powerful message and creates a whole lot of pain. Particularly because everyone in the department will gossip about it and the head of the department will get annoyed with them.",

          "text": "While some will resort to pulling and killing the manuscript, it also depends on what research data ownership belongs to.\n\nIn the example you provided, the first author is already protected with a faculty position in the bag and so the influence of the former PI might be less ( unless in gran review cycles).\n\nI've also seen PIs (department chairs even) who intentionally sat on data that was left behind after a toxic break-up with a student/postdoc and then just bid the time before new blood cycles in and re-do all the necessary experiments or even better. I was frankly surprised at such a phenomena but turns out it can be quit common when the PI wanted to make sure data are reproducible and consistent.\n\nOne big name PI once even demoted the postdoc he had in a paper we collaborated (main correspondence was my PI) to merely a single line in the acknowledgement section for \"offering technical assistance\".",
