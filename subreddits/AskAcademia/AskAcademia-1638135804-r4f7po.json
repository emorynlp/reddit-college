They just ask that the student get those in as soon as possible after the deadline. So, those are definitely out there, and I think they're probably not *too* rare. I think it's more likely for a program to be lenient if their deadline is earlier in the year, like November or such. \n\nSource: got into my program with 2-week-late recommendations",

From the institution's point of view the end result is the same as when someone just randomly lists the name of a person who does not actually recommend them.\n\nThe good news is that the people whom you asked for the recommendation have been on both sides of the barrier (speaking from my own past experience) and we all get that this ultimately is your responsibility. There is nothing wrong with sending out reminders and politely but firmly making sure that your recommendations are sent out on time.",

I can certainly understand the students are stressed over these high-stakes letters that they can't control. And the reminder emails are one thing that lets them feel like they're doing something to help. But every one of those emails that requires a response just adds one more thing to my to-do list.\n\nI'm tempted to remind them that in my class, they were not in the habit of submitting assignments days before the deadline. That I trusted them to be an adult and keep track of their own deadlines. And that they lived up to that expectation, among many others, which is why they're getting good letters. And that I'm equally deserving of their trust to be a responsible adult, which is presumably part of the reason they chose me to write a letter.\n\nMost professors are busy, and deadline-driven, just like most students are. And most of us will get the letters in by the deadline.",
