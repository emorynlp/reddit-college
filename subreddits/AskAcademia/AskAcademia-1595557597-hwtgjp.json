  "text": "Today, I noticed that a paper published by my professor in march 2020 was my project that I did in may 2019. The explanation,results are all copies from the project report that I sent him. I have proof of it (mails and Google docs edit history).\n\nThe published journal has 2 authors. One of them under whom I made this project (it was part of our curriculum and everyone from our class and had to do a project under him) and another is his colleague. They both hold PhDs.\n\nThe professor under whom I made this project presented me the idea of publishing it back in 2019 but he disapproved of my results and wanted a better algorithm. \n\nThis is a case of plagiarism. I want to be credited for my work. How should I approach the professor/university management/journal so that all ends well. \n\nI don't want them to lose their job. Is there any way I could make them add me as an author?",

They will investigate and take appropriate action.  If you are in the US, the university will have a Research Integrity Officer, very likely the Vice President for Research.  I am that person at my university.  You could address your concerns to that person, or perhaps to the University Provost.  I would keep the initial explanation limited to more or less what you have explained here, but be sure to mention that you have documentation.  You will be asked to provide it later.",

It would obviously be impossible to change a version that has already appeared in print, but perhaps your name could be added to online versions and wherever the paper is listed online.\n\nAny other consequences would be between the university and the professor and would be intended to address any wrongdoing that the university determined the professor to have engaged in.",

I had no idea and was most definitely not.\n\nMy advisor's explanation was: well, she was my student, anything she wrote technically belongs to me.  The journal editor didn't buy it.\n\nWhat the editor wound up doing was forcing my name to the author list in the online version and told my advisor and the other two original authors on the article (both former colleagues of mine) that they were banned from publishing in his journal again.\n\nI did not report it to my university, because I had already graduated and didn't want to appear to be causing problems in my field since I was just a postdoc and still hadn't secured long term employment. But, I will say, after that incident, my advisor told me that she would never write me another letter of rec again. I just laughed.",

My advisor got banned from a single regional journal, so at the end of the day, she's not really \"out\" much of anything. \n\nI think perhaps the universities are so worried about covering their own image that they will do anything to stand behind an employee to make situations like this \"go away\" rather than calling out the employee.  At least in one program (not mine, as part of my research), the director of grad studies said it is much easier to \"get rid\" of a student than to legitimately penalize a tenured faculty member and still have to be on good working with them for the rest of your career.  :(",

This is why we don't credit machinists, glass blowers, vacuum chamber manufacturers, vendors of specialty chemicals, etc. If you help make a novel contribution to the way samples are prepared, then that can be some low-level authorship.\n\nFor example, I used to work in an alloy development lab. I had friends in other groups who wanted to study our sorts of alloys. If they gave me a list of properties they wanted, and I made them a custom alloy or gave them one I had previously produced which wasn't widely available, then they'd usually give me some form of authorship (or at least an adknowledgements, if their advisor wasn't keen on collaborations). If they came to me with the exact alloy they wanted already known, I'd make it as a favor, in exchange for dinner, etc and I wouldn't get authorship. In that mode I was doing them a commodity service.\n\nThis is the reason undergrads shouldn't simply be doing glassware cleaning for a \"research\" job. They should be given some part of the project, no matter how small, and let them solve an aspect which hasn't been figured out yet. Then they've earned their sixth author position.",

I'd say they did this intentionally because you're done with your UG degree and know that you'll be leaving the college.\n\nPls try talking to your professors and confront them after you collect your certificates. Don't negotiate for anything less. I know how much effort you would have put into creating all that work. This might be passive-aggressive but, if I were you then I'd make sure that I would take the paper down and put it up with my name. **Do not disclose the fact that you've complete evidence** and screenshot all your evidence (e-mails, In and out log in laboratory register, letters that you've given to lectures regarding the permission for experiment etc;). Talk to the university regarding this. \n\nIf they fail to listen or convince you to give up the paper, approach the academic panel in the university and disclose the information to them, *with all the evidence.*\n\nIf they fail to do anything, I'm sure that the paper had been published under the guidelines of CSIR/ICMR depending on the affiliation or university you're under. Make an appeal regarding plagiarism and with all the evidence and request them to re-edit your name as the first author  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  According to, '[blog.ipleaders.in](https://blog.ipleaders.in)', this is what they've mentioned:\n\n ***Penalties for Faculty, Staff or Researcher***\n\n***Penalties for faculty, staff or researcher of Higher Education Institutes will also be given according to the severity of plagiarism.***\n\n1. ***Level 1 (10%-40%)\u2013 he/she will be asked to withdraw the manuscript submitted for publication and will not be allowed to publish any work for a minimum time period of 1 year.***\n2. ***Level 2 (40%-60%)\u2013 he/she will be asked to withdraw manuscript submitted for publication and will not be allowed to publish their work for a minimum time period of 2 years.

It is really disheartening, to see you write down here that you want to add your name to the paper rather than fighting for it.\n\nUnfortunately , Plagiarism in India is not considered as a crime but this is the only way.
