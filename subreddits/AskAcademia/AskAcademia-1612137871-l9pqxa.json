  "title:": "Do I have to become a professor? And why does anyone want to be a professor?",
  "text": "It seems like everyone in academia aims for professorship, and starting in undergrad everything you do is to make you more competitive for tenure. \n\nBut what if I don't care for tenure? As far as I can tell it is good for two things: job stability and prestige. The former is not important for me personally, and the latter... well, I can't say that I will never need it, but is certainly not something inherently important to me or anyone I know. \n\nNot to mention that being a professor is described as more administrative and managerial than involving research. This sounds dreadful because I am not suited for it and it isn't something I'd enjoy. I already dislike writing and non-science oriented discussions: I only want to spend my time learning things. I can't imagine making an even bigger sacrifice of the latter for the former. Not to mention that I have zero interest in teaching, mostly because again I have no talent for it.  \n\nIt seems like most people go into academia with the same mindset as mine: a desire to learn more about their science and nothing else. I'm not sure at what point such people decide they would rather administrate than research, or whether they just don't have the freedom to decide.\n\nIs there no next step after postdoc other than becoming a professor? Is there at least a way to be a professor where my life is not overtaken with non-research things? \n\nI myself am in STEM, but feel free to comment on the situation in your field even if it's non-STEM. I'm sure someone with thoughts similar to mine will appreciate it.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I was implicitly leaving out the option of moving into industry since I like research and academia, just not the idea of spending lots of time on non-research things",

The only caveat is you have to raise enough grant money to support your entire salary/benefits and other students/postdocs etc. It can be done and as someone who did the professor thing for 15 years I can say that it's great. I don't miss the other things and really like focusing completely on research.",

              "text": "It basically comes down to cost and maximizing productivity. PIs are a lot more expensive than grad students / post docs. My position is best described as \"research professor\" and that allows me to mentor grad students and pay for them to research with/for me. NSF (where I get most of my funding) won't let me cover my full salary with one grant; I end up having to get four or so just to cover myself. So to keep 4 grants going it's got to be very collaborative, at least for me, and I have to show enough productivity from the grants to keep them coming in, and I can't do that completely solo. NSF likes students being involved, and I my current position allows me access to the best out there.\n\nThere are different ways to make it work. I work in a research center closely tied to a department at an R1. We get tons of federal money.  All of my collaborators are external, as it turns out, but there are local collaboration possibilities here as well.",

Do you share lab space? Do you get health insurance from the school? Our grants were super sketchy about funding personnel costs.",

But don't get me wrong not having the security of a regular faculty position (where funding only gets you summer salary, not your full salary) is the worst part of the job. It has taken years to spin up to where I am fully self funded. It's a wild ride sometimes... you certainly get used to rejection/failures fast haha.",

But sometimes the research assistant professors are associated with cores and do still write grants, decide on research directions etc. If you like a specific technique, you can work in a core facility and do that all the time.\n\nIn the US, federal government run labs also need scientists, and there is often less pressure to write grants there. You can also transition to industry and work at the bench for a biotech or pharma company.\n\nAnd those are all options just if you want to stay at the bench. There's tons more careers where you still use your scientific knowledge and interact with the scientific community, but aren't at the bench doing the research yourself. And just based on statistics, most people with stem phds don't become professors. A lot more phds graduate each year than there are faculty positions available.",

I don\u2019t know anyone like that. Literally none. Not to say it\u2019s not hard to get, it is, but it\u2019s generally more about doing things to get to the next stage than focused on tenure particularly. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re thinking about this. Folks don\u2019t have to love teaching to be a good prof or to love the admin side or to love writing etc. No one likes everything. But it is a job with a lot of hats and if you only like one part of it, it can be a huge bummer. Also some profs try to treat it as all research (and they tend to be bad colleagues) but even then research includes - grant writing, hiring and managing students, writing papers. It\u2019s not all benchwork/data collection/proving theorems.\n\nAll the best to you! It\u2019s hard to figure out career directions but I really hope you can find something that\u2019s fulfilling - whether that\u2019s as a prof or something else.",

Universities also have positions called research professors that focus 100% on research and are also soft money.  \n\nIn other words, it is completely possible to do the things you want.

If you only define research as the actual bench/lab work, then it is hard to have a job that is intellectually stimulating (not just doing the same protocols over and over again) but keeps you at the bench. As you grow, research has a broader definition. Research is writing grants and papers. Research is training postdocs and grad students. That lets you do more things. Instead of just doing one project yourself, you are like a project manager overseeing lots of different projects. With that, there is administrative things that creep in, but I'm not sure of any job in any field that doesn't have an administrative burden. If you don't want to teach, you can look at more soft-money positions, but then it's a eat what you kill situation that can be quite stressful in today's funding climate.",

To do anything professionally, someone has to fund it, and in academics that comes from mostly government grants, which give more room for fundamental research than the usual industrial funding. At some universities there are adjunct research faculty, and some universities let professors essentially buy their teaching time back. If they want to teach less and have enough grant funding, they can pay the university in exchange for not teaching. \n\nWith all of that, if it's the research you love, I would suggest looking into national laboratory work if in the US. The funding comes from much the same places and have the institution behind you gets you access to conferences and publishing still etc... If you are in Europe then you can still look into national research institutions. If that track doesn't wok for you, then industry research is alive and well. There are plenty of companies funding internal research, but only for certain areas. If it's materials then you in luck, but if it's astronomy then there's not much corporate money there. \n\nI am in physics personally but this still applies to other areas of STEM. Engineering will probably have the easiest time finding outside funding.",
