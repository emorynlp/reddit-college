  "text": "Hi all, I have a bit of odd situation and I would like your perspectives on this issue (since I am probably overthinking it). \n\nI am currently in the process of applying for PhD programs in neuro for Fall 2022. All the universities I am applying to are in one town, which has quite a few options available for PhD applicants. However, I am also moving to this town in January for my husband's job, a whole 6+ months before I would start my PhD program. I am currently a RA at my current institution, and my employment plan to keep our finances flowing between January and September (when I would be hopefully starting my PhD program) would be to get another job as an RA. I want to stay involved and active in research, and on the off chance I don't get into any PhD program, I would hope to just continue working as an RA until next cycle. \n\nNow I understand that the best way to find RA jobs is to cold email and look at university websites, when is causing my current issue. A lot of the RA jobs I am interested in having and am qualified for are at universities with PIs I am already applying to work with as a doctoral student. I haven't made any mention yet to the few PIs I have talked to about my applications that I will be looking for a job as an RA come January, because I am concerned that the program and the PIs will not take my application to their PhD program seriously if I am also applying to their RA positions. Now I might be overthinking that, but I am also first-gen and struggle with navigating if an issue is truly a case of stepping on academica's toes or not and this is one of those issues to me. I know some positions come with an expectation that you will work there for at least a year, but I am not too sure on these time contracts and how essential they are to the funding of the lab. The absolute last thing I want to do is screw a lab out of their funding by leaving my next RA job early for grad school. \n\nHas anyone ever been in a similar situation? What did you do and what is your advice? Does anyone here who is PI have any thoughts on this too?",
