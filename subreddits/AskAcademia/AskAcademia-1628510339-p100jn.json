      "text": "Even pre-brexit, PhD funding is difficult for international students. Some institutions have funding tracks that target non-UK students; these were always highly competitive and no less so now that EU students compete for those as well. Our institution has such a competition and success rate for students in our department is less than 5%. You need top marks AND publication history AND something else that stands out to have a great chance.\n\nSome cohort PhD programs (DTPs/CDTs) have an allocation for international students, so it isn't impossible to find funding if you check those out at your institution of interest. The usual window though for those programs is applying sometime Nov-Feb for following October.",

      "text": "What do you mean by \"owing to post brexit rules\"? In my understanding (I am a non-EU international PhD student in the UK from a commonwealth country) and from what I have seen, it should be easier for international students (non-EU) to get funding now that EU students are also considered international students. For example, international students are now elligible to UKRI studentship, which - for some universities - freed up some funds that they decided to use to create additional PhD scholarships. Some funded projects that were strictly for home/EU students due to funding are now open to international students as well (but often it's only home student fees that can be covered), etc. \n\nI campaign for better treatment of international students and I guess I am just curious to understand what I missed in the legislature directly that would make it harder to get funding post brexit? I mean, other than the 16% increase in international students (from EU) which naturally increases the overall competition for scholarships (but that's not a rule per se). \n\nFor your scholarship, when you say you have 0 funding, does that mean home students would also have 0 funding? If so, I dont think it has anything to do with the \"post brexit rules\" or your student status, but simply with the project itself.\n\n Usually you will see people here say a lot to not do a \"self funded Phd because it means it didnt gather enough interest to be funded so isnt worth pursuing\". I would say the same rule applies but to home student funding for a UK PhD; So if home students wouldnt even be getting funding, then this might be an indication that the project is not entirely worth it. But then again, it strongly depends on the field. Some fields just receive less funding than others but it doesnt mean they are less important. This occurs especially in fields where no industrial partner exist to participate in the research, which might apply to your research. (*)\n\nIf the project is funded for home students, the university should at least match the net amount they give to home students (home tuition + stipend) meaning that you would have to cover the difference in tuition fees if needed or some of your living expenses. Is that the case? If not, I would reconsider the PhD project if it applies to the rule above (*) and maybe ask the PI you are interested in how they funded their own PhD if it's in the same research area. \n\nOther than that, you can apply for funding (student loans and bursary) from your home government (if possible), being from India I think you can access the commonwealth scholarships but it's once a year and very competitive as there's only a few scholarships available. If you have an engineering background, there's some scholarships available through private organizations. Many Universities have a funding section on their website where they have a list of potential scholarships you can apply to. But remember there's no guarantee that you will win those scholarship so you still need a backup plan on how you will survive and pay your tuition fees. As a general rule, do not go into debt for a PhD.",

              "text": "For example, in my home country, we have an Order of Engineers that has scholarships for engineering students or engineers that are pursuing research through graduate studies. If your PhD is related somehow to engineering or if you are a member of an engineering society in the UK, then you can apply to the scholarships they offer their members. I assume there are other types of societies that exist for each STEM branch, so it would be worth looking into that as well.\n\nA University website usually has a section that lists all major UK/international scholarships that students can apply to (not related to the university). These kinds of scholarships would be listed there (sometimes not, it depends on the school). I recommend looking on the websites of the universities of your choice in the ''funding'' section to see if you can apply to any of the scholarships they recommend for students that need funding but can't secure it through the school.\n\nBut again, before considering a self-funded PhD project and looking at those scholarships, other than the financial issue,  I would urge you to ask yourself why there is no funding for your research (if there wouldn't be funding for home students) and what that means for your PhD and career in terms of research value/publication potential/interest on the subject.\n\nYou know, it's hard to move away from an area once you do a PhD in it and even if you like the subject, you need to make a living somehow after you graduate. So every PhD students need to ask themselves what they want to do with a PhD in a specific research area to determine if it's worth pursuing. That's especially true for self-funded PhD students as the lack of funding is usually a red flag on the relevance of the research and also implies going into debt for a PhD (so it needs to be worth it in the end).\n\nEven if your research seems very exciting to you, I recommend taking a step back and looking at things objectively without the input of your supervisor. You need to ask *yourself* (don't answer here), what career possibilities are there for you after your PhD and how is the competition for those positions? What is your PhD going to bring to your career? Are you planning to stay in academia or could your research be of any use in the industry? If you can't find a role in academia, would a PhD in such a niche theoretical field hurt your chances of going into industrial ME as a backup plan since it's not really related to your bachelor degree?  If you decide to go into academia, would funding always be an issue and would you need to take on other tasks/research outside the scope of your specialization to make ends meet?\n\nYou can answer that last question by looking at your supervisor's funding and situation. If they can't secure funding for their students, I would assume funding is an issue.  If one university didn't want to fund you, then I would have said it might have been specific to that university, but since many universities aren't offering funding for your research, the issue seems to be more generalized to your field (or maybe it's just your specific research?). This brings you back to the questions above that you really need to ask yourself in order to determine if it's worth it. Maybe find a subreddit that's more related to your research area to ask them the same questions and have a realistic look at the career possibilities and value of your research. Good luck!",
