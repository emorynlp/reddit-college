  "text": "Mine is pretty bad, I'm not gonna lie. I would like to get better at it, because it sucks and just overall makes me feel shitty. I'm a postdoc in humanities, and it feels like research invaded every part of my life. I work from home a lot, so that probably doesn't help.\n\nHow do you handle your work/life balance? Did you have at some point the realisation that you need to re-balance things, and did you succeed in doing so? Any tips on freeing my brain of this anxiety that I should be working all day every day of the week? Or should I be working all day every day of the week? I don't know anymore.",

      "text": "I think it's a real problem in the industry, and institutions should do more to help. If the system demands that people write papers and grants to continue their careers, the time necessary to do that should be protected during the regular working week. Instead, most of my time seems to be taken up by fairly useless committees and administrative bullshit that often means I get no actual research work done in a full working day. It systematically disadvantages people with caring responsibilities (disproportionately women), and creates an unhealthy lifestyle for the people who do say in the office until 10pm working on grants and papers. Unfortunately I'm my experience a lot of academics wear their late nights like a badge of pride. I've been called a 'part timer' for leaving the office at 5pm.\n\nPersonally I'm lucky that my boss is genuinely supportive of a healthy work/life balance, even though she doesn't practice what she preaches. I'm also lucky that my wife is also an academic researcher and has a similar attitude to me. We help each other to maintain a healthy balance, while also supporting each other to work late when it's really necessary.\n\nI increasingly feel that the academic research world is split into two types of people, and you have to choose between being the live-to-work researcher or the work-to-live researcher. At one point I think I could have become the former, with corresponding fast career progression and high profile in the field, but ultimately I've chosen to focus on my family life first, so I'm now a work-to-live researcher. Once you make peace with that, it's easier to begin treating research like a 9-5 job instead of an all-encompassing lifestyle. When I talk to some of the high-achievers who are unable to have a conversation about anything other than work, I feel relieved that I'm not one of them.",

(An additional thing that helps is to have separate email clients for work and personal email, and quit the work client at the end of the work day.) \n\nAs for the FOMO, where is the anxiety coming from? Is it you putting undue pressure on yourself, or is it your workplace where such behaviour is allowed/encouraged? The latter would mean a toxic environment, and you ought to be thankful it\u2019s only a postdoc and not a TT position. If it\u2019s the former, well, try to remind yourself that you won\u2019t do anyone any favours if you burnout two years in. At the end of it all, it\u2019s really cool if your hobbies are giving you ideas that spark work, but you need to draw the line yourself between work and leisure.",

      "text": "PhD student here. I would say the balance is pretty good in my favor. At least it is now. This is pretty rare for PhD students, especially on this forum, but I generally leave work at the lab, and take nothing home. This may change a bit early next year when I am actually writing the manuscript. But I think it is important to separate work/school and the rest of my life. This also can be seen as a big weakness, especially from other PhD students and Post Docs that brag about how many nights and weekends were spent at their home running models or writing. But I just have to look past that.\n\nTo expand a bit, the first few weeks of my program were a living hell. I just moved to a new country (and continent) without speaking the language and lived on the lab campus. I spent 12 hour days at the lab getting caught up with what the team were doing, and getting the models running on my PC. All the while I was searching for permanent housing, getting visa and other official documents filled, and meeting hundreds of new people. It was horrible. I think my advisors saw that too, and after I found my own apartment, they respected that I distanced myself more from work. I even asked for a VPN key so that I could check email or run a few experiments from home, and they said \"No, don't do that until you have to\".  Life can still be a living hell, but at least it isn't caused as much by so much pressure from work and the lab, and more still trying to learn the language and make close friends.",

For a while, I had a standing two hour appointment three times a week titled \"1-on-1 w/ Brooks\" which was my pair of running shoes. No one ever asked questions about who Brooks was or why they needed so much of my time. I also scheduled dinner with my partner, and other activities that were important to my balance.\n\nThe flip side, is I also scheduled my work. If I had a major deadline coming up, I would block off parts of my schedule to specifically work on the project that was due. If I was presenting at a conference, I would specifically schedule time to prep.\n\nI've found that if it's on your calendar, people respect it. But this only works if you also abide by it.\n\nMy university offers all sorts of programs for helping PhDs and faculty learn time management skills. I scoffed at them until my PhD advisor essentially told me that I had to go to at least one. I went, learned a ton of new time management strategies, and it ended up completely changing how I approach work. It has helped a lot.\n\nI would say the biggest mistake that I see students and other faculty making is that they don't take advantage of all the resources at our disposal.

I don't work on weekends, I'm working from home right now so I usually start work as soon as I wake up (6-7) so I'm done for the day around 2-3. If I need to put in some extra hours in the evening I have no problem doing it, but I don't do anything I don't need to beyond helping out other people in my research group if they need it. \n\nIt helps that my regular summer job in undergrad was work from home so I kind of got used to it. As well, it helps that my hobbies are out of the house, so I just turn my phone off when I leave and any work or concerns can wait until I get home. \n\nAlso, my current supervisor doesn't breathe down anyone's necks, he also very much appreciates leaving the office at 5PM and doesn't expect apologies for not working overnight to run calculations like my old supervisor for my undergrad thesis lol. It's a really great group to work in for a lot of reasons, but I definitely appreciate not having to work 24/7 :)",

Much to my wife\u2019s chagrin, part of the strategy is to try to talk as little as possible about work bullshit. We don\u2019t do the whole \u201chow was your day\u201d stuff. Once we\u2019re home, we\u2019re home. Let\u2019s live our lives. That has been tough because my wife has been inculcated in that American psyche to feel as if she lives to work. I\u2019ve been working hard to show her that, indeed, the opposite should be true.",

      "text": "Pretty awesome and it's one of the perks of my job. I get to hang out with my kid a lot, and just schedule work when I can around that. I feel fortunate being in a job where I can still get paid my normal salary, get caught up on work actually (grants, writing, applying to faculty positions) and completely make my own schedule. Yes this means working at weird times, and having occasions where I drop my son off at his grandparents for the weekend so I can write all weekend, but the pros way outweigh the cons for me.\n\nFor once actually, I can schedule work AROUND my hobbies instead of the other way around, which is a remarkable plus. My buddy wants to go for a random bike ride tomorrow morning? No problem, I'll just work late at night. I have daily 10 AM jiu jitsu classes I could never make if going into lab everyday? No problem, I wake up at 6 am and blast through a good chunk of work before class and then work late.\n\nMy advice: schedule things around your family, fun, etc., and don't think of academics as a 9-5. Work when you can. Have a place that's dedicated to work (I converted our spare bedroom into an office), but also work when you can (like maybe watching a movie with the family, pull up laptop and do some work).\n\nAlso, make a calendar and have weekly/monthly etc., goals (I 'owe' myself 3 papers, 2 grants, etc., by September, for instance). Don't be firm on when you need to work on those goals; but be firm on actually getting them done. Be realistic, but ambitious and work on the goals flexibly.",

      "text": "This isn't a cool \"tip\", but the thing that works for me is to decide that when I'm working, I'm working; when I'm off, I'm off. So, no \"writing\" or grading while I watch TV, and (ideally) no hanging out on the internet while I'm writing. This helped me publish an article or two per year while teaching 3/3 or 4/4 (humanities). If I got something done and wasn't futzing around but calling it work, that frees my brain a little bit when I take a break.\n\nNow, I have a 2-month-old, so I have to actually get something out of my hour or two of writing time every day (and I can't really be multitasking when I'm taking care of him).",
