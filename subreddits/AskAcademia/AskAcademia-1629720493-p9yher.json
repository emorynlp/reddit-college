  "title:": "Hybrid in-person and online reading groups - have you participated in one and how did it work?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm an academic in the UK and have been running a small reading group for staff and postgraduate students, and it has been completely online during the pandemic. The reading group existed prior to the pandemic and used to take place in a cosy pub close to campus. With restrictions easing in the UK, I want to provide the opportunity for those that wish to meet up in person to discuss philosophy (my discipline) but I also don't want to exclude those who might find in-person reading events uncomfortable or unsafe. A hybrid system would seem to be best, but one where only-online members of the group didn't miss out on anything integral to the reading while the few in-person members can still enjoy meeting up for informal chats. \n\nHas anyone had experience of such hybrid events? How where they carried out and did they really work?\n\nI'm concerned that online members will experience some FOMO regardless, and I'm also concerned that even though it is possible to have a small meet up in the pub of 3 or 4 people it nevertheless might not be wise given that cases are still high.\n\nI would be grateful for any advice!",

      "text": "Not particularly a reading event, but a philosophical discussion. It took place at a quieter place than a restaurant (At one of the members house, with good internet). The meeting took place similarly over zoom with a bluetooth speaker and a microphone in the middle of the table. There also was a speakers list both online and in person attendants could put their names on. A moderator was calling up the next person on the list to speak. It was a bit weird at first but at the end it was a very enriching event.",

      "text": "Might you be able to use an available seminar or lecture room as a temporary measure? Somewhere for everyone to space out a little and with an interactive board or screen to have online participants on via a video call (or even just on a laptop put somewhere among the group)? It would lose the cosiness of the pub, of course, but could be a good stepping-stone before returning to full in-person meet-ups (if that's the direction you want to go in).",

      "text": "I think it's hard to accommodate a hybrid format without compromising the experience for either the in-person or remote attendees. The key consideration is a good quality conference speakerphone, but even then, you should probably meet in a quiet environment like a conference room, instead of a pub. The next issue is a good webcam, with a wide field of view,  together with a well lit room. Having a large external monitor also helps to give the remote participants a greater presence.",

      "text": "Agreeing with everyone saying that doing hybrid well is hard, especially for a genuine conversation, rather than a lecture followed by Q+A (which works fine with the right tech). You mention the pub was close to campus. How about doing the formal discussion entirely on Zoom (etc.), and then inviting all those who want to to gather at the pub afterwards. When I was a grad student (before COVID), we had a great writing group that would meet in a seminar room on campus to workshop someone's paper and then those who wanted to would decant to the campus bar.",
