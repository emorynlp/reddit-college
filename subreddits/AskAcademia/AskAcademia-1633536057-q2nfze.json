      "text": "Not really. It's job experience so it's helpful to show that perhaps you can teach and be supportive of others, but it's not research experience and PhDs are research degrees. If it is a doctorate of education it might be very relevant. You could list this on your resume but maybe not emphasize it as a highlight of your application. Good luck with your PhD application.",
