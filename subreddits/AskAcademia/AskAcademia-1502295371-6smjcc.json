  "title:": "How to mentor a graduate student",
  "text": "A dear friend of mine from graduate school recently reached out to me and asked for advice on how to mentor graduate students.  She\u2019s just starting a tenure track job, has her first student, had a rather terrible relationship and experience with her own mentor, and described herself as \u201cterrified\u201d of screwing this up.  I had a fabulous relationship to my mentor, am recently tenured, and have four students of my own, the eldest of which is currently finishing this semester.  I\u2019ve gotten awards for my teaching/mentoring of students, yet find myself at a bit of a loss.  Much of my advice focused on things I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes, and I don\u2019t want to make this a list of \u201cfor god\u2019s sake, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Below is what I\u2019ve come up with, but I thought I would turn my list over to the peanut gallery for comments and additions.  Graduate students are also welcome to add their two cents on what made their experiences positive.  Obviously, some of this is going to vary widely by discipline, and that\u2019s okay (I work in a field where academic jobs are scarce and pay is low\u2026 you know, like most of us).  Some might be controversial for other reasons.  And I hope it goes without saying, I\u2019d like this not to turn into a \u201cworst practices\u201d thread:  obviously, don\u2019t sleep with your students, steal their ideas, or totally ignore them.\n\n1)  *Don\u2019t accept sub-par students.*  This obviously has to do with selection of students rather than mentoring them, but I\u2019m a softy, and have gotten into trouble here.  You aren\u2019t doing anyone any favors, least of all yourself, by feeling empathy for a particular student\u2019s hardships if it doesn\u2019t look like they have the type of record that prepared them for graduate school.  If they didn\u2019t excel in undergrad, they probably won\u2019t in grad school, and then all you have done is create someone who is overeducated, in debt, and now can\u2019t find a job (not to mention all the time you put into mentoring someone who wasn\u2019t prepared, which, believe me, is WAY harder than mentoring someone who is).  It\u2019s a cruelty, not a kindness.\n\n2)  *Get them funding or don\u2019t take them.*  I don\u2019t know what funding is like in your program, but it\u2019s skimpy here at University of X.  I have a firm policy that I don\u2019t take unfunded students.  I don\u2019t want the guilt of someone going into one hundred grand worth of debt to work with me, and then come out possibly unemployed.  I make them apply for all the internal fellowships at my university, and if they don\u2019t get one, I tell them to consider other schools where they are funded.\n\n3) *Identify their weaknesses early and fix them through coursework.*  If you are accepting masters students, they are going to have major holes in their knowledge base.  Talk to them and check out their transcripts.  Figure out where those holes are so you can fix them before they have moved on to research.\n\n4)  *Set a time to meet every week.*  A specific time with just them, not office hours.  Make it clear that they can cancel if they don\u2019t need you, but this is their specific time with you every single week.\n\n5)  *Watch all their presentations, and don\u2019t be afraid to take a heavy hand during the first few years.*  If your graduate students give a shitty conference presentation or poster, that\u2019s on you, not them.  Review EVERYTHING they do.  In the beginning, I even review letters they are sending to other colleagues (I had one that pissed off someone senior in the field by addressing him by his first name.)\n\n6)  *You are not a mother or a friend.*  I made this mistake a lot in the beginning.  I wanted to be the sort of female role model I never had, and sometimes this landed me in tight spots.  I had conversations with them that I regretted when it came time to crack the whip (i.e. \u201cwhat if I tell them this paper sucks and they get mad and start repeating that one personal and embarrassing story I told them?\u201d).\n\n7)  *But don\u2019t be afraid to let them see you as a person.*  That said, there is a happy medium.  Once a year, I have all four of mine over for dinner.  We drink wine and eat and play board games.  We talk about academic issues like life/work balance and they get a glimpse behind the curtain.  This might not be for everyone, but it works for me.\n\n8)  *Put them on papers they had little to do with.*  I\u2019ve started adding early students to papers that I have mostly finished and it\u2019s actually been great.  They read it and edit and deal with revisions. (Edit: Edit it, fix the figures, format it for the journal, double check the bibliography, write a cover letter, submit it, go through reviews, and check the proofs.) They learn a ton about how research is constructed and the publication process.  Plus, they get a little pub on their CV before they have publishable research of their own, which is nice for them, and boosts their confidence.  (This point generated some discussion and disagreement-- I have elaborated on my reasoning below.)\n\n9)  *Don\u2019t be afraid to use them for your mutual benefit.*  At some point, we all have more ideas than we have time for.  If those ideas are doable without a large grant, farm them out to grad students and co-author a paper.  In the beginning, coming up with ideas on their own is the hard part.  And you\u2019ll need as many pre-tenure pubs as you can get.\n\n10) *Read everything they send you, but\u2026* If they are starting to write papers, make them do it in phases.  Make sure you see a detailed outline first (WAY easier to correct mistakes early).  Then a draft.  On the flip side, don\u2019t get into the habit of reading half-finished drafts.  You\u2019ll end up doing nothing but reading graduate student work if you do that.  One outline, then a finished reasonably polished first draft is the combo that works for me.\n\n11)  *If you don\u2019t know about something, cop to it.*  Eventually, you\u2019ll have students whose projects fall outside of your range of knowledge.  Admit that immediately, and work with them to find other committee members who can help.  ",

      "text": "I think I'm in love with you. This is great advice. Additional thoughts:\n\n1. *Be super crystal clear about your expectations.* Both long-\n and short-term. Especially if you can do it in writing. E.g., if you expect to see butts in seats at 9am, tell your students that, don't just viciously snark about how lazy they are rolling in at 9:15am to their colleagues (<--true story). But also make sure they know what they're working toward on the longer term (e.g., once you can complete XYZ experiments, that will support ABC hypothesis and be a publishable manuscript). This will help them stay focused, motivated, and working independently. \n\n2. *Keep an open and flexible mind when getting feedback from students.* I have worked for 2 PIs who required feats of mental gymnastics to get them on board with ideas, only for them to subsequently decide that the idea was theirs all along once they agreed with it. I think they're so used to arguing (with reviewers, with program officers, etc) that it becomes their default mode of communication.\n\n3. *Student-specific: Ask them what they need from you to succeed.* Some students don't know. That's ok. Other students, especially more senior ones, will tell you exactly what they need. E.g., \"I need a technician 20 hours a week to complete this project within 6 months.\" Or \"I need your help outlining the major themes of this draft, and then I can fill in the gaps.\" I guess the broader thing I'm getting at is that you will need to tailor your management style for different students, and instead of making a guessing game out of what works for them, try just asking.\n\n4. *Create psychological safety.* This is one I learned from a friend of mine who is a management professor. There is a lot to it but the gist is that you want your lab to be a safe place to be wrong. There is a lot of research on strategies to create psychological safety, but I think it all boils down to: Just don't be a huge asshole to people. For some reason a lot of PIs seem to really struggle with that.\n\nI think it's awesome you're doing this for your friend. I look forward to a warmer and fuzzier academia where mentors actually mentor their students instead of squeezing every last bit of mental fortitude and productivity out of them and then slamming the door behind them when funding runs out. Not that I'm bitter or anything.",

I realized after I posted this that I had left out a whole section on how to help them generate research ideas... I'll work this in with that section.\n\n3. I don't actually do this, and am going to give it a try.  It's a wonderful idea.\n\n4.  I like to tell them about all the times I fucked up royally in grad school.  They seem to get a kick out of things like how my first conference abstract was rejected because I submitted a draft of it that still had my co-authors comments on it (\"are you being purposefully vague about our results because we don't have them all yet?\")  It's a great way to create psychological safety.  :)",

If you think you can get your advisor to do it, ask them for a list of recommended readings, what they really think are the essentials in your field, old and new. And then just plow through those. It is impossible to come up with ideas when you have no information to come up with ideas *with.* All ideas are born out of the literature.\n\nAs you read, start jotting down general ideas and areas of interest. These will likely be pretty broad in the beginning, but over time they will narrow. When you have several, show them to your advisor. Say that you know they are broad, but you'd like direction in narrowing them.  Ask if the advisor sees any areas of potential projects on your list that stand out more than others.  ",

If a student is bad at time management, identifying that early and getting them into time management workshops is a good plan. If they're a weak writer, getting them into writing courses or workshops again helps. If they have major imposter syndrome issues that interfere with their productivity, encouraging them to get into some sort of support infrastructure as well as maintaining a supportive lab environment with regular positive feedback is also key. This extends to communication issues, diversity training, whatever. Most schools offer these sorts of short courses or workshops free of charge to grad students, so finding out what is available and prodding students to get the support they need is pretty key.",

And if for some reason it becomes necessary to work overtime, make sure they have time off to make up for it.\n\nSome other advice should be common sense, but it's good to remind ourselves:\n\n- *Don't  get too familiar and keep boundaries*: This, both for your and their sake. If they want to talk about their private life, don't get too involved. Be aware of problems they might have, but don't get engage in discussing them.  And you shouldn't share information you don't want others to know. This also means avoid gossiping, or even just talking about other colleagues.

There are times you're under a deadline, but honestly this shouldn't happen but a couple of times a year. \n\nLet me share something that's happened with a couple of mine. They clearly are working even late hours for days on end, but they are stuck on problems they're trying to deal with. I \"force\" them to take a day or two off, not thinking about work. For me that's part of being productive.\n\nOn the other hand, I also have colleagues who expect that their grad students need to learn what it means to be an academic, giving them tasks to do over the weekend on a regular basis, whether it's handing in a chapter of their thesis or whatever. I'm talking about things that could wait a few extra days. \n\nI think you hit it on the nail by talking about a proper work/life balance. What I'm saying is that we shouldn't expect them (at this stage in their lives) to embrace the same working hours we have. If anything, we need to foster (by example first, with words second) that sometimes you have to work a lot of hours, but at the same time it can't be all just about work.

Anyone who has not made a significant contribution on a paper does not belong as an author on it.

It makes unreasonable publication expectations for students seeking academic jobs and unfairly biases towards students, like in your lab it would seem, that get added to papers for reasons unrelated to their contributions.

The assignment was take this chunk of manuscript and make it into a publishable paper. Edit it, fix the figures, format it for the journal, double check the bibliography, write a cover letter, submit it, go through reviews, and check the proofs. I believe learning about this process two years before they would submit their own research was incredibly valuable for them. I also think had I forced this on them as a \"learning experience\" and not given them authorship, I would be guilty of graduate student abuse. I teach them to value their time by valuing it myself, not treating them like grunt laborers who do my bidding for an acknowledgement.\n\n2) There is no blanket \"ethical protocol\" for authorship in my field.  I once had an entire grad seminar on intellectual property, the end point is that things are messy.  This is what I meant when I said you don't understand authorship.  People in my field are routinely put on papers for editing help, stats help, for the contribution of a single data point.  In grad school, I was forced to take on a co-author because her institution paid for my flight to the research site-- and in my field, that's common and thought of as reasonable, as she provided resources, even it I couldn't even get her to read a single draft of the thing.\n\n3) Next week, I will send a totally finished paper to someone very senior to me for help-- a friendly pre-review.  I'm nervous about some aspects of the research and he's a world expert.  We are friendly, but it might require a good deal of editing to get the paper into top shape.  The last sentence of my email will be \"if this takes you more than a half and hour to fix, please consider being an author on the paper.\"  I'm thereby valuing his time, increasing the likelihood he will help me, and ultimately creating better science.  Why would I do less for my graduate students?\n",

And I am not trying to troll or anger you or question the quality of your work.  \n\n1 - Perhaps,  but i am still skeptical. I agree that would be a lot of work. But would still be hesitant giving authorship if they didn't do the original writing, idea development, research/analysis, lab work, etc. Editing and proofreading itself, is not a reason for authorship, or else we'd have to include every Journal editor on papers too. But for the sake of argument, I'll assume they rewrote major parts and supplemented with additional research. \n\nWith all due respect, *2 and 3 are exactly the problem.* \n\n2 - First, that's a dishonest statement. While there are not concrete rules for any of this, there's a ton of editorials and guidelines out there (and based on your comments I believe we are both biologists in the US). Here's another discussion: http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2010/04/conventions-scientific-authorship and http://www.ascb.org/compass/compass-points/ethics-authorship-science/. And just because other people do it, doesn't make it right. Those people you mention should not have received authorship either. It was unethical of them to demand that of you. You were wronged, and their authorship dilutes the hard work and credit *you* deserve. \n\nAnd 3. If your guidelines for authorship include \"half an hour\" then there are serious issues here. This is an example of a gift or honorary authorship, which is not acceptable. Editing itself doesn't warrant authorship, even if they're brilliant...or again, then every journal editor or reviewer should become an author. But again, I'd concede that *huge* revisions and help refining ideas, adding to the research, may be kosher then. ",

I read it very carefully and noted that my now ex-advisor did the literal opposite of everything on this list and/or made it extremely hard for her students to succeed.  Imagine a one-sided situation where you have to ask extremely specific questions in order to get answers.  Outside of asking these particular questions you receive zero unsolicited guidance no matter how hard you try.  Not only do you not have regular meetings, but when it comes time for qualifying exams, they actually tell you that you are completely on your own to pass or fail.  This was my life.\n\nWith that, I think that the sub-par students part is true, however some profs like students that are emotionally or academically vulnerable because they will stay on longer.  They can control them indefinitely, which is exciting for some of these people.  For example, I found out that my ex-advisor tends to keep people in the program for 8 to 10 years (an insanely long time, even by social science standards).  One person is still here well past the 10 year mark.  It's a disturbing pattern.  Around 6 months ago I realized just how much this bad leadership was affecting these scholars personally, and none of them seemed to ultimately secure jobs that I would have wanted.  If they did well, it was entirely based on their own personal drive or qualifications.  In my case, I was actually discouraged from applying for certain funding opportunities because they didn't fit the profs idea of what they wanted me to do (for the record: the funding was great, totally relevant, and has changed my life).\n\nI would say that if I am ever an advisor or mentor in the future, I would like to actually try and tailor my advice and support to specific students vs. cardboard cutouts lol.  I really suffered under someone who saw this whole experience as a \"one size fits all\" approach.  A little bit of leeway is healthy.\n",

I've had a load of mixed experiences with advisors over the years, so I feel like you're really hitting the ball out of the park (or whatever the sports term is). Thank you! \n\nI would like to add something about goals and goal-setting that I think a lot of mentors miss. Of course, this is field-dependent, but not everyone goes to graduate school to hop into academia/research for employment, and I think that figuring out long-term goals early in the mentorship process is a huge, often glossed-over factor. My best advisors didn't have a set path for me, but rather, worked with me in what I wanted to accomplish, and we aimed for that trajectory. At my last grad school interview, my advisor and I discussed exactly that to determine if we were good fits for each other. I've seen way too many fellow students nosedive sometime between their first and second year because they discovered, for instance, that they loved teaching only to be browbeaten by their mentor that they must become a pure researcher. Subsequently, they hate their life but trudge on because they believe they have no other choice. Of course, I also know that there are plenty of students who come in with no idea what they want, and they might be served better with heavier guidance. \n",

My advisor seems to define significant contribution as something without which the paper wouldn't be of the same significance and thus wouldn't be likely to get accepted in the same journal. For my first paper, I set up equations which described experimental results (obtained by a postdoc), found the corresponding model in the literature, and set up as much of the calculations as possible in Excel, but couldn't do the crucial part of the calculations/modelling because I didn't know how to code well enough. From the notes I sent to my advisor, he was able to get a high school student to code the simulation in Matlab which confirmed the model and gave the crucial result(s). I was surprised that my advisor offered me authorship for that, which was by that point maybe about 10 h of productive work, but he explained that without the model the manuscript would be almost worthless, and that they wouldn't have been able to figure it out without my input. Of course the postdoc who did the experiments was first author, and I insisted that the high school student should be in front of me in the authorship order as his work took more skill and time, which my advisor agreed to. Eventually I ended up contributing a lot of time to the (re)writing and editing of that manuscript, which was very useful for me to learn and for my advisor to not be alone in it, but of course I wouldn't have gotten authorship just for that and my advisor wouldn't have me do it if I wasn't already an author.",
