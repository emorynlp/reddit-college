  "title:": "Professors who teach STEM courses: have you noticed an increase in students who were clearly forced to major in your field by their parents or other family members?",
  "text": "On the internet, and in real life, you will see many people complaining that STEM majors are much harder than non - STEM majors and that the grading is much harder in courses like engineering compared to business or psychology. Is this grade discrepancy really due to a difference in difficulty though? Due to the tech boom and increasing need for health related professionals, the need for software engineers, nurses, and doctors is only growing. Due to the increasing need and high(er) pay, surely that means that more parents are forcing their kids to major in fields like  computer science, electrical engineering, nursing, than ever before, right? This happens even when the kid has no interest or ability in math and science. Am I right in saying that this would explain why more people in STEM get bad grades compared to majors like history, anthropology, or accounting?",

      "text": "I haven't personally observed more students telling me that their parents forced them in. But I have observed more students being interested in those types of professions and having little exposure to them (thus no idea what to expect) and little preparation from these pandemic-interrupted periods. Math preparation it seems like is especially hard for students to catch up on. You think about it: if someone wants to major in biology or history, they had that in high school. They know what biology is. Most high schools don't have a comprehensive CS curriculum. Many students go in not realizing what course work they will need, and unable to calibrate if this matches their motivations, inclinations, and talents. And so you get to college and you might need to take a bunch of weeder math classes.\n\nI don't necessarily view my job as any harder than anyone elses'. But I did have access to high-quality preparation along the way for quantitative work. This is, sadly, less common than it ought to be.",

      "text": "I haven't noticed an increase, but I would say that's because this has always been a thing. When I was teaching and advising students in the 2000s, it was pretty rampant then too, in the same professions you listed - \"STEM\" (particularly computer science and applied mathematics) and health professions (mostly pre-medicine, although interest in nursing and PA has grown a lot).\n\nI work in tech, and like most things, the story that there is an 'increasing need for software engineers' is a lot more complicated than that. Demand for developers is high...right now. But coding is also being taught in elementary school now, remote work is growing rapidly, companies are finding that they can find lower-cost labor elsewhere, and we're in the middle of a social reckoning about how tech shapes our world and our lives.\n\nOr, put another way...finance and real estate were the hot careers when I started college in 2004. They weren't by the time I finished in 2008.\n\nI'm not sure that more people in the natural, physical, mathematical and computational sciences get worse grades than people in the social sciences and humanities. I'd need to see the data on it. But assuming that they do, it's definitely possible that that's partially due to people who would perhaps be better suited for another field succumbing to financial or social pressure. I think it's safe to surmise that there are probably more computer science and biology majors who don't want to be there than there are history or psychology majors who don't want to be there.\n\nIt's also possible that the teaching style doesn't work for them, or that they're an underrepresented minority and are facing a lot of other pressures that depress their performance, or something else completely.",

Largely, the \"feeling like an outsider\" trope that gets emphasized as to why minorities don't succeed in academia seems like a n ubsunstantiated hypothesis, purely from anecdotical observations.",

                      "text": "I\u2019m a woman who grew up with a very blue-collar family in the American south. My accent often specifically gets perceived as unintelligent, and early on in college I struggled a lot with not relating to many of my peers with upper-class backgrounds, who grew up expecting to go to college, etc., and I felt like, culturally, I was very behind the curve. It made it difficult to convince people that, academically, I was capable of keeping up.\n\nI also didn\u2019t have family to really support me, because they were kind of confused about why I went to college at all and didn\u2019t understand what I was doing, and that made my transition to college particularly lonely.\n\nIn college classes, I\u2019ve had a few professors who specifically made disparaging comments about women, or who would interpret questions from me in classes vastly different from if another person asked.\n\nIn my PhD, day-to-day both within my university and outside of it, people are often shocked (not just impressed, which is the reaction my partner usually receives) when they learn what program I\u2019m in or especially what subfield I\u2019m in. That\u2019s a strong signal that I \u201cdon\u2019t look like\u201d who they expect a CS PhD student to be (my department is about 30% women, but only 8% of those women are my ethnicity, and I dress very stereotypically feminine). I try to embrace that, and do a lot of STEM outreach to help change those perceptions, but it\u2019s still annoying.\n\nAlso, as a consequence of those demographics, I have extremely few female friends, and although I\u2019ve befriended many male peers, navigating fairly common situations where I find out that they hold misogynistic viewpoints, or make unwanted romantic advances, etc. gets tiring. I try to meet people through non-academic hobbies, but the frequent relocating makes this extra difficult at times.\n\nUp until this semester, I had NEVER taken a computer science course taught by a woman professor, let alone someone who had a similar background to me in other aspects. I would like more role models who have navigated similar social dynamics as me, but they\u2019re quite hard to find.\n\nWith that said, I have friends and people who support me, and I feel lucky to be where I am. I just also recognize the ways in which my specific background has made a lot of little things harder for me than for many, and sometimes that really gets me down. I think it gets a lot of people down. It also probably depends a lot on very specific personal situations\u2014 clearly it isn\u2019t a universal experience for minorities, and I\u2019m glad of that!",

It seems the primary reasons it has been difficult for you have more to do with class than the others. Which makes sense, class division is significantly different from ethnicity in a variety of ways.\n\nI have never taken a course at the university level taught by someone who matches my ethnicity, but I never perceived that as being \"different\". It might be because I am an immigrant while you studied in your home country, but since I came with the expectation of being different, I was more shocked about all I had in common with people in my program.\n\nI come from an environment where no one is interested in mathematics, so I literally could not talk about my passions and was considered weird. When I did my undergrad however, all my peers had similar interests, in anime, in games, in mathematics, in programming... To the point I am closer with my university friends than anyone I grew up with.\n\nBut I had an \"upper class\" upbringing and lots of family support. And I think those are the key differences between your experiences and mine. I don't think ethnicity matters much for something like this, in general I find that in academic settings you bond over shared interests and experiences, and ethnicity is just a cosmetic characteristic.\n\nBut again this is just from my very specific context.",

It also sounds like I am somewhat younger than you, maybe the cohort's average age also plays into it.  \n\n\nIt might also be that I never strongly identified with my ethnic identity (I don't mean I reject who I am, I just never saw it as an integral part of what makes me an individual), it just always felt like a set of superficial traits to me, the religion of my people, the music you hear on teh radio and the folklore stories, the food... All of those are nice quirks, but I never gave them much importance.   \n\n\nI have also encountered instances of \"racism\", but I legitimately get excited when I do, as I see them as an oportunity to play with stereotypes and connect with another person. (The racism I have exprience is the ignorant kind, not the hateful kind, dealing with ignorance is easy, hatred is a different story alltogether). I just did not see someone getting \"shocked\" at me doing what I do as an insult, quite the contrary, it made me feel special kind of like \"Yay I am breaking stereotypes, I am showing other people that my kind can do these things too :)\".  \nBut again, I was raised by very supportive parents so I always thought, intrinsically, that I could achieve things if I was dilligent enough. I think that might also play a little into it, the question is never if \\*I\\* belong, but if I have \\*done enough\\* to belong.",

That means that faculty can\u2019t (shouldn\u2019t, at least) give a good grade to an answer that is demonstrably incorrect. In addition, STEM (more than non-STEM) tends to build new material atop old material. If you don\u2019t learn the earlier stuff, you won\u2019t understand the later stuff. In contrast, if you never took Shakespeare, you can still do well with 19th century English literature, though you might miss a few things. Both reasons contribute to lower grades in STEM than other fields, and this differential is borne out by research studies about grades.\n\nYes, we have a lot more students in our computer science classes who either don\u2019t want to be there or aren\u2019t doing well, or both. \u201cNot doing well\u201d can be caused by lack of interest and *perhaps* by less ability, though interested students can usually do sufficiently well to pass, even if they\u2019re not superstars. But unmotivated *and* less talented? That\u2019s a lethal combination, but we\u2019ve got a lot of them. Those dollar signs really motivate students, and motivate parents to push students. I\u2019ve explicitly heard art faculty complain about students in their classes who\u2019d like to major in art but have been told by their parents that they have to major in STEM.",

It's tempting to look down on these students from an American perspective as being afraid to grow up and leave school, but I think this reflects cultural differences that we (Americans) should respect (e.g. respect for elders and very high value placed on education for its own sake or for its class mobility attributes).",
