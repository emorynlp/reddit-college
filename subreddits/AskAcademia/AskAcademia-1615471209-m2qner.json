  "text": "Hey everyone\n\nI went to the Dr a few days ago and she found a mass on my humerus. She was reluctant to officially diagnose but it seems that it is osteosarcoma. I was wondering if this is something I should tell my grad advisor. I\u2019m hesitant because I\u2019m afraid she might tell me to quit to be with my family. In all honesty I want to keep going until it gets bad enough I can\u2019t leave my bed. The reason I\u2019m inclined to telling here is because I might be spotty quite a Few days because of imaging testing and who knows ,maybe even bone autopsies.",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in my late teens. I had just been accepted to a college i was excited to go to when I got the diagnoses. \n\nMy mistake was to move from home and support for a college in a town I\u2019d never lived. I had to drop out midway thru the first term. I ended up having to rely on a gaggle of semi-friends (I.e. other students) to get me to and from appointments, the ER when I spiked a temp in the middle of the night, the cancer ward for chemo, etc. It was *not* ideal. I finally moved back home after that and spent a lot of time healing. You will **need** a support network if you get this diagnosis. \n\nIf you get this horrible diagnosis, you\u2019re life will forever change. Stoicism and bravery will not be enough to combat the new reality of your life filled with chemo, blood treatments, follow ups, hospitalizations, etc. If you have any plan of living through it, you will need the grace in time and understanding to prioritize your health. Research should be deprioritized. You should really consider taking a medical leave of absence. Find friends and family who can help be your advocate when you\u2019re too weak to do it yourself. Establish your care network. Do this *before* you start chemotherapy: I can\u2019t describe what that shit does to you physically *and* mentally. You can\u2019t do this by yourself. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry you might have to battle this monster. I truly hope you get good news and it\u2019s benign. I agree with those saying that telling your advisor can wait until after you get an actually confirmed diagnosis. I\u2019d say you have some personal medical issues to deal with to explain your spotty availability during appointments; your advisor should respect your medical privacy.",

If it is osteosarcoma most likely you will be scheduled for surgery pretty quickly and then will need chemo. Major surgery and chemo will knock you totally off your ass. I know this is all a hard and bitter pill to swallow, but you are probably going to need to focus entirely on your recovery as soon as you have a diagnosis. If I recall correctly, osteosarcoma has a very high rate of survival with treatment so the good news is that you will probably be fine. But working during is probably not going to be doable, thus why you need to talk to your PI and see how they can accommodate you (maybe a research assistant can carry on your work, etc). Best wishes and good luck OP.",

Once you get diagnosed, things happen fast. I had to get surgery less than a month after I was diagnosed and then take a month of leave for recovery. I didn't get chemo or radiation because RCC is typically highly resistant to them both.\n\nEven after physically recovering, I still had to deal with post-surgical fatigue and mental health issues, and I've had multiple cancer recurrence scares that have required detailed follow ups. When I was first diagnosed, I thought I'd be able to maintain my normal life after surgery, but to be honest, I still haven't fully recovered my energy or mental and emotional health. In my case, my lab also lost funding right after I got back from surgery, and then COVID happened like 6 months later. \n\nI took another post-doc to avoid an an employment gap (because maintaining continuous health insurance is now critical), but this whole chain of events has largely closed the door on an academic career for me. I'm from a working class family who can't financially support me, and I have student loan debt, so I can't justify the risk of trying to play the academic lottery when so few stable academic research positions exist and the competition is greater than ever.\n\nIf it's cancer, then to be honest, it's probably going to radically affect your life. When you're living in the shadow of a terminal illness, it casts a lot of things in very different lights. I was top of my class in grad school and passionate about my research before I had cancer. Now, I don't care about it at all. I know that it's unlikely to benefit anyone but publishing companies, and I feel like the time that I've put into science and the hobbies and relationships that I've lost in my pursuit of an academic research career were all just sacrifices on an alter of vanity.\n\n I'd rather spend my time with people that I care about and having fun instead of working all the time on shit that won't benefit me. Maybe you're different, but I know that this was not the outcome that I expected for myself at all.",
