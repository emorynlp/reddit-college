  "title:": "anyone have traditions for celebrating their academic successes?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD student and my first publication is a book chapter coming out in December. I\u2019m proud of my work, but don\u2019t really want to come across as bragging by posting about it or throwing a party or something crazy. I was thinking I\u2019d like to do a little something special just for myself to acknowledge my success, and thought it would be nice to do something I could make into a career-long tradition every time I publish (\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb). Does anyone do anything like that? Or have ideas for what might be a cool thing to do?",

She would celebrate by going out to dinner with her friends and buying them a round (it\u2019s not braggy if you buy people a shot for celebrating with you right??). But seriously your friends want to see you- and \u201cI just accomplished something and am giving myself a night off and out and want to be with you all\u201d is super flattering. I love when my friends celebrate themselves, it also gives me a good excuse to take a night off and celebrate with them, good feelings all around!",

The pen for my highest citation count pub was in that case. I'm still mourning, clearly.

And by \"important\" I don't mean impact factor, I measure it by how much it mean to me or how much effort we, as a team, had to dedicate ... \nFor instance, when we finished a specially difficult publicaron that took more than 2 years, 11 people and provoked one person to leave the PhD, we threw a \"party\" (some beverages and food) at the laboratory, then we went to have a private dinner only those who took part, and then we party all night until we couldn't remember our name.\nNevertheless, no matter how \"small\" the achievement is, everytime I publish something, I'll grab my friend and go have some beer (at least).\nSo go on and celebrate, PhD is hard enough without this little things.",

I had a PI who had champagne bottles in his office from each party he threw for a funded grant. It can be hard for non-academics to understand these milestones, but they can understand the joy of sharing a meal out to eat or a night of playing board games.
