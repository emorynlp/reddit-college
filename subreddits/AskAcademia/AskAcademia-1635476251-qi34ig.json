  "text": "I am a literature student and while I love the subject I find the writing of most articles and books I read very difficult. It seems needlessly dense and convoluted; it often takes me several reads to decipher a paragraph and when I do I often find myself asking 'is that it?' Why do academics do this?",

Also, there\u2019s little reward for good prose and thus little incentive to improve. \n\nPart of it is technical terminology, and oftentimes that\u2019s used because it\u2019s a time saver. If I can say \u201cA supervenes on B\u201d instead of constantly saying \u201cThere cannot be a change in the properties of A without some change in the properties of B\u201d, then it\u2019s hard to resist the jargon. \n\nAnd part of it is that we often write in ways that preclude as many possible misinterpretations as possible, which leads to our writing being long-winded and pedantic. But not doing this means nitpicky reviewers deny the work for publication or tedious debates proliferate in the literature based on simple misunderstandings.",

This is a bigger problem than academics would like to admit, but it certainly happens in the humanities. Training is often about learning the correct discourse and how to wield it. Try reading Donna Haraway and I dare you to come away thinking that she was preoccupied with removing all possible misunderstandings. I happen to think she revels in her obscure style.",

I do write stuff for broader audiences but its no where near as rigorous nor as enjoyable to write, plus it takes up quite a lot of space. The book I'm currently writing has an entire chapter, a full 1/8th of the book devoted to explaining international law so the book is reasonably accessible to non international lawyers and I'm still not sure how successful it'll be - even academics in related disciplines seem to struggle I read a lot of IR work that misses the mark because they clearly don't understand how lawyers read treaties and try to make an erroneous legal argument (that treaties don't mean what they say isn't an entirely unreasonable criticism but its not a legal argument).",

Later, we ended up swapping critical to \"necessary,\" since the work wasn't specifically about the calls to action or resistance that critical consciousness implies, as well as to further distance it from another theme within the same piece about \"critical incidents\" (as written about by Tripp, 1993). \n\nThat citation completely shifts how the work is meant to be read, since Tripp does not use the term \"critical\" in the way that critical theorists do, nor does it define \"critical incidents\" in remotely close ways to Carter, Kang, and Taggart \\[1999\\], Roos \\[many citations\\], Furr & Carroll \\[2003\\],... etc....); in fact, Tripp basically uses the term in the complete opposite way that both many untrained readers assume and the way that other scholars do, since Tripp's notion of critical incidents are often everyday, otherwise-unexamined examples of professional practice that represent just \"how things often are,\" which are then made important by analyzing them \"critically\" (ie with the intent to trouble understandings of what is accepted and performed without consciously thinking about it). \n\nWithout a decently strong background in the field or without doing a ton of reading alongside the piece you're trying to read, it's super easy to take the completely wrong message away from a piece, even if it isn't written in a way that feels like it's highly technical, jargon-laden, or dense.",

Rather, it shows that often, folks in academia don't write in \"plain English\" largely because they feel the need to \"sound smart\" and/or \"fit the part.\" This is doubly sad because recent research has shown that scientific papers that use too much \"specialized terminology\" are cited less frequently.

Therefore, it is usually necessary to invoke those other ideas and authors and they way they used terminology. We are also taught to write with attention to the logic of argumentation.

But the fault is really not of individual academics, but the culture in academia where you won't be valued unless you load your essays up with jargon. Whenever i write in simple language for my college assignments, many of my professors, some of whom are stalwart academics themselves, under-mark me. So young academics often have no choice but to jump into the bandwagon of using jargon to establish themselves in the field.\n\nThat being said, this isn't always the case. Sometimes, convoluted language is necessary to convey a complex point of view, and at other times, it actually saves words. Once you familiarise yourself with the academic terminology of your field, it definitely gets easier to understand such essays.\n\nAlso, complexity of language itself is a subjective idea. What appears complicated to you, might appear very simple to a professor. In that case, the target audience of the author also influences their choice of language. There are some literary critics who are difficult to read for everyone, but in my experience at least, most of them write in a language that an average literature grad can understand with some effort. Of course, there are some essays which you find easy to understand, that a younger student might find incomprehensible.\n\nPersonally, i have accepted that academic essays are mostly going to be hard.

The most annoying part of scientific academic writing is probably the ubiquitous-to-the-point-of-mindnumbing passive voice--it reeks of this sort of wannabe supremely objective and analytical narrator voice. It's like it tries to rid itself of the subject completely.\n\nI prefer how mathematicians write. It seems more natural to state something along the lines \"we can see that this result naturally follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra,\" or \"we have shown this previously and the reader can verify this result by choosing the right inequality and evaluating the expression F(g(x)).\" It just straddles that sort of equilibrium of ego and lack of ego. The author gets to show their ingenuity while also making it seem like the whole group is in agreement.\n\nMuch of the humanities academic writing goes much too far with this ego-insertion for my taste. For example, many of the Pomo philosophers and authors sound so deluded and pompous without saying a whole lot as if they've been sniffing their own fumes for too long. I imagine this can probably be traced back through the German tradition--thanks Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche! /s\n\nEdit to say that I've noticed the best writers try to keep their writing simple enough that maybe a 10 year old or so could understand it.

I presume you would get tired if all of your content were completely dejargonized, and repeated frequently across your readings, as in the [up-goer 5](https://xkcd.com/1133/). \n\nI would not want to read that. I would want to bundle up these unwieldy ideas into larger ideas so I can play around with the larger ideas without getting bogged down in the details. \n\nSure, in talking to laymen, and to students, it makes sense to decompress these ideas where necessary. But that is where classes and literature reviews and old PhD theses can be helpful, no?\n\nTake for example, \"postmodern philosophy\", which I think would constitute a jargon to a layman? In the course of discussing postmodernism, it would be dreadful to always deconstruct it and develop the whole concept, define it through its history and Butler, Foucault, Derrida, (etc) over and over again. If one is learning about postmodernism, sure, but that's not a novel problem. Academics tend to publish on novel ideas, I think it makes sense that they try to put it concisely so they may deal with more interesting works.",

(Foucault called causation a \"Chimera\")...    \n\nHowever, all language has a causative structure (subject, verb, object).  What you choose as the subject (and especially, object) of a sentence determines causation.   But what if you're writing about something (like a culture) that HAS no simple causation?   \n\nYou can see this linguistic problem in childhood riddles:  \n\nwhich comes first, the chicken or the egg?\n\nThe problem is, our language is not truly capable of expressing the complex interdependently-mutually-causative, temporal-defined-at-any-given-instant-but-self-reproducing-cyclical-but-unique-each-cycle relationship between a chicken and an egg.  (you see what I had to do there?)\n\nAcademic writing is complex because the *subject matter* is complex.

This is the kind of editing that scientific writing might go through to maximise clarity/precision.\n\nYou have captured the essence of the question you want answered. However, it is a flawed question.  Some academics *do* write well. So a better phrasing would be \"why don't some academics write in plain English\".\n\nThere is also the issue that you have likely not surveyed every subject area; you are basing this on looking at papers in subjects X, Y and Z. So a better phrasing is \"Why don't some academics in X Y and Z write in plain English?\".\n\nNext we come onto the language. Is this a problem specific to English, or do we see the same problems in papers written in other languages?  \"Why don't some academics in subjects X,Y and Z write in a clear and simple way\".\n\nNow, doing that, I have made some assumptions about what \"plain English\" means.  We have also not yet addressed whether this is seen in other subject areas, or whether there are differences in extent between areas. And so on.\n\nThe point is, that language conveys a lot of subtlety, and when writing for publication it is really really important that we capture the specific details of the thing we are writing about. We can't use generalisms if our study does not deal with the general. We have to write with the assumption that the people reading it are familiar with the field so we can use terminology which gives us lots of shortcuts. We also have to write with the assumption that the person reading it is not a native speaker.\n\nThere is a shit-ton of bad academic writing out there. But there's also a huge swathe of carefully and clearly written material which - while riddled with technical terminology - captures nuance and detail in a clear and concise way.",

You can also makes things seem far more complicated and brilliant by throwing around a lot of equation and symbols, which I also see.\n\nThe clearer you are the easier you open yourself up for attack by the reviewer. Also, academics have an incentive to make their subject difficult to outsiders. Their value is the uncommon knowledge they possess.  \n\nHowever, even if perverse incentives were gone there still would be problems. Papers are written for fellow experts in the field so much background knowledge is generally assumed, which would make it difficult for newcomers and outsiders. Sometimes the subject matter is just hard and takes years to master. Finally, not everyone has English as their first language and even many people who do have it have it as their first language are terrible writers.",

      "text": "I'm going to be honest: this was one of the main reasons I left academia. I know that it sounds petty, but I love to write. To me writing is always meant to convey information and the style, tone, diction, and structure should be purposeful. But academic writing almost seems crafted for the goal of stunting - demonstrating how smart and talented one is rather than trying to illustrate points. I have a special hatred for the passive voice (\"participants were recruited...\"), as it disembodies the work - *I* recruited those goddamn participants, lol.\n\nI'm a social scientist who was trained in an applied field. In academia I always disliked that I felt like I was writing for a small group of highly educated scientists who were going to do nothing with my work other than cite it. It just felt like a giant circlejerk rather than meaningful work. I wanted to write for the public, who might actually learn from my work and use it to change their individual behavior or to build community programs based on it.  I work in industry now and all of the \"papers\" I write (and the \"classes\" I design) are directed at practitioners who are going to use the work to improve their work in some way, and it's incredibly satisfying.\n\nThat said, I don't blame individual academics for writing in jargon: these are the standards we have established, and I've seen young scientists get *dinged* for writing using comprehensible language and plain, clear terminology. Also, as others have pointed out, sometimes the specific terms are necessary to convey information in fewer words; I have no problem with discipline-specific terminology.\n\nBut I see this exploding right now with the entire world, it seems, attempting to read scientific journal articles during the coronavirus pandemic to assess the science and make decisions for themselves and their families. My background is in public health and sometimes *I* have trouble reading these articles! (The fact that most of them are paywalled is a whole other area of frustration. Science funded by public funds should be available for the public.)",

Academic disciplines focus their study on a set of concepts/processes that have been described in detail by previous writers, so  summarizing terms (e.g. \"inequity aversion\" or \"transcription factor\" or \"self-domestication) are often used without always fleshing them out. This assumes that academic writers have a particular community in mind among whom there is shared knowledge of the prior work.\n2. **Thingify concepts and theories.** Using short-hand makes academics use a lot of nouns that sum up a theory or a concept (e.g. Reinforcement learning, Social Dominance Orientation, Conscientiousness). Among academics, scientists also have a special language about cause and effect (e.g. X predicts Y, X explains variance in Y), that pushes out the use of more common sense verbs used to describe the relationship between things.\n3. **Signal one's competence.** Academics are motivated to signal the complexity of their thoughts to their fellow academics (and, for example, to organizations that grant funding). This can done using convoluted language whether the ideas being put into words have merit or not, but the motive to signal the complexity and sophistication of an argument may be the strongest for the disciplines that are self-conscious of their own credibility. \n4. **Defend from invasion.** An economist might say \"create barriers to entry\". It's a cynical theory, but maybe the urge to defend access to a discipline makes complicated writing styles more appealing. There are definitely barriers to entry in every discipline, and they could be a byproduct of the above incentives rather than stemming from this more self-serving motive.\n\nCheers!",

The goal is typically to condense a million-page long book into a 600 page one, and it takes thousands of years of arguing, definitions, use of symbols to do that. A big part of mathematics is about improving arguments, and making them easier to understand so the next generation can learn it more quickly.\n\nIf you go back to classical greece, it took an entire paragraph to describe a specific rational number. Now we just write 2/4, 5/12, ect. Studying mathematics for all of your 20's in classical Greece would get you to learn what your average kid can learn by the time they get to middle school.\n\nEven things like differential geometry which was probably some really hard math for Einstein is now something a hard-working math student can get a basic grasp of in a 15 week course, (while taking a few other papers).\n\nBut if there are people are using unnecessary terminology, It's usually to make yourself appear smarter, or to make a subject hard enough so that you need a specialist to understand it, which protects their job. There's been a lot exposure of that in regards to postmodern literature.\n\nI personally love the way mathematicians write: They choose their words very carefully, and have english phrases like \"without loss of generality\", and \"if and only if\", \"for all\" that have deep logical meaning. But everyone is treated equally here, as if everyone can understand it. That's why the person making an argument always refers to themselves as \"we\" instead of \"I\" in math. They are talking to you as if the reader is making the argument with them. It's cooperative.",

      "text": "I agree with all the comments that sometimes complexity is necessary. But I do agree with OP that sometimes academics seem to use a more sophisticated version of a school kid trying to use \u201cfancy words\u201d to mask a paper that lacks substance.  That is to say that there is an aesthetic to academic writing and I think that it is often used to make ideas seem more important than they are or to cover up having no ideas whatsoever (but still needing a paper to publish). And this is where it is a problem in my opinion. We try to make it complicated to make it seem important, whether or not it is. And maybe that\u2019s not a fair judgement, because I know being an academic in today\u2019s world is tough, but I think it\u2019s the reality: a lot of academic writing tropes and style are about expectations and aesthetics just as much, if not more so, than about substance. And I don\u2019t necessarily want to say aesthetics are always bad, but left unchecked, they can create problems.\n\nI will also say, I don\u2019t think, unfortunately, there are incentives or forums in which \u201cimportant\u201d publications encourage researchers and academics to write in a simpler and more clear fashion. Maybe a department makes a media release or a journalist writes a story on something, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same as having outlets for academics to talk like human beings instead of complicated machines. So that also is part of the problem. Let\u2019s start publishing *Annals of the Academic Discourse for Dummies and Normies*. Make it just as important to explain research to ordinary folks, by the researchers themselves.\n\nThe last consideration I would add is that many academics certainly don\u2019t speak English as a first language. And that may also influence things. I\u2019ve noticed that when trying to learn other languages, I tend to err on the side of being too formal. And I\u2019m sure some of that is at play here. You have English speakers insecure about their skills and trying to impress others and also carrying over peculiarities from their language.",

      "text": "This kind of writing in literary studies reflects the difference between those kinds of arguments and those in the hard sciences: you can prove your argument through experimentation and hard data in the latter, but not really in the former. For instance, you can't prove that a certain interpretation of, say, a Shakespeare play is correct.\n\nThis means that you're left with rhetoric. You try to make as convincing an argument as you can by marshaling your textual evidence, but you succeed in part on the effectiveness of your rhetoric.\n\nThis leads some people to try really hard to sound really smart or really clever as a way to convince you that they must be write. It also leads some people to write overly elaborate, hard-to-follow prose to convince the reader that the writer must really be saying something deep and important if it's so hard to follow.",

      "text": "A couple things play into this, which have something to do with more enjoyable and accessible writing vs academic writing:\n- Synonyms. It can add variety and sounds better to avoid repetition of terms, by typical writing terms. However, most fields have had to give similar terms, or even synonyms in standard practice, different meanings within the field. Consider that if you Google synonyms for factor, you can get point, constituent, intermediary, element, among others. Points and factors sure aren\u2019t the same in statistics, element and intermediary cannot be interchanged when describing chemical reactions, etc.\n- Anecdotes, metaphors, idioms, etc. All of these are deeply frowned upon in much academic writing as unprofessional along with potentially causing multiple possible interpretations. Dry writing isn\u2019t meant to be fun, it\u2019s supposed to convey exactly one message without the potential for confusion. It can be tedious and boring to read, but it better suits the goal.\n- Practice. Some academics are impressively fun people with a good sense of humor and a fun writing style when outside of academic writing. Some haven\u2019t had to write anything more than an essay since undergrad. Similar to the teaching requirements of academia, the writing training can be limited and fantastically dependent upon the whims of specific professors (who may also have never had formal training in writing).\n\nAll of this results in more focus on other parts than \u201cfun\u201d writing outputs.",

When I say the word you know exactly what I mean, heck you might even have some nice associate imagery to supplement that thought which can work well with my argument. \n\nAs a student think of it this way, would you write similarly for an exam you\u2019re sitting that your teacher will read vs explaining that concept to your peers for a presentation? Academics write for..... other academics, not undergrad students. there just aren\u2019t enough good textbooks for all different type of courses especially higher level ones",
