  "title:": "What does 'Have you otherwise accepted responsibility for the commission of a crime?' mean on grad school application?",
  "text": "This question has popped up in a Community Standards column. I've answered questions about criminal convictions and so on with an honest 'no', however I have been arrested for a crime I did actually commit (and I think confessed to in a statement). The case was thrown out however since there was no public interest and a tonne of extenuating circumstances. To cut a long story short, it involved me sending angry messages to an ex that were taken a lot more seriously than they were intended. So, do I have to answer 'yes' here then. Or can I just put another 'no'?",

It's much easier to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone had $1M more income than reported than to prove the illicit nature of that $1M.",

The messages were sent while I was suffering from severe mental health issues and in a very particular context. The partner who received them was also abusive and had just revealed they had been lying to and cheating on me for months all the while regularly belittling me and many other things. In short: the situation was complex. I know this is Reddit but I am saddened to be described as a 'threatening, violent man'. I think it's unfair of you to judge me based on a snapshot incident of which, at the time you made that comment, you knew next to nothing about. People text daft things all the time. And people make mistakes. Indeed, part of the reason I understand I was not ultimately prosecuted is that I was considered of good character and have never had any issues with the law before or since. So please be a little kinder.",

However, I would question how sincere you are when you sent messages that were serious enough to be investigated by the police but say \"they were taken more seriously than you intended\". Blaming the recipient of your angry texts, that by implication were intended to instill fear, for not knowing you didn't really mean them, is just a sanitised version of \"it was just a joke, get a sense of humour\". You  also justify your behaviour because your ex also behaved badly. I get that you were in a dark place, but ultimately you chose to engage in the same abusive behaviours. Until you take responsibility for sending angry abusive messages, I think it's legitimate for people to react the way the person you're replying to did.\n\nYou chose to send those messages. It's your fault the police investigated. It's not the recipient's fault for not knowing you didn't mean your angry, violent threats. Their abusive behaviour doesn't justify yours.",
