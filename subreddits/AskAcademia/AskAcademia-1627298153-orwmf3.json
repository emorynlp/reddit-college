  "title:": "Research Experience - no longer a student",
  "text": "I graduated with a psych BS in 2013 and had a decent amount of research experience at the time. However, I\u2019m looking to go back to school for a PhD and have lost a lot of the skills I learned in the interim and the job experience I do have doesn\u2019t translate to getting a paid job in a lab as far as I can tell. \n\nMy question is: Are university labs likely to allow a non-student to volunteer in their lab for research experience?",

      "text": "I did just that back in 2011 which got me the experience I needed to get accepted to a PhD program. In order to do it I pin pointed professors in my areas of interest at the local university and emailed them regarding my situation. I had 2 rejections 2 ignores and 1 that I connected with to get the experience. You are offering them free help, don't underestimate that. \n\nI also got the advice to get the experience from a counselor working at the same facility as me. It may help if you can get the same type of referral if you know anyone that has ties to a university or people conducting research. This was not how I got the professor to email me back, but he did help me get a few more leads.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re not part of the traditional student programs (undergrad, masters, PhD, etc), then getting a \u201cvolunteer\u201d position (unpaid but doing something that will yield relevant experience) can be difficult. Usually labs will only take on extra people in a non-training capacity if they have a personal/networked connection with someone. \n\nYou can try cold emailing a professor, but this has a quite low success rate if you don\u2019t have the exact skills required, nor a specific project in mind. A more likely route is looking in the lab website and finding a friendly face. See if you can email them to have an informational chat about their work (people love talking about themselves!) to gauge whether they are 1) working on something you\u2019re interested in too and 2) willing to go out on a limb and effectively vouch for/sponsor a volunteer research person for the summer, say. \n\nThe system is kind of messed up and insular if you don\u2019t have a direct connection, but this is probably the best bet without entering a full blown masters or PhD program to get that structured research experience.",

          "text": "Thank you for the reply! I will go through the faculty pages and see if my interests align with any current research. \n\nDo you think that my chances might improve if I am taking classes at the school I\u2019m looking to volunteer at? I\u2019m currently interviewing for a staff position at the university\u2019s medical school and with that comes a few free credit hours each semester. I\u2019m hoping I can establish relationships that way since I\u2019ll need letters of recommendation anyway.",

              "text": "It\u2019s possible it could help! I\u2019m only speaking from experience in biology depts, but the usual trajectory to a research position is: undergrad -> research technician -> masters or PhD, or just more tech jobs. \n\nIn psych, there are likely entry-level jobs (data entry, coding/classification of data, etc) that you could ask around about. The classes might help a little, but usually the professors know you will learn \u201con the job\u201d anyway, so prior class work may not really be all that helpful. \n\nAgain this is all from a more \u201cwet lab\u201d biology research experience, so I\u2019d encourage you to find a grad student who does research you\u2019re interested in and ask them for coffee. I think most people you\u2019d want to work with will take you up on the offer to chat about what they study, and can give you great and specific advice about getting a foot in the door!",

      "text": "It is doubtful I would take a non-student into my lab. Aside from the complications of giving this person access to data and being outside of our IRB system, my job is to provide research experiences to my students, not to non-students. There is no benefit to me, only Complications and risks. Another commentor suggested you are offering \u201cfree help.\u201c. However, the help is not free. Working with students is time consuming and often extremely frustrating.",
