  "text": "Ok so for context, I am a 17M and a senior in high school and was gonna publish my review paper on anthropology  to the \u201cJournal of Student Research\u201d. However they\u2019re are some APC fees since it\u2019s an open access journal and the deadline is August 31st; The fees aren\u2019t much though. Ive been working on this with the help of my biology teacher for a few months since she has a Ph.D and me and her have a good relationship . Should I still post here or somewhere else and if not where.\n\nI go to a small school so there Is no such thing as AP Research in fact I believe I\u2019m the first person at my high school to even touch research.",

There's no definitive list but in general anywhere that guarantees acceptance of a paper on payment of a fee, or turns around peer review very rapidly with few comments is a predatory publisher.

Writing papers by 17 is a very nice prospect for your future :)\nYou could find other journals in your field that do not charge APC fees - the SCIMAGO website would be a good starting point to filter out your options.\nThere's also the possibility of publishing the review as a preprint, which is a nice format of scientific publishing where you gather insights from peers after publishing your work.",
