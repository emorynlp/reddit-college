  "text": "I feel like a complete asshole asking this, as I know it's an emergency situation and the normal rules go out the window.  \n\nI'm a lecturer, and it feels like management are giving extra work to those of us who don't have children, or whose children are grown up. I'm not in a stage of my life where children are possible at the moment (hopefully soon), but I feel angry and upset that myself and other colleagues without children are getting all the extra work that is normally shared across all colleagues equally. Obviously I'm aware that colleagues who do have children are having to juggle work and their family situation, so I feel like I'm being unreasonable, but at the same time, this is work that I wouldn't have normally had in the usual non-COVID circumstances.  \n\nWhat do you think? I am right to feel annoyed, or am I being a selfish asshole and need to suck it up?",

      "text": "I think everyone is being expected to do more than they were previously. To take an in person course and convert it to an online one in a matter of a week or two weeks (in the case of my school) is an impossible task. Most online teachers have months to prepare the syllabus, recorded lectures and learn how to teach from a distance. For colleges there are a lot of resources, canvas, blackboard, licensed Zoom etc. My mother is a highschool ESL teacher and she's expected to flip her class online in a matter of a week with maybe a quarter of the resources and technological understanding. Luckily, her kids are grown and are good with technology lol. \n\nI think and know your feelings are valid, it sucks seeing others do less than you and sacrificing for them. As a parent I know they appreciate it. Educators, that are also parents are dealing with having to flip their classroom and trying to be there for their children, who are also experiencing great change and uncertainty. I know they feel as if they are failing in both areas. \n\nI think we need to cut everyone slack, this is unprecedented and there is so much uncertainty and not everything will go smoothly, and to expect it to it is unfair to both students and educators.\n\nI'm just an non-traditional undergrad student with three kids suddenly home with the same schedule of coursework. Two of my classes were labs (biochemistry and ecology) and I'm pissed that I won't get to have the same education that I paid for because of this pandemic. I'm also angry at myself and the situation because my oldest is scared and lonely without school and that I can't be there for her because I have so much to do, all the time. \n\nEverything just sucks right now and it's okay to be upset or angry. But don't take it out on other people, communicate your feelings and let people know what you can do and cannot do. You may have to suck up some but don't take on too much that it makes you bitter toward your colleagues.",

This is an extreme situation.\n\nIf it would make you feel better, keep a log of the ways you're going above and beyond. It's possible you may be able to use it later as leverage when you need help from others or have a family emergency of your own. Compassion now might save you from being jobless when the recession hits.\n\nThere is so much uncertainty and fear right now. Shouldering the burden when others can't is one of the ways we're going to get through this. Even if it's a little resentful, I really do thing the appropriate response right now is kindness.",

Like OC says, this is an extreme situation and it's possible that the well-being of your entire community will hinge on the actions you take and what you are able to give. \n\nThe extra work you are doing may turn out to be thankless, OR not having children may be providing you with the biggest opportunity of your life to become recognized by not only your field but the world community. I don't know your field but many groups in academia have been feeling the need to step up and put their specialties to use to combat the crisis, and it's less likely to be the ones with kids that are making their mark. While many of your colleagues have just been promoted to full-time childcare because of the crisis, you have the same (or similar) working capacity, a fresh and urgent problem to tackle, and less \"competition\" with which you are racing against to solve the problem.",

      "text": "I don't think you are selfish. I think, in normal circumstances, the state should provide the necessary means of childcare such as kindergartens, parental leaves etc. But we are not under normal circumstances right now. Just imagine working on your usual schedule, but with kids at home, constantly wanting attention, food, yelling, maybe fighting with each other. I can clearly see the point of assigning them less work. However, this doesn't mean you're selfish, and you have every right to feel annoyed. It's not your responsibility if they wanted to have kids. Unfortunately, I can't come up with a win-win solution for you, but maybe you should raise your concerns about overworking.\n\nEdit: forgot to add \"should\" in the second sentence",

Yes, you can complain about it being \"unequal,\" but it's a fairly anemic and stunted assessment of nuts-and-bolts reality. It's like when Republicans try to push a \"flat tax\" that disproportionately consumes resources of the poor and struggling, versus hardly affecting the livelihood of those with excess resources. (\"Regardless of your income bracket, everyone pays nine percent! Equal for everyone!\")\n\nIn this case, the resource is time, rather than money. It's a way for those with excess to be able to chip in extra and help those who are struggling to get by with less.\n\n^(Yes, you can balk \"people) *^(chose to)* ^(have kids,\" etc., but that'd be encroaching into some pretty unsavory territory here.

B took the job under a certain set of expectations regarding work and personal time. B has no responsibility to use *their* personal time to enable A to have more personal time. Unbalanced distribution of work eats into B's personal time to give more to A. This is not part of the agreed-upon arrangement, and is an *individualized* expense for an *individualized* benefit.\n\nIf B agrees to do this of their own free will, that's great, I applaud that and likely would volunteer myself to do such (as long as A wasn't an asshole). But if B's boss assigns excess work to B, then B should either be compensated for it, or be able to say no. If the department/university wants to give allowances to parents, again, that's great, and I support that.

The situation is socially agreed upon in the sense that these taxes has been passed into law - is this the only signifier of social acceptance you are willing to accept?\n\nThe counterpoint to this is that the United States has a woefully inadequate childcare situation, and that if we only use \"socially accepted\" i.e. legally encoded allowances for childcare, then parents are not allowed sufficient benefits. We need to go above and beyond what is required by the law in order to facilitate raising children in our society. It may be the case that some additional work is given in certain situations to those who are childless: but I sincerely doubt that this increased workload is oppressive or backbreaking in the majority of cases. I think the unfairness rankles people, moreso than they are truly overworked as a result of childcare allowances. If this isn't the case, then we have a different story.",

I'm using it more vaguely in that the concept is not something new or radical, it's generally understood and accepted. People know when they get a job that their income will be taxed, people know when they buy a house that their property will be taxed. Well, as long as where they choose to live has such taxes, my point is that it's known, understood, and outside of the \"All taxation is theft\" branch of libertarians, I don't know of any faction that objects to the concept of the government collecting taxes. There are disagreements on the degree and use of those taxes, but everyone has a say in that via their representatives. \n\nIn a salaried job, there are set expectations regarding the amount of work and amount of compensation. People can make deliberate decisions regarding where they work based on this. For example, if you doubled or tripled my salary, but expect me to work 65+ hours a week, I'm not taking that job. I work to live, I don't live to work.\n\nGenerally, people at the same rank (e.g., lecturers like the OP, or assistant professors, etc) should be expecting to be paid approximately if not exactly the same, and to have approximately equal workloads. Distribution of work should not depend on personal lifestyle choices. You want to have kids? Great! That comes out of your free time. Naturally, nobody plans on such extensive shutdowns. All of a sudden schools are closed and daycares are closed. The solution is not to dump extra work on people who happen/decided not to have children with the excuse \"Oh, but you have more time.\" Yes, they have more time, but that's *their* time to do with as *they* please. There is no obligation - legal, social, moral, or otherwise - for them to use what is otherwise their free time to do more work, to allow parents to have more free time.\n\n> It may be the case that some additional work is given in certain situations to those who are childless ... I think the unfairness rankles people\n\nYes, I think that's exactly what rankles people. And *I think that they're right to be rankled*. I certainly would be! Going back to what you wrote before:\n\n> Society has a shared responsibility to facilitate child raising ... I don't understand why people are hostile to this concept.\n\nI, on the other hand, cannot understand how someone can suggest that childless folks should be picking up extra work for parents, just because [children].

As you said to didn't understand how people would oppose the concept, that's what I was trying to portray (hopefully without being an asshole about it!): That others have different values.\n\n> It's more than a lifestyle choice. Raising children is one of the fundamental purposes of life and society. If it's not for you, that's fine.\n\nSee, I'd describe it differently. I think humans are a bit beyond animalistic instincts, and so I would absolutely consider it a lifestyle choice.\n\nI have no grudge against children or parents, I just see no intrinsic value in having or raising children. So from my perspective, I'd rephrase the last sentence as \"If that's something you *want to do*, that's fine.\" But as I don't ask others to sacrifice for my desire to, say, play ice hockey in my free time (or walk my dogs, etc), don't expect others to sacrifice for your desire to raise children. This being a general \"your\", not you specifically. \n\nI'm guessing you think that's a silly comparison, as you (I think) place an intrinsically higher value on raising children than other personal interests. My point is that others have different value sets which do not place having children on a higher tier than other interests.\n\n> It does not imply this. It implies that allowances for raising children occasionally require small sacrifices from the childless. \n\nBut why? Why should someone else's desire to raise children mean that *I* need to pick up *their* slack? That's a `Does not compute` for me. If employers want to be flexible for parents, that's great, and I support that 100%. Just not at the unwilling expense of non-parents. If the parent employees get a break, then management needs to find some other solution. Have the boss who approves/gives the flexibility take on extra work? Sure. Extend deadlines for parents? Absolutely. Two places I've worked have had pools for people to donate vacation hours for those in need. But to dump extra work on colleagues who for whatever reason don't have kids, and not pay them for the extra effort? Nope, not on board.\n\n> You are the one assuming that some judgment of worth is being passed\n\nI'm not saying it's an explicit or conscious thing. But if parents are preferentially given a lighter workload, the unspoken - and likely even unthought - implication is that a childless person's time is less valuable. It's an unconscious bias, but it has effects nonetheless. There is no reason that I should do 45 hours of work to your 35, just because you decided to have children and I did not.\n\n> I think this is a little self-centered to be honest.\n\nThat's because of your bias stemming from your values. You're hired to do approximately 40 hours of work per week. I'm hired to do approximately 40 hours of work per week. I choose to play hockey, read books, and do woodworking in my free time, you choose to have kids. Then epidemic hits and ... suddenly you're only expected to do 35 hours and I'm expected to do 45 hours to cover you. How is it self-centered to want to pursue my own hobbies on my own time, rather than work extra to give you more time for your pursuits? From my perspective, your statement is exactly backwards: I think it's self-centered to expect (or force!) childless people to pick up the slack of parents.\n\nEdit: Downvoter care to explain? I thought plumEater and I were having a good discussion here.\n\nEdit2: I guess not? Apparently \"Different views and values\" are bad, eh? Props on being an open-minded academic. ;)",

This is the very problem with academia; aside from the racism and classism that inherently characterizes it, \"colleagues\" are very much ableist and openly discriminate against those who are ill.  Just knock it off.  No one believes you, no one is convinced that you show solidarity with anyone who's different from you.",

Yes, your colleagues are struggling with balancing their workload with a sudden increase in the amount of time they have to supervise, stimulate, and teach their children.

You deserve this to come up at your review.

I\u2019ve already had people try to do it. But having a small child is no doubt a lot of work. If it makes you feel better your colleagues are getting more sleep thanks to you. As of now I get my work done once my baby is in bed, he naps 1-2 hours in the day, that 1-2 hours of productivity. To record my lessons I have to wait for him to go to bed which means it\u2019s not uncommon for me to stay up until 11pm-1am I\u2019ve stayed up longer than that. I\u2019m not telling you this makes it ok for you to work extra, but you had children as you said, so you know how hard it is. But you\u2019re not wrong to be upset either, It\u2019s strange that your admins would do that, it is completely unfair as well. Work should be equal regardless of your home situation.

Life just doesn't really work that way.\n\nP.s.s when/if you have kids and are in a situation like this how would you like your peers to treat you?",

This is a pandemic which sent kids home from school leaving parents with an entirely new schedule and set of responsibilities that reasonably they never could have anticipated. In my area daycares can only accept kids from essential workers (so not academia). You also cannot hire a nanny unless they are live-in or your child has medical care they provide. Entirely responsible faculty who have always allocated 8 am - 4 pm (and then some) to their jobs, students, and colleagues are being put into an unprecedented position of having all their childcare completely taken away from them.\n\n\nTo me this is similar to how we would hope colleagues would pull together to help out a colleague in times of high stress - sickness, home destroyed, family member death, and yes, birth or adoption of a new child. Generally those of us who are more liberal agree that it is good for companies to be understanding of how employee performance can be negatively impacted during these times and help them out. Unfortunately this current situation is affecting such a large portion of the population that all of us without kids, without sick relatives, are going to be asked to step up for those who cant step up right now. I posted here already that I think OP is right to be stressed and their colleagues should be extremely thankful for them stepping up. But I\u2019m having a really hard time seeing how anything that is happening is indicative of the rampant homophobia you just equated it to.",

It's very likely that you're in a department where workloads are neither fair nor equitable, and where non-parents are given more work because \"they have more time.\" It's not fair, and it happens all the time, and yes, be annoyed about it now and angry about it when it continues past the current emergency.  \n\nIt's also possible that your department at least tries to be fair, but in ways you and your colleagues might not see. I try to be a good chair and make sure everyone has the best possible workload. Some semesters, like this one, I give some faculty heavier workloads, because stuff has to get done. Then I try to balance that out in a future semester, maybe with a course release, or a plum schedule. Sometimes I can scrounge up some extra pay, even. \n\nIt does not all balance out, but even if it did, you'd probably not know. I have given someone a lighter committee load because she's dealing with a student issue that has resulted in near-daily meetings and calls with the Title IX office. I can't tell anyone else that's what she's spending her time on. I've given a new parent a lighter service load and more online classes this term, which everyone can see, but they probably don't know or don't remember that over the past three years, she has taught several weeks' worth of classes for her colleagues when they've been in the hospital, or had a death in the family. \n\nAgain, it never balances out. You can ask for consideration, though. As someone else posted, keep a record, and take it to your chair or dean later and say, \"hey, I put in a lot of extra work during this emergency, and I helped my colleagues/department/students when they needed it.
