  "text": "I have been suffering from serious counter-productivity for a month now. Loneliness during pandemic has really messed up my mental health. I\u2019m tired of being the person who wants to do a lot but stuck in a body of a person who needs to feel better. \n\nAfter being in isolation without any human contact for 3 months, I have finally decided to focus on feeling better by flying home. Upon returning home, I will not see my family until I completed my mandatory 2-week quarantine, but being home is all I need for now. \n\nI actually feel embarrassed that I failed the endurance test, but if I\u2019m gonna stay in isolation talking to the wall and being unproductive, it\u2019s a sign that I\u2019ve reached my threshold. I decided to do this after getting advices from family, friends and fellow AskAcademia community. \n\nI wanna say thank you to all of you for making me feel less alone and giving me the strength to make this decision. I always thought that I\u2019m useless and unworthy, but I feel a lot better after hearing your stories. I hope I will bounce back from this setback and become stronger. \n\nIf you ever experience the same thing, do whatever you need to stay sane. \n\nStay safe everyone. \n\nLove,\n\nConstantAide",

I wish I could be a super productive super human during this time but there is no shame in prioritizing your personal needs over your work/research needs. This is a lesson I\u2019m trying to learn!",

      "text": "I made the choice (although under some pressure too) to fly the 17,500km home to be with family... the alternative would have been total isolation in my tiny dorm room, with microwaveable food and only 1 hour of exercise allowed a day. I don't consider myself a hugely social person, but having zero human (or even animal) contact for even a few weeks was tough. The UK simply is not a good place to be in isolation or under a lockdown because there are no backyards and no large parks around, so you really are trapped inside.\n\nYou're going to feel a million times better when you're home with your family! It does take time to recover from that stress though, and you'll go through a real roller-coaster of emotion for a few weeks, so don't worry if you're not productive for a while. I arrived home in mid March and am only really back into the swing of things as of a couple of days ago. \n\nAlso, depending on what country you're flying to, you're possibly flying into a much less restrictive community and being able to go shopping or eat at a restaurant normally can do wonders. Knowing that you have protection as a *citizen* is also something a lot of locals forget about - it's terrifying seeing the UK nationals get so much support, knowing you've been effectively left for dead and have no one to turn to. It's another level of isolation that's unique to internationals. So don't compare yourself to what UK citizens are doing!",

          "text": "I\u2019m in the UK too and I agree with you. I used to live under your condition last year and I never felt so depressed. However, living in isolation without any human or animal contact no matter how comfortable your living condition is tough. I\u2019ve moved to a studio for a few months then bam! This pandemic happens.\n\nI\u2019ve been observing the lockdown rules religiously. I\u2019ve been following up the situation in both the UK and my home country and I can\u2019t help not to compare as the handling and adherence to the rules are better in mine. I only go out for fresh food but seeing most people not wearing a mask, I feel even more paranoid. \n\nI was so paranoid that I didn\u2019t even go out to exercise until a few days ago after getting advice from my loved ones and people on here. It felt nice, but I didn\u2019t feel safe. Most people are really being so casual about this pandemic despite being one of the worst-hit countries with one of the most deaths. \n\nI would be tested as soon as soon as I reach the immigration point and sent to the quarantine centre. If, God forbid I had the virus, I\u2019d be taken to the hospital immediately. I will not see my family until end of June or July depending on my test result, but knowing that I\u2019d be in good hands puts my mind to ease.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to be home where things are under control now. The economy has reopened since a couple of weeks ago but people are still observing the rules. Shops that weren\u2019t following the SOP were ordered to close. It\u2019s nice to know that the country is up and running again without compromising people\u2019s safety. \n\nI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re starting to be on the roll again after prioritising your mental health. Thank you for being so kind. Keep staying safe and God bless. \ud83d\udc95",

      "text": "Good to hear.  I hope you talked with the school about taking a formal leave and freezing your progress and all that as many schools have systems in place for this situation.  Getting help and finishing school do not have to be mutually exclusive.  \n\nBut even if you cannot freeze your progress, nothing else matters as much as you ultimately.  You can always do a new program later, but you only get one shot at being you so you should always prioritize taking care of yourself.  I mean what use in the end is a degree if you are miserable?  And if you are happy, you may find you really do not need that degree to do what you enjoy anyway.\n\nI am sure you will be fine.  You saw your limit and did the most important thing you needed too, sought help.  Too few do not do either of these and the stories that follow them do not have happy endings.  Whenever you think you failed, remember, it could have easily went the other way with you staying but losing your life or ruining it in the process.  The only way not to fail at your point was to see that what you were doing was not working, was not healthy and to make a change.  Which is exactly what you did.\n\nBest wishes moving forward.",

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I want, but all I need now is to be home to regain my sanity. I\u2019m giving myself until the end of this week to see if I can produce a work that\u2019s worth showing or else, I will email them next week to discuss my options. I\u2019m scared but I will do it.\n\nThe statement that having a PhD isn\u2019t a life and death situation resonates powerfully with me after experiencing this pandemic in total isolation. It was difficult for me to come to terms with that but this past few months has been been life-changing. I have a lot of worries especially regarding my funded programme, but I no longer feel as scared. \n\nThings will be of course be challenging if I decided not to pursue this further. Nobody said it\u2019s gonna be easy but there\u2019s always a rainbow after the storm. I just need to survive this storm to see my rainbow. Now that I\u2019m starting to see some clarity, I will continue to pursue this path and pray that things will turn out for the better eventually. Fingers crossed.\n\nThank you for your time to write such a kind message. I really appreciate it. \n\nStay safe. \ud83d\udc95",
