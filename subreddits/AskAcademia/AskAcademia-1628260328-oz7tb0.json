  "title:": "What are things you can do to up your chances to get a Sociology doctorate position?",
  "text": "So,  um. I have dreams of doing research within the field of sociology. I'm  reading a university prep program right now that teaches skills in  writing and understanding academic and scientific writing and similar related skills.\n\nAfter that I'm  going to get a Bachelors in Sociology and then continue to get a masters  after. Then I am hoping a doctorate position has opened up at my uni and that I might apply for. But... I have things working against me.\n\nAfter  high school I was sick for many years, suffering from depression. I'll  be 34-35 when I finish my master's (and that is if I don't take a year or so to work before getting my master's). I feel my age and lack of any  work experience will make me look bad. Why wouldn't they just pick a  younger applicant? I'm planning on making my master thesis relevant to the doctorate program I want to get into but is there anything else I  could do to up my chances?\n\nI'm in Sweden, if that is relevant to my question.\n\nThank you for reading my post.",

      "text": "Let me begin my response by noting that I am not entirely sure what you are asking when you say \"doctorate position.\" I will presume this means a position as a U researcher who has a doctorate, or an adjunct or tenure track professor. I'll admit that I've noticed, especially on reddit, that students in a PhD program refer to themselves as being in doctorate positions, The latter is easier, as it merely means admission to a doctoral program from which one may or may not graduate with a PhD. The latter is much, much harder.\r  \n\r  \nIt appears you soon will be starting your baccalaureate program, for which I offer both congratulations and kudos. In some ways this is where your age may seem the greatest obstacle, or at least differential; even today, with oceans of older students going back to school, it still means that you will feel you are a minority in your classes, and the other students may treat you differently. My U only has 2880 students over 30 in its undergrad program (out of 52K students). Plus, for some reason, the older students (for some reason) have never formed an association, student organization, or even social network.\r  \n\r  \nYou want to earn an MA and then possibly/probably a PhD.\r  \n\r  \nFor starters I'd recommend that you think about looking at PhD programs that admit applicants with a BA, i.e., not requiring an MA first. In most of these, the MA is the consolation prize for those who flunk out of the PhD program (not all, but most). Second, you don't note what school (and there appears to be just one) you refer to. For this, I'll add that where I've taught we are very reluctant to accept our own undergrads into our doctoral programs, and we never hire our own PhD's as professors. Two reasons. First, hiring your own is seen as a sign of a greatly inferiors program. It signals to other schools that your PhD's cannot compete worldwide for positions. I am unusual in this respect in that if you are OK with that, then fine. You have a good chance at a job at the school from which you graduated, and these days, in our tight job market, that is nothing to laugh at.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason for this is that many/most of our undergraduate programs are taught by the same professors who teach our MA/MS.PhD programs, Nost of our faculty feel that while our graduate programs add some more advanced training they don't offer the diversity of views and approaches and even specializations that can be obtained should students go elsewhere for graduate school. The same applies to our faculty hires. If me and Joe trained you in our PhD program you'd have a hard time convincing the search committee that you offer a lot of new things that are different from what me and Joe already offer.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, depending upon what you want to do, we have hired a lot of our PhD's as undergraduate advisors (as they know our program and faculty really well), associate deans, tech advisors, and educational/teaching/testing staff. (At my U's they've tended to make as much as regular faculty \\[which is far less than named professors, etc.\\].\r  \n\r  \nSorry this may seem discouraging. My first suggestion is to take it a step at a time. In your Ba program you may find that Sociology is not all you thought it would be and that you prefer something like political sociology or political science or history, or psychology. Think more about the future (MA/PhD/professorships) in the third or fourth year of your BA/BS. It may or may not change, but the logistics won't be much different. Some but not all STEM fields will want an MA/MS for application to a PhD program. In Engineering, Physics, Biology, Genetics, and many others such as my (Big-10) departments tend not to.\r  \n\r  \nPlus, and I meant to say this earlier, your age will feel a greater obstacle in your undergrad years than your graduate school years. The age difference will be greater in your undergrad classes even if your school has a largish continent of \"non-traditional\" students. The doctoral programs I've run have had students as young as 16 and 18 (OK, both were exceptional \"genius\" students from Russia who got their PhD's so quickly they couldn't legally celebrate with alcohol in the USA). We've admitted six or seven second career doctors and lawyers who in their late 30's or early forties decided that they hated what life as a doctor or lawyer was like and decided to change careers. You'll also get to know your faculty much, much better and many will tell you that they went to college or grad with some delay.\r  \n\r  \nOn the extreme end, several we had a 75 year old enter as a History major (UCLA) and then a PhD program at UI. She was a holocaust survivor, extremely smart, and contributed a ton to both her undergrad and grad programs. She got a job as a (TT) professor but died in her third year. So, never too young, never too old. Just be promising as a student and scholar.\r  \n\r  \nSociology, Political Science, Psychology, Economics, and a bunch of other undergraduate programs tend to attract a ton of major but only a smallish number of serious students. Perhaps not for Soc 101, but for more advanced classes, make sure you come to class well prepared and having thought about the readings. Talk in class or after class with your professors. The best questions I ever get are along the lines of \"today's reading says X, but three weeks ago you had us read Y with seems to conflict/expand/etc. on today's reading,\" or \"this article and that article seem to offer different insights on the same thing,\" etc.\r  \n\r  \nLast, but not least, you say you are in a U prep program for writing and understanding academic research, writing, and publication. That is great. But, let me also add that once admitted your U probably will have something that does the same thing (ours is the \"Research and Writing Lab) but focused on helping new (or I suppose also old) professors and students write papers that graduate schools and journals will regard more highly. You sound like the kind of person who might avail yourself of this kind of center/program, but I thought I'd add suggest them and encourage you to use them, as well as any other resources that your U and department may offer towards developing research skills, writing and technical reading skills, or publication skills.\r  \n\r  \nApologies for going on and on and on. Don't worry about your age. When my schools hire we worry about what you will publish and what (and how well) you may teach. We'd much rather have a really good 45 year old than a weak 25 year old. As a search committee, a department, or a (grad) college we don't worry if a professor will be around long enough to earn full retirement benefits, that is your decision. We worry about whether you will do a good, preferably great job while you are here. Young or old, professors leave for better opportunities all the time. As a department it doesn't matter if someone retires in 20 years or departs for Harvard. Either way they are gone. In this way the academic institutions (in the USA, France, UK) where I've worked all have been quite different than business and industry with regards to a persons' age. A good scholar and a good teacher is a good scholar or good teacher and we're happy to have them. Worry more about becoming a good researcher, writer, and teacher than about your age.\r  \n\r  \nTL/DR, don't let age deter your education; don't lock in too early; take advantage of your U's resources.",

              "text": "Thanks for clarifying, and apologies. Yes, this certainly is true, and not just in Sweden but through much of Europe as well. I somehow just assumed OP was applying in the USA where a lot of doctoral programs admit after the BA/BS... and I said this even though I spent over a decade teaching in France and the UK where what you say also applies. My comment is not really applicable in its entirety should OP be talking about Japan, China, Europe, Sweden, Norway, Russia, or several other locales. \n\nThanks again.",

      "text": "My wife has a psychology degree. Be warned: sociology/psychology fascinates ALOT of young people. That said, they are VERY very common degrees. In USA, atleast, they are nearly useless. If you want to go in that field, you have to go well into grad schooling to ever be able to make a decent living. Theres thousands of peeps out there with a 4yr stuck at 30k. Your best bet is to look for \"degree preferred\" and branch into another field. Unless for sure, you have the sheer determination to concentrate on school for the next 10yrs or so.",
