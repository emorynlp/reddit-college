But that's not feasible for many people. To stay motivated enough to actually work 9-5 every single day on a project like a PhD is very difficult. There are no set daily goals, the work itself is super challenging and is a full 3-4 years (in the UK at least) of the same thing which you get completely sick of long before you're done, which makes people procrastinate more, requiring them to catch up and work longer in the evening. And people just function on different schedules, some people prefer to start working at 6am whereas others tend to work most efficiently in the evening. And yeah, it can be a sprint for some people and it actually was for the majority of PhD students I know. There's no one right way to do things, so don't judge others for not sticking to a perfect 9-5 schedule.\n\nAlso, OP was asking for gift ideas, not writing advice.",

Of course you need sleep, but that doesn't mean 9-5 works best for everyone.\n\nBut even so, have you met a single PhD student who wasn't exhausted by the end?

People shouldn't accept it as a norm that your life gets put on hold at the end of the PhD, or that you need painkillers.
