  "title:": "Doubt about ethics regarding interviews in political sciences research",
  "text": "1. When collecting data for a research project, if you don\u2019t plan to quote a person in the paper, is it unethical to have an informal conversation on a given academic topic without telling that person that the information *might* help you in a research paper?\n\n1.1 Pushing it a bit further, is it ok if you *indirectly cite* what the person says, but keep her as an anonymous source (in a way that nobody, not even her, would know you\u2019re referring to her)?\n\n2. If an audio recording is used *exclusively* to help *you* make notes, is it a MAJOR ethics violation to record the audio of an interview without telling the interviewee?\n\nTo give a bit more context, in China, for obvious reasons, it's very difficult to get interviews with key stakeholders (former officials, SOE employees, etc.). In order not to scare off potential interviewees, a professor suggested that I should try to get informal meetings to discuss the general topic of interest, that is, talk to them as a researcher, but not say that it was an interview for a specific research project (especially because I was working on a controversial case). It sounded reasonable to me. I got some interviews and, in keeping with this approach, I didn\u2019t have a notebook to take notes, instead, I used my phone to record the conversation *exclusively* for me to make notes later. I understand the latter is definitely wrong, but I thought it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n\nAnyways, when discussing my paper, I mentioned this approach to another professor (also Chinese, as the one who advised me) and he found it highly unethical. He said that interviewees should always clearly give their consent for an interview that might be used in any way as a source of information for a research paper. Especially concerning the audio recording, under no condition should I record someone without their consent. This part about the recording, I get it. And I probably shouldn't have shared with him that I did that... but again, is it that big of a deal if it is for my use only? It's a victimless \"crime\".\n\nI didn\u2019t deceive anyone\u2026 I had clearly academic conversations on the general topic of my research, which included some more specific questions that gave me somewhat useful information. For the most part, the interviews gave me context to better interpret the official documents I had obtained, as well as helped me see which issues I should explore further. I most certainly won\u2019t cite any interviewee by name, but I was considering the possibility of citing some of them as anonymous sources for some additional information that isn\u2019t even key for my main research question, since anonymous interviews alone obviously cannot support strong findings/arguments.\n\nAnyways, maybe I was wrong and should abide by higher ethical standards when doing interviews. Should I have interviewees sign a form? Isn't it kind of implied that you're talking to this person to help your academic work?\n\nOr perhaps my mistake was discussing this strategy with a third professor, maybe this is one of those things that many people do, but you\u2019re not supposed to discuss it with others.\n\nAny thoughts?",

Are you in social sciences? What's your approach to conducting interviews? In every academic discussion you say that the information might guide you in a research project? Do you always get a consent form signed? Or have the ethics board approve your interviews?",

Being ethical isn't a nice to have, it's a framework by which we can balance harms against benefits. You can't just decide to exempt yourself from behaving ethically because you believe your science is too important. There is no justification for breaching ethics to boost scientific knowledge. If the law/regulation isn't right, you get it changed you don't just decide you're too important for it to apply.",

      "text": "Based on what you've said I would consider it to be unethical. Consulting with an expert in an area to inform writing a paper is one thing, but that doesn't sound like what this is. For example, I might write something in a paper that mentions the laws about something, and check with a lawyer that my interpretation was correct.  It muddies the waters a bit to say that these \"informal conversations\" \"might help a research paper\", but ultimately it sounds like they are research participants and the principle of informed consent should apply. \n\nRecording people without their knowledge is particularly problematic, as audio recordings are potentially identifiable information, which comes with it's own issues about privacy that are normally reviewed by an ethics board.\n\n>I didn\u2019t deceive anyone\u2026 \n\nI don't think that's true. If you're recording them without their knowledge and consent, and using their data for purposes that weren't made clear to them, that's deception.  I mean, you say yourself that you do these things because being explicit about them might scare them off. When deception is used in research studies, a common principle is that if the participant would be angry or upset at finding out that they had been deceived, then the deception is probably inappropriate.",

      "text": "It\u2019s unethical. \n\nRegarding the recording\u2014no matter what you promise there\u2019s always the guarantee someone else gets ahold of it, even unintentionally, and it could cause problems for the interviewee. That\u2019s why they should know they\u2019re being recorded so that 1) you can explain the process for keeping, using, then destroying the recording and 2) they can consent (or not) knowing what the process is but also knowing there\u2019s always a chance someone else does hear the recording. But if they don\u2019t know a recording is happening at all they can\u2019t decline.\n\nEven interviewing someone when you know you intend to use the info is a problem. Like if you\u2019re writing a paper on X topic and interview them just to flesh out the paper\u2019s framework but then use other data to actually make your point that\u2019s fine. But if the interview info IS the data and helps you make your point then that\u2019s wrong to use it without their consent. \n\nFor example, in my field I talk to police a lot. Let\u2019s say I had an idea about a paper on how police interact differently with juveniles. I might informally talk to some cops to see what they think and see what they\u2019d expect to happen, and maybe that helps me to form my hypotheses. But then I\u2019d use other data to actually test that hypothesis. That\u2019s legit. On the other hand, if I talked to them and then used that info as interview data without formally telling them they were being interviewed and giving them a chance to decline that\u2019s unethical. They may have said different things had they known\u2014and although we hate that idea (we don\u2019t want them to change their response because they know they\u2019re being interviewed), it\u2019s still the right thing to do.\n\nYou can say you\u2019ll anonymize it, but you never know if you\u2019ve completely done so. Sometimes someone says something in a unique way and someone else who has heard them say that before would know it\u2019s them. The risk is low and I get that, but there\u2019s still a risk and it\u2019s unethical to subject someone to even the slightest risk without their consent and full knowledge of how the info will be used.\n\nTalk to someone about ideas to help you plan a broader paper that you\u2019ll then either do formal interviews (with consent) for or use other data? Cool and fine. Use that info as the data? Not cool.",
