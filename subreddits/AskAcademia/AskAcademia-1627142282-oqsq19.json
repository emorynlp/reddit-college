Now I know\u2026 it\u2019s if you don\u2019t get tenure you\u2019re literally done for. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude31",

              "text": "In most places in the US it is an \"up or out\" system and you do not get a \"second go.\"\n\nHere's how my institution words it: you cannot be in a TT position for more than 7 years without having been approved for tenure by the P&T committee. You can apply for tenure before your 7 years are up, and if you are rejected, you can still stay if you have more time on your \"clock.\" In my institution you can then apply again the next year assuming you went up early. Some people have done this here, but it almost always means that people get rejected if they go up early, because there are no consequences to rejecting someone and one can always wish for \"more\" in a candidate. (I did not go up early because I saw this was the clear pattern \u2014 I didn't want them to play games with my file. I did get tenure last spring, hooray.)\n\nIf you go up in your 7th year, you will get notice by the early spring semester that you got it or didn't. If you didn't get it, you finish up the semester but you will not be back in the fall as TT faculty. There is nothing that prevents them from hiring you as NTT faculty (e.g. a short-term contract), but if you are out of TT time, you can't ever work as TT faculty there ever again.\n\nI tell undergrads about the \"up or out\" nature of it and their eyes get big... I think it's important for them to understand how academia works (and why their TT professors look so stressed).",

Similar to a PhD defense, you usually don't get to the point where you'd be going up for tenure unless you are expected to be successful. There are clear guidelines you get when you are deciding to accept a job on what the tenure criteria are in your department. You have yearly reviews and a bigger mid-tenure review to let you know if you are on track and areas to improve to get you on track. \n\nPeople make academia out to be some horrible beast, but the job security in a tenure track position is quite incredible compared to industry. You don't have the tenure process but it is very easy to lose a job in industry!",

First, we hire very carefully, second the mid-tenure review (3rd year) is critically important, third if somebody isn't doing well at that review, we basically give them another year to start doing REALLY well or they are released at the end of their fourth year. In my 36 years at our college there were 2 people that I know (campus-wide) who didn't get tenure when they came up. That statistic, of course, never impressed the TT faculty on their way up. It's always very stressful until you get the letter congratulating you on earning tenure.",
