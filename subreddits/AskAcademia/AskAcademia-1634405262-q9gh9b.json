  "text": "I am starting my EE/CE master's soon at a top university with a lot of research opportunities in almost all subfields. I feel lost because I do not have a preference for any of the research topics offered by my department. So, how can I avoid such confusion and what can I do to help me decide my path?",

But I will say that if you aren\u2019t at least somewhat excited about your research it might be a painful experience. Either way, good luck!",

      "text": "Take advantage of your university library and read about current research in your field. Find what you find exciting, interesting, or whatever, and see if anyone at your Uni is doing something similar or relevant. And, if your program allows for it, try working with a variety of groups. There's really no better way to find what you like than trying things out, but sometimes it isn't feasible to join all sorts of different groups temporarily.",
