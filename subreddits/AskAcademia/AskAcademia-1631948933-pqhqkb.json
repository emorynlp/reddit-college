  "title:": "PSA: Academic Twitter",
  "text": "In another thread I mentioned academic Twitter and someone asked me to explain it. The response ran long so I thought it would be worth posting:\n\nA huge number of professors and grad students use Twitter as public-facing academic profile rather than a more casual social media account. They talk about their research, opportunities, their progress through graduate programs, and keep in contact with labs and collaborators all over the world. Their bios usually focus on their professional life rather than their personal life (typically their program, career stage, and their research interest).\n\nGetting involved isn't too hard. First step is to make a (new) Twitter account of course, lol, with minimal personal stuff of anything you wouldn't want colleagues and advisors to see. Keep all that separate.\n\nAnd of course the second bug step is finding who to follow. When I started looking, I was able to get a good start by brute-forcing my way through the presenter list from a recent conference. For each presenter that was remotely close to my research interest, I'd throw their name into Twitter search and see if they have an account. Sometimes it's an individual account, sometimes there's an account for the lab as a whole. And of course you could do the same by using Google scholar topic searches and checking out the author's from recent publications.\n\nOnce you get over like 30 or so follows, Twitter's algorithm gets pretty good at showing you other people worth following. The bios for these accounts will make the choice to follow or not to follow super easy. I stopped when I got around 200 follows. About 80 followed me back!\n\nThen just spend a little bit each day or a couple times a week checking out your feed like a quick little work chore. Retweet job opportunities, congratulate other people's progress, ask research and career questions where you can squeeze them in, etc. It makes networking a lot more streamlined.\n\nHope that helps!",

I started out only following profs/postdocs/grad students who post professional stuff (papers, conferences, etc) but once you follow people who also post opinions (university COVID policies, national politics etc) Twitter will start recommending you similar content. I let it get out of hand and now my feed is basically Facebook. Sounds like you were more judicious about who to follow to begin with, which is a good idea.",

It helps you jump on things earlier than others and keeps the super controversial stuff from being the only thing you see.",

TL;DR: keep away from toxicity!\n\nAlways switch to \"latest tweets\" (the timeline is generated by what or who you follow) instead of \"top tweets\" (the timeline is generated by twitter's mysterious algorithm). If the twitter account is for purely academic purposes seeing a full timeline of tweets by academic bots (for example, arXiv bots with topics you are interested in, though you may never click the link) is 100 times better than seeing ten tweets of a clueless debate. I think one thing need to keep in mind is, using twitter does not make one an activist or politician or a politician, it's who we are that determine our twitter profile. I think many people not knowing this is why twitter's reputation is keep being ruined. One cannot be immune to politics but making it one's everyday life is not a good idea in general. **If I become edgy as f and want to argue with whoever doesn't agree with me, or keep posting political compass memes, I think I need to take a long or permanent break from twitter.**\n\nOn who to follow, I think I don't tend to follow those with whatever flag emojis in their username or bio, if I don't know the person already; or those with a lot of standpoints in their bio, as if they were some professional politician. Whatever flag or opinion they put in their username or bio is not of my concern, but yeah, I don't think it is a good idea, and I think the reason is already explained.",

Support and acceptance can mean a lot and the discussion over these topics quickly get toxic. There are left and right PhD's and people view thing form all types of different lenses. A Marxist history prof and an econ prof will not get along\n\n> I think that's a much more appropriate public-facing rhetoric than one of silence\n\nthis isn't about rhetoric. This is about getting a job in the future. Being silent is a good way to not have the stupidest thing you ever said be the first result on a google search. Employers rate this against you no matter how correct you are. Keep politics to a separate account \n\n> but recruitment and retention of underprivileged and minority students is a huge obstacle\n\nYour post is about growing your career through twitter. You're not doing it to help minorities and neither is anyone else lets be real here",

Twitter won't think so and neither will future employers. Nowhere did I specify any positions. This has nothing to do with diversity or LGBT stuff. \n\n> But if you HAVE TO shoehorn every opinion into one side of the aisle or the other, I think we all know where \"support, inclusion, and diversity are good things\" lands.

I specifically crafted my original statement to be as politically neutral as possible. I never said stay of twitter. I said be carful with getting overly political",

The point isn't to gain as many followers as possible, but to keep up with and stay in contact with potential collaborators. As others have pointed out, it's more like LinkedIn than Twitter when used this way.\n\n>again no where did I talk about inclusion/diversity/LGBT rights. \n\nYou didn't have to. I spend enough time with academic Twitter to know that this is really the only \"controversial\" topic that comes up repeatedly. But if you're in agreement that this stuff is safe and more extreme positions are not, then, sure, I guess we agree.",
