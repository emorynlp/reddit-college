  "text": "I'm currently in an M.Ed. program where we take a capstone course during our final semester. It includes a portfolio of our work and a final \"scholarly paper.\" The examples I've seen from other graduates are between 20-30 pages. But this is a non-thesis program. So what's the difference? I finish spring 2020 and I'm wondering if I should put this final paper on my resume/cv and how I would word it?",

      "text": "The difference is that it's just a paper. 20-30 page papers were standard for my upper year undergrad courses. A dissertation is longer, for one, and there's also an expectation of some level of original research - you can't just go over a claim that's been made before, even if you're putting a bit of a spin on it. It would also be formatted differently and usually organized into chapters.",

      "text": "At our university, what you are describing sounds like the front end of a thesis (the introduction and literature review). Then, there is a data and methods section, a results section where you describe your findings, and a discussion/conclusion section. I tell my students that a thesis in our department range between 35-50 pages, on average. So, it sounds like your paper may be a synthesis of existing published work, whereas a thesis is a generation of new research. You could ask your professor about putting it on your resume, but I suspect the goal is for you to really do an in-depth study into a topic so you gain further expertise. Pick something relevant to your career path because future employers may be interested in what you got out of your master\u2019s degree, and this would be one more thing to highlight. This information is probably university-specific, so it may or may not be relevant in your situation (there is such variety in non-thesis requirements). Congrats on being close to graduation!",

It normally involves a committee that approves/guides the process and culminates in a thesis defense with a simple pass/fail.\n\nThe scholarly paper just sounds like a class paper with certain guidelines. I wouldn't put basic coursework on my vita, but would keep it as a potential writing sample for future applications.",

          "text": "This is entirely different in my field and where I studied. I studied history in Europe. We had to start writing papers based upon original research starting from our first year. The requirements just gradually became more strict and the quality was expected to be higher the further you progressed through your education. While at first you had to do a limited amount of research on actual sources and could mostly based yourself upon secodary literature, the amount of source-based research you were required to do would gradually increase.\n\nHowever, the requirements for your final product weren't all that many pages. We used to do it like that, but they decided that writing a concise piece of literature based upon a very extensive body of research is also a very important skill for academics to have. So they'd limit every paper to between 10 and 40 pages orso, much like you'd end up with when writing an article for an academic magazine.\n\nThat doesn't mean you end up with less work though. The entire master year was focused on writing your thesis. You still had to do the research and show it through your writing. It's very easy to pick out those who didn't do the work. I actually struggled to put my research into 40 pages, but it was ultimately better for it. I still had over a hundred pages of my cryptically written notes and piles upon piles of secondary literature or sources.\n\nYour doctorate is a bit different. You can mostly do whatever you want, depending on the department, as long as it's academically sound. However, you'd ideally also want it to be ready to be published. So many of those pursuing their doctorate also take this same approach. Honestly, maybe my bachelors thesis, but certainly my masters thesis were ready for publication - which can happen. \n\nThis was sort of the requirement and the education aimed to produce scholars.",

The research paper is about proving the central thesis statement and concerned with gathering evidence and data to prove the same, exploring other possibilities and nullifying them and providing a speculation on future alternatives for the central thesis question. To be precise, the research paper is all about explicating and proving the thesis.\n* The thesis usually is formed through extensive original thinking that puts forth a proposal or statement, but the research paper requires tenacious resilience on part of the researcher to justify the central question. The latter is a long process in which there is gathering of evidence, raising and nullification of various other possibilities and the application of theories and evidence to the central research question. All this is done towards proving the thesis. The research paper might be called an expansion and extension of the central thesis.\n* The word thesis is sometimes used in place of research paper, but this is a rhetorical error in which a part is substituted for a whole.
