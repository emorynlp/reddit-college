  "text": "I\u2019m having issues with a professor who refuses to teach adequately. The professor dismisses any questions the students ask during class and just tells them to go to her office hours, once you go to her office hours she dismisses you again because she\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d. also she outed students with accommodations to the whole class. Besides that, she keeps telling us how she\u2019s extremely credible and smart and super smart. And also let\u2019s us know that if we want to report her we have to report her to the Dean, which in this case she\u2019s the Dean so she will be ignoring our request.\nWhat can I do to report this behavior, I am not the only one having issues.",

In this case, we can try and set up a \"neutral\" meeting between the aggrieved parties (I would not recommend this) or we can go on behalf of the student to pertinent superior of the dean (usually a provost and this would be the way to go). However, in this case it is going to come down to an opinion about behavior being within the realm of appropriate and they are going to look this as students as being less able to judge that. So, they are going to need a LOT more evidence than this to get action. Sorry.",

Administrators typically have a home department or discipline and the chair would oversee teaching within that discipline.  If that does not go anywhere, then you go to the Dean.  Also, while every school is different, usually procedures are set up where someone does not review their own stuff, so I would not be surprised if complaints or appeals for her classes went through someone else (though maybe not). \n\nSecond, I want to point out what is a legitimate complaint.  If the person is just a bad teacher or gives poor feedback, that is something you put on the teaching evaluation.  Same for things like boasting in class.  Adding those kinds of personality traits to your complaint will cause it to not being taken seriously.  I will also add that women tend to be more criticized about personality traits than men, so I would do a little self-reflecting in how you are evaluating this prof.\n\nThe two things that you have mentioned that are concrete is that she outed someone with an accommodation (of course, that assumes she did not have permission to do this from the student), and the abuse of her position in telling you cannot file a complaint or appeal your grade because of her position.  These should be taken seriously by someone.",
