  "text": "\nI'm affiliated with two universities, one British and one American. Both mandate students to email from their university email accounts. Some students don't. When I emailed them to ask why, one student replied\n\n>Sorry for the inconvenience. I prefer to use my personal, rather than university, email account because of personal issues.\n\nI have no interest or plan in emailing back to ferret out what this student's \"personal issues\" are. I'm just asking this at large and out of curiosity. What rightful reasons could prevent a student from using a university email, but not a @gmail.com? Thank you.",

      "text": "It might just be a convenience thing. It's easier to have one address where you get all your messages than multiple inboxes that you need to check each day. Plus, depending on the school, their student account might expire after they graduate, and they don't want to lose their old messages/ contacts. \n\nAt least in the US, though, I don't think it's really the student's choice. My understanding is that, due to FERPA regulations, you can only communicate with students about academic topics through their school email. If I get an email from a personal account, I don't even acknowledge that the person they're claiming to be is in my course (I believe that alone is a FERPA violation). Hypothetically, if a student had a stalker, abusive partner, or abusive relative, they could email you from a non-school email address pretending to be the student in order to get confidential details. So I just send out a boilerplate response that I only reply to students on school email addresses. It's also a great excuse on the rare occasions when I've had helicopter parents reach out to me about their kid's performance. Sorry, can't even acknowledge the student is in my course unless they sign a FERPA waiver. \n\nFun fact, FERPA came into being after one of the guys from Symbionese Liberation Army got Patty Hearst's address from the Berkeley directory, facilitating her kidnapping.",

But there are reasons for most rules, and it's important to explain that when there's a good reason.\n\nIt's a matter of security, explain that to the student.",

I know my university has means to change that for students in such a situation and if that is available to OP's students then they should use it but I recognise these things are far from universal.\n\nThe other valid point would be to do with IP, but I doubt an undergrad emailing about assignments has those concerns. I disagree with your point that uni email security inherently sucks; this will be dependent on your university's email provider.\n\n> Just wanna add that, corporate world suck, there's lots of abuse in there, so if your bar for moral / benevolent treatment of your students and coworkers is based on that of the corporate world's, just review that idea mate.\n\nThere are a great many reasons why in a corporate setting one would be required to use corporate email, e.g. security, so I don't think expecting people to do so is unreasonable. And it is hardly the source of all abuse in the corporate world, nor would allowing employees to use personal email end workplace abuse.\n\nI did advise OP to mention accommodations to the student, in case there is a genuine reason why they can't use their uni email. I also acknowledged that there could be reasons I hadn't thought of why the student might not want to use it. \n\n> It's hurtful, it's built to be hurtful and subordinating.\n\nOh please. If you'd read other people's replies here as well you'd see that at least in the US there is a legal need to use official emails, and there are sound and logical reasons for that law to be in place (confidentiality, security, avoiding fraud and impersonation). Requiring use of official emails also makes sure students are checking their emails and getting the info from the uni that they need.",

That sounds wildly melodramatic and honestly makes no sense. It is just a consistent means of communication that is ultimately more secure in terms of senders/recipients, and if students make sure to use it then they can't miss important notifications. Trust me, I've taught plenty of students who have pulled an \"oh, you tried to contact me? I don't check my uni email\" which is ridiculous.\n\nPlus on the matter of abuse if staff and students are only communicating via official channels then that minimises the opportunities for inappropriate behaviour without leaving a paper trail, which ultimately could protect students.",

They say nothing about using those to contact their profs. \n\nI've seen profs who crate a sign up sheet at the beginning of the semester and ask for a preferred email address. This works fine for a class of less than 30. Personally I tell students to only contact me using the LMS messages tool because it keeps all class communication in one place. For department purposes I tell students that I only email students at their student email, but they are free to forward their emails and respond back with whatever email they prefer.\n\nAt the end of the day campus emails expire once a learner graduates or when they become inactive in some way. They are at best temporary and if a student wants to keep records of their emails it's a pain for them to use a university email. So long as they can log into the LMS and the library, and their emails are forwarded, I don't care what they use.",

Felt terrible after I found out, all they needed a was a YouTube video to show how to set things up.",

      "text": "Security and privacy in some universities' email systems suck. I wouldn't send anything but the safest, most generic of messages thru any uni's email, unless there's strictly no other possibility. (Edit: I'd expect academics to not struggle with this but, not all universities are the same, so if your university's email is nice and safe, good for you, some of us don't have that luxury.)\n\nAlso, email software sucks, and it's pretty hard to use them with multiple accounts. Webmail of uni emails suck particularly (I really don't want to see another Roundcube or that Oracle monstrosity again).\n\nYounger people do not really use email for much these days, nor companies really (which have \"advanced\" on to Slacks and Discords and Teams and stuff), so a single email for the occasional emailing is useful, and if you use one account, it's easier to search, if you don't have a~~n over-engineered~~ sophisticated email setup, and especially as of late students are [really low on spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory).",

              "text": "First of all, I am not equating anything. Spoon theory is used outside communities of people with disabilities, neurodiverse communities, etc, too, e.g. mainly among oppressed minorities. Students definitely face oppression and power imbalance, and a lot of students go thru serious mh issues all throughout their academic experience, so the use here is appropriate imo. And even if I'm misusing the term, the fact that students are precarious and stressed and have limited patience and attention remains.\n\nSecondly, I'm giving companies migrating to slack et al as a reason for why people might be unfamiliar with how to use multiple email adresses or use email appropriately. Your reading there is hostile, as in that comment I refer to \"corporate world\" generally, i.e. excercise of power in corporate context, not merely \"email in the corporate world\".\n\nWon't reply to you further or to your other comment, as you apparently look for winning a conflict over minutiae rather than an understanding of the potential reasons why a student might behave like described in the OP.",

                  "text": "Okay, either you are vastly overestimating the difficulty of managing two email accounts (you don't even have to sync them, you could just check them separately. Don't even need to check them frequently, sign into your uni email once a day), or you're massively underestimating students. These young adults have had to demonstrate a certain level of intelligence and competence to get into university, and will need to employ those same traits to succeed at university. And handling a second email account really shouldn't be a stretch.\n\n> the fact that students are precarious and stressed and have limited patience and attention remains.\n\nBold of you to state that as a \"fact\", or to think that email is one of the main stressors. While stress is no doubt in strong supply given the state of the world, to say they have \"limited patience\" and that that justifies not checking their uni email every day or so is an abdication of standards that aren't even that high to begin with.\n\nI'm not doubting that there are some students that have mental health issues during their studies. Or that some will be from oppressed minorities. But to act as though all students are under some form of oppression, further exacerbated by *using a particular email account* is ridiculous.\n\nHonestly I saw your other comment before I read this one, and you came across as really patronising which rankled me somewhat, so perhaps I'm a little more ornery than I usually would be. But I'm not trying to win a conflict over minutiae. I just think you are wrong. You're acting like managing email is some greatly punishing ordeal that we must protect them from. If someone had talked about students that way back when I was an undergraduate I'd have found it deeply insulting.\n\nIt is probably right that we stop replying to one another at this point because (what I perceive to be) your condescension in your comments here and towards students in general makes it difficult to maintain a civil tone.",
