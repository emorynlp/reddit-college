  "title:": "Is it ever okay to exclude a co-supervisor from a PhD thesis acknowledgments?",
  "text": "I\u2019m submitting my PhD in a few weeks (hooray!) but having an ethical dilemma. In my university, it is common to have a primary supervisor and a co-supervisor where the primary supervisor has never supervised a PhD student.  My main supervisor, whom I\u2019ll call Bob, has been wonderful. Although junior and with little supervisory experience, he has met with me once a week every week of my PhD. He has been nothing but supportive and even his criticisms are still said in a way that make me feel good about myself. He is everything I could want in a supervisor and I am so grateful for his help, advice, and mentorship.\n\nMy secondary supervisor, whom we\u2019ll call Marie, has been disengaged from my work from day 1.  She is the textbook definition of narcissist. She will only come to me when she needs something from me, like to give a lecture or grade papers. Marie also believes she is above admin work and has caused serious negative consequences to me over the course of my PhD from not approving forms on time (despite many many many emails from me and Bob). This has resulted in me not getting paid multiple months in a row, multiple times. I also was de-registered as a student at one point because she chose not to transfer scholarship funds to pay my tuition in time. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the issues that we have had, and she has refused to  apologize for any of these issues\u2014even when the head of school got involved. She has never asked to meet with me over the 4 years of my research (always me asking for meetings), and she has never read a single word of my thesis. This doesn\u2019t seem to concern her even though her name will be attached to my work.\n\nVery recently, Bob had a serious emergency for a few weeks and was unable to read my first full thesis draft that I had sent to them. Long story short, I emailed Marie many times asking for her to read my draft and give me feedback because SOMEONE needed to read it before I submit. She ignored all of this and yet again refused to engage. However, she had previously asked me to give a lecture yesterday, which I did, and we overlapped in a private zoom group. Heated words were exchanged because I (calmly) told her I was disappointed that she was neglecting her duty as a supervisor to read my thesis, and she didn\u2019t like being held accountable for her actions. She then said some very unkind words to me and hung up.\n\nThankfully, Bob just sent me loads of feedback and I\u2019m feeling a lot better about my work. However, it\u2019s nearing time for me to write my acknowledgments. I personally feel that I have nothing to thank her for. She did not read any of my work, she didn\u2019t engage with me, she didn\u2019t supervise or mentor me, and she completely neglected me as a PhD student. Is it wrong if I exclude her from my acknowledgments? Or can I say \u201cthank you to my supervisors Bob and Marie. Bob thank you so much for blah blah...\u201d and leave it at that? I know the chances of anyone reading my thesis are slim but I\u2019m honestly already upset at the fact that I even have to put her name on the first page. She added nothing to my work, so I don\u2019t see why I need to include her. Or is there another way I can phrase this where I\u2019m still being polite but also can make my point that I think she\u2019s useless?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. The common theme seemed to be to suck it up and thank her for whatever she DID do. So I spent this morning writing the acknowledgments and this is what I settled on. I wrote a glowing thank you to Bob in the first paragraph. In the next paragraph, I thanked Marie for her her role on my doctoral panel in conjunction with the other member, Nancy. I thanked Nancy and Marie for providing the opportunity to start this phd (my first project is based on Nancy's dataset, and Marie connected me with that). And I thanked Marie for providing me the opportunity to teach, which I actually am really grateful for because I love to teach. I didn't thank Marie for any supervision or feedback, because she provided me none. I had two friends read it and they both said that it was professional and to an outsider they'd have no idea that I had beef with Marie (one friend said \"it's way too nice tbh\"). They said that only **I** would know (and maybe Marie, if she picks up on it) that I'm snubbing her a bit. \n\nThanks for everyone's advice, I really appreciate it. What changed my mind was a commenter who said Marie may be on a panel or committee that is deciding funding opportunities down the line and could influence a decision to not fund or hire me. Tbh, at this point the damage is probably done, but at least I've ended on a slightly higher moral ground than I originally wanted to haha.  And it's unlikely anyway--I've accepted a job in industry for the foreseeable future and Marie is in her late 60s and will hopefully retire soon. Thanks again everyone!",

I searched long and hard and surprisingly came up with a genuine acknowledgment of things he did that I benefited from. If there's any chance at all that you can do this--and you may have to go really far back--I'd recommend it. \n\nIn academia, knowing how to be diplomatic despite your displeasure/boredom/rage is a core skill. I'd look at this as an opportunity to hone that. What could be more challenging for you, right now, at this stage? It will be great to cut your teeth on. Good luck!",

The consequences of anything you actually do, however, may not.*\n\nYou *do not* need to spite Marie to show your appreciation for Bob and spiting her gets you essentially nothing positive. She clearly knows you don't like her and good on you for speaking to her directly (seriously, that was brave)!\n\nPeople can be really good at reading between the lines to work out *what* you are saying without being able to work out *why*. They don't know Marie and so could very easily interpret *you* for being a \"jerk\" (i.e. unprofessional) for demonstrating such clear bias towards one supervisor in your acknowledgements.\n\nUnfortunately, for each person that reads your thesis and understands your situation, there will be someone who reads it and just sees an unprofessional jab at Marie.",

There are SO many details I left out but  suffice to say that this is a pattern of behaviour, abuse, and bullying towards anyone in my building who is of lower status than her.  I'm not planning on staying in academia for the next few years at the very least (I have a job lined up in industry), and Marie is a year or two away from retiring I'd say. Plus I have good relationships with nearly every other professor in this field at my university.  So I'm not concerned about how this could negatively impact my professional career.  I had a meeting with one of the Deans of the school recently to get advice and she was the one who suggested I file a formal student complaint, but wait until I've passed my defense so that I'm protected. \n\nBut I agree. Why is it down to me to have to file a complaint (that will likely go nowhere)? Why are the other professors staying quiet? I have heard every single one of them bash her and her behaviour. But everyone stays quiet. One of my other PhD friends joked \"what dirt does she have over the head of school? What sort of blackmail is she conducting where everyone is so afraid of her?\"",

Sometimes this does happen, off the record and behind closed office doors. Or do you mean that faculty should hold their colleagues accountable, leveraging their job security to call out bad behavior? This doesn\u2019t happen because they are, at the end of the day, colleagues.

Students and postdocs have their housing, years of work, their entire careers, and (for international students) residency at stake. We've seen the same power dynamic at play in places like Hollywood, where young actresses are afraid to speak out against powerful people in the industry.\n\nBut tenured professors have connections within their field, solid research records, and guaranteed six-figure incomes. Of course, they should leverage that kind of power to protect those susceptible to abuse. I don't mean this as an ad hominem, but standing aside while young academics are bullied and retaliated against just to avoid another professor's angry looks in department meetings shows a lack of moral courage.\n\nOur universities should be places of egalitarianism, fairness, and intellectual curiosity. None of that is possible if predators are allowed to operate freely. Those people don't go from 0 to 60 right away. They learn what they can get away with and escalate their behavior accordingly. If more professors and administrators call out toxic behavior, we can start to change the culture to live up to our ideals.",

Do you want to be  researcher after this? Would you cite Marie's work in the future? Do you have similar works? Can she screw up your life somehow, even with Bob 100% backing you up against her claims?\n\nFirst, I would question you as to why you still have her as a coadvisor, why Marie gets credit for your work without help? Is it mandatory for you to get the title that you must have a coadvisor? Unless this is a contractual obligation, to my eyes this is a stupid tradition that god knows why exists, and it pissed me off reading about you suffering on Marie's hands and still \"thanking\" said hand.\n\nSeriously, I would refuse to thank her on your thesis. Just submit it like that, she wont read it anyway. On the case she might question you, if the people evaluating your thesis question this, you can say that you \"forgot\" - and then simply \"forget to edit\" this part of the final thesis. After all, Marie forgot about you during 4+ years, why do you have to remember her now, when you're about to cut strings.\n\nPlease do not buy into the \"acad\u00eamics have fragile egos and short memories\" talk. Yes, this is true, and more than enough reason that bullies/toxic people like her should be put into their place. \n\nDuring my MSc I was with an advisor that was beyond toxic, simply horrible human being. Everybody walked on eggshells, everybody hated each other and were constantly scared. I lasted exactly 30 days, fresh out of undegrad on a new city on a different state. I cannot describe enough how bad I felt, and how he made me feel like a cockroach (he used to call us that by the way). Do not be the ones who simply stayed there and thanked him every time he treated them like shit. I decided to leave, and after that the humilliation he put me through just clkcked something in me that I only felt rage, so I did absolutely everything in my hands to throw him and his reputation - after all, like he said, I had nothing to lose. And I succeed. Everyone from the 1st year undegrad to the dean's office, to the ones funding his research, received a full account of each and every abuse, including e-mails and audio files. This was in 2016, he is still avoided like the plague and nobody wants to work with/for him, despite his stellar research before entering our university. I regret absolutely nothing.\n\nBest wishes to you OP, regardless of what you decide to do. I just hope you have a nice thesis presentation, and quickly cut as many ties with Marie as possible.",

So compensation, and the fact that I do love teaching, was why I agreed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you want to be researcher after this? Would you cite Marie's work in the future? Do you have similar works? Can she screw up your life somehow, even with Bob 100% backing you up against her claims?\n\nNo, No, No, and No. It's hard to explain without getting into details, but Marie is in my \"field\" but her work is on a much wider subject than mine.  Like pretend that her field is in \"biology\" but her work is specifically on anatomy of species. In this fake example, my field would also be in the broader field of \"biology\" but my work focuses on cell biology. She is familiar with my topic because they do overlap somewhat, but I would struggle to think of a time when I would need to cite her work for my own work. And she cannot screw up my life. Ive accepted a job in industry and do not need her for a reference. If I ever do come back to academia, she will be long gone (she's at retirement age right now--I'd say she'll stay for only a few more years). \n\nSorry to hear about your experience with an academic during your Msc. I can relate to a lot of those feelings. I'm glad you stood up for yourself.  Part of me wants to just keep my head down and finish my thesis quietly and make my exit, but I just don't think it's fair to other students and other academics that she's allowed to treat people like this. Everyone in the building is too scared to speak up about this abuse, despite us all being on the receiving end of it at one time or another. I want to prevent any student ever having to deal with this again.",

See, this fear of standing up to ourselves against bullies is one of our gravest mistakes in academia, because after all we, students, are the weak link by a big margin, and professors have nothing to lose because who cares about PhD students?\n\nYou answered No to everything I asked, so you are in the Perfect position to give her the middle finger by not thanking her in your thesis. Even if she demands it from you, you can choose to ignore it, after all she has no power on your future (never forget this) because you already have a job secured. There is life beyond academia and you are moving towards it. You have spent far too many years looking to the floor and grumbling a \"thank you m'am\" after she shat on your head. \n\nYou deserve better, OP, seriously. I hope you stand up to her (its not easy, at all) as a \"gift\" to the you in the future. It's been 5 years since I standed up to my previous shitty advisor, and while I'm totally over him and everyone else on that god forsaken lab, I look back with pride at myself, because I took auction and fought back, instead of lying in complacency. Sometimes I use that to motivate myself, \"you have been in worse waters math_chem, remember that, you can do this and you will succeed\"",

He regularly screwed up my forms, did not meet deadlines, did not respond to emails, skipped one on one meeting he scheduled with me. I had to track him down during his classes it was hell. Little did I know the asshat was going to skip my defense because he doubled booked for my defense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was required by the university to attend my defense but he did not bother. The date was agreed upon by him, my advisor, and the university.  Thankfully I recorded my defense (prior to covid in 2018) and sent him the video which he asked for.  He did not watch the video till the last day of the defense approval deadline of the semester. I asked my advisor and the department to help since the day of my defense, but this asshat did not respond. Asshat proceeds to email me on the deadline day to do a presentation to him personally. I went and did with a smile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am presently doing my PhD at the same university with my advisor, but I got rid of asshat from my committee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh btw Congratulations you freaking did it !!

In my university this has happened to a colleague, and his advisor was forced to sign, by both the dean's office and the head of our institute, else she'd be in deep trouble with pretty much the entire administration (the advisor in question refused to sign due to personal reasons, despite the entire commitee aproving the thesis)",

I will be leaving academia after this and will be filing a formal complaint as soon as I pass my defense. I genuinely believe that no one should have to ever work with her again. \n\nThe other thing is that she is close to retiring, and she has MANY more enemies than friends in my field. I\u2019ve quadruple checked with Bob and an academic much higher status in the school to see if there is anything I need from her going forward, and they\u2019ve assured me I don\u2019t (she doesn\u2019t even have to sign off on my thesis). So I\u2019m not worried about any potential backlash or hurt to my career from her. \n\nAll this to say that I agree with your point in most cases, but in this case Marie is an abuser and this cycle needs to end. I\u2019ve only talked about a few of my experiences but she is a truly nasty woman who is vicious in her words and actions, to pretty much anyone she views as below her. I\u2019ve heard many many stories and witnessed it happen to many of my coworkers. People staying quiet just gives her further confidence that she can continue to bully people and get away with it.",

It sounds like your program distinguishes between primary and secondary supervisors anyways so even if your relationship wasn't wonderful with Bob and toxic with Marie, giving Bob the lion share of the credit and relegating Marie to the list of other people who read part of your thesis at some point wouldn't be that odd.",

I learned about some stuff my marie did for me much much later, like her role in phd admission, my scholarship, suggesting me for teaching jobs etc. My marie is chaotic but her vibe totally changed after graduation and she became more like a colleague. Didn't expect it but Marie still checks up on my while Bob is ghosting/busy with his career. Maybe all Bobs become Maries one day, with more experience and fame?",

We had a really good relationship at first because I worked for her for a year at a small business that she manages (which is through the university). I knew she could get nasty and cruel bc I watched it happen but she LOVES people who suck up to her so I figured as long as I stroke her ego, I\u2019m good. And I started my PhD and that\u2019s basically what happened. I was a TA for three of her classes each academic year for three years. We had a good relationship (as in, friendly\u2014she never engaged with me on my work) until she started asking me to do additional work for the small business. I said no, I don\u2019t have time and it\u2019s not my job anymore. That was when things soured. She tried to bully me into doing it and I had to go to Bob and ask that he ask her to stop. And then the missed deadlines started happening, etc etc it all unraveled from there. I sent her email after email over the years of my PhD asking her to meet with Bob and I so I could go over my work, and 9 times out of 10 she wouldn\u2019t show up. I sent her chapters, she didn\u2019t read them. The only meetings she ever showed up to were the yearly meetings I had with my dissertation panel, because these are mandatory for her. Trust me, these past few weeks are not the first time I communicated with her. She\u2019s had no problem using me as a TA each year (It pays well, only reason I do it) but has ignored my pleas to engage with me and my work.\n\nETA: In December I had a meeting with my wider research panel where I (and the chair) explicitly asked Marie if she could commit to reading my thesis and giving feedback because she has more experience than Bob so I want both opinions. She agreed AND she was the one who gave me the deadline to send them the draft by beginning of March. When I sent them my draft, they both agreed to meet 3 weeks later to go over it. For that meeting, Bob was dealing with his issues and Marie canceled and rescheduled the meeting 3 times and then for the final meeting straight up didn\u2019t show, leaving me waiting on zoom for 30 minutes. I called her and texted (she read my text) and no response and never addressed me until I gave the lecture for her.",
