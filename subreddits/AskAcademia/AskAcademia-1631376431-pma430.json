  "title:": "Why do academics never respond to \"strangers\"",
  "text": "I have been a PhD candidate in CS, and specifically in the field of signal processing and computer vision, for about two years now. Every time me and my supervisor hit a wall, when studying on a publication, we would try to communicate with a paper's authors, to provide us with some insight on things that aren't stated properly. \n\nSome days ago, we sent an email to the authors of a specific paper that provided figures but no actuall numbers. We asked for their experimental results (mostly the numbers) and/or any implementations IF available of course. We justified this because we are in the process of publishing and would like to compare and cite said authors. Our thought process would be to make a fair comparrison and not support our claims only on our implementations that follow their guidelines.\n\nThe first author is a PhD student as I understood, with two scientific publications and one of them having some citations. As I see it, another citation should be more than welcome, or at least that's just how I would feel. But two weeks later, there is no response, not even a \"thank you but no thank you\" email.\n\nThis is no news for us. We came across this \"silent treatment\" many times in the span of two years. But I still believed that it was just situational. I don't think that these emails were offensive in any way. I tried to be as reasonable and respectful as possible. So is this what you guys have to face as well or is it just me? Is this a thing?\n\ntl;dr : We never get a response from people that we inquire about their work in academia, even when we intend to compare and cite and clearly state it.",

Most institutions have a policy to remove any e-mail address and personal space of leaving personnel, seemingly as to avoid unauthorized intrusions.\n\nI always find it surprising when I encounter some journals that require an institutional e-mail, because that's the perfect recipe to ensure that the corresponding author will not be reachable in a few years down the road. Academic publications should be made to endure the test of time, that's why we have DOI, citations formats, and other permanent notation standards. But e-mails practices aren't yet up to that quality standard.",

It also means that all the different forms of your name that you foolishly used on different papers (J. E. Smith, John E. Smith, J.

Communications with colleagues and their labs will obviously take precedence. Sometimes it takes all of the time available.\n\nAnother answer though is that, depending on the type of paper, the academic may not have ready access to send you something on the spot. Combining that with the earlier result, you may just get ignored as there isn't enough time for them to track down the requested information for you and send it.\n\nAlso, not every author on a paper is knowledgeable about every portion of the paper. Especially for large experimental groups, an author may not be able to provide the answer you're asking for at all without a chain of emails to colleagues. This of course depends on the papers you're asking about.\n\nFinally, humans are just lazy sometimes.\n\nAll of these together mean that non-negligible requests (something negligible is asking for a PDF of a publication) may not be answered.",

Taking a demanding and entitled tone (whether or not it's justified) is a good way to get no response. Try being friendlier. Mention you're working on something similar, and ask to chat about it, and then make demands on their time after you've got them on the phone. I know you probably feel differently, but strangers owe you nothing, and if you need something from them that takes any amount of time then you'll have to try a different approach. My grandfather always used to say, \"you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.\" If you are getting no responses ever, it's probably partly your approach.

Annoying a stranger is not a good way to get them to do you a professional favor, and that's what you're asking for - a favor. It may be a big favor, depending on their circumstances. If your approach isn't working, you'll either have to change it, or do without the data. Most people like talking about their research, and most people like helping others. I almost never have trouble getting a response from an academic I don't know, but I also treat people like they are human and don't throw a big ask in an intro email. If you aren't getting responses at all, it's probably something you are doing, but if you want to keep thinking it's everyone else who is the problem go right ahead. I just don't see the harm in trying a different approach, especially if a response is that important to your work. I would make the effort for my own work.",

This has a tendency to keep happening day after day until it passes the point where it feels pointless to respond and the email gets archived.

              "text": "So I am personally an open science and replication person myself and do answer these as often as I can, but I have some thoughts here. \n\nFirst, your assumption that all scholars expect to provide their data is wrong. In many fields that is not the expectation at all or norms are only recently changing. That might mean your request is a lot of work even if the data is sitting in front of me, which it probably isn\u2019t. For instance, My crappy looking un annotated code that works well might not be understandable to others. So Even if I have the code sitting in front of me I might have to do a lot of work to make it nice to send to you. Since I don\u2019t know you or what you\u2019re doing with it, I\u2019d assume it would need to look good. If it\u2019s been several years, that code could be on a random computer in a random drawer or god knows where and I have to look at it and figure out what it even means myself again because it\u2019s been so long and I write many papers.\n\nSecond, my relationship with my funders, my coauthors or my IRB might preclude me from sending it to you at all or significantly delay my response. I simply can\u2019t share some of my data because it is sensitive and confidential. Some of my data has to be destroyed after a certain period of time. Sometimes I don\u2019t control the repo and only one author or data custodian does. Etc etc. \n\nThird, I get a tidal wave of emails every day and sometimes lose track of something even though I really am trying. Among these emails are dozens of requests for prospective student meetings, high school student homework\u2019s, data, volunteering and all manner of things. Sometimes I\u2019m stretched so thin that I struggle to balance the students I teach, the students I mentor, and the colleagues I promised things, so stuff slips through the cracks. \n\nFourth, I almost definitely changed emails and institutions so probably didn\u2019t see your request. Worth giving the author a google to find their new place. I\u2019ve run into this problem trying to recruit speakers and whatnot, not just papers. \n\nWhat I would prefer (n=1) when someone asks for my data is to 1) check to see if it\u2019s in my GitHub or hosted by the journal already 2) be nice (or at least not mean) in the request 3) have the request be reasonable (that is, providing data is often reasonable but running new complicated models for you is likely not - and people ask), 4) go ahead and give it a follow up, especially if your original request was at the start of a semester or right during grading period for finals.\n\nEdit to add: so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong at all to ask, and I think people generally should give their data, but also just know there\u2019s things that make it more complicated than just a quick email.",

In other words, you can publish a dataset with an accompanying paper (usually at decent venues) and a DOI. Giving away parts of them may damage a future publication of the whole dataset. In the case of ML approaches used in Computer Vision, selecting data is impossible and you need to send the whole dataset for reproduction. \n\nHaving said that, I am happy to see more and more publication venues requesting the data for validation during peer review and, subsequent, publication alongside the manuscript.",

The only person that ever responded to me, was an Italian professor, which shared his data, gave me his implementations, instructions etc, while  had only asked a simple question. Seemed really friendly and eager to help but came out a bit weird. After a while I found out tha this professor was called out from some other academics in their publications due to the fact that he and his fellow co-authors got blindsighted by some faulty methodology and some \"unexpectedly\" good results which resulted in a chain of publications on their behalf.",

          "text": "Generally I agree and can see how these things can lead to a no response situation. But I'll try to adress each point based on my personal interactions, the ones that lead me to make this post.  \n\n\n(Also sorry for the long response.)  \n\n\n1. During this time period of 2 years, I have tried to contact (corresponding) authors on queries about dataset availability, architectural details (like number of layers, kernel sizes etc, my focus on my phd revolves around neural networks), or questions about the numerical results (some results where not disclosed, but the paper stated that the proposed technique was \"better\" than other state-of-the-art techniques in the litterature without actual comparissons of the two, just with bar graphs and no scale). These queries are what I consider easy to reply to, since if a dataset is not available, then one can take the time and respond, saying \"Hey, we are not ready or we dont want to release the dataset, not yet or ever\" (Actually one lab did respond this to us, when asked, not for my PhD but for a research project I was working on). Or when someone proposes an architecture, such details are important. A convolutional layer's kernel size or the padding that is used, defines the layer's output, so I don't see why someone would omit such information. And for numerical results, well, this is why your paper is published, at least on my field. Because your technique works better or solves faster a specific problem. In my opinion these things should be straightforward, and it's also the reviewer's responsibility to not allow papers be published with missing results, especially when said results concern the main attributes of the proposed technique.  \n\n2.   My personal queries, or as I seemed to understand at that time, didn't really need any followup clarrifications. I undestand that this is kind of subjective and the authors don't always see it that way, or they might think that by responding they might fall into a long email chain pit. But personally I tried being as much reasonable and comprehensive as possible. I tried asking for things that if a random person would ask of me for my personal work, I would take the time to respond, and not consider it a chore (like some people suggested on this thread).  \n\n3. No comment here, most mails I think were sent not on a very bad time, but for the last one I sent, definitely a bad time of the year. I was so absorbed by the upcoming publication that I didn't even consider this as an issue. That's on me!  \n\n4. I've said it before somewhere in the comments. All my mails went through the edits and got the green light from my supervisor, which does this work for 20+ years now and is well respected in the community. So, don't let my bad temper and foul mouth lead you to any wrong conclusions. Also I know that when you ask people for anything, you better be polite about it or else you won't get anything out of them.",

      "text": "In my PhD (molecular biochemistry and biophysics) I came across a paper that I thought could have launched a project on my end: the original authors were cell biologists, whereas I wanted to try a more in vitro biochemistry study from a different angle. I politely asked for a reagent, just a plasmid with DNA encoding the protein that I know they had since it was clearly stated in Methods. \n\nI received a prompt email saying that they would happily send me the physical reagent free of charge. The corresponding author, a pretty famous and mature researcher, was excited that someone had seen and read their publication, and that it spurred new hypotheses and experiments. Sending me the plasmid required someone to go into their archive, get an aliquot, and make a shipping label; not hard, but not nothing, and they didn\u2019t really \u201chave to\u201d do this for me. (There are some NIH guidelines that say you \u201cshould\u201d share reagents for collegiality, but it\u2019s not reported or enforced or anything.)\n\nIn this case, I AM:\n- extending their hypotheses, in a natural way\n- using orthogonal techniques from theirs\n- requesting something I know they have on hand\n- doing the work on my end\n- being nice :)\n\nIn my case, I am NOT:\n- questioning their results\n- asking for some piece of data not originally in the publication \u2014 peer review exists for a reason\n- trying to publish my own competing analysis\n- telling them that my future citation of their paper is part of \u201cthe deal\u201d (this is the grossest part btw\u2014assuming that the citation from you is worth the effort of compiling anything)\n- making an assumption about who the authors are, and their motivations; maybe the first author graduated and doesn\u2019t care about your citation, nor this project anymore \n\nIf you are not receiving replies, there are many reasons why this might be, but only a few options left for you in the end.\n\nSimply state in your publication that the original data/values were not available in the manuscript, so you can\u2019t compare in the precise, perfect way you want to. Nevertheless, if you are a critical thinker and can come up with some \u201creasonable\u201d value, maybe that\u2019s enough. I know many fields are different, but even the fact that you want to be this specific about a comparison suggests that your own results may not stand on their own, as it were. I\u2019d be mortified if my own work relied on the extremely precise comparison with others\u2019 work, down to whatever starting value another group used.",

Sometimes those steps need to be ran on a HPC/cluster and code is specific to that HPC. Sometimes it's non-trivial to setup (yourself, let alone for someone else on a system you have no idea about). Sometimes there's non-public datasets used that someone wanting to replicate would need to obtain permission themselves from a 3rd party as you're not allowed to distribute them. There's tons of reasons why it's non-trivial to help.\n\nHaving said that, I've put in tons of effort helping people who've emailed me politely to understand and replicate the science I've done (rewriting and providing code, making huge datasets available in a simplified format, etc). That effort has often rewarded itself, e.g. it's led to future collaborations, co-authorship on papers, spotting a bug in my own work, etc.\n\nIf you're being constantly ignored, there's something more going on. Either your field is far less collaborative than mine or you're not asking in the right way. Maybe post an example of how and what you're asking?",

And this was to a complete unknown PhD student at a completely different institution with no publications to his name. And of the two academics I emailed, both were/are professors, and both pretty big names in their respective fields too. In fact I think they even replied to me quicker than I have had research advisors from my own institution reply, ha.\n\nIf you are emailing PhD students who are first authors they may have graduated and moved on, and most likely no longer have access to their institutional email address as listed on their publication. I would say try contacting the second author, and waiting a week or two, if that doesn't work then try the third and so on.",

If their data is difficult to package up and share with you, they might balk at the amount of work and/or procrastinate long enough to forget. My husband is a physicist who curates large data sets. He very often shares his data freely, but gets easily frustrated with people who take that for granted (ie no acknowledgements, impatience, etc). As a result, when he asks for data from other people, he most often offers joint authorship as well. Some people turn him down, but as he sees it, having more authors simply increases the possible readership.",

If you're too busy to fully put things together, say so (or send them whatever shit uncommented code you have and let them work it out).\n\nI'm frankly embarrassed by my colleagues' responses here. No wonder replication in science is in such a sorry state.",

I'm in a humanities field, though, and we're less collaborative. A lot of these requests want my time/labor and don't want to give credit for it. At worst, they want to steal my work--people will request copies of an unpublished conference paper, and that's a BIG no. If it were a real request for collaboration, I'd consider it only if there was a personal connection I could use to check on their sincerity. For example, I'd be open to co-authoring something with a friend's former grad student if it made sense (and I have done that, happily).",
