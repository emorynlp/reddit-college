  "title:": "Discussion and help, PhD : How did you guys bring up graduation to your advisor?",
  "text": "I was a bit curious as someone about individual experiences.\n\nAdditionally needed some help on behalf of a senior. We are in quite a good research environment in STEM and my advisor is well known in the field. In our lab it is quite usual for people to graduate in 4-5 years and advisors are quite well funded so they don't mind extending from their side. Overall the advisor is extremely helpful and reasonable. Unfortunately, when it comes to graduation, things become a bit hazy. In general, he expects independent research etc. which is quite reasonable.\n\nIn addition though, as in some cases, he has often provided abstract requirements. My senior has done a lot of work in the last few years and advisor has acknowledged it as well. Overall, however, she is completely burnt out and definitely homesick. She was curious as to some pointers on approaching about possible graduation in such a case.",

Grad students using don\u2019t get paid much and so sometimes PI\u2019s will be inefficient at getting students to graduation because it benefits the professor to keep a more skilled student on longer. I know a couple people who voiced complaints about this to me when I was considering if I wanted to get a grad degree. As far as I can tell it is not malicious most of the time it\u2019s just procrastinating on the professors part. It\u2019s never a full conversation just a \u201cwell I don\u2019t think your quite ready let\u2019s talk later\u201d kinda thing. \n\nAlso assuming that a PI knows graduation requirements is a stretch. I can tell you that my PI does not in fact know them. He can evaluate what needs to go into a dissertation, but anything else such as paperwork requirements or processes, credit requirements all are the responsibility of the grad student.",
