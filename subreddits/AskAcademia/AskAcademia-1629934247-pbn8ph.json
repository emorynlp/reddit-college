              "text": "This is good advice. I know that several Californian universities have [graduate student unions](https://uaw2865.org/about-our-union/) and [Yale does too](https://local33.org/). There are also [United Campus Worker (UCW)](https://www.unitedcampusworkers.org/) chapters across the South (Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky) if you are interested in trying to form a union that recruits all job classes and not just graduate students. Both approaches can get results, but it will help a lot if you get advice and help from an existing union. Despite what duke other posters have said, we as graduate students, whether allied with other job classes or not, have had some incredible victories resulting in higher pay and better working conditions. It is worth it.",

Workers in a right-to-work state can still organize and join a union if they want (and if they can do it without getting conveniently fired), but they cannot force co-workers to join that union if they don't want to. They also might not be able to collectively bargain on behalf of the workforce (which is arguably fair - if you're not in the union, you shouldn't get its benefits), which undercuts the purpose of a union altogether. \n\nBut unions aren't illegal. Think of them like an abortion in Mississippi. If you can make it through all the hoops and get yourself to the one clinic in the state, you can still get the procedure. They've made it as difficult as possible without actually banning it.",

Right-to-work laws just make it harder to get collective bargaining because unions can no longer require people at a workplace to belong to them.
