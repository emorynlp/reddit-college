Not everyone can do sexy research that ends up in Science/Nature/Cell/PNAS. You might end up doing work very fundamental and specialized to your subject, and the pool of people who will appreciate, care, or understand what you do will end up very small, which can be very disenheartening. \n\nPlus, you have to deal with departmental politics, keeping your advisor happy, and seeing people who may not be as hardworking/knowledgeable as you getting sexy publications, recognition, and awards. It's no wonder that academia is soul-draining and that most people completely check out by the end of the PhD. In my case, I was so jaded that I didn't even want to do a postdoc, much to the detriment of my career.",
