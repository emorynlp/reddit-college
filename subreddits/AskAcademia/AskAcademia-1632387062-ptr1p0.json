  "title:": "When under pressure from the industry, how can I protect myself/coauthors?",
  "text": "Our group (western Europe) has submitted a review on a device that generates a lot of money (i.e. multibillion $ industry). Our results speak against the use of said device, with low confidence in the evidence presented.\n\nSince the inception of the study, we have been queried multiple times by a VP of the relevant company through email, asking us to share our data (which we refused). Since submission, the VP is asking for a meeting in person and there are rumors of them not being happy about our results (which are BTW still unpublished). We did not respond. In the meantime, the company also reached to our head of dept. to express that they were worried about our work.\n\nThey are obviously treading very carefully so we can't accuse them of exerting pressure on us. But we are worried about the risk of retaliation on publication (i.e. legal action). Our boss told us not to worry and discouraged us from seeking legal advice. Neither the study nor our group are financially supported. How can we protect ourselves? Are there organisms specializing in / providing (free?) researcher protection?",

Scientists are usually pretty good at this, but be *very* careful with your language. \"Data presented in this paper MAY suggest\", etc. \n\nThey may take action against the university, but I doubt it. I've been through this recently with a multi-billion dollar company, and I actually engaged with the company at every point of the process. This essentially gives the company opportunity in advance of publication to point out potential flaws and criticize the work. At the very least, this allows you to hedge against those weaknesses in your writing.",

The only thing I will say with absolute confidence here is to not spread that the company \"may be targeting you\", while IANAL, that is the most dangerous thing I see here (slandering a company without evidence would be a quick ticket to a defamation suit, and regardless of the quality of the study, would likely call it into question as well).",

Of course if you are provided anything (i.e. funding, resources, speaking gigs, etc.) then you need to disclose that, however discussion with a company does not necessarily create the appearance of a conflict. \n\nWith that said, I am also in a medical discipline (more or less in the oncology space), so I am aware of the implications of working with industry. Having to disclose something though does not make someone untrustworthy - to the contrary, almost every accomplished investigator has disclosures. I agree with the other poster - disclosing the nature of the relationship is key, as well as removing yourself from any situation where potential bias would impact the science (double blinded study designs, independent reviewers of data/images, regulatory oversight etc.). If a study is strongly susceptible to investigator bias, it probably wasn't a very robust design to begin with.",

          "text": "In the medical field, most researchers are unpaid and investing their own free time to publish. Especially reviews, which are high impact and often not supported financially.\nAs for the legal dept yes of course. Except that we'll have to bypass our boss to get internal counseling, which probably won't go too well for us.",

              "text": "What country are you in?\n\nAnything you do that is an actually study has to be sanctioned by ethics boards and even meta-analysis that involved human data are subject to that .\n\nA review is not typically high impact in my country.  Even systematic reviews.\n\nYou can go to your office of research or research ethics and to whomever deals with tech transfer etc.\n\nYou research librarian, who does this kind of shit for a living can at least point you to the relevant internal guidelines and standards for whatever kind of review you are doing.\n\nIn the \"medical field\" most people are paid for their clinical duties, but at teaching hospitals also have to have mentoring , teaching service and scholarly activity, and CME.  You don't get paid every time you go to a CME class but it is part of the deal.\n\nIf you are doing a review, I would be very careful. This not a study.  You should at least find out how to do a proper systematic review.",

However, the corresponding author is widely considered an expert in systematic review and meta analysis who gets to speak at major events in the field. As for myself, it's not my first rodeo either. It is however the first time we have to interact with a company directly about our research.",

We wrote a curt letter saying we were confident our research was legal and wished them the best of luck. They never did anything after that. I think the hope was to bully us rather than actually spend money on a lawsuit.",
