  "text": "Sorry if this is off-topic. I want academic perspectives on this. I'm looking for some podcast to listen to on my way to school. I'm having trouble finding good ones especially in tech, science, and engineering. Most that I come across are tech market news and pop science rather than deep conversations and discussion of concepts. I also enjoy listening to social topics, politics, news and just fun chatter.\n\nAny recommendations are welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for all the suggestions! So many interesting options! ",

      "text": "Seconding This Podcast Will Kill You. Ologies is a nice podcast where a different \"-ologist\" is interviewed every week. Engineering Commons is an old one that I'm going through right now, seems it was discontinued in 2017 but there a large backlog still available. It's a really nice look at the realities of being in engineering. Exponent is fantastic tech podcast but it's more on the biz side of tech than academic. You Are Not So Smart is great for psychology stuff.\n\nFor all those long days in the lab, I prefer history and lit stuff. I'm going through Mike Duncan's podcasts, finally finished History of Rome some time back and got started on Revolutions. That's the foreseeable future sorted lol. BBC's In Our Time is also brilliant, so much variety! And of course there's Cumtown.",

Virology / Microbiology /Parasitism / Evolution / Immunology - my favourite series of podcasts, they were my gateway, and they don't pull the science punches    \n+Planetary Radio - news in planetary science, fairly lay-person but so engaging",

Maybe it's because of how I learned to understand science through lectures, articles and PowerPoint presentations but only having audio really doesn't allow me to fully comprehend the information presented.
