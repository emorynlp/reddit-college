  "text": "Hi, everyone I hope this post doesn't get outside of the academia subreddit. I am currently in search of a Ph.D. in Applied Math. And one aspect of a Ph.D. is that you have to search and teach yourself a lot of things maybe stuff that is outside your degree for example a liberal arts student learns how to code. In undergrad, I got a lot of help from TA, classmates, or school even provide extra classes for students that struggling so during my undergrad if I have trouble I can get to those help without too much self-taught myself the subject. But for Ph.D., your supervisor doesn't always available and classmates don't research the same topic as you so **How can I self-taught myself basically any things I need to learn?**\n\nThank everyone for your answer.",

      "text": "If I were to learn something academically relevant (not how to fix my car, or how to manage some software), I think I may look for lists of required reading in introductory classes in that field, to get at least some quality assurance in there.\n\nIf you just google things on your own, you may end up in some extreme or irrelevant corner of things. There are books about Flat Earth out there...\n\nThat being said, I'm sure I would start out with Wikipedia, Youtube, and similar just to get a feel for the (possible) big picture, (possible) key concepts, and stuff like that.",
