  "text": "I'm studying master & working at the same time. I also have to look after my siblings studies\nOn the 2nd week of the subject I started to get stress from work, home & studies I thought I could handle it on the end of week 3 I thought I couldn't do it I need a break. \nOn Thursday of last week it was the last day to withdraw from subject without academic penalty. However on Friday afternoon I just had break down and my mental health went down & I thought I wouldn't be able to complete the subject. I couldn't keep up my studies (I'm very late) or research with what happening at home\n\nI'm planning to call my advisor and explain if I can withdraw from the subject for these reasons without asking for pity or sympathy \nI want to withdraw without academic penalty if possible I'm fine with not getting refund but I don't want the penalty to affect my GPA",

      "text": "Like you said, you're not looking for pity but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get some sympathy. Grad students are unfortunately notorious for having mental health breakdowns and odds are your advisor has been through something similar. Just remember, there are probably mental health care resources at your school. Utilize them. And don't feel bad for asking to take a break due to personal reasons. There's no reason to suffer in silence any longer.",

      "text": "As an advisor and as someone who felt similarly during his masters, PhD, and quite a few projects in between and after, I'd suggest telling them exactly that. Most advisors are aware of the strains a thesis puts on you (as it did to them) and will understand.  \n\n\nDon't ask for an immediate withdrawal. If your subject isn't time sensitive, ask for a mental health break. Lock away your things, hang your lab coat if you have one, and take a break. Go hiking for a day, away from it all, relax, rethink, refresh.   \n\n\nYou can always get another stab, but your mental health always should come first.",

      "text": "I went through a very similar experience twice during my master\u2019s degree. The professor that chaired our department was able to help the first time. He found me another small scholarship so I wouldn\u2019t be as stressed about working every available second. And he helped me calm down about feeling behind. The second time I went to the professor whose class I was struggling with. I explained calmly that I wasn\u2019t able to make much progress on the paper and felt stuck. He helped me realize that I was on the right track but just needed a break. I turned the paper in a few days late and he still allowed me to earn a B. Just talk to them and ask what they recommend. It always worked out for me.",

If you ever needed help from that person you are more likely to get it.\n\n- They might be willing to help you so that you get some refund.\n\n- On the other hand, if your advisor comes of as a total douche then you know who to avoid next time.",
