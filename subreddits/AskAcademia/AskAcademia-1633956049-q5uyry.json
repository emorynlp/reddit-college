  "title:": "Examples of poorly-written journal articles",
  "text": "I am teaching a scientific writing class to our department's graduate students (STEM). I am looking for examples of poorly written journal articles (or other scientific writing). Of particular interest are papers with: \n\n* Run-on sentences\n* Excessively verbose language\n* Awkward ways of conveying message\n* Rampant grammar issues\n\nTo be clear, the quality of the science makes no difference. In fact, it is even better if you can show me a high-impact paper that is poorly written (or has some very poorly written sentences in it)! I just want examples of writing that is confusing, pretentious, and/or way too long. :)",

If a paper with such egregious grammar mistakes, pretentious and unecessary verbosity can be published through this institute, it can mean that:\n\n1. There was no peer review, and the paper was published as received\n2. There is \"peer review\", which didn't care enough to even signal the lack of writing cohesiveness and grammar soundness.\n\nIf such a horrible \"compromise\" of the peer-review process can happen in this IEEE, what stops dangerous or highly inaccurate studies to be published? What stops potential publishers from fabricating data to push political/dangerous rather than scientifically correct research (e.g. antivaxxx fake info) ? What stops editors from basically rewriting the submissions they want to their own or to the \"author's\" advantage?\n\nHaving a paper like this pass peer review in a journal of this scope is much more dangerous and outrageous than what you may think. What would you think of a medicine journal with an article which instead of saying \"all patients in the trial died\" stated \"the patients in the clynically correct and scientifically sound ceased to have their hearbeats make little sounds which can be heard if you put the metal scientific implement in the man's chest\"?\n\nThis stuff is not only dangerous but also a complete insult to all other researchers busting their asses to get good science published.",

              "text": "Agree, and probably many of your students will be able to achieve a better level of writing because they have been writing in English for some time. I'd suggest looking at other articles in that conference/journal or whatever that is. Since the minimum effort to proofread an article for this thing seems to not exist, perhaps you'll be able to find the examples you need.\n\nHowever, I do believe some errors beyond not knowing English exist in that paper. For example, no decent introduction (usually papers in Economics always have them, even the most terrible bachelor's theses), a terrible explanation of the empirical strategy, no decent presentation of all summary statistics of their regression analysis, among others. Not sure if these apply to actually writing the thing, but something good to have in mind anyway.\n\nI strongly disagree with the idea someone else posted about most articles having terrible writing. While the writing may not be perfectly beautiful, artistic, fancy or even efficient, I feel like most peer-reviewed articles that I've seen can convey ideas effectively to a decently educated reader. The thing that I've felt the most indeed in Economics literature is that the writing seems very, very dry, direct, plain. But maybe this is because I am an avid reader of novels and literary essays. However, I've seen some textbooks have good writing and are fun reading (e.g. Money, Banking & the Financial System, Hubbard). All in all, what I'm trying to get to is that it won't be easy to find the examples you're seeking in published papers, even peer-reviewed or not. I had a professor in a considerably prestigious American university who have us a wonderful writing handout with writing tips which included very funny but ultimately instructive examples of bad writing. He had found these in student's term papers, not in journal articles. I can send it to you through DM if you'd like.",
