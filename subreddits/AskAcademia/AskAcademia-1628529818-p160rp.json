  "text": "This is something I thought I had under control, but when I submitted my proposal to my professor she told me I needed to add page numbers anywhere with stats even if it is paraphrased. Never heard this but cool, so I went back and found them all. \n\nFast forward: submitted to my committee and was told by one of the members it is unnecessary. \n\nAny insight would be great on this!\nAnd I did check Owl and the manual first. There is nothing that says anything about pages numbers with a paraphrase.",
