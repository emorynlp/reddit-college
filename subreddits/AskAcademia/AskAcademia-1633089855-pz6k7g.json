  "title:": "Interdisciplinary PhD (especially in foreign languages/education/linguistics) - Where to start and if it's the right path to take?",
  "text": "TLDR; For those doing interdisciplinary studies, especially involving language/linguistics. What are some things to keep in mind (best programs known, advisors, funding, etc.)?\n\nI have two BAs (language and art). I haven't touched university grounds in 12 years. I love languages and their inner workings and to an extent teaching them (I've been an ESL and ELE teacher for over 10 years, but would love to sharpen these skills further). \n\nI am conflicted at how to begin researching PhD programs. I initially wanted to do an MA in Spanish/Teaching. Some people are telling me to go for a PhD program. I'm deeply interested in Linguistics (finding patterns, cultural ties to language, similarities between other languages, etc.).\n\nHow can I narrow down choices? How can I figure out what the best programs are or best interdisciplinary programs could be or how to combine them? What is the job market for these types of PhDs? What questions should I ask universities that I wish to apply to?\n\nI know very well that any graduate program is no joke and am determine to shed the many tears for it!\n\nThank you for any word of advice!",

      "text": "Seconding what u/namenamename0 and u/DrKittyKevorkian have said, as a recent ling PhD. If you are considering going into a PhD program, you need to have a burning research interest. For a linguistics-related field I'd recommend being extremely prepared for going into industry afterwards, not academia---the linguistics market is pretty terrible right now and I don't see it getting better in 6 years. \n\nIf you do decide you really must get a PhD, you need to have a better idea of the kind of questions you're interested in, and THEN you can find the program you want. Your choice will be guided by the faculty that are available. The three interests you stated are far too broad and unrelated to each other to be much help to you at this point (general linguistic analysis, cultural/anthropological linguistics, historical and/or comparative and/or typological linguistics, respectively). \n\nAs for your other assumed interests, L2 acquisition is a pretty decent field to go in if you want a job, but it's not necessarily the case that you'd need a PhD. Hispanic linguistics is currently a growing field, but you'll still need to have a better idea of your research question before you choose schools, and definitely before you apply.",

      "text": "I am in an interdisciplinary PhD program in social sciences - but has nothing to do with language. The PhD market in humanities and some social sciences is really terrible, meaning it is hard to find a job after this sort of PhD. Interdisciplinary PhDs make it a little bit harder to find a job (this is true in my field, not sure about yours?).  Which has made my life a bit more difficult.\n\nIf you want to be a professor, you need to do a few things:\n\n1- Be geographically flexible during and after your PhD\n\n2- Go to a VERY top school. Like, top 10, top 20 max, for your subject. You can look at USNews or look at professors publishing in top journals and where they are located.\n\n3- Publish well and early (ie: work really hard during the program).\n\nIf you don't want to be a professor, I personally don't think doing a 5+ year PhD is worth it, even when funded. I say this as someone at the end of their PhD! Try to get a funded or otherwise supported MA, they're very expensive to self-fund",

      "text": "In addition to what everyone else says, being in an interdisciplinary PhD program is kind of a catch-22, at least in my experience. Because the work of our students is not grounded in a specific discipline, we end up 'floating' between different schools. Prior to this year, we were a program directly under the Graduate School, and now we are switching to a specific college that will provide more funding and administrative support, which has caused some issues among the faculty and students whose research is less relevant to the new college's discipline. \n\nThis also means that a lot of policies are unclear, and we sometimes end up dealing with MORE bureaucracy than a student in a more focused program would because we have to involve people from different departments.\n\nFinally, there may be philosophical/epistemological differences among faculty/admin that are a headache to deal with and reconcile.",

Never.\n\nBeing interdisciplinary in ling can be difficult. I don't know how it is in other disciplines, but there can be quite a lot of pushback or all-out contempt between applied/theoretical, qualitative/quantitative, variationist/ethnographic, etc. It's like the worst of the stem/arts divide on a micro scale. That's not to say there isn't excellent interdisciplinary work being done (mostly by phds and recent grads), but it can be really easy to feel double the imposter syndrome.\n\nTo reiterate, though, the most important thing is to ***never pay for grad school***.",
