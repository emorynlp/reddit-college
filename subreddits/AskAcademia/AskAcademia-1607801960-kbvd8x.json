  "title:": "Why does the age when starting a PhD seem to be such a big deal?",
  "text": "Here on this sub, and anywhere within academia. Everyone seems bothered by the fact that they started their PhD \"too late\", but these people are like 25+! Meanwhile, I just turned 30 last month and I'm only going to apply for a PhD in the following months (neuropharmacology or neuroscience). Now I get that the late 20s-early 30s are probably the time to kickstart your career, but in my country (the Netherlands) and my field, a PhD study is a fulltime job with a decent salary. \n\nI'm feeling like the gif with Steve Buscemi holding a skateboard saying \"how do you do, fellow kids\".",

      "text": "It does have a lot to do with subjective perception, but I will add this to the conversation.\n\nIn the U.S., it is REALLY difficult to make it in the traditional model of Ph.D. programs when you are an older student, simply because your life has so many more demands and a lot of programs in the U.S. are not structured in a way that makes it easy to manage work and life. This dynamic is changing more and more, but really, our systems are pretty archaic if you go to a school that follows the more \"traditional\" model.\n\nTypically (this will vary depending upon your field), you don't make more than 10-30k a year on a Ph.D. stipend. You have to work long hours and either teach classes or spend a lot of time on research. You are only compensated for 20 hours of work a week, so you can also take classes. However, the reality is most GRA/GTA positions are actually full-time jobs (meaning you work closer to 40+ hours a week) and you do not typically have time for another full-time job on top of this. Some programs explicitly forbid their students from working outside jobs or from working full-time outside of their classwork/research. You get a tuition waiver and/or health insurance, but your benefits are limited and typically you do not accrue PTO, retirement, etc.  I was expected to publish at LEAST 3 first-author papers in my program and funding was very unstable year-to-year. This varies across universities.\n\nAdd kids/family to the mix, and it becomes even more difficult. Again, this dynamic is changing, but there are not typically many benefits offered to students. At some universities, you can hardly take maternity/parental leave. Some schools will give you the bare minimum health insurance. Generally speaking, it makes it mighty hard for someone to take of a family of 3+ on less than 30k a year. Not saying that it's impossible, but it does make it a lot more difficult when you are in an established career, working on a Ph.D., and taking care of a family. Not to mention, healthcare in the U.S. is insanely expensive, even with insurance.",

Absolutely **zero** chance.

Like, programs are 5+ years and largely don't allow you to skip any years of classes even if you have a master's in the field, which is understandable if the department wants to mold a young mind in its image or whatever, but it's not workable for a lot of working professionals who want the PhD to stay in industry. \n\nAlso, the fact that you have to work for the school while getting your PhD can also be a hurdle for older applicants. Like, in my field, it's actually more lucrative to consult on the side instead of teaching, and it's also more beneficial for your career if you don't intend to stay in academia (which many people don't), but the way most departments are set up financially, it's simply not possible to admit a PhD student who won't also get a stipend through TAing. And it's legit a reality that pushes many people to either get the PhD in Europe, where a lot of programs are fine with you defending your diss and that's it, or skipping the PhD entirely.",

Secondly, I think the commenter is talking about life stage, which is fair to proxy with age. Of course some young people have kids and some older people don't, but tautologically, the likelihood that someone has kids increases as their age increases, so it's fair to use age and life stage as synonyms. \n\nBut OC is talking, essentially, about how graduate programs are designed for people who are single, childless, and are able to live for extended periods of time on a small income (so, probably able-bodied, probably not responsible for supporting any family members, probably less concerned about buying a house or saving for retirement). While exceptions exist, this tends to describe older rather than younger people, so imo focusing on how some people in their 20s have kids is missing if not derailing the point of the discussion.",

      "text": "I went to an R1 institution for an MA and PhD in a humanities field, and I never encountered people who were bothered by those who had a late start.  I went straight from undergrad, and I'd say only about half of my cohort were around my age.  A bunch of my colleagues were in their 30s or older.\n\nThat being said, if someone told me that they wanted to get a PhD with the goal of becoming a professor, and then asked my advice, I would be extremely honest about the challenges of that process and the difficulty in finding a job in academics.  If the person was 30+, that would add some extra consideration, because they might be 38-40 by the time they are able to go on the job market, and in some fields it takes 3-5 years of applying before getting a full-time academic job.  I'm all for people of any age pursuing their dreams, but some may regret devoting 12-15 years to a goal they are only able to finally enjoy in the mid-40s.  If after hearing all that the person decided they wanted to go for it, they'd have my support and best wishes.\n\nRegion and field could also definitely play a part.  In the US a PhD fellowship in the humanities would never be considered a decent salary, and the academic job market is bad in general, and abysmal for the humanities.  If the job market is better in the Netherlands, or if you're planning to go into industry, then you might not have anything to worry about.",

If that timeline gets moved 8-10 years forward, that's a tougher situation to be in if you can't find a job.  I would never tell someone not to go for it, but if I'm asked for my advice, I feel it's only right to mention the risks.",

If you start out of undergrad (typical in my field), you can expect to graduate around 26-28, do a postdoc (or two), hopefully get an TT job in the early thirties, start a family, and ride off into the sunset. In fact, even in this \"ideal\" scenario, you're sort of barely making it to childrearing before it becomes biologically difficult.\n\nDoing anything with kids is harder, and this is so for a PhD (or even postdoc), with the stiff competition for TT jobs.

      "text": "Lots of others have said that age doesn\u2019t really matter, which is true. I\u2019ll point out why many people think it does, at least in STEM.\n\nNewton was in his early-mid 20s when he essentially founded modern physics, and hugely invigorated mathematics to boot.\n\nEinstein was 26 when he published his major groundbreaking papers including the photoelectric effect and special relativity, and still only 36 when he published general relativity.\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan was 23 when he officially began his mathematical career, but already his notebooks were filled with incredible work in number theory. Much of it was already known to the wider community, but he didn\u2019t have access to it as he grew up poor in India, and much of it was new anyway. His mentor, G. H. Hardy, lamented after Ramanujan died young that the latter\u2019s genius might have been even greater if he had been noticed sooner.\n\nHawking was in his early 30s when he published about Hawking radiation.\n\nAlso in mathematics, the Fields medal (roughly equivalent in prestige to the Nobel prize) is only awarded to mathematicians under the age of 40. The explicit reason is that the medal is supposed to celebrate work achieved and great work still to come, but this doesn\u2019t stop the community from talking.\n\nThese concrete cases and other, folklorish stories have lead to the very widespread notion that great STEM discoveries are much more likely in younger researchers. Of course this discounts many other breakthroughs that were made by more senior mathematicians and scientists (Weierstrass published his celebrated Weierstrass approximation theorem at age 70; Andrew Wiles was over 40 when he presented his proof of FLT; Euler, while certainly not the typical case, published at an increasing rate until he died at 76).\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that young and old researchers have different strengths that they bring to the table.",

Not that I *can't* do that in my 30s, but in all likelihood I'll get married before I finish my degree and then start a family sometime soon after. I have friends with MBAs who are all doubling or even tripling their salaries after graduation and that would be pretty great, given that I've now spent four extra years on student-level income.\n\nOn the other hand, my colleagues who started the PhD immediately after undergrad seem to be really antsy to graduate because they haven't experienced freedom yet.

So in that sense maybe age is a thing, you wanna finish faster.\n\nI think we also have a tendency to compare life trajectories.

Knowing that my career progress, finding a city to settle in, buying real estate or at least living in a nice apartment...all of that is dependent on me and how much I can show up each week. And I haven't had good mental health the whole time I've been in grad school (figured out I had PTSD about one semester into my masters'). For me, I think it would also be a terrible idea to have kids in grad school, so that also has to wait. \n\nWhen I think about internships I had or when I worked at a national lab and saw their lives, it feels like I didn't have this constant voice in my head saying \"you should be doing more\" that just has really impacted my ability to enjoy life.\n\nI feel like what I want out of life can be enhanced by HAVING a PhD, but it is definitely not being enhanced in the process of getting it.",

However, not every PI is interested in this, as more and more labs become toilet paper factories (high quantity of papers published pa, but citations come only from themselves and \"friendly\" research groups).",

In my experience, motivated older students, even with a smaller knowledge base, always out perform the younger students that have this attitude.\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying the majority of younger students have this attitude. Of course most of them want to be there and of course most of them are exceptional. But motivation seems to be higher in older students and in my experience usually translates into a more productive PhD. YMMV",

I would posit that PhD start times are being pushed back in general in the US. Whereas Master\u2019s degrees haven\u2019t traditionally been required to apply to PhD programs, dynamics are shifting because changing higher ed institutional \u201cbusiness\u201d models and more restrictive institutional budgets (which will undoubtedly be accelerated by Covid-related austerity at many institutions) have the result of driving up admissions standards. Master\u2019s degrees still aren\u2019t *technically* required per US tradition (in contrast to European norms), but the admissions statistics suggest that this is now almost a de facto requirement in many US programs. It has become much harder to get into top programs without already having completed another graduate degree. This trend tends to push PhD starting dates to later ages. I am in a top program at a R1 institution (and am fairly familiar with a number of others) and this appears to be increasingly the case as budgets decline and the numbers of funded PhD positions shrink. Admissions committees want to be more certain that a student can complete the sequence, and faculty on admissions have personally told me that students with Master\u2019s degrees and older students are seen as more likely to accomplish this.",

I know people who've finished their PhD and have TT jobs by 29... I can only speak for myself but I feel a huge sense of shame around waiting. Partially because I always knew I wanted a PhD while in undergrad, and partially because I've done literally nothing of value these past few years. I'm ashamed at how much time I've spent sinking into the blackhole of my crap mental health. Grad school won't fix these things, of course, but I had a lot of things go wrong after making the mistake of leaving school and I became a person I don't respect. Trying to piece my life together while others my age who went straight into academia are coming out and moving into a career is painful. By the time I graduate I'll probably be close to 40 and it's terrifying to think of how little value I'll hold because of my age.",

A PhD salary is anywhere from \"ok but not great\" to downright abysmal.  I think most people have a limit for how late in their life they want to be dealing with the shenanigans of a low salary and long work hours without great benefits or government-supported social security.  Most people (again, US-centric view here) will have worked their way to something much better than a PhD salary by the time they are in late 20's, or at least have a comparable salary/wage job that does not suck so much energy out of them.  There is a very real tradeoff between taking that salary hit at that point in life, vs. making slow but steady income progress elsewhere.  I did my PhD in my early-mid 20's, and I basically just rolled the downsides of my PhD as well within tolerance limits for a typical shitty entry level job.  I put up with things then that I would not put up with now, I think because I've developed a stronger sense of how I will or won't waste my time or apply my energies.  Because I have my PhD hand, I have the leverage to be picky like that, and I did not spend a prolonged period in at the entry level.  Not to say that my PhD was a bad experience, it certainly was not, but it's also not exactly something I want to repeat now that I have it behind me.",

I know that in theoretical physics and pure mathematics, age is a big concern because there is this strong tradition that says you do your best research work around certain ages, and unis don't want to invest in you if your PhD age puts you out of that range once you graduate. Some would say this is just biology. I personally don't believe that. \n\nAnother factor: Unlike us European PhD candidates, the North American PhD candidates (and the British to some extent) are seen as lab slaves. When I hear how my colleagues from these places live during their PhD, I shiver. At this age, I won't survive that. Luckily that is not a factor in most of the EU since we can live a comfortable life with PhD salary. It is also a perception issue, in the U.S. you are treated as a \"student\", whereas here you are basically a research employee. There is stigma attached to still being a student at 30 for some reason. \n\nIn Germany, some PhD vacancies in my field (Computer Science) have an age upper limit for applicants which was very weird to me. I am 29, almost 2 years into my PhD currently in the Netherlands. My younger colleagues do have some advantages for sure, but so do I. They are faster, but I know how to run a marathon at this age.",

I do think, though, that my age and life experience (relative to peers) has been really valuable.  \nBeyond that, it's the fact that I'll be starting a career extremely late, meaning I'll probably be working well past retirement age.

Although of course the advantage is I would have more years of experience than them. And to be honest, my plan all along was to get a few years of experience to have practical examples to apply to research and teaching. So this is exactly where I wan to be.",

Perhaps some think starting at 30 will get in the way of their life plans. I agree that in the Netherlands it's much more considered a job, whereas in the US it seems to be a very different stage of life all together - a longer journey for starters. In the UK, where I did mine, you're viewed as a post-graduate student and with less income than an AIO or OIO in NL. The AIOs I knew when I did my undergraduate in NL seemed more settled than the ones in the UK when I did my PhD there. They might also think they won't connect so much with other PhD students if they are older and that can happen of course  (but that can ahppen for other reasons too)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only time I witnessed it being a 'problem' was when somone in my research consortium was the same age as the consortium leader (both early 40s). The PhD student kept insisting the leader had a problem with their age, while I actually think he found it hard to accept he was the same age but junior (I had problems with the leader because of other things). It seemed he found it hard to accept that his previous experience didn't matter too much when it came to research design",

You also probably have college classmates who started their PhD right away and are already talking about graduation. Through the end of college, age and education status generally correlate perfectly. It can be confusing for that pattern to break down. It starts feeling like you have done nothing, so you complain on Reddit.\n\nBy 30, you've already thought about your age and your education trajectory. If you decided you are too old, you already moved on. If not, you don't need to turn to Reddit to tell you what to do.\n\nEdit: Why am I getting downvoted for this? Seems like a reasonable answer. On the other hand, many of the comments are just personal anecdotes that don't even directly answer the actual question.",
