  "text": "Hi everyone, grad student here. I love my field but I've notived after long 8 hour days I just become useless and feel like I've dropped about 50 IQ points. Does this ever get easier or is this pretty typical for long academic days? Also, what is your favorite method of recovering when you feel like an idiot after using all your cognitive energy on writing or research or teaching all day?",

So yes, totally normal.\nI think at some point in my graduate career I found a balance and was able to get back to doing things like reading and writing for fun at the end of the day. Working out also helped a LOT, as it got rid of all that excess restlessness and kickstarted blood flow and what not to keep me grounded. \nI think time does help; you naturally learn to handle the long days better, but also cutting back and finding that balance was critical for me (and continues to be!). \n\nBest of luck!",

Work days used to be a lot longer, between 10-16 hours a day, 6 days a week around British Industrial Revolution but people passionate about worker rights (or keeping themselves sane and healthy) kept protesting. Employers started to drop down work hours, eventually leading to the 8 hour day, 5 day a week routine. You probably got used to 9-5 so that's why it feels natural now. Sweden and Finland are testing out dropping it down to 6 hours/day:\n\nhttps://www.inc.com/john-brandon/finlands-prime-minister-suggests-a-four-day-work-week-six-hour-days-sign-me-up.html\n\nhttps://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232934\n\nPersonally, I dont think I actually do 8 hours of continuous work even when Im in the lab for 10 hours.

      "text": "Honestly, as a senior full professor at an SLAC I still see multiple 12-14 hour days every month. Most often these are due to the combination of early meetings and some sort of evening event (a talk or performance) so it's not all mind work, but simply being on campus from 7:30-9:30 is wearing because everyone knows everyone and you can't go anywhere without being drawn into social interactions. \n\nOther long days stem from grading...I might be on campus 8-4 but then end up grading papers from 7pm-1am. I'm not a morning person but I have friends who get up at 4-5am and grade for several hours before going to work. In any case, I find teaching more draining than other work. The only thing that winds me up more is giving a public lecture or being on a panel, which most often happen in the evenings. So my problem is more often being too wound up to relax rather than being too tired to think clearly.\n\nI'm beat when I get home but have teenagers to engage with. Usually by the time we've made dinner, done homework, picked up the house, etc. it's 10:00pm. I tend to unwind by listening to audio books in bed-- almost always ones where I've already read the book --which allows me to shut off my mind and be distracted without relying on screens and the dreaded blue light effect. Or if I'm really wound up I'll play guitar in the basement for a while before bed.",

One of the ways I try to combat it (with moderate success) is structuring my days to include a little bit of all kinds of different mental activity - reading things and thinking about them, planning future research/grants/projects, administrative tasks, lecture prep, grading. For me, these each exercise different parts of my mind, which helps me not become exhausted at any one kind of thinking.

I study ancient Egyptian languages and scripts, and my work involves a lot of computer stuff and other mentally taxing activities. To recover at the end of the day I read Egyptian texts (usually Coptic) with a translation nearby. It\u2019s basically just reading without worrying too much about the details, like reading for pleasure. Reading ancient texts is my favorite part of the subject, it\u2019s what I loved doing from the beginning, but it\u2019s also low reward and low effort.\n\nIn your case, try to think of the thing that you love doing the most as it relates to your field. Find a low-effort way to do it when you\u2019re exhausted and have no hope of getting any \u201creal\u201d work done. That will keep you focused and on track while giving you a chance to recover. Plus, even if it is a very low ROI activity, you do still learn something because you do it everyday for a long time.",

Lunch break, coffee break, cat video break, or just taking a walk for 15 minutes in the afternoon. Some people may criticize you for taking breaks, but they are beneficial in the long run because they will help you feel less drained during and after work.\n\nAfter I get home from work, usually I'll have to cook and eat dinner first, which gives me around 90 minutes break from anything that might be mentally challenging. There's nothing more soothing than watching you food sizzle in the pan. My entertainment after that usually consists of watching series, playing a computer game or pursuing my craft hobbies (sewing, lego). Pick up a hobby where you don't need to do a whole lot of thinking. Physical exercise is also good (but I detest exercise, so I don't do it).",

      "text": "Take breaks, exercise and eat. \n\nIf you work for 8 hours straight with only a 30min lunch and a few poop breaks, your brain stops working.\n\nI find the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is the most efficient. Work for 25min, 5min break (get out of your chair and walk around) which is one pomodoro. After around 2h of work (4 pomodoros) have a 30min break.\n\nFor example:\n\n9:00-11:00 you work\n\n11:00-11:30 you have a \"coffee break\" in the cafeteria or in a plaza or in a cafe across the street or whatever or just take a walk\n\n11:30-13:30 you work\n\n13:30-14:30 you have a 60min break for lunch or whatever in the cafeteria or across the street or just take a walk in the park\n\n14:30-16:30 you work\n\n16:30 you call it a day and pack things up and take a shit on company time and whatnot. If you have a busy day you can take a 2h break and go to the gym and have dinner\n\n18:30-20:30 you work\n\n20:30-21:00 you have an evening snack\n\n21:00-23:00 watch TV or play videogames\n\n23:00-07:00 sleep\n\nrinse repeat\n\nI don't recommend working for more than 12-14 pomodoros (6-7h) per day.\n\nDo not skip breaks and get your ass out of the chair and walk around. That's what keeps your mind sharp. Overworking is high interest debt, if you're working 12h days this week, you need to downshift and recover by working 4h days for the next week or even take a couple of days off.",

      "text": "I think everybody has already made excellent suggestions but let me also add in a longshot that applies to myself and some colleagues of mine just in case: Depending on how much you air your office or workplace, you might be subjecting yourself to a higher than normal amount of carbon dioxide (from you and colleagues breathing in a closed environment, nothing woo going on). Several studies show this sort of thing leads to drowsiness, worse decision making and feeling drained. So one step to feel a bit less drained may simply be to open a window occasionally. I don't think this will entirely solve your problems at all but it can help you through the day while feeling less drained.",
