  "text": "I'm in my first year of a PhD in the UK. They delayed my start date from when cases were relatively low to when we were in a full lockdown. AS a result, I haven't been on campus or physically met my supervisor face-to-face for the entire year I've worked under them. \n\nI feel as if I've worked alone and in a vacuum and missed most of what makes a PhD worth doing (socialising, collaboration etc.). The university has promised I won't be working remote for my second year but I haven't heard anything more about that.\n\nAlso, most of my work is simply just email tennis now with very little getting done. \n\nI'm still grateful to have a position that pays comparatively well though.\n\nThe resounding theme is my days aren't very full because I'm working away from the department and have next to no contact with them.",

      "text": "I'm spending a lot more time actually using office hours to meet with students. This is mostly a result of holding office hours virtually, though. Students don't want to get dressed and come to campus for a thirty-minute meeting. They feel more comfortable if they can do it from home, so that they aren't \"on the opposing team's turf.\" Sure, we're here to help students grow and learn, but they infrequently see us as genuine allies until after the course has ended--and, thus, the grading has ended, too. For context: I used to have two or three students (out of one hundred) come to office hours each week. Now I have three or four per day.",

      "text": "Most of my Masters was done in-person. My entire PhD is remote/online.\n\nHonestly, I think that whether someone is productive during this pandemic really depends on a lot of factors. Depends on the nature of your project, your personality, faculty support etc. All of them are linked.\n\nPersonally, I have benefitted greatly from this pandemic. I get to work without the office politics in academia. I also get to stay away from a lot of negativity, that came with doing research in-person. Doing research as a young research is intimidating in large workspaces where you are constantly scrutinized by other more senior researchers. It's not always easy working in-person. I got to do plenty of self-development because many conferences went online and I can attend most of them for free!\n\nOn top of that, many universities also have self-development courses that are free to join for all academicians. I have learnt so much in the past few months of 2021 and I don't think I would have been prompted to do that if I wasn't for the pandemic. Most departments do maintain some sort of online/social network communication group though. If there's none, maybe you should suggest it.",

So we've had to spend so much time accounting for technological issues that would be confounds. That part really sucks.\n\nOn the social side though, my introverted self is really shining. Sure, I miss socializing, but I can deal as long as I have my PC lol. I also have problems with time management, so being able to hop on a meeting in 5 minutes without any real prep time has been great.",

I wrapped up one study in December of 2019 which was good timing, because it gave me a lot of material to publish with for a couple of semesters. I feel like my motivation to work with data and to write has decreased significantly the longer I work from home. In the beginning I was trying to fill in every second of the day I was no longer spending on commuting or socializing, but that just burnt me out and now I'm on the complete other end of the productivity spectrum. I've also realized that in general I am a lot more productive when I can have spontaneous conversations with people around me, and WFH has made that much more of a challenge.",

      "text": "I feel ya OP in that the pandemic has been really hard. I'm actually surprised that the other comments are positive because the pandemic has been a complete drag for most of the people I know.  \n\nI started my PhD in Aug 2020 after finishing my bachelors May 2020. I'm lucky in that I am doing my PhD in the same program that I did my bachelors (well I'm working closely with that program and another) and therefore know a good number of professors, have met my advisor IRL, etc. But it still has been awful for me without seeing people IRL because I actually don't know any other PhD/grad students (the masters students I knew graduated).\n\nCollaboration is definitely worse because I don't have people I can casually reach out to and bounce ideas off of. I also don't have anyone to get a feel for progress from by just talking about life. One thing that helped somewhat was to have a lab slack because it doesn't feel as cluttered as emailing for simple things. I try to stay off zoom/video chat because I'm burnt out on it and I'm a fast typer. \n\nFor my advisors I feel that half of them are burnt out (the ones who have families) and half of them are happy to keep going. It's been nice to work with the ones who have more going on because they've been more understanding/compassionate/relaxed but hard because they don't have time to give me hands on feedback. It's been nice to work with the ones who are hyperfocused on work because I get more feedback but it's been a struggle because they now expect you to be available 24/7. (I seriously got a snotty email from a collaborator because I didn't answer a phone call at 7pm on a Saturday.)",

      "text": "Terrible\n\nBegan during the later part of my 2nd year as a chemistry PhD, 100% of my work is hands-on and absolutely nothing to do online (already finished classes)\n\n6 months basically staring at the ceiling, nothing to do. Got an authorization to attend my lab for exactly 10 days (yay..) and managed to finish work for two different collabs. Then my whole institute closed for more 6 months, and only then I finally managed to be authorized for \"regular\" (very limited) work. During this time I almost got depression, I became a funcional alcoholic and turned into a terrific cook (could become a real chef actually, according to feedback from professional chefs).\n\nNow I'm finally back on lab, I know have two things in mind: 1) finish this PhD, and 2) have a somewhat stable life doing anything that pays well.\n\nI am to a point where I almost \"Don't care\" about science or academia anymore. Why? Well, the government that pays my grant basically said I'm useless and don't do anything, and I might be sued unless I get back to work (mind you that the same government ordered closure of my lab, due to pandemic), during our annual evaluation (12 months of lab being locked down, except for the 10 days said before). You know whats even better? My institute was apparently the ONLY ONE following covid guidelines of locking down, everyone else \"ignored\" it and kept working regurlarly - so Yes, of course I \"did nothing during an entire year\", because I followed the rules, while everyone else ignored them. And now I am in deep troubles because of this comparison to places that ignored covid restrictions, since they kept working while I did quarantine/social distancing\n\nThe moral of the story is a big F* to doing science in my country. Either I immigrate to another country or I'm never bothering with this again, despite the so called \"stellar curriculum\" I have been building for 5 years. Burn all that shit on a fire",

But the uncertainty, isolation, not being able to see my family for many, many months, making a big change from phd to postdoc and moving in the middle of all of it... resulted in some serious mental problems. At this point I don't think that I can catch up.\n\nIn the end all of us junior people go on to compete for the few funding opportunities (fewer of them then pre-pandemics). Those who kept their sanity in this period will get the funding, and the rest of us, well, tough luck. I guess this was true pre-pandemics as well, you can formally take sick time, but the funding bodies do not care about that, and you answer to them every 2-3 years.\n\nOne last thing. If you had it good during the pandemics, I am glad for you. But please do not start your talks/seminars by bragging how much you published thanks to the pandemics. People have died! I have witnessed this actually hapenning... still cannot recover from how out of touch some people are.",
