It happens quite often. Some universities go as far as having 2-3 candidates as 'reserves.'\n\nThe time constraints bit sounds like they are expediting any actions to ensure that they can come back to you within your time frame. This may also indicate how close you were to the first choice (i.e. it was not a clear-cut case on who was the better candidate of the two).\n\nThis is perfectly normal. If you like the position and it is offered to you, then go for it.",

So I asked them to keep me apprised of their final decision as soon as possible rather than have a step by step update. Not sure if I should have acted differently? There are differing views on this with folks telling me to call them and ask for what I lack that the other person is offering. I was thinking that I'd ask that question if they get back to me with an offer. Should I push more aggressively or take a step back? What did you do?",

They do that so you can plan, e.g. defer a decision for another place, and for them to plan if they need to find a different reserved candidate. \n\nDo nothing. When the top-ranked candidate decides, they will let you know. Being 'pushy,' even if they give you the job won't get you anywhere other than making a bad impression on your future colleagues.\n\nAsking for feedback is not only reasonable, but it is also often mandated by law/internal policy. However, now, it is not the time to do that. You should ask *after* any decision has been made.",
