      "text": "Well, I'm an American and did her PhD abroad in the Netherlands and just moved back to the USA, so I'll answer!\n\nI really enjoyed living in Holland- I wanted to live in Europe like you, and it's really a great base for doing so.  I also met my partner there, so definitely got to know the locals! :) It's a great country for historical and cultural activities, less so if you're a \"get out into nature\" person. (The national parks are more like city parks, and are packed on weekends. I did love cycling around the countryside on all the bike paths though.) Also very great for getting out on weekends to see Europe.\n\nOn the research side, there are a ton of great research institutes in the Netherlands, and the one my degree is from has a great reputation, so no one's cared that my degree/experience occurred abroad so much as what that experience was.  I can obviously tell though how that might be field (or even sub-field) dependent.  It also really helps these days IMO to know how science works in Europe and get collaborations going there.  There are always several Americans in any institute I visited doing postdocs btw, and international people at every level- I'd say only a third of the institute was Dutch, and almost all the postdocs are from other countries as Dutch PhD students were encouraged to go abroad for their postdoc.  We always spoke English in the institute, and you'd probably be fine without knowing much Dutch in daily life unless in a rather rural place.\n\nThe one thing I do advise people about is based on my experience the Dutch academic system is more rigid than you will find in the USA.  It's kinda hard to argue against hundreds of years of tradition in many cases, and the obsession about the hierarchy of stuff we don't care about in the USA like associate vs full professor is pretty strong there.  This can be hard to notice because the Dutch insist they're a casual bunch where everyone is equal... but I have definitely seen postdocs whose contracts were ended early in ways that wouldn't have flown in the USA, and everyone shrugged their shoulders.  So, just be aware.",

While, like all places, there are few things to critique, in general it is a great place to live, with the biking culture a special standout. I could have stayed on in Europe looking for more postdocs or possibly a more fixed position, but I decided to go to a different country/continent when I left the Netherlands a few years ago. I did not apply for many US jobs but I got a campus visit for one, and some of my colleagues were able to get US jobs from the Netherlands, so it is possible. Another bonus is that between conference travel and vacation I ended up seeing half of Europe while I was over there, everything is just so much closer and well connected. Good luck!",
