  "text": "I studied history at undergrad, and graduated last year with a good but not spectacular grade. With all the uncertainty about how degrees would be managed during covid, and because I found other work and would like to travel / improve some foreign languages I speak, I've decided that I don't immediately want to do a postgrad. I figure it's not a bad thing to take ~3 years off in-between, but a ~10 year gap would probably be a real issue if I wanted to get a PhD and work in academia. \n\nAlthough I was a touch burned out after graduating, I've recently began doing quite a lot of academic reading online, and it makes me wonder if I could continue doing so as a hobby for an extended period then jump back in where I left off.\n\nIn your opinions, is it possible to stay up to date with current scholarly knowledge in a field without access to a university library, an academic mentor etc? Are there any potential problems I should consider?",

      "text": "Personally, I would enroll as a non-degree-seeking student in elective courses you are interested in but will not find bothersome to attend (such as yoga, weightlifting, drawing 1, etc.) at a nearby university just to have access to the databases if this is your intent. Pay a minimal fee each semester to keep doing research while also getting some of your side interests fed without having to worry too much about grades.",

      "text": "There are always a lot of questions from prospective grad students about \"current scholarly knowledge\" in a field, and I have no idea where any of them come from. This is not a thing in the humanities. People in historical, geographical, intellectual, disciplinary and methodological silos are continually grinding out new publications in more or less benign indifference to what is happening in the rest of their field, let alone the humanities as a whole. \n\nConsider: what would be meant by \"current scholarly knowledge\" on, say, James Joyce? Or the Easter Rising? Or Ireland? Do you think that any two people would give you the same answer on this? And why would anyone care if a prospective student had read a recently released academic monograph on a specialized subject area *before* beginning graduate school, when they could easily do so after? It doesn't make any sense as a concern. \n\nThe most you will need to do for applying to grad school is to be aware of the existence of major methodological innovations from the last 50 years.",
