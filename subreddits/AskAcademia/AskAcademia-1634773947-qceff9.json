  "text": "I studied history at undergrad, and graduated last year with a good but not spectacular grade. With all the uncertainty about how degrees would be managed during covid, and because I found other work and would like to travel / improve some foreign languages I speak, I've decided that I don't immediately want to do a postgrad. I figure it's not a bad thing to take ~3 years off in-between, but a ~10 year gap would probably be a real issue if I wanted to get a PhD and work in academia. \n\nAlthough I was a touch burned out after graduating, I've recently began doing quite a lot of academic reading online, and it makes me wonder if I could continue doing so as a hobby for an extended period then jump back in where I left off.\n\nIn your opinions, is it possible to stay up to date with current scholarly knowledge in a field without access to a university library, an academic mentor etc? Are there any potential problems I should consider?",

      "text": "Personally, I would enroll as a non-degree-seeking student in elective courses you are interested in but will not find bothersome to attend (such as yoga, weightlifting, drawing 1, etc.) at a nearby university just to have access to the databases if this is your intent. Pay a minimal fee each semester to keep doing research while also getting some of your side interests fed without having to worry too much about grades.",
