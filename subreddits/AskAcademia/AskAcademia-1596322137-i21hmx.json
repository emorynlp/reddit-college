  "title:": "How can I stand out to my professor on an online research project? I really need a good recommendation for PhD",
  "text": "I have a physics research internship this summer but because of COVID, it\u2019s been online and unpaid. I only video call the professor once a week, sometimes less and it\u2019s just hard to show him the work I\u2019ve been doing or for him to get an impression of how I work. We only meet for an hour as well because he has back to back meetings and I\u2019m worried the reference I was relying on him to give for my PhD will be effectively empty given he barely got to know me. What could I do to get him to see I\u2019m working hard, well, etc.? How can I impress him in this medium?",

I recently started making little presentations for meetings with my supervisor with a list of what I've done since the last meeting and what I would like to do before the next meeting (and any questions I have so I can do those things).  Then the next meeting I can say if I did those things and what problems came up. It makes the meetings run smoother and helps me set priorities, but has also impressed my supervisor.",

      "text": "Hi Al-sen! I'm currently helping run a summer mentorship program at my campus and I've heard a lot of similar issues from students. One thing I would recommend is to setup a meeting with your advisor to discuss your PhD application. If they seem like a reasonable person, I would basically tell them exactly what you said here, like:\n\n\"Dear Professor X,\n\nI was hoping to setup an extra meeting with you to talk about an application I'm putting together for a PhD program. I had hoped this summer internship would provide good experience and potentially a strong rec letter, but now due to it being a virtual program I worry about how my application will look. If you have time, I'd really appreciate your input. \n\nBest,\nStudent X\"\n\nHope that helps!",

      "text": "I'm currently advising a few master's student theses in an online manner. I'm fully aware that they will need a reference letter from me, and so I'm being extra careful to note their strengths as best as I can from afar.\n\nMy best students come prepared each meeting with a (very simple) powerpoint or LaTeX document that lists:\n\n* a summary of everything we talked about last week\n* all the progress that has been made on the points we discussed last week\n* all the points that the student has questions on that they need feedback with\n* a tentative plan for the next week, and questions on if the next steps are appropriate\n\nThe powerpoints are super simple, they probably took about 10-20 minutes to make, but they make the meetings a lot more streamlined and productive. Most importantly, it becomes very easy to gauge what kind of work they are doing and how productive they are.",

I find professors are often willing to help students pursue graduate school and typically use fairly standardized recommendation letters.",

I can\u2019t imagine anyone being offended with someone outright saying \u201cI\u2019d like to do a great job - please tell me how.\u201d Ideally right at the start.  \n\nThe problem only comes when people ask this kind of question far too late.  If you are asking for a recommendation tomorrow, it\u2019s probably too late to ask this kind of question because it\u2019s obvious you only care about the letter and not about the hard work it takes to do a good job.  But asked early on - or even halfway through as a \u201ccheck-in\u201d conversation - seems fine.  It\u2019s not like any professor is going to clutch their pearls about a student wanting a letter of rec.\n\nKey point here is to ask *what you can do to **earn** a good recommendation*, rather than just if you can have one.  Makes it clear you expect to work for it and don\u2019t feel entitled to it.",

Setting up an additional meeting about pursuing the PhD  is a great idea and gives you a chance to ask what makes a good candidate and what makes a good grad student. The traits/skills that your PI looks for in grad students are the things they\u2019ll look to when thinking about how ready or not ready you are for PhD and how strong their recommendation is. If they mention some stuff you\u2019re not already doing, you can figure out a way to start! This also gives you a chance to pick their brain without potentially poisoning their opinion of you!",
