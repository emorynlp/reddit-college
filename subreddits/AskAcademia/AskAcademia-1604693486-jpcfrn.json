  "text": "I find it's impossible for me to stay alert during colloquiums or presentations, and sometimes even for more dynamic conversations where I'm actually participating, for more than about 20 minutes into a video call. I feel like my brain gets exhausted very quickly by the low-quality, compressed audio/video. I'll have a coffee during these events and that still doesn't help. Has anyone else suffered from this, and do you have any tricks for remaining alert?",

      "text": "Absolutely... and the NY Times had a great article on this about 6 months ago as to why.  \n\nIt turns out that, when we engage with people in real life, our brains are absorbing a *massive* amount of almost-imperceptible information (small gestures, posture, foot-shuffling, smells, pheromones, etc.), most of it subliminally.   \n\n(Because our lizard-brains need to know:  is this person about to attack me?  is this person a potential mate?  is this person a member of my in-group?  And our civilized-brains are constantly-evaluating on every level, from the utilitarian to the social to the abstract.) \n\nBut even on a high-quality, non-lagging Zoom call, practically NONE of this information is being captured by the software or otherwise conveyed.   You can't see their posture;  you can't smell their pheromones, etc.   So, your brain starts revving up to try to pick up the signals...  and this is exhausting. \n\n(It's sort of like how your cell phone battery drains faster when you're in an area of poor coverage, as it tries to grasp onto a useable signal.) \n\nIt goes the other way, too:   when I was Zoom-lecturing, I quickly learned to \"over-emote\"... to exaggerate the facial expressions emotions I was trying to get across, because the students seemed to respond much better when I did.  But this itself was exhausting... a 50 minute Zoom \"lecture\" felt as exhausting as giving a 2-hour in-person lecture.",

      "text": "Absolutely. There's a couple of strategies you can use. Try and set up somewhere where its possible to get up in long zoom calls. I do it in my classes. I just tell people I need to stretch, and step up as I keep speaking. Its easier when I'm conducting the class. When I'm in a meeting or a conference or something, and I'm not the one on the spot, its easier to just blank the screen, keep listening, and keep going. I've found that people are really accommodating about this in Academia. My students have been insanely supportive.\n\nAnother strategy, as someone mentioned below, is some exercises to get the blood flowing before you settle down.\n\nI realize it seems counter-intuitive, but I also find that doing something for just a few seconds when someone is speaking, and then letting your attention come back helps. Attention peaks and falls, and I think going with the natural flows a bit helps. With me, I sometimes take a minute in a long lecture to shift screens. Just refresh on Reddit. Maybe see the headlines on the news. Maybe look up an interesting source related to what we're discussing. When you've got 2-4 hour zoom classes like mine, I doubt looking away for like 5 minutes would break your ability to participate.",

      "text": "Is it only zoom calls or do you get this in, for example, lectures too? If you are otherwise sleeping well and have no underlying physical health problems, I really suggest looking at other aspects of your life and consider whether you might have ADHD. One of the big ways my ADHD affects me is that if I have to concentrate on only one thing for a long time, and I don't find it naturally engaging, then it literally exhausts me and I'm super prone to just falling asleep. Lectures, tutorials, zoom calls, the cinema, you name it I probably fell asleep in it. By the way, the subject itself could be super interesting to me, but if I'm not 'engaged' it doesn't matter... It just requires so much brain power to keep my focus, it feels like I'm trying to run some kind of mental marathon, but I've only got one leg and that one poor leg gets tired trying to hop while everyone else runs. Since starting medication I'm now a lot better able to pay attention to things without getting so overwhelmed. Not saying you necessarily do have this, and I certainly don't want to contribute to the \"college kids with adderall\" stigma, but if you also struggle in other areas I'd considering seeing a Dr.",
