  "title:": "How would you utilize research funds to improve your research career in the short term?",
  "text": "**If you had discretionary funds (let's say \\~$10k) from your department, how would you use that money to improve your academic career / research in the short term (i.e., one semester / academic term)?**\n\nIt is quite rare, but sometimes departments offer students startup funds that they can use to aid their research. More often, fellowships may provide funding beyond your stipend that you now have available.\n\nLet's say hypothetically (\\*wink\\*) that I have some such funds but they run out at the end of the calendar year. There's not enough time to hire a RA, nor is there time to say host a local conference or event that would give me many networking opportunities. An example of a good use: a colleague used her funds for an editor to help her translate her PhD thesis into a book. \n\n**What say you? What would you do with extra funding in the short term?**",

      "text": "Personally, when I don't have a use in mind already for something I'd directly need, I'd decide based on whether I'm trying to broaden or to deepen. By deepen, I mean things that allow me to do more of what I'm currently doing and by broaden I mean branching out into areas, topics, approaches, jobs, etc. that I'm not currently doing.\n\nFor deepening, I try to find ways to convert current funds into future time saved  or expanded capacity. Basically getting an RA accomplishes both of these things, but getting access to new software or investing in things that reduce my time-burden later on can accomplish the same overall goal. For example, your colleague who secured an editor saved time by not having to invest that effort and time herself in something that she may or may not be as well versed in as the topic of her thesis. My go-to if I'm just looking to save time is to prepay for things like transcription services, since that's time consuming, I don't really enjoy it, and having it done can really boost my overall productivity elsewhere. Obviously this would vary based on what type of work you do, but finding ways to lower the burden of the parts of the work you don't enjoy, that take a lot of time, or that generally hold up you being the rockstar you already are can be a less-direct (but still very effective) way to boost your career.\n\nThe broadening could take the form of things like certs that open up other job opportunities or let me reach into area I'm interested in.  I'd personally choose this one if I had a goal of branching out, changing jobs, etc. as compared to just digging deeper into something I'm already doing. Having some training in a new method, gaining a cert in something that allows me to take on new responsibilities, or whatever else could be a big big boost to my goals and if I don't have to pay for it (but would given less pressure on my time/personal funds) hey, sign me up. I also personally prefer things that can concretely live on a CV like a cert over a more amorphous workshop or conference attendance if I'm specifically trying to use that opportunity as a springboard for change. I want something where I can later point to it and say \"here's very specifically what I got from that money\" or mention the experience in a job interview, cover letter, or discussion with those above me about why I want to join project X or get new position Y. If they helped pay for that knew skill/knowledge/insight, I've found people tended to be more down with making sure I get a chance to use it and that they're sharing in the benefit of their investment. If I end up going somewhere else, it's easier for me to have a cert show up on a CV than a conference I attended (but didn't present at).\n\nThose are both very specifically if the goal is to use the funds to \"get ahead\" in some sort of way. If it's just ways to use money? I'd attend a conference in some place I wanted to visit so I could reduce the cost, pay participants or students to participate in things we'd usually just ask them to do as volunteers, reinvest it in quality of life improvements for the department that would improve my existing there, or something else that just generally helps me and those around me.\n\nBest of luck finding a good use for the funds :)  \n\n\n\\*\\*edit: another thing to do with one time funds that can be cool is to hold a competition and have a cash prize, create an award for something and then have people nominate others for who should win it and why, or similar. Competitions and awards are also a fun, kinda roundabout way of networking and connecting you with cool new ideas, people, and recognizing work others are doing that's rad.",
