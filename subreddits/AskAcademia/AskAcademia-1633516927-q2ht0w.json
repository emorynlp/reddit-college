  "title:": "My Ph.D. is not working out. Can I apply elsewhere and start again?",
  "text": "Slightly long post.\n\nI started my Ph.D. in January of this year and it has not been great. I have published a methods paper and am currently on track to submit a review article in a well-respected journal in my field but in terms of experiments, I have no experiments. There has not been a lot of guidance or feedback from my professors with regard to experiments. The Post-Doc who was supposed to train me until the end of this year (Dec, maybe even January 2022) on a technology developed in the lab over 4 years quit in February and left. I was left with no project and since have been struggling to get a successful experiment, start or even establish a project. \n\nI also work as a part of two labs, both specializing in two completely different fields (researching the same discipline of course) and communication is an extremely big problem between the two. Neither of my PI's understands what the other does and when I try to explain an experiment plan at least one of them is bamboozled.  \n\nA senior colleague of mine who is about to finish her Ph.D. (she works only in 1 lab) sat me down some time ago and told me to prepare for hell over the next 4 years because the collaboration within this one lab is 0 and it is essentially each person for themselves and no guidance will be provided once we finish our first year.\n\nI do not wish to brag or anything but I consider myself a good employee/Ph.D. candidate. I work hard, I do my research with enthusiasm and interest but honestly, I am scared right now. If this is what my future looks like, I would like to switch not just laboratories but straight up go to a different university (possibly and favorably in the USA - for personal reasons). I am currently in an EU country and have a master's degree from the USA. \n\nIs there a way I can quit my Ph.D. and start again somewhere in the USA? It is an engineering/STEM field that I would apply to but I really do not know how to move forward with this if I can at all.",

It's your journey and your responsibility to ask questions, set up meetings etc.\n\nYou're supposed to do novel research so the fact that your advisor doesn't know what you're talking about is a good sign. It would be hard to publish if everyone knew about it already.",
