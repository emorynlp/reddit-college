Best is to go psych and take courses in data science as a specialization. \n\nYou can always understand the context by working in industry, conducting and reading research, and by talking with others in the field.

      "text": "On average, those with a master's in GIS (or related field) will make more than those with a BA/BS who will make more than those with a certificate. It remains a field with some of the stronger employment opportunities (though I personally feel this is on the decline). There's various information on this available through the AAG.\n\nMany/most master's degrees in GIS (as opposed to in geography) are going to be self-funded. Many will have scholarships, internships, research assistant positions, and other opportunities available, but aren't funded in the way that PhDs in traditional disciplines usually are. That said, there are several very well respected MS level programs that are a single year and/or online/hybrid in nature. \n\nAll told, you should study what's right for you; but, explore your options and consider where you want to be in five or ten years.",
