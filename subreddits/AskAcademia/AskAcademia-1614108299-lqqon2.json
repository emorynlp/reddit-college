Turns out I had just mislabeled the sample and nothing interesting had actually happened. The result was a week of wasted efforts and my PI asked I give a short presentation during group meeting on the importance of labeling samples correctly and good organization. I imagine situations like that probably happen everyday.",

At least in my students I try to explain that as long as we're learning something we're making progress - even if it isn't what we set out to learn it helps us grow as a lab & as a field.  \n\nSometimes something that initially seems a waste (i.e. experiments disagreeing) can lead to deeper understanding.  The one that comes to mind from my PhD was with one type of experiment we saw opposite results and (after another 6 months of work) found out we were operating in two different regimes which helped to explain all of our results and led to us understanding the physics much better.",

So now I have some nice indices but no controls - so I can\u2019t do anything with them. The spatio-temporal changes look cool on a map, but that\u2019s about it. \n\nAnother example: last year someone didn\u2019t update the internal wiki to inform other department members of current projects. End result? Two researchers worked on the same kind of thing with similar data. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that one person\u2019s work was superfluous. \n\nWe also spent a long time recoding raw patent data for use in a couple projects, aggregating and matching it. Not particularly difficult, but time intensive and was worked on as a side project for a couple hours a week/every other week for a good six months. Finally finished, then found out another research group at the same institute had already done the prep 2 years ago and not told us or made it available for wider use. We operate out of different budgets and they had no obligation to do so, but it would have saved us a lot of time.\n\nThis happens all the time in research. Shit happens.
