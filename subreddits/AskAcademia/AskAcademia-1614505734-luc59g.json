Which got progressively worse and turned into severe ME/CFS. I've now been housebound, mostly lying down and unable to do pretty much anything for almost 2 years.\n\nDefinitely has given me a lot of time to reflect on my stupid decisions in the past and to think about how much health and family are the most important things in life.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. I also didn't think that anything bad could happen and was quite proud of my great work ethic. Things can change pretty quickly when some small mysterious piece stops working properly.",

I also, then, got very sick with multiple illnesses brought on by stress. I even have a hiatal hernia to show for that time in my life. \n\nI learned a lot from that experience. I now set certain hours for work and rarely go beyond them (unless I really feel like it for some reason or if I want to work a lot one day to have a half day the next or something). I don't work weekends. I treat my PhD like a job because it is. \n\nAnd guess what? I get way more done and it's better work. Setting boundaries and having time to rest and rejuvenate does wonders for focus, productivity, and quality when it comes to things like writing, reading, grading, etc. I was able to get 2 papers published in the amount of time it took me to publish one with this new process. \n\nSo set the boundaries. Take the day (or two!) off. You'll be better for it.",

One had just won a MacArthur genius grant and mentioned the \"secret\" to her success was she worked regular hours, every weekday, in her campus office. The other was an older grad student who (maybe condescendingly) rolled her eyes when younger colleagues complained about their course workload. She was flabbergasted by how terrible their time management was. \"I've worked for fifteen years. I had to get stuff done or I didn't eat, but these guys want to track down the citation of a citation instead of actually writing. They gotta learn they can get up at 7, start work at 8, and get shit done so they can get a good night's sleep and think clearly the next day.\"\n\nI won't pretend that's possible for every program or P.I.

If you work 60 hours just think about the amount of money you work for and pay with your free time for which you are not getting paid. Or calculate how much you now really make per hour. Let's say you work 40 hours a week for 20 dollars an hour as an easy example. If you work 60 hours instead you'd be down to a little over 13 dollars an hour. So much less for so much time. And every hour you make more you basically pay with your free time. Time you could spend to relax or do things that make you happy. Would anyone in industry do that? Just imagine someone would ask you to do more time and paid nothing more. You'd probably be pissed. So why do this on your own? \n\nAnd I mean money isn't everything. What will you look back on later on with a good feeling, the endless hours you worked or the time you spend with friends and family, the places you visited, your hobbies and interests and all those little things you did that made you happy? For me it definitely wouldn't be all the projects and my 'great' work ethics. I love my work but I also love my free time and all the little things I do on the weekends and days off. They keep me happy and prevent me from being overly stressed. A little over a year ago I was completely overworked and stressed out working overtimes while still having money problems because I 'loved the research so much and did so important things'. Then I got sick with several illnesses, took a break and realised I did this to myself. I quit the job and took my time to recover and rediscovered so many things that make me happy while keeping my stress level on a minimum.\n And guess what? My lab I worked at hardly realized a difference, they could hardly remember anything about me and found someone else. They literally did not care about my work. All the extra work I did is not being missed much. I had the feeling they hardly even realised I did all that. They actually made me feel bad for quitting when I was absolutely burnt out and sick.\nFrom then on I realised it's just a job that may be fun and I feel great about but I won't sacrifice things that make me happy, valuable time and definitely not my health for that.",

Now I work however much I need to in any given time. Sometimes that's more than 40 hours. Sometimes it's only 25 hours. And when it's 25 hours I happily take the time to refresh, take care of myself, and appreciate the fact that I have the privilege to take time to myself.

How we go about those hours is up to us. I generally work 7-12/1-4 Monday through Friday. Another student in my lab only works afternoons/evenings during the week (12-8).\n\nI'm not in classes right now (got them all out of the way in my first year); I was putting in slightly longer days then (like 9-10 hours/day) but still not working weekends. I have found doing working on my thesis and TAship manageable within that time frame if I can manage distractions (scrolling reddit/twitter, an urge to bake, etc).",
