I've been told my writing is good by my professors but I'm not sure it is to the level of being published, especially as an undergrad, and the subject matter of the essay is so specialized I can't submit it to any other journal.",

Make a pitch in your cover letter for why your manuscript fits the journal's scope and readership and what it says that is innovative or unique or of interest to your field.",

People will always have opinions. The comments might be quite blunt, but please remember that reviewers are not paid for doing so, so in the very likely event that they\u2019re busy, they\u2019re not going to spend loads of time making the language flowery and comforting. That\u2019s not a reflection on your work. When I\u2019ve reviewed manuscripts, the questions/comments always come from a place of interest, not malice. \n\nYou may also have to wait a while but don\u2019t panic: depending on the type of work, it might take a while for the editor to find suitable reviewers, and with the pandemic a lot of people have written the papers they\u2019ve not had the opportunity to until now, so there\u2019s lots more work. \n\nGood luck and congratulations on getting this far - it\u2019s an achievement either way!",

As an undergraduate, you haven't (yet) received the training to know whether or not you're actually making an original contribution. You can only make this assessment after you've gained incredibly deep familiarity with a given discipline over several years. That's why earning a doctorate takes so long.

If not, then you're not submitting very many articles! In most cases, when I have had an article rejected, I have gotten some really good feedback from reviewers or the editor. That has helped me to strengthen the manuscript for the next journal submission, and grow as a researcher more broadly.\n\nAbsent a situation in which you get a rejection with little to no feedback (which I agree is not ideal) consider that something good will happen either way: either you'll get the opportunity to revise and resubmit, or you will receive helpful feedback from reviewers that will help you to grow in the work that you do.",
