  "title:": "Incoming MA and cold feet",
  "text": "Hello, I am an incoming MA student in Singapore.  I am funded by an external organization for my MA (which means the bulk of my school fees are covered). However, I will not receive a stipend, nor any funding for conferences from my university, since these privileges are only afforded to university scholarship holders. \n\nThe chair of graduate studies had also informed me at a briefing that I'll very likely only be able to be an RA, since TA positions will be reserved for those on university scholarships, though my supervisor has indicated his willingness for me to co-teach one of his modules with him in future.\n\nI wanted to pursue my MA as I got an excellent grade on my undergraduate thesis, and will be contributing a book chapter to an academic publication on disability studies, which is a relatively nascent field here. When I applied to the programme, I just felt that contributing my knowledge to society outweighed any potential drawbacks. All the professors I spoke to within and outside my major were also very supportive of my endeavours.\n\nAt the same time, I was also working at a job that I couldn't see myself staying long in, since the pay wasn't great, and I felt like I wasn't growing or learning new skills, which attracted me even more to pursuing an MA. \n\nNow that I've left my job and matriculated for my MA though, my mum keeps questioning if I had made the right decision, since I'll be without a stable source of income. She's also worried that finding another full-time job will be difficult for me in the future, because I have a disability. \n\nInitially I brushed it aside, but the more she questioned it, the more I am starting to doubt myself too. What if I'm not as cut out for research as I thought? Is the opportunity cost of not having a stable income for the next 2 years worth it?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts/advice.",

      "text": "Hi there, first off congratulations on getting the funding. I'm from Asia and honestly, it is common to not get stipend during Masters. If anything, it is getting more difficult to source full tuition fee funding in the past few years. So kudos to you on that.\n\nYou are starting off on a great path by contributing on the book chapter. I feel like I was in a similar situation as yours when I started off my Masters. I also felt like I had great support for me to continue on my journey. While that was an initiator for my journey, I had similar questions from my parents as well asking me about the feasibility of going 2 years without stable income. This is where you need to have a conversation with your parents about getting the financial support you need during these years. I found that it helped to speak to my parents about the future job outlook after my Masters. You can also talk to them about possibly doing a PhD which will pay a stipend? I'm not sure if you are going to walk that path but most PhDs are fully funded with living wages so it helps.\n\nSingapore is a great country with a lot of opportunities, I'm sure. I think at this point you just have to ask yourself what you really want for yourself. Postgraduate is a long road, I'm not going to make it sound good. The reward is more internal than it is external. I'm sorry to say that haha, you'll probably make back your time & resource investment maybe only 10+ years down the road. I do think though that you should not scare yourself into not trying out the MA first. \n\nPostgraduate can be a great path. Whether or not you are cut out for research is something you will discover down the road but the fact that you are writing a book chapter is a great indication towards that direction. Wish you the best of luck.",

          "text": "Thank you for the reassurance. \n\nOne thing that my supervisor said I could do was find additional work outside if I wanted to, since I don't have restrictions/teaching obligations like my friends on university scholarships do. \n\nIt's likely I'll only have coursework 1-2 days a week in my first year, and my 2nd year will be focused entirely on writing my dissertation. Would you suggest I take up part-time work now, or maybe even a full-time job while writing my dissertation in my 2nd year?",

              "text": "I actually have experience working and studying so I think I can offer my two cents.\n\nI think that part time job is doable throughout the entire Masters as long as it does not tire you out too much. I wish I took on a part time job during my Masters, as the workload albeit being endless was highly manageable. \n\nIt does depend on whether you are a good multitasker though. If this is your first time working + studying, you should wait a few months before taking a part time job. However, I do not recommend doing a full time job while writing your dissertation.\n\nI can reassure you that the dissertation is harder than the coursework. You will have to learn many new things that you probably have never picked up before. If anything, try to keep it part time. I\u2019m not saying full time job and full time study is impossible, its just that it incurs significant tradeoffs. Again, look at your capacity.",

Could apply to get it paused while I'm pursuing graduate studies, but it'll just keep accruing interest.",

      "text": " I do not think in Singapore anyone is discriminated based on a disability, I have not seen or experienced that in my work life but then I work in a place that is related to the disability sector. What matters is your values, work attitude, communication and aptitude for the work. \n\nGo for something you are good at, not something that offers the best prospects. \n\nWhether you should continue or not is a decision you have to make. Will you regret it if you don't take up the MA? Do you have a back-up plan if things don't work out? No matter what decision you make, always take care of your health and mental health.",
