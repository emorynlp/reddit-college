  "title:": "Question about name formatting for poster presentation and potentially future publications",
  "text": "Alongside a partner, I have been working on an for a poster presentation that is due at the end of the week. Today during a team meeting the topic of names came up. As of right now my name is just [first name] [last name] with no middle name. As a first generation college student, I\u2019ve thought a lot about the efforts and sacrifices *both* of my parents have made in order to help me get this far. I\u2019ve thought a lot about changing my last name to be [first name] [last name]-[mothers surname] so that if I\u2019m ever published both of my parents family names are there. I wanna go through with it, it\u2019s just a tedious process that I haven\u2019t done yet. Would it be ok to submit this abstract under the latter last name-surname even though it\u2019s still not my legal name? Just want to make sure I don\u2019t run into any issues. Thanks in advance to anybody that answers my question! Hope I used the correct flair but if not please fe",

I usually advocate others to publish their name as they want, 2 last names, hyphenated, middle initial - up to you from perspective but I'm not a lawyer or a journal editor so take that into account",

In that case, you probably want to use your legal name just to make sure it doesn\u2019t lead to any issues later on when it comes to immigration.",
