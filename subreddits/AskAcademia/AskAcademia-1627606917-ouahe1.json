  "text": "Tl;dr- will there ever come a time in your career when you stop needing to apply for grants, and can just focus on research and teaching?\n\nCognitive Science PhD student here, soon to be applying for post docs and/or faculty positions. I\u2019ve been attending professional development events, chatting with alumni from my program, attending funding workshops at conferences etc. Before I started th PhD, I thought that once you were a professor then your job was mainly to teach and do research, and that\u2019s what a university hires and pays you to do. Since I\u2019ve been on my program, I\u2019ve found out that you need the be continuously applying for grants in order to fund your research. The grant award rate (for any funding body) is astoundingly low, the grant writing process is usually immensely time consuming, and you\u2019re almost always working on the next proposal. \n\nMy question is\u2014will there ever come a time in your career when you stop needing to apply for grants? When you can just, say, teach and do research?",

He'd been doing this for decades and decades.\n\nMy thesis adviser almost never set foot in the lab, even though he was bran new and had just published a really good paper in his postdoc before getting the tenure track job.  His job became conferences and grant writing to keep the lab funded.  Eventually you just become a sort of logistics monkey commanding troops to do your research while you beg the government for more money to keep it going.\n\nIt \n\nNever\n\nEnds\n\nHave fun.",

One of them has a collaboration with a national lab that provides more money than he can spend, a couple have money coming from fortune 500 companies, and one has a \"continuing\" research project with some government agency (DoD?). None of them are low stress projects because maintaining the relationship and research productivity is super important, but they don't write grants. I suspect none of those situations are common outside of EE and CS, though.",

      "text": "Not for most people.  Some exceptions:\n\n\\- Some researchers do eventually wind up in some sort of long-term funding relationship with some company (usually a big one, I see this happen most with the Apples and Facebooks of the world) where the company permanently funds their research so they don't have to spend their time seeking other funding sources.  Typically the researchers is doing some sort of consulting or part-time employment for the big company as well, so it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.  This does usually require some sort of conflict of interest oversight at the university so it's not perfectly frictionless, and wouldn't be allowed at all universities\n\n\\- Some researchers end up at an FFRDC (federally funded R&D center), where there's no grant-seeking because there's just one big chunk of government funding that runs the whole place forever.  Those people aren't teaching, though, in my experience.\n\n\\- Some people run their labs on one huge grant that gets renewed every five years or so (typically, some kind of center grant).  This is a real mixed bag; you end up getting three years or so of uninterrupted research, a year of absolute chaos while the one grant is being written, and a year of setup once the new grant is awarded and you have to actually prepare to do whatever new stuff you said you were going to do with the new money.  And of course the renewals aren't guaranteed - I worked at one such lab that had been running for fifteen years off such a grant, and then when it wasn't renewed, it devastated the lab, a lot of people lost their jobs, everyone left worked their asses off scrambling for twenty new small grants.  It was a real mess.",

Some places give their profs/PIs some baseline operating funds, or funded/subsidised access to technicians, while in other places you have to bring in grant funding even to cover your own salary.  There's also variation in how PhDs get funded, which affects this: in some places you need to pay PhD students out of your grant funds (which requires you to apply for more grant funding) but in others, PhDs are paid out of some departmental or university-level fund which may be less onerous to apply for.\n\nI've seen grant writing \"pause\" for a while for people who got really big grants (ERC level), enough to run their group for a few years.  Then they spend more time managing the group and doing admin to handle the funding requirements, but then have to swing back into grant writing well before that funding runs out if they want to maintain any consistency/momentum.",
