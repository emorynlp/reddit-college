  "title:": "What to do when you realize a huge error in the thesis you wrote a year ago?",
  "text": "Hi guys, I graduated my bachelor in linguistics last year and today, I realized a huge mistake in my published thesis. I made a translation mistake of the main theory that I used that affected my conclusion. The data stays the same, only the analysis would've been different. I wrote the translation of the theory directly without the original text, so that's probably why my academic advisor missed it. As well as the other 3 professors who reviewed it. I also passed my defense. It's an honest mistake that I just realized today and I'm scared this will affect my academic in the future as I will be pursuing my Master's degree this year (it's not linguistics). I'm also scared this misquoting will mislead people who will potentially use my thesis as a reference. What should I do? Will I get my undergrad degree revoked? \n\nTl;dr: I realized I made an unintentional vital translation mistake on an approved thesis and I'm scared this will mislead people and affect my academic career.",
