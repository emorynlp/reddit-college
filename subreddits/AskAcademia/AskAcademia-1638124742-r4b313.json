  "text": "I live in southern Europe and I just completed a PhD in history. I am trying to find out what to do next, mostly applying for postdocs. The thing is that in my country opportunities are very few and funding almost non existent. At the same time, left wing historians consider  others as \"enemies\" and they try to block their moves. As the others are a minority it's really hard to get funding for your research. Most of these people have connections to the government and are part of a broad network of academics and politicians (as they also admit).\n\nI do not belong to any political party and I only care for my research (although I have an opinion). I failed to receive any nationaI funding because of that and so did my colleagues (later we got prestigious international scholarships). As I specialized in regional studies (an already underfunded field) I see that these people also dominate positions at research institutes abroad.\n\nI feel that I have no future. \nHas anyone faced any similar situation?",

Academic Twitter (place where most networking is done, especially in covid times) is filled with lot of political opinions. These are perspectives which should be discussed in a civil way. But as Twitter is a cesspool, you vs me arguments get amplified the most.\n\nBut I want to know more about how you think left wingers block any moves though. Could you explain more?",

          "text": "Yes, as it's commonly known, Southern Europe suffered from populism, so this gave rise to various academic groups in humanities and social science. In addition these countries had a long history of authoritarian regimes (military juntas), so non left-wing ideas are usually identified as far right. And left wing historians consider that they have a task to save society from right wing political discourse. And left wing historians are the majority in Europe in general. Of course (at least in my country) these objectives justify their attempts to monopolize research and get funding.\nI find surprising the fact that people in the US or western Europe refuse to even try to understand how clientelism affects academic networks in small places where the situation is also highly polarized.",

                  "text": "First of all your topic of study would reveal your political preferences. As I said the majority of historians are left-wing in my country. When you apply for a PhD scholarship in my field of study, depending on your topic, people can assume who your supervisor is (and along with your university and department they can be sure who he or she is). Then the supervisor's ties with the government or the opposition can determine to a great extent your chances. We are a small country, our universities are not very old and academics in every field are very few (let's say in that particular field they are maybe ten, including both left-wing and right-wing people).   \nIt might be helpful to think of the situation in Soviet terms. Just imagine that in addition to the regime's friends there are one or two others who are excluded from practically everything :)",
