  "title:": "My PhD advisor is trying to forbid me from going to the lab.",
  "text": "I feel like I'm in a bit of a weird situation, and I could use some other thoughts about what I should do. I'm in the last semester of my PhD (I hope). My department is kind of an omnishambles, and there's a lot of political maneuvering that is affecting my situation. \n\nRecently, my department advisor tried to asset control over my work by forbidding me to going to the lab that funds me. My co-advisor, who is my lab supervisor, very nearly cut my funding after my advisor called him to tell him I wasn't going to work in the lab anymore. (I met with him separately later to tell him I would still work there, regardless of what she said.)\n\nMy advisor thinks my research, and my dissertation, is in a much worse off place than it is. She thinks that I need to spend 10 hours a day for a month non-stop writing, but also admits to not having read anything I have sent to her save one chapter. As of this post, I have about 8 chapters, 150-odd pages, all cited, formatted to the university's standards, figures and tables inserted, etc. \n\nI'm not sure if my advisor's behavior is in the scope of normal. The graduate program director has also told me I shouldn't be going to the lab, so I think my advisor catastophized my work to the director. I'm not sure if I should just let it slide and ignore my advisor, but she wants to meet me weekly before I hand my dissertation into my committee. According to my co-advisor and lab supervisor I'm doing fine and he thinks my other advisor is being needlessly negative.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. I honestly don't know what I should do in this situation.",

With you at the very end of your PhD, and you having seemingly 8 chapters (that\u2019s a ton for a PhD thesis, although 150 pages isn\u2019t very long) worth of data already collected...it seems like you should be done in the lab? Is the stuff you want to do in the lab PhD related, or additional experiments?",

If you\u2019re stuck in the same lab for a really long time, you\u2019re constrained to the same set of ideas, people, standardized ways to do techniques, etc. Maybe it\u2019s not such a bad idea if your lab is very good at doing one specific thing, and you plan on doing that one specific thing for the rest of your life. But most people probably don\u2019t, and even if you do, departments want to hire people who can draw from a wide area of expertise to make strong research innovations and not people with limited training experience. \n\nEven more generally, I\u2019ve heard people say that staying at the same institution for a long time is frowned upon. Different universities and departments will have very different cultures and styles in how they conduct research and organize administration and everything. Being exposed to those differences is also often deemed important when hiring PI\u2019s, as they may be more successful in navigating the professional environment of research in forming collaborations and being a strong team member of the department, etc than someone who\u2019s used to one system and culture their whole academic life.",

Maybe /u/ph0rk is right that the ombud is the next place to contact.\n\nAs for additional context (if you feel like giving it): When did this pressure start? How long have you been working on the dissertation? Is your timeline typical for your lab? Can you see any specific reasons why she would be concerned right now about you, or is this typical enough of her that you can conclude she is an ineffective adviser? How assertive have you been in pointing out your progress to her? I can think of more \"food for thought\" questions if you find them helpful to consider.",

What exactly does she mean then? \n\nAlso she doesn't need to be an expert in your specific thesis topic to have expertise in your area. Generally you should know more about your thesis focus than anyone else by the time you finish. She must be in the same department though? If she is completely useless in assessing your research \\_and\\_ doesn't have a PhD then why on earth is she your advisor? You would need a co-advisor either way anyway. You could have at least gotten someone with real academic training as your main advisor. Speaking of which, you need to get the co-advisor to read your thesis since their opinion is apparently critical here.",

It's really hard to explain your work to an audience beyond your tiny little niche of a subfield. That's one of the big challenges in writing a thesis. And while your co-advisor can assess whether the thesis is technically correct and impactful, they are probably  too close to your research to assess how well you explain things.",

              "text": "There are conferences where they will publish literally anything and the review doesn't even consist of reading the paper.\n\nGraduate writing tutors can tell you whether you've made spelling mistakes and whether your grammar is correct, but they are often not experts in your niche field. A research plan that landed you the position doesn't mean your research is any good.\n\nYou should bounce your research (as in stuff you've written down at least as a draft, if it's not written down then it doesn't exist) off experts that can do some sparring and help you refine your ideas and thoughts on the paper.\n\nThere is a huge leap from \"essay writing\" to \"writing academic papers\". There is no expectation of writing academic papers from undergrad or even grad school in most cases (perhaps they hope that you'll achieve that level during your masters thesis but most don't even have one and it's not required).\n\nWriting a research plan, preparing a conference poster etc. is not the same as writing academic papers. In most fields (notable exception is computer science and some engineering fields but you said you don't use Latex) conference papers are not academic papers. They're more of an abstract, a short introduction and a short description of what's up.\n\nI am not doubting your ability to write a text or make pretty figures. What I am doubting is whether the content of the paper is solid.\n\nNobody ever explained to me how exactly do you write a paper in my field (computer science). There were courses that taught how to write academic English and everything related to language and text, there were courses about how to make a conference paper or how to structure a paper and research methodology and techniques and methods and study design and whatever.\n\nBut getting away from \"school paper\" towards \"academic paper\" took a long time of learning by osmosis. Reading some non-top conference/journal papers or looking at young researchers I believe that even most fresh PhD's don't completely understand what's the point of research and how do you do great research and write great papers. \n\nYour PhD supervisor will rarely act irrational and emotional for no reason. You don't get to become a professor or even a senior researcher if you are irrational. If they are saying that you need to work 10 hours per day to salvage your PhD, I'd listen to them and try to figure out what exactly are they talking about and how to fix it. They have probably supervised people before and they probably have a lot of reviewer experience and know what they're doing. Your fellow colleagues and 2nd or 3rd PhD advisor probably don't have that under their belt (or they'd be the first).\n\nShit does happen and some people are batshit insane, but I'd look into it and make sure that I'm not the problem here or misunderstanding something before blaming someone else.\n\nIn my experience if you're confident and think that everyone around you is stupid and doesn't understand you in an University setting, [you're very likely at the peak of Mount Stupid](https://kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/kajabi-storefronts-production/themes/250022/settings_images/PqQFgBHiTmSHXPj5vCgL_Dunning-Kruger-Effect.jpg).\n\nThe dunning kruger effect is treacherous because it makes you absolutely sure you're right and it is not simple to tell the difference between actually being right and just thinking you're right.",

For most of the last semester I thought I was stupid and subpar, because of how my advisor was treating me and my work. It turns out she does this to the other advisers she has had. Over the past five years I have been here, I am the only student she has chaired a committee for, which shouldn't have happened because she doesn't have a PhD and doesn't know the breadth of work it takes for a PhD. This became very clear to me after her comments on my work were almost all about formatting for the paper. Trust me, I also wanted for my advisor to give concerted feedback about the soundness of difference areas of my research but she simply won't.\n\nI have had different problems with her earlier in the semester, which I have brought up to administration, who also remarked on the erratic and harmful nature of her behavior. This previous behavior is why I am currently wondering if her behavior now is erratic as well.\n\nMy lab supervisor, also a 20 year expert in my field with a PhD, has been reviewing my work. He has brought in different experts to review and give feedback on the work I have proposed that is the major part of the project.\n\nMy area is a field related to computer science, so I tend to submit to computer science conferences, so the conferences papers are more like condensed articles with lots of peer and expert reviews.",
