  "text": "I will finish my masters (humanities) mid-2022. Until about six months ago I believed I wanted to build a career in academia. I loved my subject, I had an area of interest for potential PhD research and most importantly, I enjoyed the process of research. \n\nIn the past six months my interest in my studies has dwindled significantly. I am getting by doing the bare minimum. Research brings me no pleasure nor do I have any new ideas. I haven't written a paper in months, no conferences either. It's like I hate doing all the things I used to love about academia. Also, I am beginning to think I will hate teaching.\n\nJust looking for some advice from people in academia. Should I take a break from academia and consider returning if I ever feel like it again? Is that feasible or do I need to accept this field isn't for me and move on?",

      "text": "First, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's really really common to hit a slump and consider dropping out. I've found this most common during someone's 2nd or 3rd year of grad school. In my case, it was during my third year (I even got certified to teach in the K-12 system as a backup plan). Your feelings are normal but this doesn't mean you should stay in your program, it also doesn't mean you should leave academia. \n\nSecond, the past 18 months have been horrifying and, if at all possible, I would avoid making future projections about your happiness based on how things have been going during a pandemic coupled by a period of incredible political instability. This is important to keep in mind because it may be at least partially responsible for your feelings behind your research and behind your teaching (students are living through these times as much as we are). \n\nYou don't have to say what program you're in but know that people who go into a PhD program with a Masters (in my experience) tend to do much better than people who go straight from undergrad. Even if you've learned that you're no longer interested in your thesis topic but still interested in your discpline, that's significant progress and will really help you in a future PhD program (so many grad students in the humanities take a lot of time to realize what they're really interested in - you're already putting that time in). \n\nI think it's important to try and remember what it was that most interested you about your discpline. What questions did you love? What professors lit that fire in you to pursue a Masters degree? It's possible (I would say it's likely) that as we return to something that looks more like normalcy, some of that love and passion will return. If it doesn't then you'll know that your decision to leave wasn't impacted by political instability or the anxiety-producing hell of Covid. \n\nI should say that if you have a solid alt-ac plan already, it could be worth finishing the masters and trying that out for a year (you could apply to PhD programs and defer admissions for a year if it came to that). I wish you the best here and please take my comments as one person's opinion though I've felt this before too and also seen it happen to a lot of graduate students. It's common and whatever you decide to do on the other side of this, it's probably going to turn out okay.",

      "text": "I think you need to reflect on what it is about research you\u2019re not currently enjoying. I think it\u2019s fairly normal for people to realize they don\u2019t like research as much as they thought once they start to enter the PhD phase. There\u2019s a world of difference from studying a wide variety of topics in your field as an undergrad or even during master\u2019s course work and doing an extremely narrow topic for a PhD. If you\u2019re a person who\u2019s mostly excited by the variety of topics in your field and the big picture, then a PhD will be a struggle in my opinion. \n\nIf you really do hate teaching, one thing to think about is what kind of jobs you\u2019ll likely get coming from your program (or the program you get accepted to if you\u2019re in a terminal masters). If it\u2019s a low or middle ranked program, chances are you\u2019ll end up in a job with a very high teaching load. And if you hate the main activity of your entire career, no amount of love for your field or your research will offset that. \n\nThat being said, as a general rule I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to start a PhD program unless you\u2019re fairly confident about these sorts of things. PhDs grind down even the most passionate and devoted students. If you go in half-hearted and questioning it likely won\u2019t go well.",

      "text": "Impossible to say. I think most of us in academia have had similar slumps. Personally, I happen to enjoy teaching the last year or two and struggle more with motivation in writing. Career-wise I should focus more on the latter, but right now it bores me. (Most other times, I have been the reverse, where I loved writing and hated dealing with student deadlines, grading, etc.)\n\nI really hesitate to give advice here without knowing you, though.",
