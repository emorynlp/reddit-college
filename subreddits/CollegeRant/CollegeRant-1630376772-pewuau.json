Im a junior and I transferred and thought it would be super easy to make friends since most juniors haven\u2019t been on campus for a year and half and most sophomores have never been. I am getting along with my roommates but I feel like I\u2019m clinging to them and I\u2019m kinda being forced to be friends. I don\u2019t know anyone but them and I\u2019ve been trying to branch out but its really hard. Idk how it seems like everyone has all these established friends when most of us haven\u2019t been there in forever. I did go to a club meeting tonight and had fun but didn\u2019t really make friends. Also I\u2019m gonna go to a couple more but its just SO hard. I just get so jealous of people who have all these friends when it\u2019s impossible for me to even talk to one person", "author": "aj011922", "created": 1630384545, "upvotes": 6}}}
