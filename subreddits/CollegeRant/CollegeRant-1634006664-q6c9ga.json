  "text": "So for my computer information class, we have been meeting through zoom for 8 weeks now and my professor sent out an email about 10 minutes ago telling us that the class is now in person starting tomorrow. I\u2019m not annoyed about changing the meeting format but how she sent out the message late at night. Like if you knew you were going to change the meeting format then why not send a email 2-3 days ahead of time? Not everyone checks their email at night and will miss class tomorrow because they didn\u2019t see the email. Maybe I\u2019m just being overdramatic but I think a message like that should be sent ahead of time so us students can be prepared.",

      "text": "I feel like these professors do things like this because no one is going to call them out on it. No one holds them accountable in their day to day activities, so they feel they have carte blanche to do whatever they want whenever they want because they're the professor. Is it right? No. Is it punctual in this case? Heck no. But who's gonna stop them, it's their class that they're entrusted to teach. Therefore, all your professor has to do is say \"well I sent out the email\" and then they have a free pass to shit on you for not reading your email. Playing the blame game and avoiding any reason or accountability-because they can. Screw professors that do this kinda crap on a regular basis. People need ample time to make changes. What if your car was in the shop or you had to go to the doctors the day the class was suddenly moved to in person? Jesus, some colleges try to do whatever they want with their students.",
