They haven\u2019t left literally since we moved in and I\u2019m just about fed tf up. A bunch of other crap happened too but I won\u2019t get into that. First of all the rent is fairly expensive so it pisses me off every time I think about how they haven\u2019t left. Like bud, go home. You\u2019re campus is in a whole other town. Im so tempted to snitch but if I do I\u2019d need to break out if the lease for my sanity and that\u2019d be even more money. Ugh. Ever semester it\u2019s something. Whether it\u2019s college, work, or home environment it\u2019s always freaking something.", "author": "r-e-w-13", "created": 1631070989, "retrieved": 1632841131, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc0l6au": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pk2f1c/horrors_of_student_living/hc0l6au/", "text": "Thank you u/r-e-w-13 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
