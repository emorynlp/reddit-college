I never made a 100% on any of the writing assignments always just 90s or 95s because there would be one APA requirement I would miss.\n\nNothing on the rubric referenced whether or not the question needed to be correct. Never got feedback on if the content I was writing was right. Just length requirements, responding to peers, and APA requirements.\n\nIt was easy after I got the hang of it after the first assignment but it made me think I could write anything as long as it was long enough and APA compliant.
