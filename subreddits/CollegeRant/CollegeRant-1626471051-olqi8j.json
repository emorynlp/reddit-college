  "text": "So I\u2019m a transfer student from a CACC and I\u2019m planning on applying to UCSC (tag program) CSUSM, CSUN and Humboldt State (probably). But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to leave for college or if I\u2019m ready to deal with how lonely it does get in college. I don\u2019t have the gpa to stay in my city. I originally went to Portland State in 2017 but withdrew before the quarter ended because I did start using drugs and it let to a psychotic episode. I did manage to get sober. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to accept debt from university or if I\u2019m ready to deal with the fact that when I start there, I will have nobody. I don\u2019t really have an excellent support system in my city either but it\u2019s better because I\u2019m near family. I\u2019m scared of the idea of transferring and it just being crappy. I need some advice on what to do, what helped you and what I can do.",

      "text": "I think you should think of it as a new opportunity and an investment in yourself. Once you get that college degree it will pay for itself. Loans sound really daunting at first but if you get to pursue a career in what you passionate about it will pay for itself. You also never know who you\u2019re going to meet, so rise to the occasion and put yourself out there and you will meet potentially life long friends. Make sure you network because the people you meet in college can potentially help you land a job. I know I wasn\u2019t ready when I was 22-23 to transfer but you have to trust your gut and trust the process.",
