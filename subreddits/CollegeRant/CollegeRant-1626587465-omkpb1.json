Just finished biology 2 online course last week, it was great. Like the material and the prof, and got good grades. No complaints there. BUT NOW I am taking general chemistry 2. I tried to take it spring 2020 but dropped it when we got sent home for covid. Except now I have to take it again over the summer because it\u2019s a requirement. I HATE chemistry. I already failed the first quiz and I have no idea how I can get at least a C in the class so it\u2019ll count as credit. I\u2019ll be so mad if this ends up being a waste of money and time. It\u2019s just misery in every sense of the word for the next month for me. I\u2019m trying my best but I don\u2019t know if I can do this.", "author": "toastedmeat_", "created": 1626587465, "retrieved": 1632841759, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h5lmvqq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/omkpb1/how_to_survive_a_summer_class_that_i_hate/h5lmvqq/", "text": "Thank you u/toastedmeat_ for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I thought it was harder then 1 due to how much more math intensive it is. I can\u2019t imagine taking it during summer instead of the normal 16 weeks. Organic chemistry tutor has amazing videos on Gen chem 2. You can do this!! That class is a hell of a chore and I had to study hours upon hours to figure it out. Also most Gen Chems end with nuclear chemistry and that is probably the easiest chem unit you\u2019ll ever take unless you\u2019re taking Ochem. Without nuclear chem at the end I probably would have gotten a B.

If you\u2019re in in-person classes, just ask the prof for help and they\u2019ll be partial to kick your grade up a little, just trust me on that", "author": "newmuffins1216", "created": 1626601310, "upvotes": 1}}}
