Failing a test or doing badly for an assignment despite your best efforts is brutal.\n\nI'm also a little stressed because I never treated my studies seriously since Elementary School (got by barely on smarts/practice questions), so when I attempt to put in effort right now it feels like a mountain of work.\n\nI'm disassociated, struggling with some of the content, struggling with the tests, not to mention I had a fucking panic attack when I was presenting. To top it all off my high school bully is in the same course and classes as I am and it's just been terrible.\n\nI just really don't know... I remember reading posts elsewhere on Quora (entitled successful people place) and some Reddit posts saying that if you're struggling you're not meant for college and you deserve to work at Macs flipping burgers >\\_>\n\nAm I really that hopeless? I don't want to drop out. I want a comfortable job that can pay my bills and more.", "author": "Fairpawse", "created": 1630744331, "retrieved": 1632948940, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbs4jjs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/phnson/am_i_just_not_meant_for_college/hbs4jjs/", "text": "I'm currently in my fourth year of computing science and your anxiety is perfectly valid. I know the existential dread of not being the smart kid anymore *very* well, and it's fucking awful. I never learned proper study habits or academic discipline and completely fucked my GPA in my first year because I could coast on my reading and writing abilities in high school. I was very depressed and ready to drop out by the end of my first year.\n\nUnfortunately, the fact of the matter is you need to study, and you need to do it better. What that \"better\" means really depends on your learning style. Personally, I use the DiMaio reading method to create a mental outline of my material, and then make notes on the readings and annotate them. However, that's how **I** study based on years of trial and error and study. I'm not going to tell you exactly how to study because it may not even work for you. All I'm going to offer is universal advice for all learning styles:\n\n1) Have a \"study space\". For me, it's this spot on campus that's very quiet and isolated, especially in the evenings when I prefer to study. For you, it may be a corner of the library or a booth in a nearby cafe. Any distraction-free, relatively quiet space that your brain can *always* associate with studying is a good candidate.\n\n2) Use headphones, even if only for noise reduction. As a bonus, people generally don't bother you as much wearing headphones to study vs not (that's entirely anecdotal though). Listen to music that you ONLY use when studying (albums or playlists) or stuff you don't necessarily know. Whichever you choose, don't use anything with a beat or anything with vocals. Personally, I layer rain, a fireplace, and \"space ambient\" music and stash them on a separate desktop. Happy to link all three if you'd like.\n\n3) Unless you can honestly say you'll be more productive with someone else doing the same material, study alone. I'm way more likely to fuck around and make a three-hour session take five with a friend.\n\n4) Have small snacky things that won't dirty your hands like cereal (something with big pieces), veggies, granola bars. Unless you're pulling an all-nighter, you do NOT want to be hungry while studying because it's very distracting. Gum is also great if you're dieting or just don't want to constantly snack.\n\n5) TURN OFF YOUR DAMN PHONE. Put the little bastard away and on Do Not Disturb. If you can even see it, it'll tank your productivity. Let your friends know you're going to study and they shouldn't bug you unless it's serious.\n\n6) Drink lots of water. It's good for you. That's all. But make sure it's a reusable bottle because fuck Nestle.\n\n7) Take frequent breaks. Try working for 25 minutes and breaking for five. From there figure out the intervals that work for you. Obviously, this one is flexible if you get on a roll and don't want to lose your train of thought, but keep it as a guidline.\n\n8) If necessary, use a productivity tool to block time-wasting sites. I started using Forest last semester to block Reddit, YouTube, and other time-wasters for a set amount of time. imo the premium version is completely worth it, think it was only like $5 CAD.\n\n9) Your mileage with this may vary, but I like to meditate for about five minutes before I get started. It's nothing serious, I just try to keep my mind as blank as possible. Alan Watts has an excellent video to guide you through your first few tries.\n\n10) Regarding being \"not meant\" for college, you might find some comfort in Howard Gardner's Frames of Mind. Dr. Gardner popularized multiple intelligence theory in the 1980s, and reading it for an education class was life-changing for me. It's a bit of a challenging read since he has a PhD but it's worth it.\n\nThis isn't related to studying specifically but **go to therapy**. It's probably free at your school. Not only is it beneficial for *anyone*, but it'll also help rule out any mental illness or learning disability that may be complicating things. Believe me, you do not want to piss away three years of school and graduate late because of undiagnosed issues that you could've gotten help and accommodations for. Not to mention sparing yourself potential *years* of constant suffering.\n\nHope this helps.

Lots of people struggle to adjust to the workload, especially if they are dealing with a heavy course load. It's possible you might do better by reducing the number of classes you're taking. I'm not sure what your study habits are but finding the study methods that work for you is a challenge. \n\nTime management is key to getting through college. There's constant deadlines so I'd recommend, if you aren't already, creating a schedule for yourself to keep on track. Fitting studying in on top of course work is something I'm still figuring out so don't feel bad. \n\nTry reaching out to your professors if you're struggling with the material. It's their job to help you understand the concepts. If your school has tutors, try working with one to see if it helps. Study groups might work help. I'd also recommend seeing a counselor if you can.\n\nCollege isn't about talent. A large part of doing well in college is time management and knowing your limits. Some people struggle with 4 classes and others easily take 6. It's about finding what works for you. \n\nNot sure if this was helpful.
