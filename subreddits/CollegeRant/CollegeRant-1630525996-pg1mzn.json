  "text": "yo honestly screw any UPD! They give out parking tickets but they forget to realize we already pay what, 15k/SEMESTER to GO TO CLASSES?! I literally come back to my dorm late at night and don\u2019t see the \u2018sign\u2019 for a staff parking at night, mind you, I\u2019m extremely farsighted; when majority of that lot is student, so I think I\u2019m able to park wherever!! :((\n\nAnd not only that, they ticketed me twice! I only paid the first one that was issued, so why should I pay the second one that was given THE NEXT DAY?! I don\u2019t get it! I\u2019m a resident, so I barely visit my car!! I hate this!\n\nTLDR; campus parking should be free.",
