  "text": "My mental health is currently at the lowest it\u2019s ever been. I\u2019m in my room all day and can\u2019t find motivation to leave my bed. Also, I cannot afford to finish this semester. I lost my scholarship and have to pay 5 grand out of pocket. I have about 25k in student loans but I think I can make the monthly payment. I don\u2019t know what I want to do, I have no friends and literally cannot socialize with other people. I think dropping out might be the best option",

      "text": "Have you considered just taking a single class or maybe two at a time? It's much harder to get back into school once you leave but this should cut down on your costs and overall stress. This way you won't have to start paying the student loans yet. It's also better to make those monthly payments once you have a degree behind you. You'll statistically get a higher paying job. And do you feel that it's better being thousands in debt and have earned a degree from it or do you feel that you'll regret that decision in a few years? It's getting harder and harder to make a decent living without a degree and you'll have debts to pay off right away. It's hard right now, but there are ways you can make it better. Good luck!",
