I got caught in one subject and I will receive a failing grade for the class. I am stupid for cheating. Although I posted just to compare my own answers and with no intent of just copying, I still made a huge mistake by posting it. Stupid for using Chegg thinking that its okay because everyone else in the batch seems to post there too. I have no excuse, I am dumb. And its scary to think that if I was not caught, I\u2019d probably think of this lightly and might continue doing this for the next semesters. So I\u2019m glad I got caught but at the same time so afraid of the consequence I might face.\n\nI was academically honest the whole time before that semester.. My friends from high school to college can attest to that. But now, that doesn't matter. I feel like because I cheated that semester, I feel like all my hard work from the previous years and from now onwards is invalid, that no one will ever believe in me, that people would not recognize my efforts for the good grades that I have because I cheated at some point in my life. I am so ashamed and I know this a consequence I must face because I cheated.\n\nI want to hide from embarrassment. I want to transfer school and even want to stop studying for a while to reassess my values in life. Because I don\u2019t think I can continue.. I am so ashamed of myself. I don\u2019t know what to do. I already have grades for the two subjects I wasn't caught, but should I admit to my two professors that I posted in chegg?", "author": "Individual-Ad-2274", "created": 1628932873, "retrieved": 1632841630, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h8w50ij": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p44ve9/i_hate_myself_for_cheating/h8w50ij/", "text": "Thank you u/Individual-Ad-2274 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First of all, it's clear you are feeling very guilty and ashamed. You understanding what you did is considered \"wrong\" in the academic community. You're beating yourself up which may be clouding your thoughts and not helping you move forward.\n\nYou cheated. And you claim that fact. I think you're focused so much on the fact you cheated that you're not asking yourself the big question: why did you cheat? The reason why is, imo, a lot more important than the fact you did it. You said you'd always had academic integrity previously. Did you cheat because of parental pressure? Or are school and grades important to you personally? Was it because of mental health and stress around Covid and online learning? What did you fear would happen if you did flunk? Was it financial pressure (are you putting yourself through school and have $X amount to finish) or parental pressure? Is it pressure to be successful by society/classmates/professors or because you love what you're learning and want to succeed for yourself?\n\nTo sum it up: what were you afraid of happening if you failed?\n\nAfter considering the reason behind it, could this have been avoided? By taking less courses? By studying more? Were you struggling because you were overwhelmed with the material and didn't understand it regardless of how much you studied? Or were you struggling because you spent time doing things other than studying, like partying or hanging out with friends, when you should have been studying?\n\nAlso, what was different this year than in previous years? Heavier course load? New romantic partner? A move? Loss of a job, a friend, loss of motivation? Simply just the change to online learning? Lack of a peer support group?\n\nTry not to have too much self-judgement when asking yourself these questions and try to use neutral language.\n\nSecond, why are you feeling shame and embarrassment? Is it external (i.e. my professors will look down on me, my classmates/friends will judge me, I may suffer repercussions) or internal (i.e. I'm smarter than that, I personally value academic integrity because it is important to me, it's important to me to get good grades the honest way).\n\nFinally, are your embarrassment and reasons for cheating similar? For instance, did you feel incapable of learning the material no matter how much you studied, so your confidence in your capabilities dropped, which was a blow to your self confidence because you love what you're studying? Or did you cheat because your parents are putting pressure on you to finish your degree, when you would have preferred to take the year off or study something else entirely, so you spent time with friends and procrastinated on studying? Were you overwhelmed with mental health/exhaustion because of Covid/online learning?\n\nJust my thoughts :)\n\nI think looking at it objectively, instead of punishing and hating yourself, may help you move through it, take steps to prevent it from happening in the future, and move forward. Best of luck!
