  "title:": "Does anyone else feel like some professors' teachings are just outdated?",
  "text": "I've been in college for four years now and I'm set to graduate by the end of this year. Having taken a bunch of professors, I noticed that many of these classes involve the same thing:\n\n\\-having a required textbook where required reading comes from (and it's expensive)\n\n\\-doing discussion posts and making students reply to them in a certain amount of words\n\n\\-requiring students to attend lectures, read the book, and watch online lectures, despite all covering the exact same material\n\n\\-doing online quizzes but the time limit to take it is so short, students practically have to have memorized facts to just scrape by it\n\nAnd so many more I probably can't think of (because it's nearly 4 AM right now but I feel compelled to get these thoughts out). It just feels so old, like I should've gotten past this kind of learning. This is amplified by the fact that I've taken professors who don't do any of this stuff and just taught what they loved. Even better, some of them would have open note quizzes, because they know students are not machines whose sole purpose is to memorize facts. And it's so weird because **I seem to learn more from professors who don't require a textbook than from professors who do.**\n\nNow, I can sympathize with professors because I know they have lives outside of teaching, and a lot of their work with the university is research-based. At the same time, however, I wish they would take time in their day to put together a good curriculum that doesn't require them to say \"turn to page 575.\"\n\nI'm hoping more professors ditch these kinds of outdated methods for teaching and actually engage in the students. Maybe then, they can get excited and not see the class as an obstacle.  \n\n\nTL:DR- teachers need to make class not so monotonous ",

      "text": "Ideally, textbooks are chosen because they provide deep detail and put information in overall context. Lectures, in person or online, spotlight key concepts -- like a Cliff's Notes version. Online discussion prompts force students to synthesize the information, and prepare them for in-class discussion.\n\nI've taught with and without a textbook. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Using a textbook locks you in to that author's program. It can be very expensive -- and if the prof only uses part of the book, students (justifiably) feel like they're paying for things they don't use. But going without a textbook may mean cobbling together a variety of materials, which don't necessarily work together, and don't provide a comprehensive picture.\n\nIt's natural, I think, that college professors, as a whole, would tend to be less open to innovation and exploration of alternative methods than K-12 teachers. Broadly speaking, professors are much more likely to become professors because of their interest in a subject, while K-12 teachers are more likely to take those jobs because of their interest in teaching. That's a huge generalization, with a lot of exceptions, of course.",

The first stage is you first week as a teacher where your optimistic and still hopeful that you kids will listen to you and everything will be dandy\n\nThe second stage is called survival, and we learn that this is the stage a lot of teachers stay at. These are the teachers that assign busy work and make you study all of the time and basically don\u2019t do much to further your education. We learn this is fine for the first year or so as a teacher so you can get the hang of a teaching but after that you supposed to move on, but most teachers don\u2019t. We also learn that these are the teacher that end up hating their job because theres no excitement in assignments. It\u2019s the same thing over and over.\n\nAs for the last two stages, these are the teachers that are growing and learning how to be a good teacher. They are the teachers that are able to make assignments interesting and exciting while also allowing you to learn along the way!",

      "text": "College is outdated in its entirety. From what I can tell, every education system uses primitive and idiotic teaching methods for almost every concept. On top of that, professors are generally not the type of person you want to teach you these things because they are normally a person who failed in the actual workforce and are now a professor who does minimal work by comparison. There is also the problem of majors that exist only to produce more professors to teach that major, thus creating a stupid false workplace in which people squat on to make money while having little to no actual useful knowledge/skill.\n\nI dropped out of college to work full time as a software developer. College is run by idiots 99% of the time, just like almost everything else in our sad, idiotic, reality.",

When you can just google a bunch of thermodynamic relations or matlab methods, it\u2019s easy to forget about classes like one of my grad requirements in history, where the professor\u2019s lectures were narrative enough in their quality and detailed in their information that I was super entertained learning a lot! Unfortunately, academic culture is super gatekeep-y, so being able to teach yourself isn\u2019t broadly sustainable for an entire education, but I\u2019d love to see more doors opened about that",
