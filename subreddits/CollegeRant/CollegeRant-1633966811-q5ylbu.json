  "text": "\ni feel like a failure. my grades are terrible. my parents make me feel like crap, and their expectations are too high; they expect me to do work all of the time. i feel like college is weighing me down mentally.\n\ni\u2019ve always been bad at school. when i was a little kid, i had several issues, and i still struggle today. in high school, i had low SAT/ACT/GPA marks. i was always lost in class, no matter how easy the subject was. i honestly don\u2019t know how i graduated from high school.\n\ni can\u2019t memorize anything, and i don\u2019t know how to study. i get distracted by everything and anything. \n\ni want to dropout, but i\u2019m afraid to tell my parents. i\u2019m considering trade school, but i don\u2019t want to say anything until i have a plan. i\u2019m in community college, so at least i have no debt.\n\ni feel alone, i need someone.",

      "text": "I\u2019m going to risk sounding like the old out of touch prof I suspect I sometimes am.  If this is your first year either in person or online it\u2019s a tough adjustment so cut yourself some slack. When I teach Gen Ed courses I share with my students that I almost failed out my first semester since there are so many spoken and unspoken rules to learn, not to mention each professor teaches differently depending on subject.  What finally helped me was taking a 1-credit \u201chow to study\u201d course if your CC offers one.  You mentioned getting distracted in your post.  You might consider looking into getting evaluated for ADHD through your college\u2019s health service (it may fall under counseling services as well).  Don\u2019t give up on yourself yet!\n\nEdited to add:  there should be quite a few resources at your college to help with tutoring, time management, etc.  Search your college\u2019s website for these things and see what pops up.\n\nTL;DR\u2014Don\u2019t give in yet!  I\u2019ve been you.",

      "text": "Hey, I just want to say you are doing great. I know you feel like a failure, but I can tell that you care a lot and you want to succeed. You are very much not a failure and you are worth so much more than your standardized test scores.\n\nI personally have never been a great student either. In High School, I failed so many classes and I am currently in a similar situation to you.\n\nI know it might not seem very genuine coming from a complete stranger over the internet, but you are very much not alone.\n\nSchool is hard! You have every right to feel the way that you do.\n\nI know being open with your parents can be difficult, and I do not know what your relationship with your parents is like, but if you have a decent relationship with them, I think you should try to be open with them and tell them you are unsure if college is the right thing for you. They might be able to help you figure out another option you could consider.\n\nBut, yeah. \n\nI feel like, for a lot of people growing up in this generation, the idea of going to college is pretty much shoved down our throats. But, there are so many things that you can still do without a college education.\n\nAnd, if not college, trade school sounds like a great option to consider.\n\nPlease try not to feel pressured about continuing school if it is something you really don't want to do. \n\nDon't be discouraged; you have so much potential and I believe in you.\n\nGood luck with everything!\n\n<3",
