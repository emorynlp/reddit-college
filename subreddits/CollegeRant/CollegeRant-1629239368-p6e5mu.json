You can actually reduce your loan if you don\u2019t feel like you need that much extra. Ideally, you get a loan that covers tuition, housing, and whatever other school supplies you may need. They do send you a check with your extra balance each semester. The total of that will change each year though most likely (it\u2019s simply your approved FAFSA student aid minus the tuition- there will be a billing page on your school website that will have a breakdown somewhere). Like others have said, I\u2019d keep the extra for emergencies and things you may need. I used a lot of mine for gas when I was commuting. The next year I used a good chunk of it to get a new computer for both school and home use. This year I\u2019m having to get dorm supplies and keeping a good chunk of it in case I have any car problems since I have a long drive multiple times a week. It\u2019s not free money, this is all going to be owed back plus interest after you\u2019re done with school.", "author": "XxNHLxX", "created": 1629302479, "upvotes": 2}, "h9dm3rg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6e5mu/im_getting_my_financial_aid_check_dispersed_what/h9dm3rg/", "text": "Every semester you will get one lump sum of your aid package. If your aid covers your tuition and there is still some leftover after that balance is paid, one check (or deposit if you have direct deposit) will be given to you with the remaining amount. You can spend it on whatever you want. Generally, I use mine to pay for things like rent or parking. The money won't drop until a few weeks in to each semester because they need to confirm your attendance. One of the reasons your professors are absolutely mandated to take attendance for the first few classes is because they have to report to the school that you showed up before they will give you aid.\n\nI do not advise using this money on things like video games and non school stuff. You're taking out thousands of dollars of loans for your education and you should put it towards that, like buying your books or if you need a parking pass. Or save it for an emergency.\n\nTo check on how much you will be getting in financial aid, you can generally look it up in whatever your school's dashboard for the bursar/registrar/financial aid stuff is.
