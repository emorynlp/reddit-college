The next time our class met (yesterday) he said, out loud,\n\n\"If you email me, please start your email with my name and title. It's disrespectful if you don't do that.\"\n\nI feel like he snubbed me over email because I didn't use his name. I just want feedback on my paper so I can write a good final draft.\n\nEdit: Sent an email using the pointless introductory formalism that includes the name of the professor asking if there is somehow an error on my part in regards to my lack of a grade. I'm dreading a response that just asks to see me in person (they've done it before) or some other variant of that. I sure wish I didn't have to wait this long. Oh fun fact, my college has a very helpful end-of-course survey that we have to take following each term. I don't want to be mean, but I will certainly be including this delayed grading and email-dodging stuff.\n\n**FINAL EDIT**: Got a 90 on it. It turns out that the professor thought my previous email was in reference to another assignment that I sort of half-assed. He interpreted my email as begging for a better grade or something, but everything is cleared up. He apologized for the late grade. I could very easily ask for an extension, but I want to try to see if I can pump out a high A in 5 days.", "author": "SomeNumbers98", "created": 1625650914, "retrieved": 1632950845, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h4dtwhi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/offmtg/the_final_draft_of_an_essay_i_have_to_write_is/h4dtwhi/", "text": "Go to office hours, it's much harder for most profs to be complete dicks 1 on 1.", "author": "coastalpillar", "created": 1625683461, "upvotes": 3}, "h4cz6ne": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/offmtg/the_final_draft_of_an_essay_i_have_to_write_is/h4cz6ne/", "text": "Email him again with \"proper etiquette\" and say \"per my last e-mail, I still have not received feedback for my rough draft.
