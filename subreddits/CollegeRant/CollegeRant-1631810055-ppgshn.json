She's brand new to our university but has been teaching for 20 years. First day of class, there was no Canvas page. No information on the class at all. The Canvas page pops up the next day thankfully, but it's blank. I gave her the benefit of the doubt because she is used to BlackBoard. \n\nThe first assignment she gives out is a reflection paper. I finish the paper quickly after receiving the prompt and then a few days later, she changes it. So I now have to rewrite my essay which was fine. Sure. This professor also likes to start class late and cancel it a lot. She's canceled class for the past few Thursdays so we can have a library day. She also teaches a few other classes and I've heard she cancels those as well sometimes and I'm beginning to think she doesn't want to teach. Additionally, she constantly makes typos in her emails and announcements.\n\nWhen she does hold lectures, they're very awkward and uncomfortable. We're in a big lecture hall with a class that has about 200 people in it. She asks a question and we sit in silence until someone answers or she decodes to move on. Her slides she shows in class have very minimal information on them as well. However, she does upload the slides that are from the textbook along with lecture notes that are also from the book which are very detailed. I don't understand why she just doesn't use the slides that are from the book instead because that is what she said the exams are over. She also treats us like children sometimes. This is a class about child development, so we talk a lot about how parents raise their children except when she talks about parents, she doesn't say mother and father or mom and dad... she says mommy and daddy. Like we are in elementary school. She also asks very odd questions like \"do y'all know what a rattle is?\" or \"do y'all watch TV?\" and the class just stares at her.\n\nTuesday's lecture in particular was the most infuriating one to attend. She was discussing autism and ADHD and such in the weirdest way. She said autism isn't something you are born with but it's something you develop which is not true at all and used the terms high-functioning and low-functioning which, as an person with autism, I found to be abelist and rude. \n\nWe have another reflection paper coming up with a very similar prompt to the first one. I will also note that she has a doctoral degree. I don't feel like I've learned anything and I'm seriously thinking about taking this professor to our school's dean of students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Professor who is new to our university who has been teaching for 20 years has not taught me much in terms of material and has made abelist comments and I'm wondering if taking her to the dean of students is the right thing to do this early in the semester.", "author": "Altruistic_Concert66", "created": 1631810055, "retrieved": 1632841036, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"hd3i2sf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppgshn/a_problem_with_a_professor/hd3i2sf/", "text": "Thank you u/Altruistic_Concert66 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a professor, I\u2019ll offer my two cents\u2019 worth.\n\nIf someone cancels class a lot, and if assignments get changed after being given out (and you are specifically told that you have to redo it if you already did it), then that\u2019s a problem. However, you should not involve the dean of students. The dean of students usually handles issues of student conduct and can advocate for students to faculty on a variety of issues, but they have no involvement with how courses are run. You may be thinking of the academic dean of the given college that hosts the course. However, the person you would want to consider speaking to is the department chair, not the dean.\n\nSecond, many of the other things you mentioned are not grounds for a complaint. Not having detailed slides or using infantilizing language might be annoying, but she\u2019s within bounds. On the former, students are expected to take notes (slides are not intended to be reading materials). On the latter, it would be an issue if she uses problematic language (for that, I would suggest talking to her directly about it).\n\nAs for asking questions that no one answers, that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s her way of trying to get people to discuss. If the class sits in silence, then that\u2019s not necessarily her fault - she is trying to make it a two-way street and not just \u201ctalk to\u201d the class the whole time.\n\nGood luck with everything!!", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1631812243, "upvotes": 7}}}
