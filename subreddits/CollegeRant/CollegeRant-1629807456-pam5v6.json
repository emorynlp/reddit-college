  "text": "So as a background, I study premed . I, along with other students couldn't do a subject due to the pandemic. This subject is really important and if not completed wouldn't let us be interns. My group always tried to contact the professors for any options/ alternatives we could complete this subject, but they were always radio silent only to announce 3 mos. before enrollment that an alternative was created and that we were supposed to complete. Now a lot of students took this option(old and new) as someone who is from the **old curriculum we were only allowed to finish this subject before school starts while the new curriculum students were allowed to finish as long as it didn't hinder their graduation**. \n\nWE DID NOT FINISH IT. \n\nIt took a bit of groveling to the prof and they relented to have an extension of deadline. Now let's just say the profs have a bit mood swings and one of the student got fed up with their attitude decided to just fuck it. **They pointed out how unfair the treatment the old curriculum students** and shit hits the fan. The profs called for a meeting to berate us were just very angry at that point. Emotions were high some of the students were trying to calm the profs. In the end were allowed to enroll but when it was my turn and decided to  send the required docs, I was scolded. At this point, I knew enough to just be silent and apologize every time. The problem is that I did not attend because they moved the sched. to a different time. \n\nI JUST FUCKING FEEL SO DAMN EXHAUSTED WITH THEIR HOLIER THAN THOU ATTITUDE. MY FUCKING GHAWD. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THEIR DAMN OPINIONS WHAT SHOULD WE DO. THEY JUST STAY SILENT. WE AIN'T FUCKING CHOPED LIVER HERE. AS STUDENTS WHO WANT TO FINISH AND JUST GRADUATE WE ARE DOING OUR BEST. I KNOW THAT THE PROFS ARE STRESSED AND WE MAKE SURE TO BE POLITE WHENEVER WE CHAT THEM. BUT WE ARE IN A FUCKING PANDEMIC, YOU CANT JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE TO ADJUST , THIS **\"NEW NORMAL\"  WILL NEVER BE NORMAL**.",
