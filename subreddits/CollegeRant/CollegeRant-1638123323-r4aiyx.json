  "text": "So for all my life I have adored science of any kind but as I got older I have become more attached to astrophysics and physics in general, so when I got to college it really was a no brainer for me to major in physics now I wasn\u2019t in love with the idea of physics I was actually in love with it the complicated mathematics behind it all and the intricate theories and ideas that people can\u2019t wrap there head around, I thrived in that environment I adored physics and up until last year or a little before that my passion and love for it just faded now this is where most people would say just change your major but I really don\u2019t want to I have adored something for all my life and now all of a sudden sense my body can\u2019t muster up the emotion it use to give me I should just drop it, it would be like killing a part of me that I use to love and thrive in I just don\u2019t know what to do any help or suggestions",

      "text": "This happens to a lot of people! If you\u2019re really not vibing with it and it\u2019s making you miserable, it may be a good idea to switch majors. Or, you can stick it out. When you work in the future just because you have a degree in physics doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to do something related to physics. Most people don\u2019t end up working in what they majored in. I totally get feeling like you\u2019re losing a part of yourself, that happened to me when I completely dropped music even though I spent majority of my life focusing on it. Sometimes I look back and I miss what I used to do, but I\u2019m honestly happier that I changed paths and started doing something new. It\u2019s tough to make such big changes, but sometimes it\u2019s really worth it. Ultimately, you just have to do what\u2019s best for you in the long run",

Last week I had a depressive episode and took the entire time off, even if that meant sacrificing a bit of my grade. My sister told me that it's okay to switch my major, but I'm so attached to the subject that I can't imagine myself anywhere else. I feel like I still love math and astronomy, but I've just been in a two-year-long rut.\n\nI feel like my habits went awry during that period. I got addicted to social media after a few years of hating on the kids who did (lol). I'm no longer physically active in any way shape or form. I feel stuck in my house all the time.\n\nIt's burnout. We need a break. \n\nI think I'm going to major in math and minor in astronomy/astrophysics (not sure which is offered here), or vice versa. I just need to take several months to sort my life out. That's why I'm committing myself to doing absolutely nothing during J-term.",
