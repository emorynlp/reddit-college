One of them was bent by the postal worker who stuffed it into my mail box. Secondly, it's literally just a simple piece of paper (though I'm not 100% surprised, but just expecting more since my high school diploma is a really nice faux leather bound one). Third, it doesn't even fit the diploma \"cover\" they gave me at graduation!!!!! I say \"cover\" because it's literally a folded piece of paper with my college's name on it. I am very disappointed, and obviously there's nothing I can do about it, but I wanted to rant a bit.", "author": "babyblue924", "created": 1625782863, "retrieved": 1632841799, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 133, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4ixbkb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oghxyy/after_four_years_my_paper_diploma_doesnt_even_fit/h4ixbkb/", "text": "Thank you u/babyblue924 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
