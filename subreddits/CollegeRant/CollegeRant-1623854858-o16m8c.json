  "title:": "Struggling a lot because of my ADHD.",
  "text": "I was a \"GT\" kid who breezed through elementary and most of middle school. Struggled a lot in high school and got diagnosed with ADHD at 15. Started taking medication and it saved my GPA. Stopped taking medication after I graduated (save a couple years) because I couldn't afford it. I'm 30 now and going to college for the first time. I don't know why I convinced myself that I would be able to work through this without medication. I'm really struggling. I'm three weeks into the semester and it's like pulling teeth to get my work done on time and I feel like I'm not retaining any information. I have no insurance, no income. My school doesn't offer cheap student health insurance, a clinic, or anything like that. I don't qualify for medicaid because Texas sucks. I'm stuck. There is no way I can take on a job on top of school because I'm already drowning. I wanted to improve myself and my chances of a better life/job/future by going to college, but I don't know how I'm ever going to get through it. \n\nI scheduled an appointment with a mental health counselor at school but it's not like they can really do anything except listen to me complain. The whole system is so unfair. Why do I feel like I'm being punished for trying to be better? I'm at a loss because I really want to succeed but I just don't see that as a possibility unless I am able to get medication somehow.",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat. This is going to be harsh but its the truth...You don't know how to study.I never did any studying in hs besides maybe skimming the text but that won't fly in college. Research specific study methods and find some that work for you. I've also found it helpful to time exactly how much I studied or did hw ect for a certain class. Often it's less than it feels like.",
