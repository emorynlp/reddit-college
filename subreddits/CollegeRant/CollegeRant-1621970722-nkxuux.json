  "text": "I just completed my sophomore semester for my Computer Science Major about 2 weeks ago, and it was a rough one, but I managed to do relatively well. It was online of course and I just feel burnt out as hell. My school extended the winter break and got rid of spring break to \"reduce the spread of covid\". I basically worked my ass off for the past 4 months either doing school or work 6 out of the 7 days of the week. The only day I had off from school and work was on Saturday. I finally get done my semester, I take a week off from work and I just felt like a lazy bum. My mom pushed me to work when I just didn't feel like doing anything after that week I just had off. I literally don't feel like doing a single thing anymore besides just sitting in my room. I just feel so burnt out from everything. I am also taking a summer course so I don't fall behind starting in July and then I go back to school in August taking about 20 credits where I have 8 AM classes 4 out of my 5 days. I know that its manageable and that I can do it, but I am just tired, frustrated, and I just want to graduate already.",

      "text": "OP I feel this in my soul. Going into college I got a scholarship that would only extend for only 3 of my 4 years. So I pushed myself to overload on classes and finish my 4 year program in 3 years. Between classes, internships, fellowships, working, clubs, and a TA position I was fucking exhausted every day for the last three years. \n\nI graduated two weeks ago and I just feel so....empty. Like what do people do with free time? I genuinely don\u2019t remember. \n\nTake breaks when you can and hang in there. You\u2019ve got this.",

          "text": "Dropout so my words might be meaningless. \n\nI read that people who finally got into cushy high paying also had to work hard. But also take conscious recovery breaks where you treat yourself because mentally the hard work wears down people's psyche and all that mental mentality stuff. \n\nWork is work and free time and play is actually essential to your health because otherwise why do people feel so shitty with no breaks? Feels like life itself is trying to tell people something. If we feel bad something is obviously wrong. It's a mental balance of purpose, fulfillment and self care.",
