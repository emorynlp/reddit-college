It was online of course and I just feel burnt out as hell. My school extended the winter break and got rid of spring break to \"reduce the spread of covid\". I basically worked my ass off for the past 4 months either doing school or work 6 out of the 7 days of the week. The only day I had off from school and work was on Saturday. I finally get done my semester, I take a week off from work and I just felt like a lazy bum. My mom pushed me to work when I just didn't feel like doing anything after that week I just had off. I literally don't feel like doing a single thing anymore besides just sitting in my room. I just feel so burnt out from everything. I am also taking a summer course so I don't fall behind starting in July and then I go back to school in August taking about 20 credits where I have 8 AM classes 4 out of my 5 days. I know that its manageable and that I can do it, but I am just tired, frustrated, and I just want to graduate already.", "author": "Hess20", "created": 1621970722, "retrieved": 1632949790, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzfevta": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nkxuux/i_feel_like_i_never_get_breaks/gzfevta/", "text": "OP I feel this in my soul. Going into college I got a scholarship that would only extend for only 3 of my 4 years. So I pushed myself to overload on classes and finish my 4 year program in 3 years. Between classes, internships, fellowships, working, clubs, and a TA position I was fucking exhausted every day for the last three years. \n\nI graduated two weeks ago and I just feel so....empty. Like what do people do with free time? I genuinely don\u2019t remember. \n\nTake breaks when you can and hang in there. You\u2019ve got this.", "author": "HighlyPolitical16", "created": 1621971124, "upvotes": 9}}}
