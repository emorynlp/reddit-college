So I am pissed off that I basically didn't do well and shell-out some money for nothing. And they're going to be mad that they wasted \"their\" money, when in fact I paid for the classes, so it's gonna be a lot of back and forth problems.", "author": "aspiringwanderer03", "created": 1594699371, "retrieved": 1632951631, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"fy3wfpm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hquin8/lost_motivation_and_feel_like_i_wasted_money_this/fy3wfpm/", "text": "Hey, don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s still time to do well. There\u2019s still next semester. Seriously, don\u2019t dwell on it. It\u2019ll pass and you won\u2019t even think about in a couple of years. \n\nI remember when I was in second year of undergrad, I got an A (yeah, an A) in the first part of organic chem and I thought that was the end of the line for me because all of the other pre-meds got A+\u2019s. I thought I\u2019d never get into medical school and that I\u2019d amount to nothing. I swear to god I thought about committing suicide (yeah, I needed to chill). Well, I retook the course and got that A+ and today, I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m an MS1 (first-year med student). Suffice it to say, I don\u2019t think about that little failure of mine anymore.

It\u2019s such a messed up situation for schools & students & the world is literally f$cked up right now. As a parent & as a former college student, I feel horrible for you.\n\nMy suggestion is to yank the band aide off - but have A PLAN. Figure out how to get your degree & move on; especially if you\u2019re the one mainly footing the bill. \n\nI had 4 years to get a bachelors-after that, no more money. My step father was an asshole & when I failed one of my classes I dreaded having to tell my parents. But I went to them with my tail between my legs, told them the truth & that I had learned my lesson - blah blah. \n\nMy stepfather raged, yelled, acted like I had just murdered someone & now the entire family was going to jail. I let him scream, and in my head said eff you effer. I told them my plan to make up the class the following semester & to pay for it myself.\n\nI learned what my weaknesses were, that I had to knuckle down for a few weeks & was more motivated to get it done & on my own. \n\nPlease know you are normal, you are not alone in feeling unmotivated, you are a good person, and you can do this.", "author": "Karenena", "created": 1594759874, "upvotes": 9}}}
