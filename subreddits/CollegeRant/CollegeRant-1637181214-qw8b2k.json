  "text": "idk what i\u2019m doing with my life. my motivation has only been going downhill since october. i\u2019m in my sophomore year of college and i honestly wish that covid never happened. my motivation goes up every semester bc i feel like i get a chance at fixing my gpa lol but always end up losing motivation to go to class or hand in assignments after the first month or two. senior yr of highschool and freshman year of college was really bad i hate online school i can\u2019t focus and my sense of urgency and dedication to hw disappears. i have a cumulative gpa of 2.75 and less than 30 credits excluding this semester. it\u2019s funny because i also dread going back to in-person classes i have social anxiety lol. i\u2019ve been failing at least 1 class every semester so far and its honestly my own fault. my mom\u2019s been urging me to transfer since freshman year of college and honestly it\u2019s so annoying\u2026 i feel bad because she\u2019s paying for it but she won\u2019t let me take a gap semester or yr off. everyday she tells me to try harder study harder im sick of it. it doesn\u2019t help. i also made no friends so far and i ended up leaving this one club i joined (after getting a bit comfortable) bc my sister pretended to be a student and sent death threats on discord. im sick of everything. i don\u2019t have any close friends from highschool and all my friends from middle school r really busy with school and dating. we barely talk to each other and when we do it\u2019s about their relationships\u2026 i think im lonely. i have a part time job and get paid under minimum wage and the only other worker just quit earlier this month. i looked forward to meeting her everyday even tho she\u2019s 20 years older because she talks to me. the only reason why i have a job is bc i want money. i want to quit and volunteer at a shelter or something with a nice group of people. i want to be happy and content. i want to feel motivated again and be productive.",
