  "text": "I'm a Dean's list student. My GPA is a 3.9. I do not have it in me to sit through these three hour lectures two times a week when all I'm doing is watching a PowerPoint with a voiceover. It's not that I'm not interested in what I'm studying, it's just not engaging and I can't ask questions. I don't even know what my professor looks like. I'm so sick of this. My work is boring AF and it's still way better than school. Yesterday it took me all day to watch a 2.5 hour lecture. Anything is better than school right now, and that's coming from a guy that loves school. I have no motivation and I just can't force myself to get my school work done on time. This is the first time I'm running into this problem and it's not going well.\n\nTL;DR ya boy sick and tired of online college and is struggling to keep up.",

Now, I don\u2019t even have the energy or motivation to study for my calc test the day before and my grades are steadily slipping. I used to enjoy school to where I took 21 units last semester and now i\u2019m taking 19 and I\u2019m struggling so bad. It sucks because I feel so inadequate and such a failure because everyone I talk to seem to be doing so much during the pandemic- with taking a bunch of classes, getting research opportunities, internships, and I\u2019m just too freakin exhausted to even think about doing any of those things. I know I could take a break from school and have a leave of absence or something but what would I even do? The motivation just isn\u2019t there for me in anything anymore.",

And maybe I\u2019ll do better with on campus classes because I won\u2019t skip and I\u2019ll do my homework right away.",

My grades are equally as good as they were prior to covid. Your mileage may vary, depending on your learning style, ability to multitask, and the type of content covered in your lectures.",
