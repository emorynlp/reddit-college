  "title:": "My university can take their 10000 dollar summer tuition and shove it up their a**",
  "text": "All I want to do is take a few summer classes to make sure I graduate on time. Just two or three classes. Somehow those classes add up to over 10000 dollars! It would be fine if I had the same financial aid I had in the regular semester, but my university is only offering me a few thousand is leftover Pell grant money. No student loans, no scholarships, no extra grants.\n\nHow am I expected to pay the remaining 8000 dollars then? Oh it\u2019s easy, at least according to the financial aid office! I\u2019ll just take out a massive private loan. My parents can too! Then everybody wins! \n\nIt\u2019s so damn absurd. I\u2019m going to end up dipping into my savings and paying out of pocket. They literally don\u2019t give a crap if I\u2019m having to pay thousands myself or have to take out large loans. Why should they? They get the money either way.",

Universities don't make the funding rules, and a few hundred thousand dollars won't make or break a university - so they aren't rubbing their hands in delight. \n\nIn fact many universities are starting to be penalised if students take too long to complete. So they *want* you to take summer classes. \n\nOne thing you can do is shop around for cheaper alternatives to those classes. They might count summer classes from a community college or another university toward your degree, especially if they are electives.",
