You need to email it.\n\nMe: there not just bad links. All of these articles were taken down making them impossible to see. IT wouldn\u2019t be much help here since they wouldn\u2019t be able to access them either.\n\nHim: like I said this is a technical issue. All the time you\u2019ve wasted I could have been helping another student.\n\n\nAt this point I was pissed. I decided to try using the way back machine and luckily it worked but seriously professors that rely on technology need to be better.
