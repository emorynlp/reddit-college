  "text": "Just came back home after three months in college for Thankgiving break. I'm an only child so I guess my parents have been dealing with being Empty Nesters. The wrinkles on my dad's face and his hair becoming whiter. My mom had surgery two weeks ago and is still recovering, and I've never seen her look so old before. We used to joke that she looked more like my sister. But now she's slow and tired every time she moves and I realize that both my parents are around retirement age already. Even my sweet little dog that I've had since I was 5 looks so frail and tiny. I feel like just yesterday I was a little kid going to the waterpark and going on all the crazy rides with my parents. Everything just feels so weird. I don't think I'm ready for this :(\n\nTldr: came home from college and suddenly realizing the passage of time exists",

My oldest niece is in her junior year of college already. My second oldest niece just turned 16, and two seconds ago I remember all of us being kids and playing outside. You never realize how quickly time goes by until you see it yourself and it hits like a brick wall.",

My brother got married and has a kid, my sister got a promotion, my parents are growing old and now I'm ever more worried about my grandma's health.\n\nIt's just, everything's changing so fast and I'm not there for it. I probably won't even remember this moment by next year. It's so scary...",
