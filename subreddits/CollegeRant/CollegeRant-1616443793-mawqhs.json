  "title:": "I CANT WATCH THESE ANYMORE",
  "text": "I cannot watch another pre recorded lecture where the prof reads exactly what\u2019s on the slide. These shit ass pre-made PowerPoints from the textbook company are the WORST and do not teach me a single thing and the fact that the prof is so boring makes it even worse. It takes all of my strength to sit here for 2 hours and I still end up taking breaks every 2 minutes because my brain isn\u2019t picking up any information. I am so BORED!!!!!",
