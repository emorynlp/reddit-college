I pay $100 for an access code that has the book (which is what i use to learn the class) and homework/tests (which automatically grade themselves). Like seriously is the professor just there for shits and giggles?",

And none of them can help me. Kept getting transferred to different departments. What a fraud company. I don't even know if I could get a refund back on top of all of this.",

      "text": "I think back in my high school, they gave access codes to a program that honestly had no materials in it. Just folders that open to nothing. Aside from that, I studied where we had absolutely no course curriculum or text materials. Can it get worse? I still loved that school though, the ratio was smaller. \n\nOne thing I figured along the years was that, when you have a large student to teacher ratio, the more your professor suck or the less they can help you. And the smallest ratio you have, the more damn they give about you. And this way, you are a better student and you appreciate your teachers more. Honestly, it\u2019s less about the teacher\u2019s actual knowledge on the subject in teaching the student and more about being able to engage and support them through the process.\n\nAnd from this, I can deduce that 90% of all my professors I\u2019ve had have done absolutely shit to my life. Useless, as simple as it may sound. Not gonna blame them totally for it. Rather the strength of my classes being too large. So, were my professors at my undergraduate university with a strength of 40 in a class. Given that, there\u2019s just this one that completely changed my perspective on my course, despite online class dramas and what not. I hated this course I took btw. But, this one dude flipped my whole picture towards it. I still don\u2019t love it, but, I don\u2019t hate it either. And it happened likely because, again, small ratios. So, was my private tutor for Mathematics back in high school. Respect.\n\nSo, are teachers shit? Yes. Are they truly? Maybe not.",

This past semester, the online classes I had were structured extremely well.  No lectures or access codes, but the material was easily understood and the assignments and exams were based strictly on the material covered, and any reading outside of the textbook was provided by the profs for free.  Plus, I received timely and in-depth feedback on my assignments, so I could apply the critiques for the next one.  If only all online learning could be like this =.=\n\nI would be ok with access code type learning if the access codes included well-written content and testing methods that accounted for nuance in the answers.  Unfortunately, this has never been the case",

I\u2019ve used it more times than I care to count now and I still have trouble sometimes. The way it\u2019s set up is so weird as far as accessing your texts and homework. Maybe it\u2019s just the way I was taught/how my teachers post links and I also never took a ton of time to learn because I\u2019m used to just being able to figure shit out but I also feel like the interface/way it\u2019s set up is stupid and that\u2019s part of my issue. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s a giant fucking scam because they don\u2019t list what classes you need it for at my college so I end up just buying it per semester and paying an assload extra. The one time I paid for a longer subscription I didn\u2019t need it until the semester after it ran out. Even if you were a professor that taught like 3/4 courses that all used Cengage why wouldn\u2019t you put that in the syllabus? Like \u201cif you also plan on or need to take English 0001, 2023, 1052 or Sociology 1010 you\u2019ll need a cengage subscription so try to plan accordingly\u201d",

They would talk about 2 to 3 books a week in lecture, which they never asked questions for. They read the books on their own time. The end of the course was an exam with no review that tested their knowledge of the books and lectures. \n\nTechnically, I think professors are supposed to be curators and facilitators. They know what you need to absorb to learn the subject. It\u2019s your responsibility to absorb it. High school was like t-ball. College is like having to read the baseball rules and watch gameplay and practice hitting balls on your own time until you get good. \n\nGranted, some instructors are FAR more helpful than others, and take that role of mentor/facilitator much more seriously.",
