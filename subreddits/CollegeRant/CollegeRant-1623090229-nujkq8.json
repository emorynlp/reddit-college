Just folders that open to nothing. Aside from that, I studied where we had absolutely no course curriculum or text materials. Can it get worse? I still loved that school though, the ratio was smaller. \n\nOne thing I figured along the years was that, when you have a large student to teacher ratio, the more your professor suck or the less they can help you. And the smallest ratio you have, the more damn they give about you. And this way, you are a better student and you appreciate your teachers more. Honestly, it\u2019s less about the teacher\u2019s actual knowledge on the subject in teaching the student and more about being able to engage and support them through the process.\n\nAnd from this, I can deduce that 90% of all my professors I\u2019ve had have done absolutely shit to my life. Useless, as simple as it may sound. Not gonna blame them totally for it. Rather the strength of my classes being too large. So, were my professors at my undergraduate university with a strength of 40 in a class. Given that, there\u2019s just this one that completely changed my perspective on my course, despite online class dramas and what not. I hated this course I took btw. But, this one dude flipped my whole picture towards it. I still don\u2019t love it, but, I don\u2019t hate it either. And it happened likely because, again, small ratios. So, was my private tutor for Mathematics back in high school. Respect.\n\nSo, are teachers shit? Yes. Are they truly?

To be honest, I actually prefer asynchronous learning to in-person when it\u2019s executed properly.  This past semester, the online classes I had were structured extremely well.  No lectures or access codes, but the material was easily understood and the assignments and exams were based strictly on the material covered, and any reading outside of the textbook was provided by the profs for free.  Plus, I received timely and in-depth feedback on my assignments, so I could apply the critiques for the next one.
