I feel like college is not what it is promised to be. I\u2019ve been trying to get involved by applying to research and stuff. I have emailed 4 different professors about undergraduate research opportunities and tried to follow up but I never get a response. I know that I don\u2019t have much experience but there\u2019s nothing I can about that because I\u2019m trying rn to get more experience. I just need an opportunity to do so. It\u2019s like the whole: no one wants to hire you because you have no experience but you have no experience so no one will hire you. I feel like I\u2019m running out of time I\u2019m already in my third year and I feel so hopeless\u2026 sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t go to college at all. I\u2019m doing well academically tho\u2026 it just sucks that no one is willing to give me a chance.

Research isn\u2019t the end all be all. I\u2019ll be honest, I should\u2019ve done research sooner but I was so afraid of rejection that I didn\u2019t put myself out there. I didn\u2019t send emails to professors yet I was mad at myself for not doing research. However, the one thing I did do was TAing, I was really good at it and I loved it. Then, I decided to contact the professor I was working for and began doing research with them the spring of my junior year. This was chemical education research, not even wet lab chemistry. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m going for a PhD in Chemistry in the fall with a full ride, stipend and an additional 40K fellowship. Not beginning research early won\u2019t guarantee failure.

Ask grad students for advice, too!!!\n\nAdditionally, sometimes universities have classes that are instructional UR labs. You could contact your advisor or ask around on your university's social media to see if classes like this exist.
