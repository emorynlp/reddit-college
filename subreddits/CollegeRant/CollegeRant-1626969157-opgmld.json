  "text": "I feel like I\u2019m losing motivation. I feel like college is not what it is promised to be. I\u2019ve been trying to get involved by applying to research and stuff. I have emailed 4 different professors about undergraduate research opportunities and tried to follow up but I never get a response. I know that I don\u2019t have much experience but there\u2019s nothing I can about that because I\u2019m trying rn to get more experience. I just need an opportunity to do so. It\u2019s like the whole: no one wants to hire you because you have no experience but you have no experience so no one will hire you. I feel like I\u2019m running out of time I\u2019m already in my third year and I feel so hopeless\u2026 sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t go to college at all. I\u2019m doing well academically tho\u2026 it just sucks that no one is willing to give me a chance. Idk what to do anymore",

I\u2019ll be honest, I should\u2019ve done research sooner but I was so afraid of rejection that I didn\u2019t put myself out there. I didn\u2019t send emails to professors yet I was mad at myself for not doing research. However, the one thing I did do was TAing, I was really good at it and I loved it. Then, I decided to contact the professor I was working for and began doing research with them the spring of my junior year. This was chemical education research, not even wet lab chemistry. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m going for a PhD in Chemistry in the fall with a full ride, stipend and an additional 40K fellowship. Not beginning research early won\u2019t guarantee failure. Regardless, you want to make sure you\u2019re not just another face in your classes.",

I don\u2019t even know if I have any job options with this bachelors degree, nobody told me and the job openings don\u2019t look too promising.\n\nI was also a first generation student and from a working-poor family. But I didn't have an image in mind of what college should have been like. No one tried to sell me on college. In fact a lot of people (including my high school guidance counselor!) tried to talk me out of going to college. If there's one *best* decision that I've ever made, it was ignoring those people and going anyway.\n\nBut one of the *great and terrible* things about college is that what you get out is proportional to what you put in. There's no job fairy waiting on the other side of the stage to shake people's hands and pass out careers when people get their diplomas. And most people aren't going to go out of their way to find out whether you need help getting the most out of your college experience. Other than going to classes and trying to pass exams, are you taking the steps to put yourself in a good position to succeed post-graduation? Here are some examples, in no particular order\n\n* You say nobody told you about job openings, etc.--but who have *you* asked about it?\n* Have you been to your school's career center?\n* Have you scheduled meetings with a careers/student development/whatever counselor (NOT an academic advisor) at your school?\n* Have you been to campus job fairs (virtual or in-person)?\n* Have you emailed or called or dropped by the appropriate office to discuss internship opportunities for students?\n* Have you tried to engage any of your professors in professional development or careers discussions (i.e., about working in their field and not just about stuff from their class)?\n* Have you checked around your major's department website to see if there's a careers guide posted online?\n* Have you looked at the websites of professional organizations from your field?\n* How much time have you spent on your own researching careers in your field?\n\nIn a lot of ways, college is like a dine-in buffet style restaurant. There can be too many options to sample everything and nobody's going to bring shit to you just because you're sitting there. It's up to you explore what's available yourself.",

Going to be honest and say that I haven\u2019t actually looked at or asked about job/internship opportunities, I just kind of pessimistically assumed there wouldn\u2019t be any. Just thought I\u2019d mention too that I started in one of the \u201cuseless\u201d libarts majors (English) and looking at the job opportunities or thinking about academia is really discouraging, but I think I\u2019m going to switch to sociology/general social science because it seems more useful/employable.",

But there are **achievable careers** (with job openings) that are well-suited for successful English majors. Too many students think that the diploma is the most marketable thing about their college education (and the ones who just fuck around and do the bare minimum in undergrad might be right). Instead, think of the **transferable skills** that you learn and develop as a student in whatever major. \n\nSome things that you might not be thinking about in an English skill set are technical writing (not to everyone's taste, but it's important, pays decently on average, and prioritizes English major skills over tech knowledge), editing, marketing/advertising, public relations or communications, paralegal, and grant writing. The catch is that an English degree does not guarantee a job in any of those, but if you combine English major skills with the right knowledge (e.g., a minor in X to go along with the English degree) or experience (e.g., undergrad internships in Y to go along with the English degree) then you start to have have real prospects.",
