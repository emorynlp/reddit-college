  "text": "I am in my second year of a major in microbiology and have made up all my other subjects with chemistry and I love learning about it all I go full nerd mode with the content and I am passing so far but I feel like I am several steps behind all the other students. But could they just be acting like they know everything so they look smart? And I get the vibe that lecturers look down on you for asking questions even though they have 20+ years on me content-wise. Does anybody else feel like this??",

At least you're supposed to feel discomfort and you're supposed to struggle at least a little with material. Whenever you think you've understood a concept without any difficulties sound the friggin alarms cause that's trouble. Just take your time and know that to build the house that one day will be your career you have to lay bricks of knowledge down one at a time.",

I am kinda stuck between being pissed cos I am paying for this course and trying to be understanding of his workload but it's kinda bullshit.",
