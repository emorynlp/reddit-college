All my good experiences somehow turn sour and I am constantly having to fix a problem. I'm about to start my 3rd semester next week and I'm already having issues (car problems, health issues, not fitting in with friends, and more): I kinda regret going to school (even though it's a really good school). I'm pretty worn down at this point.\n\nSorry for the weird post, just needed to share this with someone. Wanna respond but don't know what to say? That's ok, just share a funny story or something.\n\nTL;DR: I'm going back to university this week and I'm worn out because I've had nothing but bad luck since I transferred.\n\nUPDATE: MY CAR IS FIXED!!!!!! And my apartment is ready for me to move in!!!", "author": "Thecrazysharklady", "created": 1629754085, "retrieved": 1632841579, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ha302zs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pa99nn/ive_had_a_lot_of_bad_luck_since_i_transferred_to/ha302zs/", "text": "Thank you u/Thecrazysharklady for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
