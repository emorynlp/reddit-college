  "text": "I\u2019m so tired of seeing a letter grade but no comment on why I deserved that grade. In person they marked what you got wrong, and maybe even why you got it wrong. Online it seems like the norm is getting grades back with no indication on what I did right or wrong. I\u2019m kinda tired of it.",

It's the most frustrating thing especially since my other classes with a much bigger work load are always on top of grading quickly and providing feedback. We've finished 2 modules already. My grade still says \"N/A\". Ridiculous.",
