So I begun community college in fall 2019 not knowing what I wanted to do.\n\nSo fast forward here I am almost 21 and I\u2019ve just now realized that I want to pursue an interest with a marketing degree. My school is only 20 minutes away but I don\u2019t have my own transportation. I think they\u2019re starting up in person classes but I\u2019ve decided to continue with online only because I think it\u2019ll be best for my situation. And I don\u2019t think the pandemic is going away any time soon so they might even shut down campuses again.\n\nI\u2019m the past I\u2019ve been so scared of the possibility of being by myself in a dorm away from family, im not an independent person at all as much as it sucks to admit. But now I feel like it\u2019ll be good to be on my own and have the full college experience.\n\nBut no matter how \u201cyoung\u201d people say that I am right now I still feel like it\u2019s too late. I already feel left behind compared to my peers because I took a break year after high school and my major was undecided for so long. Also I feel the main downside of community college is that you don\u2019t get the full experience . And I\u2019m starting to realize that now.\n\nThis rant is probably so pointless because like I mentioned, money is important and obviously CC is much cheaper so I don\u2019t know if I have a choice . And besides, I\u2019m under the impression that my specific program won\u2019t transfer over properly and it\u2019s kinda my fault for not looking into it.\n\nAnd I fell into a deep hole while being on YouTube and stumbling upon these back to school/ college dorm videos \ud83d\ude13I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only person feeling left out and liked they\u2019ve missed opportunities. When I\u2019m done with my associates degree it\u2019ll be 2023 and it\u2019s so crazy to think about\u2026  btw I live in Illinois", "author": "jonesbrooklyn773", "created": 1628875199, "retrieved": 1632949112, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"h8wbc14": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p3ppik/community_college_student_feeling_lost/h8wbc14/", "text": "I took 90 semester credits at a CC, then transferred for my senior year at a university. Depending on your CC and university\u2019s articulation agreements paired with your degree type, you may be able to save a TON of money. Saving money trumps most experiences IMO. It\u2019s over 10k per year to live on campus as is, then add on tuition. If you don\u2019t live on campus, then you don\u2019t get much of an experience either way. I\u2019d stay at CC as long as you can. I did and I lived with my parents. My bachelors only cost me 14k in the end. Also, earn an associates degree from the CC. Some colleges, no matter what associates degree you have, won\u2019t require as many or any general Ed classes. My university just flat out waived all gen Ed requirements even though I didn\u2019t take some of the classes because I had an associates.", "author": "mother_of_nerd", "created": 1628938391, "upvotes": 1}, "h8vja1h": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p3ppik/community_college_student_feeling_lost/h8vja1h/", "text": "I went to a CC for my first two years of college and then transferred to a private four year school nearby for their Graphic Design program. At the time my CC didn\u2019t have a transfer agreement with the other school. What I did was I declared as a Liberal Studies major at the CC, where I had greater flexibility to choose my courses, and then tried to take courses that were essentially the equivalent to different courses in the private school\u2019s program. There were still some unforeseen hiccups, but it definitely allowed me to have a smoother transition and not have to play catch-up. \n\nAlso, I lived at home all through college. While everyone\u2019s situation is different, and I definitely had boundary issues with my parents at times, I don\u2019t regret it. I had a private, larger space than any dorm (or even off campus apartment) could provide. Cost aside\u2026 I never had to worry about paying for laundry; sharing a bathroom; showering in flip flops; being forced to buy a meal plan for overpriced crap; being sexiled by a roommate; or being caught with alcohol by an RA (my school was a dry campus). The quote-on-quote \u201ccollege experience\u201d is overrated.
