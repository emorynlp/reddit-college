  "text": "As a parent of a college age children I have read various posts over the past year or so about the issues people have had with sat and such and college board. But I have to say that I have never on my life dealt with such blatant incompetence as has been my experience with college board. This was even before covid-19. If they did not hold so much power over the educational lives of students it would actually be funny. But at every turn (AP test results getting lost - twice no refund, sat tests cancelled with no warning, the inability to refund for tests they cancelled, sitting on hold for over an hour only to be disconnected, one person says one thing and another says something completely different, the list goes on and on)..and now with the sat tests cancelled again without warning and without notification that they are cancelled (a friend told us) we are now stuck with booking another test and paying for it and then sitting on hold for another hour to get them to either refund or apply to next test.\n\nTruly amazing level of ineptitude.  \nSorry for the rant but this is truly sad.",

      "text": "Seriously, college board is a scam. When I was applying for schools, I paid for my test score to be sent. Yet, the schools I applied to didn\u2019t receive it and when I contacted college board, I was given a case number, so they can resolve the issue and actually send my test score. With the case number, college board was supposed to provide me assistance with the issue and they never did. I was told I would be reached through email and I never was. In fact, I never heard from them, and they never sent my test scores to the schools I applied to. I wasted my money trying to send my test score.",

The curve on my exam was probably the worst in SAT history - with my raw score, if I had a normal curve (not even a good curve, just a normal one) I would\u2019ve gotten 50 points higher on my exam. I missed out on 50 points and thousands of dollars in scholarships because of a messed up curve. Thanks, collegeboard.",

                      "text": "There is a pretty significant research into how the SAT is biased. African American, Hispanic, Native American, and poorer students perform worse on the SAT because they don't have very specific cultural knowledge that only White and Asian American students of means have.\n\nOne of the biggest examples of this bias is in the question asking about analogies:  \nRunner: Marathon  \na) envoy: embassy  \nb) martyr: massacre  \nc) oarsman: regatta  \nd) horse: stable\n\nThe answer is C. Even knowing what an oarsman or a regatta is, is a pretty specific piece of cultural knowledge that is biased toward rich students who attended private prep schools (the only schools that would offer crew or have students who would attend some kind of rowing event outside of school).\n\nJust because you did not face institutionalized bias does not mean that others are equally fortunate.",
