That's how I felt since corona and online school started last year. I failed my spring semester and I failed my fall semester also. This semester I have been on top with my homework since I want to make something of my life with my degree. I hope that you are able to find the motivation! It definitely is harder now, but (in my personal experience so far) just figure out what you want to do with your life. If your dream job (idk like a nursing) requires a degree, you can take a semester or two off to figure out of that's actually what you want to do or find a different path.
