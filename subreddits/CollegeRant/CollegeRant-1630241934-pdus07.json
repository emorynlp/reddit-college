I think it\u2019s a really tough adjustment because I\u2019ve spent the past year and a half seeing my boyfriend, my mom, and my friends all day everyday and having them so close and now I just got dropped off at this huge school where I don\u2019t know anyone. I\u2019m so sad and scared. I know I need to push through but I wish I could go home so badly. I can\u2019t stop crying", "author": "js35689", "created": 1630241934, "retrieved": 1632948999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"hasuju8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdus07/want_to_go_home_already/hasuju8/", "text": "You aren\u2019t the only one. \n\nMy advice is to find a job on campus and join 2 clubs.
