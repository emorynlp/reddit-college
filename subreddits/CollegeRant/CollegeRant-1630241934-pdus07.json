I think it\u2019s a really tough adjustment because I\u2019ve spent the past year and a half seeing my boyfriend, my mom, and my friends all day everyday and having them so close and now I just got dropped off at this huge school where I don\u2019t know anyone. I\u2019m so sad and scared. I know I need to push through but I wish I could go home so badly. I can\u2019t stop crying", "author": "js35689", "created": 1630241934, "retrieved": 1632841444, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"hasqmzo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdus07/want_to_go_home_already/hasqmzo/", "text": "Thank you u/js35689 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
