That's why it's so painful for me rn because I'm on my last year, dropping out is dumb but so is doing something I know won't benefit me", "text": "And it's a mf art course \ud83e\udd26 talk about useless. And I can say it's useless because I still learn more online. I'm looking at the job scopes of my field and all the stuff they want was SELF TAUGHT - the school didn't teach me fucking shit. \n\n\nIf you asked me, I truly learnt nothing (useful). I just always hated school, so maybe I'm just being extra negative lol. But I'm so fucking annoyed because 1. School is useless 2. Yet it's stressful 3. It's a fucking art course 4. It's so expensive (thankfully I'm not paying WHICH I AM SO GRATEFUL?) and the fact I'm not paying is also one of the reasons why I'm still in school. I can't just drop out when someone is paying for me?? It's just wrong. But at the same time I already seen myself to not work in the field, and looking back I realised how school triggered my suicidal ideation and depression. \n\n\nI was already depressed and suicidal but it got so much worse whenever I had to go back to school. Society is literally torture, always making us do shit we don't wanna do. All of what we do is so that we can fucking EXIST. BEING HOMELESS IS ILLEGAL YET HOUSES ARE SO EXPENSIVE?
