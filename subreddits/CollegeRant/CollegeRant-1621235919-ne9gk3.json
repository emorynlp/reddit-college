  "text": "I'm an international student in a country that I won't mention (the people are known to be grumpy and rude, guess you know who) and to be honest, after one year and a half here, I'm very disappointed and angry about all the bad experiences that I had here.\n\nI don't know if I can't fit into these type of elitist-like colleges, but I definitely don't like being there. People are cold. I've tried to make friends with some , but I clearly saw the disgust in their face. I remember being in group with people who left the group after, without saying anything, they weren't responding on slack (it's the app we're using to communicate between students and profs), but I saw some with their friends at College, and pretending I don't exist when our path cross at school.\n\nSecond rant. Some people are not helpful at all, they don't hesitate to humiliate or scream at you when you make a mistake or ask for help. I know we're supposed to , at some extent \"figure out\" things by ourselves in order to resolve problems in our domain, but it's too much for me. I've been screamed at by some students for asking how to resolve a problem. I can't forget about it. I've also been publicly humiliated by one of my prof for being 15 minutes late. He made me tell in front of everyone why I came late and after he belittled me by asking (made me feel like a bad unmotivated student, meanwhile it wasn't the case at that period) if I was even coming to college, and later scolded me in front of everyone in the class. I was shocked. Nobody said anything. Couldn't believe student were just okay with things like that. It's something also that tells that nobody give's a shit about you, not even your pretended \"classmates\".\n\nThis year my grades were average to insufficient but close to average, due to the depression caused by all of this.I can't quit because my parents are paying for it and yeah I'm supposed to graduate, but this is really taking a toll at my mental health. I have PTSD everytime I wake up I recall the moments I've been humiliated and that makes me feel like a piece of crap and shameful.I also can't change college because it's the most affordable I found. So I'm in a dilemma.",

That will give you the peace you need to focus on your studies. \n\nThere is too much negativity out there, and I honestly admire your patience and resilience. Good luck!",
