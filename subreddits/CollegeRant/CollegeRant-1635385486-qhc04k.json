  "title:": "Should I Attend my Graduation Ceremony, Does it really matter??",
  "text": "I\u2019m 21F and in two months I\u2019m done with college degree but my ceremony is held in May. I\u2019m grateful for it but I just don\u2019t care about the ceremony part. The Uni experience wasn\u2019t the best for me, I basically made no friends and I  was dealing with medical problems most of the time and I just wanted to finish as soon as possible. However my parents would like to go, should I go or do I sound selfish ??",

Kind of just to symbolize \u201chey I made it and persisted despite my medical problems\u201d, even if you didn\u2019t make any friends graduating college is a huge accomplishment. So I\u2019d just go anyways, especially if your family paid for any of your tuition, it would be for them too.",
