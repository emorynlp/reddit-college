The class was mostly in-person, but there were some people joining over Zoom.  My teacher was lecturing and had moved away from the computer.  \n\nWell apparently, the kids who were on Zoom couldn't hear my teacher very well but he didn't see the comments they were typing in.  I understand that this was frustrating to them.  However, when I saw that one girl had commented \"why the fuck can't you listen to us we can't fucking hear you idiot\" (not an exact quote but basically the gist of it), I lost all sympathy.  My poor teacher, who was very nice and accommodating to everyone, saw the comment at the end of class.  He didn't even look mad, just really disappointed.  He briefly announced to the class to please not use that language towards him.  I still can't believe people who talk to teachers like that even make it to college.  I'm an education major and I am really not looking forward to that part of the job.", "author": "dandelioncommittee", "created": 1628555412, "upvotes": 3}, "h717fu8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/otmddn/whats_up_with_disrespecting_teachers/h717fu8/", "text": "You might be thinking, \u201cwell he doesn\u2019t know all teachers.\u201d Take your concerns about respect to the principal - that won\u2019t be disrespectful.", "author": "Zealousideal-Yard803", "created": 1627610284, "upvotes": 2}, "h70fzvp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/otmddn/whats_up_with_disrespecting_teachers/h70fzvp/", "text": "Honestly professors rarely treat their students as actual adults.
