If one isn\u2019t skilled enough to help the other behave safely, then it is only worse when neither can help each other or themselves. Sometimes you can only watch. Sometimes that\u2019s because neither wants to help themselves. The most important thing is that nobody gets hurt.",

      "text": "Once during my fall semester this past year, I was in a math class when a girl so blatantly disrespected my teacher (not professor, was earning a grad degree and TAing) that my jaw dropped (this was a freshman-level math class that was as close you could get to remedial without it actually being remedial).  The class was mostly in-person, but there were some people joining over Zoom.  My teacher was lecturing and had moved away from the computer.  \n\nWell apparently, the kids who were on Zoom couldn't hear my teacher very well but he didn't see the comments they were typing in.  I understand that this was frustrating to them.  However, when I saw that one girl had commented \"why the fuck can't you listen to us we can't fucking hear you idiot\" (not an exact quote but basically the gist of it), I lost all sympathy.  My poor teacher, who was very nice and accommodating to everyone, saw the comment at the end of class.  He didn't even look mad, just really disappointed.  He briefly announced to the class to please not use that language towards him.  I still can't believe people who talk to teachers like that even make it to college.  I'm an education major and I am really not looking forward to that part of the job.",

Being disgruntled is not an excuse for treating people as garbage. If the student had been in class, then the problem wouldn\u2019t have been. I know many people who have the policy of removing them from the others\u2019 space. As a leader, and teachers are in leadership roles, it is the teacher\u2019s responsibility to protect the students from threats. Psychologically, emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually damaging people is a threat. Removing the students who are threats to learning is how to deal with them. Leadership requires thinning the herd if toxicity is damaging the most important part of the team...its people.",

Everything we do at work is serving, and while you might say \u201cso what?\u201d One thing I learned is that some people, a minority of people, are rude and feel entitled to treat you like garbage. They have no right to treat people like garbage, but you need to be prepared to sway them into believing that they are understood. The most helpful skill I learned in \u201cputting out fires\u201d that entitled people cause is customer service. When they are frustrated, they want someone to tell them that both of you are frustrated. They feel lonely and need help. While somebody solves their problem by swearing and screaming, another solves the same problem with questions and friendship. Some people are taught to distrust their peers. As a teacher, you will have the power to show them that learning about how they act can impact their future. If a student is endangering your class, you will need to act for them. Working on your leadership skills out of the classroom will certainly help you overcome your nervousness in an argument with a student. I was taught against verbal abuse, but it is my responsibility to teach others the benefit of the way I was taught. Even if someone is so frustrated with me I think what works is simply saying I am sorry you are frustrated so am I! At this moment, the old adage \u201chow you speak matters more than what you speak\u201d is disproven. When someone is behaving so erratically and everyone freezes in terror, \u201cwhat you say becomes more important than how you say it\u201d. Learn a script to use when speaking to someone who is erratic. My example is the donkey in Shrek. When he speaks to the dragon he focused on what he said, not how he said it, and that made her feel better- but we all know, and the rest of the class knows too - that the donkey is better. \n\nNobody is born with leadership skills. I suggest you learn them that way you can avoid the problem of being a surrogate parent for your students and you can feel healthy and able with them that they look to you and expect you to show them how to behave.\n\nIf you need examples of free videos and some clubs and groups that teach leadership skills, send me a PM. I don\u2019t want somebody else to say their opinion about the group and sway you into apathy. I keep my mind clear of the time it takes to share great ideas with the public because not everyone else has been working toward the same end as I have. \n\nGood luck. And for example, it does suck that students act that way when all you want to do is teach them to be successful. I am sorry you are frustrated with them and I too am frustrated! Does free advice for winning the class over sound suitable to your needs? You can let me know in PM or you in this thread. What do you think will help you? I wish I could do more.",

When the prof asked calmly that he come to office hours to voice his complaints, he doubled down and argued that many people in the room agreed with him.

Someone might say \u201cthey could be rapists\u201d, if so I\u2019ll wait for a jury to decide whether they are or not. \n\nSo if I understand you correctly, deans might not back up a teacher? I think that constitutes weak leadership. The teacher was chosen by measures far more stringent than requirements for classmates. If the dean cannot stand by their decision to choose a teacher and back up a teacher, then the dean might suitably be unqualified. For those who have opinions about \u201cthe story behind the teacher\u201d, there are choices here based on no information. Standards are taught to keep the group safe. Many educators vote for new teachers and those not voted for cannot work for the school.
