The professors I have are great, but two weeks into my sophomore year of college, I am not happy with college. I still have no friends, am overwhelmed with the reading one of my professors assigned (book didn't come in right away so I have to catch up on six chapters and then five more for a book we start on Tuesday), and am afraid of letting anyone down. On top of that, I begin a degree-related job soon that, although is exciting, is going to consume even more of my college work time. The one thing I'm sticking with though is that I will NOT work past 7-7:30 PM. No need for that stress.\n\nLast year was a roller coaster: nearly failed the first semester before coming back and getting a 3.2+ I believe, but then getting a below 3 GPA the next semester (even though I worked even harder). I don't want that to happen again.\n\nI just want to enjoy college instead of treating it like another 9-5 where I just can't wait to commute back home.", "author": "SportsMajor", "created": 1631312873, "retrieved": 1632950969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 75, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdh8c1p": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/plv5gm/im_not_having_fun_with_college/hdh8c1p/", "text": "College is supposed to be fun?", "author": "rocketraccoonz", "created": 1632068396, "upvotes": 1}, "hcilez9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/plv5gm/im_not_having_fun_with_college/hcilez9/", "text": "Really struggling with making friends too.
