  "text": "Last semester many of my online classes were asynchronous which was amazing! I could watch the lectures whenever I wanted, I could pause to take notes, rewind, watch at a faster speed. It was effing awesome. I\u2019m guessing over the winter break faculty must have had some sort of meeting to encourage more student participation or something because in several of my classes they now throw us into breakout rooms with the same technique of having to elect a student speaker depending on some random butt question. For example, \u201cthe speaker of your group will be whoever has the most amount of pets\u201d, and suddenly everyone claims to have zero pets, even the people who clearly have profile pics of them holding their pets.... \u201cthe speaker of your group will be whoever\u2019s birthday is coming up the earliest? \u201c all of a sudden everyone\u2019s birthday was last week. Most of the time we get thrown into breakout rooms for majority of the class and no one speaks. I have tried several times to speak to my classmates but I\u2019m lucky if I even get a response back. I\u2019m not sure if they are shy, still asleep, or just don\u2019t care but at this point I\u2019m starting to not care as well. I hate breakout rooms! Either teach/ lecture or let us go there is no point in being thrown in with people who refuse to discuss or participate. I would like to just not attend these classes as I see them to be completely pointless but attendance is taken so I very close to just muting them and doing my own thing on the side at this point.",
