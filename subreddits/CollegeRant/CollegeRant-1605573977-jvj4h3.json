I constantly fantasize about dropping out, even though I KNOW I want this degree (History major w/ specification in Euro history). I have 4 fuckin 10-15 page papers (3 require 10-12 pages, 1 requires 15) and I haven't started them; that isn't due to stress, my writing ethic just tends to flourish-- i'm going on a tangent. But dude, I wake up and dread the fact that I'm awake. I've already got depression and anxiety, but I was in a good place before this. All I gotta say is, shit's wack my guy. But I know we can make it through this, let's all keep pushing and fuckin skimming these God forsaken heavy ass reading assignments.", "author": "sawwft", "created": 1605573977, "retrieved": 1632951569, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gclk3d8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvj4h3/this_semester_has_ruined_my_mental_health/gclk3d8/", "text": "Check Chats", "author": "JosphatM", "created": 1605609295, "upvotes": 1}, "gclcsl3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvj4h3/this_semester_has_ruined_my_mental_health/gclcsl3/", "text": "Don't know if this will help, but when I took my bachelors in History, I would write in 10 or 11 pt and format the line spaces to single instead of double.
