It\u2019s not like high school at least I know why it\u2019s important to study those lessons or I was motivated enough to study them. It just feels rushed, as I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m also preparing my cheat codes. While I would have preferred not to cheat, I just can\u2019t catchup. I have chemistry despite knowing nothing about it since I took physics and biology, I asked our professor for any advice or recommended resources and I got the reply \u201cUse your better judgement\u201d. Honestly I feel like shit, it doesn\u2019t help when my parents tell me that its just gonna get harder the older you get. Like what\u2019s the point then, like I just don\u2019t know. I wanna quit but since I\u2019m at SEA I\u2019ll get heavy backlash from my parents. I don\u2019t know honestly, I just don\u2019t feel motivated like before.", "author": "Kaezumi", "created": 1631070053, "retrieved": 1632841129, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"hc0je9r": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pk26ab/im_not_happy_and_i_feel_like_im_just_forcing/hc0je9r/", "text": "Thank you u/Kaezumi for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
