  "title:": "feel so undervalued as a research assistant at a lab + other personal issues make it worse",
  "text": "I'm a full-time research assistant. I'm not taking classes this semester. I will graduate on time.\n\nI'm not getting paid, which I thought I'd be able to deal with. I didn't think money motivated me. I know I'm privileged to not need it, but I have also saved my family a lot of money in the past few years by living at home/not getting university housing since COVID began. Anyway, on the days when I'm feeling so dejected, ignored, undervalued, worthless, I realize that making any kind of money would make it a bit more worth it. I know I was kinda dumb to take an unpaid job, but it's at a prestigious university and I spent seven months looking for a full-time RA position and this is my first job in my field. I'm hoping it's a solid foundation for my future jobs.\n\nI think if I was learning a lot, it would make it easier to deal with not being paid, because I would be able to put a lot of skills on my resume and get better jobs in the future. But I'm not learning anything besides getting familiar with the software that I was trained to enter data into. Just entering data, for 3 and a half months now.\n\nEven before I started the job, I was told by the PI that I would be working with a PhD student. Cool, I was really excited! She rescheduled our first meeting, and our second one too. She told me to research a software and write a brief report on it. She said thanks, I'll take a look later this week. She got back to me like 3 weeks later basically saying that she and other grad students were editing some part of her study and when they were done, she would let me know and tell me what I could do to help. She didn't mention anything about the report, so I guess she didn't need it and won't need it anytime soon. She said she would probably finish editing her study in September. I haven't heard from her at all since that email.\n\nFor all 3.5 months I've had this job, I've just been helping the lab manager with this administrative stuff. Which is fine, but I wish it wasn't the only thing I was doing. And the amount of work is much less than full-time. I know I should be grateful. I am. Plus this job is remote, which has a lot of positives, but it did kind of crush my dream of walking around the beautiful campus of this prestigious university and pretending to be one of the students. I can't get another job because I don't have a car (I was planning on taking the train if this job were to be in person) and where am I going to get the money for one?\n\nOur lab \"meetings\" are just opportunities for the phd students to present their work. I feel like an inexperienced underclassman once again; listening to people talk passionately about their research and wishing for the day I could be involved in research myself. I thought that's what I would be doing at this job! I didn't expect to be such a passive member of this lab. It's big, and they don't need me. No one really knows me besides the lab manager. All the other research assistants are students who go to that university, and they can actually go to the lab in person and meet each other.\n\nThe lab values statement says they're devoted to helping early-career researchers. Give me a break. I haven't felt one ounce of support. I feel like such a fool. And I can barely be involved with my own university's students because 1) I'm at home, 3 hours away from campus, and 2) most clubs are having in-person only meetings.\n\nI can't believe I worked so hard for four semesters (16) classes, absorbing information, hoping that it would help me get a good RA position, then spent 7 months applying to labs, and then when I finally got a job, I'm not applying anything from my classes nor learning anything new nor getting paid nor meeting new people. :(\n\nTL;DR mad at myself and the lab for my first experience in research being less educational & gratifying than I expected",
