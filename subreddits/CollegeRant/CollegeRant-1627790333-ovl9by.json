It just sucks. You will make friends quickly, just make small talk with people in your class or where you get food or where you study. Hands down the most important thing youll need to master or at least be good at is time management. Its not high school, your hand isnt held. Some professors rely more on you teaching yourself than others, meaning the bulk of learning is done on your own and class time is for summarizing what you studied and answering questions. They say you should spend 2-3 hours studying for every hour youre in class, but it really depends on the class. You should definitely have specific chunks of time where you study and review.", "author": "taybay462", "created": 1627917987, "upvotes": 1}, "h7d90ii": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ovl9by/so_nervous_for_college/h7d90ii/", "text": "It\u2019s definitely nerve-racking, but 90% of freshmen are going to be just as nervous as you.
