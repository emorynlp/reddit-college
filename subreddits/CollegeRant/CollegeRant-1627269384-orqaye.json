I keep asking myself this question despite the countless conversations I had about this with other classmates, friends and family. Literally all of the people I\u2019ve talked to told me that they don\u2019t remember most of what they learned in college/university. I have a few questions and would appreciate your honesty. \n\n1. Do you use most of the theory and whatever knowledge you learned in college/university when working? \n\n2. Do you, yourself, remember all the material you learned in college/university?", "author": "LovelyHoney98", "created": 1627269384, "retrieved": 1632950756, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h6qjxu1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/orqaye/so_whats_the_point_of_university_if_were_gonna/h6qjxu1/", "text": "Forgive me if I\u2019m wrong but to me, it seems like you might really be asking  \u2018what is the point of going to college/what can I expect to get out of it? Is it worth it?\u2019 \n\nI will answer your questions in order first before we continue: \n\n1.\tSort of. I do use some of the research and critical thinking skills I learned in school and the background knowledge of some subjects comes in pretty handy when trying to understand some of the things I\u2019m working on. \n2.\tNot by any means. But I think how important this is depends heavily on what it is you\u2019re doing. \n\nTo answer beyond what you\u2019re asking directly and touch on what I think you might be curious about: \n\nI\u2019m not an absolutist. In my experience, college where I live is more about not closing the door on opportunities than it is about opening doors. But that varies greatly depending on what you choose to study and how much you decide to apply yourself. I wish that K-12 education was better and that college was an accessible option to everyone but not so widely considered or intended to be the only viable option after high school. There are people who find alternatives who do well for themselves and sometimes I wish I was one of them but it is legitimately a riskier route in most instances. \n\nNot all STEM majors are created equal but if you are looking for something that will be practical, where you will be using what you studied on a day-to-day basis once you graduate, my sense is that something like compsci or engineering or medicine would require you to use what you learn in the classroom at a fairly high rate. Does that mean that you\u2019d need to have equations memorized to do what you need to do? Almost definitely not, and so I question any pedagogy that requires memorization for an exam or something like that (in the defense of memorization, maybe taking the time to memorize something like that actually does lead to better understanding of the formula and variables? To me it seems like there are more efficient ways to achieve this outcome)\n\nI think your questions are interesting because it seems like there\u2019s a clear premise to them: college should prepare you for the working world and you should learn useful and applicable things in college that you use in a professional capacity once you graduate. \n\nGiven how expensive college is and the amount of time and effort required to complete it, at face value I think that\u2019s a very reasonable sounding premise. \n\nWhat I wonder though is, if college were cheaper or if you were paid to go to college, comparatively how much more or less would you value learning things that are immediately applicable to what you would do for work? How much more or less would you value remembering all of the material you learned? \n\nI think that it\u2019s interesting to consider the value of other things the college experience can provide: an opportunity to be independent and away from home with other people who are likely to be the same age as you and probably share some similar experiences but also may have some insights you don\u2019t have and vice versa. College can be (isn\u2019t always but personally, I think should be) an opportunity to take social and other risks, go outside one\u2019s comfort zone, and fail not without consequence, but with a safety net that may not be as readily available outside of college. \n\nPersonally, I do question whether college is worthwhile at the price point many people have to pay to attend it. Unfortunately, the experience college can create in ways other than those explicitly focusing on hard skills and academic knowledge, which legitimately do have some (but a difficult amount of value to meaningfully measure) value, is difficult to replicate outside of college. It\u2019s definitely not impossible. But I think as we consider the worth of a college education and broader experience, it\u2019s worthwhile to contemplate possible alternatives not only for the skills necessary to succeed in a workplace, but also the experiences that help to develop one\u2019s sense of what one is passionate about, where one\u2019s limits are, and who one wants to associate with or become. \n\nAnother thing that is interesting to consider is whether knowledge one forgets can still have a significant impact on one\u2019s choices, decisions, and development over time. If there\u2019s research out there on this topic, I\u2019d be curious about it. \n\nI do think questions like yours about the degree to which one uses knowledge learned in college in the workplace and the degree to which one remembers what one was taught are interesting, especially within the framing of how expensive college is. Questions like these make me curious about whether we can find ways to make alternatives to the college experience more readily available and accepted and whether these alternatives will be able to provide comparable experiences, if that is an outcome we\u2019re interested in achieving. There is a lot to be said for how many jobs in the world are largely BS that almost anyone could do. I am curious about how college\u2019s worth will change in a world increasingly headed toward automation of all but the most creative tasks. Will the college system adjust? Will the system be necessary in the future? Will its purpose have to change as technology changes the economy, and thereby, society?", "author": "hallieluyah", "created": 1627411251, "upvotes": 1}, "h6m2gqo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/orqaye/so_whats_the_point_of_university_if_were_gonna/h6m2gqo/", "text": "Getting drunk, getting into trouble and making memories.
