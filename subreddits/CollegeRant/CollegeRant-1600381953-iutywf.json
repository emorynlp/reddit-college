I just feel so frustrated and stressed. Feeling like my mental health is draining me and some people will say it\u2019s normal because everyone goes through it. I don\u2019t really like it when people say this because it diminishes my feelings.

They don't always get to choose what to teach and may be required to assign homework even if they don't want to.\n\nI once took a class on the education system and found out a lot of teachers have their hands tied by school requirements and the whole politics inside education. Sometimes teachers do deeply feel sympathy but have job requirements that can't control.\n\nI'm currently taking a class with an excellent teacher but the overall experience on Zoom is seriously limiting how good he can ACTUALLY can be, and he definitely has his requirements. The class really sucks, but I can't really blame him. \n\nSorry if this isn't helpful on how you feel.

This leads to a toxic mess of a lecture-style and extra pressure being put on students to perform at the same level as they would during in-person classes because it is what professors are being forced to do as well. However, that is no excuse for their behavior. If you are having any kind of mental health issue while attending a college, you should seek out your college's Disability Access Services to get class accommodations. They can really help in terms of having a support system and advocates if you feel like you're health issues are keeping you from performing at the same level as your peers. Also, if you are being helped by an Access Center, professors will be notified that you have accommodations, and they can't pull the \"you're just lazy\" argument. I mean, that won't stop all of them, god knows I've had my fair share of arguments with professors about how missing a class for a mandatory doctor's visit isn't lazy, but it definitely cut down on the bull crap. Yes, it's normal to feel mentally drained, but that shouldn't diminish you at all because it means you're not alone in all of this! It doesn't mean your lazy or weak, it means that your brain is reacting how it should to a majorly stressful situation. And that is perfectly okay. \n\nTL:DR, Professors are stressed and forgetful, seek out disability accommodations for mental health stuff, you are not alone, and you got this.", "author": "Joyfuloops", "created": 1600405835, "upvotes": 10}, "g5o8eqm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iutywf/feeling_like_teachers_dont_care_about_our_mental/g5o8eqm/", "text": "Teachers don't care about your health, mental or otherwise, because our capitalist hellscape of a world has turned learning into a competition for survival. Many professors are brainwashed by this sink or swim mentality. Learning should not be painful or torturous, nor is learning the goal of education. If learning were the endgame, why would we not be allowed to retake exams?
