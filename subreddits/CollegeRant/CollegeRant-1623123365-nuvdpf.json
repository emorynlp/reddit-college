But then I got a job. A very bad job that had no breaks and was unfortunately food service. Things got so bad (blooclots in both my big toes) I had to jump to another job asap not realizing that's its not that much better, it pretty much just has breaks. Now I'm so physically and mentally exhausted from the building we have to do and the socializing that drains me, I can't do anything when I get home or the days after. Oh and did I mention the two summer classes I had to sign up for the take out the loan I needed to pay for student housing starts this week. Yay. Just to emphasize how unproductive I feel let me tell you where I thought I would be by now. My python review should have already been done but I have a few more lessons to go. I haven't even started my review of java. Theres six lessons of discrete structures I need to teach myself because I only focused on passing the class and not actually learning, but I've only gotten through one. One freaking lesson! I am doing better at getting back into yoga and exercising but its hard to do it consistently because our work schedule is random and I just can't exercise the day of and after work. In four weeks Ive only been skating once and all my motivating for trying to learn to cook vegetarian meals or any meals is just gone out the window. So yeah that how behind I am. I go on social media and youtube and see all these productive college students killing it, especially the ones who are also majoring in computer science, and I just can't help but thing about how pathetic I am. They have these apps and startups and I can barely code. I haven't even started a project that isn't related to classwork. And its gonna get worse because after this week it'll be work and class work. I would cut something out but its all so important to me. I need to strengthen my coding skills because my future depends on it, I need to take my health seriously, skating is the only hobby I have and interesting thing about me, I really want improve my eating habits, and to do most of this I need income so I need the job. idk what to do.", "author": "r-e-w-13", "created": 1623123365, "retrieved": 1632842259, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h0zq5lc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuvdpf/summer_not_going_as_planned/h0zq5lc/", "text": "Thank you u/r-e-w-13 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
