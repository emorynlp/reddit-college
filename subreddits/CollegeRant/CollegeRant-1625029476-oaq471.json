I honestly don\u2019t know what to do I did everything right I did everything they said and I am still struggling and felt like I have not learned anything and had to teach myself which is not great considering I am not good at math in the first place. I worked so hard to get to where I am and to see it possibly end due to this class is devastating to say the least. Idk what to do I cant afford to pay for and take this course again so I\u2019ll have to figure it out or not graduate\u2026 can i also say aleks sucks and idk why any accelerated class would use this godforsaken math program \ud83d\ude12. I\u2019m just so tired and my final is tommorrow at 7:30 pm but I have to work before so no chance to work on it beforehand. I just needed to vent honestly \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e.", "author": "Silver_Least", "created": 1625029476, "retrieved": 1632842159, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h3j0lb2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oaq471/might_not_graduate/h3j0lb2/", "text": "Thank you u/Silver_Least for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
