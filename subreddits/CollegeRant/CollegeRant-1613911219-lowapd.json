The classes get bigger and bigger, and the lectures become filled with nonsensical jargon that you could read off the textbooks from with little to no practical examples or hands-on experience.\n\nDon't worry about the $4000+ a semester if you're paying for 4 courses at once, or $1000 if you decide to only take one. Oh. Did you forget about the other parking fees, textbook fees, other class fee utilities like some clicker app or pearson subscription? Don't worrrrry about it.\n\nCollege is just a business run to suck money out of the majority of people nowadays and only cater to a small few, and even that small few have it hard to even pull a decent job with no connections or practical experience on their resumes with even bachelor's.\n\nYou're better off just going into an internship or entry level job without the damn degree and working up from there instead of wasting your time in college. At this point, it tries to teach irrelevant courses to you in order to suck out the most money from you in the longest time possible all under the guise of \"paying to teach yourself\".", "author": "Alextherude_Senpai", "created": 1613945415, "upvotes": 7}, "go98b14": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lowapd/does_anyone_else_feel_like_this/go98b14/", "text": "That's how it was for my last semester.
