Yes, you need to know the material for career purposes but much of that will come from experience I believe. You won\u2019t even make it to that point however if you can\u2019t pass....\n\nThis is why I was forced to drop my chemistry II class this semester. The professor believed it was the students fault the highest grade received on exams was around a B with the class average more around a 40?! In a fake attempt to help us he asked what we would want to change in future exams and I simply requested a REVIEW, his response was a chuckle like I was mental for asking and he said we are given the chapters covered and that should be enough...it is CHEMISTRY! The book is just simple definitions, his class lectures? Just elementary examples of reactions. Test? Nothing recognizable from the 40 plus hours of tedious homework going over the same reactions or pointless lectures. Considering letting department head know. I\u2019m an A student in all my other classes. \n\nBasically I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not just you.
