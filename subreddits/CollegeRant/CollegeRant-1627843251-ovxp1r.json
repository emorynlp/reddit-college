  "title:": "I want to write a book about the college experience during COVID",
  "text": "I'm a reporter for my college newspaper, and I also really love reading creative nonfiction. Ever since last year I've been thinking that it would be cool to write a nonfiction book about what U.S. college was/is like during the pandemic. I want to hear the stories of students all across the country and tell them. I want to convey exactly how painful and confusing being in college is right now, and I want to hold colleges and the government accountable for their mistakes. There's been books written about COVID already (obviously), but no books about COVID + college. \n\nMy questions for this subreddit are: \n\n1) Does this book idea sound interesting or compelling to you? Why or why not?\n\n2) Would you be willing to share your own personal 'college during the pandemic' story with me, or the story of your college as a whole (i.e. how your college struggled financially, questionable decisions/changes they made, etc.)?",

Maybe try focusing on government/colleges (social institutions) mistakes & making them take accountability + basically what covid was/is like in general. I could see that being a book k-12 schools require children to read. I\u2019m in college & also work at a hospital as a nursing assistant. IMO (it\u2019s a biased one, sorry) what I saw in the hospital could never compare to hardships in college where ppl felt like they had FOMO or creating relationships, etc. I don\u2019t want to invalidate anyone\u2019s feelings because I also share similar ones, but the main problem and what will always stick with me comes from the actual symptoms & outcomes of people who I cared for. It seems selfish to me to focus on first world problems (like hardships with college + covid) when millions have died and lack adequate healthcare.",

          "text": "That's a good point. I absolutely agree with you that the suffering of college students can't really compare to the suffering of many other groups of people. During 2020, I actually thought to myself that I was *glad* that I was a college student and not a young child or a middle aged or elderly person. In a lot of ways college students have it pretty good right now, relatively speaking. I don't want my book to make it seem like the troubles of American college students outweigh the troubles that many other people are facing.\n\nHowever, I can't tell every story. I'm a college student myself, and I can relate to the struggles of college students during this time. This is the story that I am confident I can tell, that I am passionate about telling. I will hope and trust that others will choose to tell the pandemic stories that they are personally equipped to tell (for example, you can tell stories from the perspective of an essential worker since you're a nursing assistant).",
