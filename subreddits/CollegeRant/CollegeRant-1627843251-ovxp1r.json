Ever since last year I've been thinking that it would be cool to write a nonfiction book about what U.S. college was/is like during the pandemic. I want to hear the stories of students all across the country and tell them. I want to convey exactly how painful and confusing being in college is right now, and I want to hold colleges and the government accountable for their mistakes. There's been books written about COVID already (obviously), but no books about COVID + college. \n\nMy questions for this subreddit are: \n\n1) Does this book idea sound interesting or compelling to you? Why or why not?\n\n2) Would you be willing to share your own personal 'college during the pandemic' story with me, or the story of your college as a whole (i.e. how your college struggled financially, questionable decisions/changes they made, etc.)?", "author": "shirbert6540", "created": 1627843251, "retrieved": 1632841687, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h7cb1c9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ovxp1r/i_want_to_write_a_book_about_the_college/h7cb1c9/", "text": "Thank you u/shirbert6540 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

IMO (it\u2019s a biased one, sorry) what I saw in the hospital could never compare to hardships in college where ppl felt like they had FOMO or creating relationships, etc. I don\u2019t want to invalidate anyone\u2019s feelings because I also share similar ones, but the main problem and what will always stick with me comes from the actual symptoms & outcomes of people who I cared for.
