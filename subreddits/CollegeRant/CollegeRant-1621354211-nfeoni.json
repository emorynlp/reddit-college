So last semester, I did my absolute best and ended with straight A\u2019s (1 A-) to boost my culmulative. This semester my classes were much tougher, so I didn\u2019t expect straight A\u2019s again but I expected majority A\u2019s and like 2 B\u2019s. Well now we\u2019re coming to the end I have an A an A- 2 B+ and a B. The thing is tho is that one of the B+\u2019s is literally 1.17 away from being an A-. So I nice asked (I did not request, just ask) if she would be rounding final grades for the class this semester and if not that would be completely fine. She completely ignores my email and sends one to the class w like the stats from the final and says \u201cI will not be taking final grade requests\u201d, basically throwing shade at me even tho I never said \u201cchange my grade to an A-\u201c I just asked if she would be rounding for the whole class. But I\u2019ve literally gotten 98%-100% on every single homework and I have B\u2019s on both exams (it was hard to get an A on an exam as each question was worth 13.3 pst so you could only miss like 2) but I\u2019m still 1.17 short of an A-. Anyways, getting a B+ in this class drops my semester gpa to below a 3.5 so now I\u2019m not gna be on the deans list that I worked so hard to try and get on again. And to add salt to the wound it\u2019s gna lower my culmulative gpa by .2.  Now I know to some these may be good grades and they definitely are but the reason I\u2019m so concerned is because I\u2019m planning on applying to grad school in the fall and having a low culmulative isn\u2019t great. I had a 3.41 and now I\u2019ll have a 3.38. I wanna apply to competitive top schools but now I fear that my grades are really gna hold me back. I just can\u2019t believe that 1 fucking point can cause so much damage. Like if I was 3+ point away I\u2019d be able to accept it but I can\u2019t accept that 1 damn point may ruin my future.", "author": "Rosedawson19", "created": 1621354211, "retrieved": 1632950138, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"gypefbb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nfeoni/im_so_madsaddisappointed/gypefbb/", "text": "Most professors do not round, and those that do certainly are unlikely to round over a point. Your future is not ruined by (more than) 1 point. You gpa is not a 3.38 because of that (more than) one point in that one class. It is a cumulative reflection of your work in all classes from all semesters. Grad school is going to care about more than your GPA - entrance exam score (GRE, LSAT, etc.) and recommendation letters are huge. Your professor sent that email because you weren\u2019t the only one she got one from, and it\u2019s easier to just address the issue with everyone at once.
