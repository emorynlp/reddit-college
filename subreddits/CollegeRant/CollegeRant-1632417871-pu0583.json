The Authors (who write the textbooks) would call in unable to even speak with Cengage about their published works. The physical books, when converted to eBooks don\u2019t have the same page numbers. So naturally students would call in really confused when trying to find assigned reading or sighting sources. They didn\u2019t update their courses and book material to run without Flash!\n\nBut now I\u2019m back in school. For reference I\u2019m a Cyber Security student.\n\nMy classes are all online, with no video lectures or meeting times. The instructor fully relays on the Cengage Book and the online course that they create. \n\nThe books content isn\u2019t laid out in the order I think it should be. It jumps around from topic to topic and I find it easier just to pull up a YouTube video on the subject. That usually explains it much better. Sometimes the text won\u2019t elaborate on an important topic and instead says \u201cfor more info go to this link\u201d. The link is always some site that looks like it was a paid promo.\n\n\nI personally find their lab simulations irritating as well. The Live Virtual Machines are down all the time. There isn\u2019t enough context to go with the labs. \n\nAnyone else with this issue?\n\nTL:DR Cengage books and courses suck so bad\u2026 so bad.", "author": "mariastranger", "created": 1632417871, "retrieved": 1632840985, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hedhfrc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pu0583/does_anyone_else_hate_cengage_courses/hedhfrc/", "text": "Thank you u/mariastranger for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
