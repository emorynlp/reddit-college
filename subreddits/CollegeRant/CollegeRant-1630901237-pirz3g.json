They all dress so immodestly and completely different than me. I feel so stupid. I hate to party. Males won\u2019t even acknowledge me because I don\u2019t look like a whore. I just feel embarrassed. I so badly want to die. I just want to go home. I\u2019ve been sobbing every night since being here.",

I hate to be a downer all the time but everyone told me that it will get better and if anything it\u2019s just gotten worse.",

Sometimes women dress to show off their body if theyre like, going out to the club and are looking to take a guy home. Sometimes we dress cute/revealing because we *just fucking want to*. Dressing cute makes you feel cute. I promise you that most women dont wake up everyday and think \"what can I wear that will most please the men who will see me?\" Lolol fuck no. Has it ever occurred to you that women dress because of their desires and motativions based on what THEY want, not what some random dude would like? Same with makeup. A lot of women genuinely enjoy the process of applying it, and the confidence boost of seeing themselves looking hot. The fact that men enjoy that type of attire is a side affect, not the goal.",
