Is it kind of worthless ? kind of. \n\n2018 Worst year of my life. had to put my cat down, month later fianc\u00e9e and girlfriend of 7 years cheated on me and gave me mono. Failed out of an accredited radiology program likely due to depression and mono. Wallowed in misery for a year.\n\n2019 started back at school in biology as it is the only thing I am good at, while working full time lost 30 lbs  all thanks to stress and lack of sleep.\n\n2020 Been dealing with some of the worst professors I have ever had to deal with in my life I have in general loved my teachers and professors beforehand. These university professors were so full of themselves and more concerned with their research. \n\n2021 finally done and tired this sub has been amazing. I do not plan on going back to school as I have seen the education system as a broke one. I am not sure of what I am going to do but I really want to try and be a pharma rep. It will be hard and competitive but it will not compare to these last few years\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not doubt yourself guys I was a sad miserable depressed turd at the end of 2018. Just one step each day trying to make myself better is what it took. It was long and painful and made me question my sanity but I did it, and if I could I promise you guys could I promise.", "author": "fruithat123", "created": 1621004171, "retrieved": 1632951596, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gy6tql6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ncajt1/finnally_damnit/gy6tql6/", "text": "I read this shit expecting poetic literature and started tearing my eyes three sentences in.
