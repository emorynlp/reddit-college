  "text": "So due to covid my university had cancelled exams worth 25 marks out of the total 100 in each subject. Instead they were giving out assignments. It was like writing a 1000 words essay for 5 marks, writing a research paper for 10 marks (for every subject). Till now I had submitted around 5 assignments and was in the middle of submitting 3 more assignments (I had completed one of it. It was also a research paper). And now the \"professors\" have informed us that they'll be taking the exams and that basically our assignments meant nothing. The exams are also supposed to start from next week.\n\nI don't know what to do other than cry.\n\nEdit : Thank you everyone for the kind words.",
