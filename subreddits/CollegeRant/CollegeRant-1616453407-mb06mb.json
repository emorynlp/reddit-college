Earlier on this year, the university preemptively cancelled our spring break. I don\u2019t know anyone that uses the spring break to travel down to the beach and drink. Most people, myself included, literally use it to relax, work, study for any upcoming exams, or simply just sleep. But instead, we\u2019re pushing on like business as usual. Makes me upset, since this has already been a long, strenuous semester. Semesters are usually like this in a normal year, but add the pandemic, social isolation and online school to that list, and it makes it much more harder. I honestly don\u2019t know if there would be a \u201csurge\u201d in cases if Spring Break wasn\u2019t cancelled. It probably wouldn\u2019t have made a difference in the case numbers anyway..\n\nTl;dr: College cancelled spring break; college student upset about it.", "author": "atmoscience", "created": 1616453407, "retrieved": 1632843526, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"grv6dei": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mb06mb/this_was_supposed_to_be_my_spring_break_week/grv6dei/", "text": "Thank you u/atmoscience for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
