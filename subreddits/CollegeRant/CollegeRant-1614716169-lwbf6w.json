  "title:": "Is transferring from CC to university supposed to be the most challenging feat known to mankind?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve talked to my counselor multiple times about transferring to a particular school and almost every bit of information I\u2019ve gotten hasn\u2019t translated to the university. I was told multiple times (by multiple people) that the university would accept my associates as basically I\u2019ve completed all of my undergraduate classes and I\u2019d be ready for the school of business. I\u2019ve submitted my application for the school of business and have been talking to admissions at this school and holy shit I\u2019m about to lose my mind. My application has been put on hold like 5 times now because they keep finding shit that they don\u2019t like. The most recent one is that I didn\u2019t complete this one class to get into the school of business (which contradicts the whole associates counts as all undergraduate classes). I had to schedule a meeting with an advisor and the earliest I can get in is in a month. The best part is my CC doesn\u2019t even offer the class that they require lmaooo. I\u2019m in college limbo atm",

      "text": "My friends and I used to joke about how the community college we went to would purposefully try to fuck up so you would have to stay an extra semester or two to catch up on classes. Hell, I have friends now who listened 100% to the counselors and are on their FOURTH YEAR. The ones who said \"fuck you\" to the counselors were out by the second year, such as myself. \n\nThe best bet for you OP is to use Assist.org. It is a website that allows you to pick your community college and any college you would like to attend, and then find out which classes you have to take so as to be accepted. It's in-depth enough to know the specific class name you will have to take at your community college. If you are trying to apply to a UC, use IGETC. Go to the advisor during the beginning, middle, or end of the academic year to verify you are on the right track and take any of their advice with a grain of salt. For example, an advisor told me to take trigonometry instead of starting calculus because \"it's easier and faster\" but all it did was keep me behind a semester in calculus.\n\nAlso depending on how 'necessary' the class is, some colleges don't give a rat's ass if you miss a single mandatory class",

      "text": "This seems like a weirdly unique situation you have lol. My experience from transferring colleges was pretty easy - just the experience you described as anticipating having, my associates was counted as 99% of undergrad courses and I was able to start on my major right away. \n\nAlthough, some schools require you take the direct prereqs for your major at their school. That's what kinda sounds why the school you're trying to transfer to is peeved - because you don't have the direct requirements for their school of business and you're trying to apply to that.\n\nAlso could be more difficult depending on where you're transferring to and where you earned your associates. Some schools don't use DTAs (direct transferable agreements - basically where ur associates would be ur undergrad) with certain states because their curriculum is not up to the state's or the school's standards.",

      "text": "Ugh the worst. CCs are notorious for this and I didn\u2019t know until I experienced it myself. I suggest checking what classes you need for transferring to the program at the university, and compare it to what you have. Assist.Org helps a lot too. \n I was screwed by counselors who were telling me I was \u201cdone\u201d, then i would apply to the university and get rejected. It happened twice before I finally completed every requirement because I said fuck these counselors and researched myself and created my own checklist/path of classes required by the  program at the CSU I was applying to. I partially blame myself for not being proactive but also the counselors/ \u201cadvisors\u201d for not giving proper information either. Best of luck!",

Then I transferred and found out they didn't accept any of the business courses I took at CC to keep their AACSB business school accreditation and half of the general education courses were not required at the university. So I basically wasted a lot of time and paid thousands of dollars for classes I didn't need.",

Then every semester call and make sure the classes you're taking will transfer. It seems extreme to do every semester but trust me it's worth it. CC is terrible at keeping up to date and often they don't communicate with the actual university. It sucks when people don't do their jobs. But that just means you'll have to do it yourself because in the end of you don't you're the one that gets fucked over not them. Take it into your hands immediately",

They will omit information that will eventually hold you back or lead you astray with classes you don\u2019t even need. The concept of transferring SEEMS easy, given you have the right connections to good academic advisors. But the reality is far from that. Most of the advisors don\u2019t really give a damn about the students they are paired with for advising sessions, because there\u2019s so many of them. Coming from a CC, I feel your pain 100%. When you transfer, try to get in contact with someone who is well-connected in your major and form a relationship  with them. They are usually the ones who are actually invested in your growth, as opposed to the sea of dismissive faculty at a CC. Best of luck, you are not alone in this situation!",
