  "text": "Hello so we just finished the sem and I feel super anxious whether or not I will get a scholarship for the next semester. I did pretty bad on one quiz (11 mistakes on a 20-item quiz) and I am so scared if that will super greatly affect my final grade. The previous scholarship I had was like a 100% one so we didn't have to pay for anything. Now I think I can only qualify for the 50% one since they raised the standards. I'm super scared coz Idk how to tell my parent about it and they basically shared it with all of our family. Idk what to do..feeling super anxious. BTW, I still don't know what my final final GWA is because not all subjects have released the grades, but I estimated what I think I got, and yeah.",
