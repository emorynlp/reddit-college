I pushed through the 4th time. The week before the final was a 3 or 4 day weekend. I was practically already drowning in a D, if not an F (it was an F), and I fell into a DEEP depression where I only ate alcohol and didn't leave my room before the final Monday morning unless it was to get food (alcohol). I think I had a cold too but I really can't remember. I didn't eat because I was so nervous about failing again and possibly destroying my GPA even further. I didn't even really think about food. \n\nThe last moment, Monday morning, panic hit me and I decided to show up cause I figured it was better to show up and fail than not show up and fail....WRONGO! \n\nI sat down in my seat a little hungover, felt pretty ok cause I knew the outcome. That's when my stomach started rumbling. It went from a rumble to the sound of wet spaghetti getting shot through a low velocity canon in a matter of seconds and I just felt sick like I hadn't eaten in 4 days. I kept pushing through cause I was hoping the sound was only audible to me...until the class queen shot me the death stare because I was distracting her (rightfully so). I kept pushing through until the kid sitting next to me couldn't take anymore and started giggling like a school child. I smiled at him and said fuck this...handed my wrong answered, half filled out paper and never came back. \n\nTalked to my faculty advisor about how bad at math I am and it's going to stop me from graduating. He didn't care about that. He just knew it was the wrong major for me. Switched me into one I am feeling much better in. \n\nI'm not saying you're in the wrong major, just know when to stop...and keep eating.", "author": "Pasquanch", "created": 1607574883, "upvotes": 27}, "gf8l3l3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ka5ou6/just_flunked_my_math_final_probably/gf8l3l3/", "text": "I\u2019m in the same boat, friend.
