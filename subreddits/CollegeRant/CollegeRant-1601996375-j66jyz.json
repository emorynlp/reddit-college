And breaking up screen time during the day would simply mean taking x3 as long to get through everything, so I just try to knock it all out with a few breaks. I wonder what health impacts this will have for students? I can guess :\\",

Eye doctors recommend doing this to avoid eye strain and worsening any vision problems you have. Please please please do this!\n\nAnd every hour, take a short 5 min. walk or stretch to make sure your muscles won\u2019t atrophy. It helps prevent shoulder/back/neck stiffness as well. Sitting is comparatively more unhealthier than smoking if leading a sedentary lifestyle over a long time period.\n\nPlease make sure to take care of yourself !!!! <3",

Turns out my eyes were literally drying out from looking at screens all day. I had to get a change in prescription because the damage is permanent :/ My eye doctor advised me to purchase blue light glasses (along with some expensive eye drops) and it\u2019s gotten better. \n\nIt upsets me that no one is really considering the impact zoom university will have on our health. Like my eye sight has been permanently changed because of this and it\u2019s just shocking to think of sometimes. I would suggest buying blue light blocking glasses and staying hydrated :)",
