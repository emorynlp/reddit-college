  "text": "I\u2019m going to have to withdraw from/drop out of college (for the second time) and I have nothing I\u2019m good at in life. I used to think I was good at school (this was in high school), but then I got to college. I\u2019m very severely mentally ill and even just sitting down to do my homework triggers tears for me to the point where I call my mom sobbing. If I stay I\u2019m failing out. Might have to live with my parents for the rest of my life /srs",

      "text": "I totally feel that. College is not your only option and college isn\u2019t for everyone. My brother and several friends have all taken different paths other than college. One went to a trade school and now makes more money than some college graduates. One got a fantastic internship and now has their dream job. \n\nThere are other options and college just might not be the right one for you. Do what is best for you! Go at your own pace, maybe in a few years college could be for you, if that is what you want. Life is not a race or a competition, just be the best you, whatever that is! Everyone has a purpose in life! Even if it is just the little things, like making someone else smile, or showing your mom that you love them. \n\nNow you mentioning that you have no talents. I highly highly doubt that is true. Everyone can learn something if you practice enough and everyone has a talent. You could learn guitar and become some famous musician! No college degree necessary lol. You can turn a favorite hobby into a career. \n\nThere are so many jobs out there that people never even realized were jobs. Maybe do some research and see what could fit you well. I wish you all the best and stop being so hard on yourself, you are fantastic!",

Plus to be quite honest, dropping a class and a little extra time management really went a long way. I'm by no means smart at all but I'm getting by. What did me wonders when trying to figure shit out was just attending a community college and getting gen ed credits out of the way while working. It helped keep my parents of my butt while giving me some space to figure shit out in my head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you're going through is rough but not the end of the world, just remember you're gonna get through this fam and many people have gone through this before. We all get burnt out and have our breaking points, nothing to be ashamed of homie :) I wish you the best of luck fr",

I sometimes feel dejected sometimes but you have to remember all the people who struggled in college and got through it and became successful but college is not all ok so do not overwhelm yourself, buddy.",
