  "text": "I\u2019m a prospective college student and in the app process and I HATE IT. ESPECIALLY THE FAFSA. I don\u2019t mean to be super yelly I\u2019m just REALLLLY PISSED because I just sat with my parentals to fill out that long ass form about 2020 tax returns and info that we don\u2019t even know because they filed a tax extension! We don\u2019t know any of the actual numbers, so we\u2019re just guessing and giving numbers that we think are as accurate as they can be, not having filed our taxes!! AND NOW\u2026 THE SITE WONT LET ME SAVE MY PROGRESS???? How could the dumbasses in the government not have thought that there would have been *significantly more* traffic on the site once the fafsa opened?? Now that I\u2019ve wasted my valuable time on this BULLSHIT, I\u2019m gonna have to try everyday for the next week just so I can beg the government for money to go to school for more time. AHHHHH.",

Those false numbers will get you into trouble that can vary but will impact your life (ex. Fraud, big fines, etc). \n\nTry using the IRS database retrival tool if you can or just wait until you have the correcr info to submit",

I just need to submit asap so that more aid is available and it would help if the DoE could accommodate the fact that we don\u2019t have tax info, because there was a question on the form that asked if we had the info. And I could have sworn that the form says I was ineligible to use the retrieval tool for some reason \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
