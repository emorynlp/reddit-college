I commited the awful mistake of not paying attention the first two classes of calculus and physics, and then when I tried to listen on the next class everything was super confusing, and I didn't want to ask the teacher because college teachers don't have any patience.\n\nSince then in all the tests and homeworks I just cheated. In physics was easy, thanks to the teacher-free whatsapp group chat in which we share all the answers. Calculus was a little tricky but Photomath and Symbiolab gave me everything I needed. I need to point out that this was all posible because of the online classes, if I was physically on classroom, this kind of cheating wouldn't be possible, and I probably would've payed more attention.\n\nBut why? Why would I do such thing? Because of an ultimatum. Before this semester my dad came to me and said \"If you withdraw, I will not pay for college anymore\". Boy I wish I could go back and really learn my calculus, but I can't go back. I have to pass even if I'm not learning shit.", "author": "Elmagoencapuchado", "created": 1605102156, "retrieved": 1632951478, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"gcp1ycv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/js8bu4/i_cheated_through_all_of_this_semester_because_i/gcp1ycv/", "text": "My whole class got caught cheating and were all under the notice of action of misconduct of cheating.

I have a major where most of my classes don't really matter. They're concepts you can APPLY. But at the end of the day it won't matter. So much of the content overlaps. I've just used quizlet and all the questions for all if my classes are there. It'd be one thing if i was a stem major or in nursing or something where I actually need to do the things I'm learning, but I don't. I just want my degree so I can get a better job than what I'm doing now. Especially since I'm kinda late to the party. Idgaf about the social aspect, friends partying, etc. I'm just trying to get my degree and get out with as little debt as possible so I can move on from my shitty job and get another shitty job that at least pays well enough for me to live better.

This is kind a super stressful semester for everyone, and then your dad adds to your load with stupid financial blackmail.\n\nI also get where you're coming from because I kind of did the same thing (albeit to a lesser degree). I'm a CompSci major and a freshman. I understand absolutely nothing about my Intro to Engineering Design course except our most recent assignments which are just creating programs that to solve assigned math problems. But before this, we've been doing Arduino projects that did nothing but confuse me (like you said many college professors are impatient and unhelpful). \n\nBut luckily all our assignments are just done by group, so I just let me teammates put the projects together and I do the (easier, but still important) job of putting all their work together in the report that gets us the points. Which basically means I copy+paste their pictures and write a short summary of what \"we\" did and what \"we\" learned working on it \"together\".\n\nAnd I've looked at the professor's ratings online, apparently that's a strategy used very frequently by her students\n\nIs it ethical? I mean, probably not, but I'm on my way to getting out of that class with an A and there have been zero complaints from my teammates so I'm not stopping. I also highly doubt this will impact my ability to properly do my future Computer Science job (again, I'm really good at the pure software stuff)\n\nSo basically, do what you got to do, man. College is full of a lot of crap classes and crap professors that cost tons of money. As long as you don't straight up pay someone to do your written work or take an exam for you, you're fine. Especially since all you're doing is getting extra information on stuff that you're unclear on (which is what you'd be expected to do in a real-world setting anyway)", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1605130798, "upvotes": 8}, "gby8920": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/js8bu4/i_cheated_through_all_of_this_semester_because_i/gby8920/", "text": "That degree is all that matters nothing more nothing less.", "author": "fruithat123", "created": 1605113978, "upvotes": 22}, "gby3t4u": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/js8bu4/i_cheated_through_all_of_this_semester_because_i/gby3t4u/", "text": "You did what you had to do.
