This Monday will be our 3rd week, first day of classes all 5 of my professors have assigned group work.  \n\nWe get like 2-3 days to work on the questions they assigned us. I\u2019m on different schedules, all of of my groups (16 people) it\u2019s so hard to get everyone on schedule. \n\nIt takes forever to get everyone to respond back with texts because we\u2019re all busy with other classes or many of us are working. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve finished one group work and I\u2019m still working on the other 3, we\u2019re all just gonna do it on a google docs and respond to the questions when we have time. \n\nI\u2019m working 2 jobs to try and pay of this $2000 college bill I owe, and I\u2019ve got 4 essays and 1 project all coming up this week, these were all assigned last Thursday and Friday. \n\nI\u2019m not great with time management, but I\u2019m trying here. \n\nI haven\u2019t slept since the first day of class. I\u2019ve finished 2 essays so far, I\u2019m gonna get started on the other 2 luckily all four are like 3 pages. \n\nAnd then I\u2019ll get started on my project on Monday since I have no work and it\u2019s not due until Friday. \n\n\nAnd one more thing about group work. I FUCKING HATE IT. No one has time to do it because we\u2019re all busy with other shit.", "author": "DumbHuman53", "created": 1600613124, "retrieved": 1632950856, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g61n6qq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iwf3nk/just_wanna_rip_my_hair_out/g61n6qq/", "text": "I pretty much dropped any class that had group work outside of class time to avoid this.

I have a project due tonight and I have been waiting all week for my parter to respond to one of my comments our my google slides. I can\u2019t continue until she responds to my comment!! And when she\u2019s done with her part she need a to send me her video so I can edit and upload it to YouTube so I can submit it, because I volunteered to edit it.
