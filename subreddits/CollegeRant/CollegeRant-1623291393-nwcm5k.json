I snuck in a thermometer to test the temperature and humidity. You'll never guess what the temperature was, 83 degrees and 75 percent humidity. This is in Idaho. It's not even 83 outside. \n\nIs this bull crap?", "author": "Upbeat-Ad-5678", "created": 1623291393, "retrieved": 1632842250, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h18dvmw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nwcm5k/what_conditions_can_a_university_subject_you_to/h18dvmw/", "text": "Thank you u/Upbeat-Ad-5678 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
