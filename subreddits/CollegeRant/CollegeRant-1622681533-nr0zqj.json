I was Varsity in college, the 5th fastest on my team. I can run a 23:30ish 6k and a 5:26 1600 m. (I'm female.)\n\nAnd somehow I failed my spring semester jogging and road racing p.e. class.\n\nWtf?!\n\nIt was probably due to absences, except I was only absent like 3 times which wasn't enough to get me marked down according to the syllabus but whatever...now I'm going to have to take an extra class in the fall so that I have enough credits to graduate ugh!\n\nUpdate #1: to everyone asking, yes, I did email the professor right away to ask why he failed me.\n\nUpdate #2: he responded and said it was a mistake! Apparently I missed the final (forgot there was one oops) so I didn't get an A, but I still passed the class.
