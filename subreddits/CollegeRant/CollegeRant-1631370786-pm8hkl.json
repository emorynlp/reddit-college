People who are smart, successful, creative, etc. all have this problem at some point.\n\nAsk yourself, \"Do I want to succeed and/or do the best I can?\" I assume the answer is yes. Then fundamentally hammer this into your brain that you CANNOT do that unless you take care of yourself first. Thus means food, sleep, and play are NECESSARY to your performance, not a distraction. You will do better on a project by leaving it, having a fun night, getting sleep, and returning to it the next morning than pulling an all-nighter to try to finish it.\n\nIn grad school it was not uncommon for me to be in lab at 1 AM.
