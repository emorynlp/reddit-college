Attended every lecture, did all the hw, went to office hours, went to review sessions etc. I got Bs on all my midterms and 90 or 100s on all the online midterms.  I didn't do well on my final exam (I had surgery a week before and fell behind) so I got a 73 on the final exam.  I'm currently sitting 0.1% away from getting the next letter grade up and the professor refuses to round up.  He says I clearly didn't master the material so why would he round it up.   Prior to this semester I have had a 4.0 in engineering.  I know it wasn't going to last forever but im pretty dossapointed I am literally one point or 0.1% from keeping it.   I'm pretty discouraged right now.  So frustrating.", "author": "drock121", "created": 1620107893, "retrieved": 1632951581, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 32, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gww6ic8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n4h8r2/01/gww6ic8/", "text": "You have my sympathy.
