Attended every lecture, did all the hw, went to office hours, went to review sessions etc. I got Bs on all my midterms and 90 or 100s on all the online midterms.  I didn't do well on my final exam (I had surgery a week before and fell behind) so I got a 73 on the final exam.  I'm currently sitting 0.1% away from getting the next letter grade up and the professor refuses to round up.  He says I clearly didn't master the material so why would he round it up.   Prior to this semester I have had a 4.0 in engineering.  I know it wasn't going to last forever but im pretty dossapointed I am literally one point or 0.1% from keeping it.   I'm pretty discouraged right now.  So frustrating.", "author": "drock121", "created": 1620107893, "retrieved": 1632843571, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gwvkhe0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n4h8r2/01/gwvkhe0/", "text": "Thank you u/drock121 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
