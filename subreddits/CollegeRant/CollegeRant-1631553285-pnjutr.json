For my entire academic career, I've been this perfectionist student who earns A's and B's but for some reason this semester I just don't care as much. That doesn't mean I'm not putting in any effort; I still have that perfectionist bone but I'm not obsessing over every word I put in my assignments and making sure every detail is correct. If I answered the prompt, I'm good. But I just don't have much energy or motivation to continue. I have to robotically make myself do my assignments. I actually like college in a way but at the same time I kinda just wanna graduate and start a career that will pay. I know work is boring and stressful too but at least you make money. I don't get paid to do my homework.\n\nI'm just done. The fact that I have to do this for two more years is killing me. It would be better if I had friends, even though I don't have much time to invest in any kind of relationship. Thankfully I have an in-person class that starts tomorrow so there's that.\n\nTL;DR: Feeling emotionally \"done\" with college and willing to just do the bare minimum.", "author": "snarkasm_0228", "created": 1631553285, "retrieved": 1632950820, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"hctlmz5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pnjutr/i_am_just_so_done/hctlmz5/", "text": "Graduating this December and I am already burnt out.
