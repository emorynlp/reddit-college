The fact that I don't have to travel all the way to class, I could web-surf more discretely, and I feel like I have the ability to leave at any time because once you're in an in-person class, you can't really leave without it affecting the class.\n\nBut now, most online classes require webcam and microphone. This is even worse than in-person classes because some people don't want to have to present themselves at home. Some people live in more unfortunate conditions than others and it becomes more apparent when we have to record ourselves at home.\n\nI think online classes, in general, are a little fun for a short period of time, but I can't do them all the time. We will lose most of our social skills by doing everything virtually and it's more difficult to present yourself professionally from home.", "author": "darkjordanx", "created": 1603842232, "upvotes": 5}, "gabi2i4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jj4q40/online_college_is_an_absolute_joke/gabi2i4/", "text": "Haha yeah.
