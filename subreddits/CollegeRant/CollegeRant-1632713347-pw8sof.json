  "text": "So for some context my school does require masks indoors, however people are allowed to take them off to eat/drink\n\nSo the other day I was at my schools student center eating breakfast before my first class and before I even finish my meal this middle aged man comes on the loudspeaker and says something like \u201cif you\u2019re not eating put your mask on\u201d. I didn\u2019t even think he was talking about me until right after I took a sip of  my drink and he came back on the loud speaker and says \u201cmask up when you\u2019re done drinking\u201d. Anyways this guy made like 5 different announcements about this within the timespan of 15 seconds. He finally shut up once I put my mask on, right before I threw out the rest of my breakfast and left. Oh and I also forgot to mention I was literally in an area with nobody around. I wish I was making this shit up\ud83d\udc80\n\nI swear I had more freedom in high school than I do here",

Plus I can\u2019t be the only one who thinks it\u2019s a bit overboard to call someone out on a whole loudspeaker for this even though they\u2019re not even really breaking the rules \ud83d\ude10",
