I didn\u2019t even think he was talking about me until right after I took a sip of  my drink and he came back on the loud speaker and says \u201cmask up when you\u2019re done drinking\u201d. Anyways this guy made like 5 different announcements about this within the timespan of 15 seconds. He finally shut up once I put my mask on, right before I threw out the rest of my breakfast and left. Oh and I also forgot to mention I was literally in an area with nobody around. I wish I was making this shit up\ud83d\udc80\n\nI swear I had more freedom in high school than I do here", "author": "Ugly_kid2", "created": 1632713347, "retrieved": 1632840982, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"hefk0fs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pw8sof/cant_have_shit_in_college/hefk0fs/", "text": "Thank you u/Ugly_kid2 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
