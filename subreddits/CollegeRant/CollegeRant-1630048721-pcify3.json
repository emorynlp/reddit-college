  "title:": "Feeling really depressed after moving 7 hours away from home to go on campus for the first time. I'm a little overwhelmed with everything.",
  "text": "My parents didn't really allow me to go outside much unless it was for school so I never really got to experience some independence and explore the world on my own accord. Heck they never even really allow me to go out with my friends so I was stuck in the house all day. That was one of the main reasons why I was so excited to finally break away from them and get my independence but so far I've felt nothing but homesickness, anxiety, and depression. I dont have a lot of friends here so I'm mostly alone. I eat alone in the campus dining halls. I'm having trouble exploring the huge campus of my university. The environment is just so new and different and I can't help but just wish I was a kid all over again and run to my parents and not have to deal with this.\n\nI'm sure I'll grow out of it sooner or later and slowly start to become more like an adult. Im really scared cuz I realize that this is my first step to getting a career to earn my own income and support my parents in the future. I really dont want to fail and I just don't feel confident at all in my abilities to succeed in college. I've never taken calc in HS and I'm horrible at math but I need to complete the calc course in order to get my degree and I'm just scared I won't be able to keep up. I'm scared I'll fail and let my parents down. I'm scared I'll let my whole family down. I can't afford to fail. I come from a poor family and I'm going to be their sole provider in the future. I wanna use these stakes to encourage me to work hard but I cant help but feel anxious at the same time which I feel is screwing me over.\n\nFor my freshman year, which was all remote, I mostly took easy gen ed courses and did pretty well on them. I took one technical course required for my major and got a B+. I know it's not horrible, but it isn't an A and I struggled a lot in the class. If I could excel in an intro chem course how am I supposed to excel in my other technical courses? I'm really just absolutely afraid of failing and idk how to deal with all this anxiety. I got lost in the area near my campus and realized how different everything was from my hometown and how there were so many ppl I didn't know and idk why but I just felt so discouraged and afraid. At that moment I really didn't want to be alive and it was just such a weird experience for me. I miss everyone back home. All the classmates I had known from elementary til HS, all going off to different colleges. Idk if I'll ever see them again. Idk if I can make new friends, if I'll get adjusted to college life, if I'll ever be able to truly grow up and function in the real world. I'm just rlly scared.",

      "text": "Just breath deeply and know that this feeling will pass. 2 years from now you will be desperate to finish your degree and independence will likely no longer be a concern lol. \n\nWhat you\u2019re going through IS scary, you will be experiencing a lot of things for the first time. This is a chance for you to grow into the person you want to be. It will be uncomfortable, but life is and you will be better for it, I promise! \n\nYou are capable and can accomplish your goals.  Don\u2019t let self doubt limit your ability. It will require hard work- but you CAN do it. \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that this college experience is to benefit YOU, no one else.",

      "text": "Hello, being overwhelmed by college happens to more freshmen than you think. In that case, it's pretty normal.\n\nOn your first few months away and if possible, you could visit your family more often. Video call them, message them. Maybe bring to your dorm (?) a family photo album as well. So you won't feel alone too much, also because you aren't. I can relate to growing up in the house all day, but I took it as an opportunity to learn household chores. At my dorm I could cook and clean and get stuff done. Thankfully haha.\n\nLeaving your parents' house really is part of becoming mature, and you're quite right, what you feel now will slowly be gone. \n\nChin up simply because you have good values in you. You plan to study so you could better yourself and be someone your family could rely on. Now that's a good foundation for being mature. Take it one day at a time. Eating alone is nothing to be ashamed of. It's kinda what we do in college haha. It will make you more confident in the long run. Also, no one's really judging you by that. It's all in your mind. So be kind to yourself and try not to overthink it. Also, you can try walking around one area at a time. Walk around the library until it becomes familiar, then move on to building floors etc.  \n\nFor calculus, if you know your algebra and trigonometry, you'd be fine. Also, \"Patrickjmt\" channel on youtube has great calc tutorials. Easy to follow and simple compared to others. For most people, it's also their first time studying calc in college.\n\nI suggest try not leaning too much on being the future sole provider of your family. I think this adds way too much pressure and anxiety especially for 4 or 5 years of your stay at uni. I also speak from experience.. Just know that your family would love to see you succeed. You wouldn't be this worried if you didn't care for your family. You're for real :)\n\nYou will fail, but you will also get up and try again after. That's being human. This skill will be very important to you in college.\n and in your social life. I hope you get the grades that you want. Getting anything lower isn't really a negative thing. Except maybe for those on a scholarship. So, accept possibly failing, but prepare and trust yourself to succeed. \n\nSome friends will stay, some won't. That is just life.  But yeah, keep in touch with them now and again. It's going to take effort to know people, so join an organization you like. Everyone's also putting themselves out there. \n\nTL;DR: Take small steps as you adjust to college life. It's normal for some to be this overwhelmed. Take care",
