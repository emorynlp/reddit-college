  "text": "I\u2019m going to community college and plan to transfer, but I\u2019m suffering really badly. I suspect that 1) either I have an undiagnosed mental disorder or 2) I don\u2019t, but could still benefit from therapy. However, my parents are averse to therapy (in the \u201cI-don\u2019t-care-but-you\u2019re-making-a-big-mistake\u201d way). How do I even begin getting about therapy? Do I have to wait until transferring - and how do I take care of myself in the meantime? It needs to be said that my parents are very controlling and emotionally immature folks.",

Like they can\u2019t even begin to know what\u2019s going on but think they\u2019re right about everything anyway. I\u2019d also suggest starting at your schools health center, everyone at my school has been so great.",

      "text": "If your community college has a health center, start there. Often colleges have doctors and counselors on site that can assist you while you are enrolled (my brother was first diagnosed with depression and prescribed medication to help this way). If they don\u2019t or are unable to help, I also recommend looking into online services. I utilize an app called Dr. On Demand, they have doctors, therapists and psychologists to assist and can often see you within 5 minutes at any time, day or night. They accept some insurances as well. I struggled through high school trying to convince my parents to let me go to therapy. I gave up on the idea after a while. Now, at *cough-30-cough* I\u2019ve been formally diagnosed with depression and pretty solid anxiety. I am going to therapy as well as taking some medications and no joke, I feel more like myself than I have in YEARS. You know your body and your mind better than your parents ever could, if you feel like you need some therapy- do it. Commit. I believe everyone can benefit from therapy, certainly, but it is up to you to stand up for yourself and get the help you need and deserve. Don\u2019t let doubtful parents or anything else stand in your way. In my own experience, it can be a devastatingly long road to feeling better if you let others talk you out of it.",
