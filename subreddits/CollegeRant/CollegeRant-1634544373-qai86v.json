  "text": "I\u2019m a first year undergrad \n\nI feel like a fucking disappointment. My head has been in a million places in the last week. My grandfather has been going to the ER almost weekly (no one knows why) . My family had a huge blow up. And I learned a situation from a few years ago wasn\u2019t what I though happened I\u2019m not comfortable going into detail. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to make excuses. I need advice on how to move forward. \n\nMy prof has been emailed (can\u2019t ask for an extension) explaining what happened. And I will be contacting my schools counselling service. \n\n\nTLDR: factors in my personal life/ mental health caused me to miss a deadline",

You\u2019ve emailed your professor and contacted who you need to contact, so you got that base covered. \n\nMissed assignments happen, you\u2019re not a disappointment. Life has been hard for you and you\u2019re doing what you can. And for some unsolicited advice, I suggest maybe putting everything you need to do in an excel document and then saving that and checking it daily if you\u2019re anxious about missing another one. I implemented that this semester and it\u2019s taken off so much anxiety.",

Just do what you can: contact your school counseling service or try to discuss this issue with your professor live. You shouldn't invent any reason for them - tell the truth, and I believe that you'll resolve your situation.\r  \nGood luck!",

      "text": "I can't give you advice on the administrative side of things, as that will be different for each country and probably each university.\n\nFor instance we have something called a 'm\u00e9lt\u00e1nyoss\u00e1gi k\u00e9rv\u00e9ny'. You get 3 of these for your entire life. If you miss a thing, you can use one up and get a second chance at any one exame or whatever.\n\nI can give you some advice on how to prevent this from happening again. Make a calendar in word or excel or laytec or Rstudio or whatever program you use regularly. Put every exam and midtearm and assignement in there. Make it routine to look at this calendar at least once a day. This way you won't ever miss anything, nothing will surprise you.  Putting the calendar together will help you oragnise all your stuff too.\n\nI also make a folder for each semester with all the class material and all relevant literature.\n\nA friend with whom you study regularly also helps, that way even if you do forget something, they will remind you.",

      "text": "This is a kind of situation many are going through right now, including myself. My best advice would be to not allow it to spiral out of control. Especially with project-oriented classes which build on themselves throughout the course, it is easy for one missed assignment to snowball into other missed assignments and eventually having to retake the class, because in order to move on you need to complete this weeks work in addition to all the work that wasn\u2019t finished from before. It\u2019s happened to me a couple times and it\u2019s not a good feeling, failing an entire class just because of one week when I felt particularly down for reasons beyond my control.\n\nYou\u2019ve already done well to contact your professors and counseling services; now just make sure you do everything you can to recover quickly in your classes, despite the circumstances. If you have friends at college, do homework with them in a library or somewhere so you can\u2019t get sidetracked. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about your failures because it\u2019s obviously not your fault, considering all that\u2019s going on right now, but at the same time make sure for your own sake that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThis includes taking good care of your mental and physical health, because you\u2019ll be more motivated to work if you are living well. Steady sleep schedule, eating consistently, showering, getting outside often, and socializing are all vital components to staying a functional adult but have a tendency to get neglected sometimes if you are living away from family for the first time.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can say, really; hope the rest of the quarter/semester works out alright for you.",

College is a lot about having a good schedule and staying on top of things.\n\nGood look with your personal events as well. Definitely do as others said and see if you can get an extension for your circumstances. My advice is general.\n\nStay well. Time will help you feel less disappointed in your self, it just takes time and a positive mentality. Life is hard.",

Could go either way with your prof, but when all is said and done, taking time to be with your family is the right move. Do what you have to pass the course and get better, but at the end of the day, a degree is a degree no matter how you get there. I once left campus and missed a quiz because my best friend was in Afghanistan and out of the blue he told me he had some time to play PS3, and you know what? I've never regretted it, and in fact I look back on it and am thankful because the memory of talking to my friend is much more important to me than a quiz. Obviously don't ignore your schooling and it's important to do the best you can, but missing an assignment for a family member's health doesn't mean that you aren't doing your best.",

If it\u2019s something larger and you explain what\u2019s been going on, they\u2019re likely to give you an extension (even if they said they would not in the first place) or have some sort of make up assignment. Always remember that school isn\u2019t the most important thing. You are the most important thing. Being there for your grandpa is an important thing. Take a deep breath. Things happen how they are supposed to happen. It will end up just fine in the end. I can say from experience that it feels terrifying and like you\u2019re a failure, but your professor has most likely made that same kind of mistake before too, and understands. Deep breaths",
