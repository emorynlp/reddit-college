I am struggling academically, mentally, physically, socially, emotionally, and financially. \n\nAcademically - I don\u2019t understand anything that is going on in class and I have a hard time trying to pay attention\n\nMentally - I am very exhausted and tired all the time and don\u2019t have the motivation to do anything\n\nPhysically - Just walking to class is very tiring\n\nSocially - I have no friends and don\u2019t have the energy to talk to people\n\nEmotionally - I feel depressed all the time and always tend to stay up very late\n\nFinancially - My dumb self took out financial aid when I didn\u2019t need it and now I\u2019m stressing over how I\u2019m suppose to pay it back\n\nI am struggling so much even though I am taking \u201ceasy\u201d classes. I am a freshman and all my class are gen ed, only taking 14 credits and I can\u2019t even handle this. I feel like it\u2019s only going to get worse from here.",

      "text": "Hey, I totally feel you.\n\nI don't exactly know the right things to say and I know that my comment alone won't take away any of your stress, but if I could give you any advice, however, I'd say maybe try to slow things down and take everything one day at a time (easier said than done). I personally am still trying to get a grasp on everything as well.\n\nJust for a little background, I am a freshman as well and taking 12 credits--- also what most people consider to be the \"easy\" classes... and to put it bluntly, I have never struggled more with school in my life.\n\nTo be fair, I have never been the best student, but I feel like since starting college I have been eating, sleeping, and breathing school work and it's still not good enough. Ever since the beginning of college, I've cut off communication with the only two friends I had (not intentionally), and I'm already failing two of my classes. I feel dumb sometimes because I feel like it's just expected for everyone to do everything and feel completely fine.\n\nBut, school is difficult. I see this as a fact.\n\nI think everyone is struggling somehow or another, and when I say that, I am in no way trying to say that your struggles are not valid! They 10000000% are!!! \n\nAll I mean by this is you are not alone.\n\nI feel like mental health is something that a lot of students (and people in general) tend to push aside in order to focus on school or other things (myself included), but sometimes you have to put yourself and your health first.\n\nI read something one day about this and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. It said something to the extent of:\n\nIf we have a cold or are injured in some sort of way, it is almost no question for us to stay at home and rest/do whatever we need to do in order to get better. But when it comes to mental health, we are pretty much taught to work through it, grin and bear it, and eventually, things will get better... But why treat the two so different? You're not going to continue to walk on your leg if it's broken because it will never heal, so why should we treat our minds in a similar fashion?\n\nI feel like this speaks measures about how people go about taking care of themselves; we tend to focus on merely the more \\~obvious\\~ things and ignore our internal status.\n\nI know life can feel exhausting and I really wish I knew something that could make things easier on you.\n\nI know I have no idea who you are personally, but I can tell that you care a lot about your education despite how it is affecting you. \n\nSometimes we need to just take a second away from everything else and just sit and breathe and think.\n\nSomething I personally like to do is journal when I get overwhelmed; It helps me to express how I'm feeling without exerting too much energy. (Reddit is also a great place to do this too!)\n\nBut yeah. College is hard. I feel like society put so much pressure on people, especially people our age (I am assuming you're around 18 like myself but if you're not I apologize for assuming).\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nI am so sorry that life is difficult right now and you feel mentally and physically exhausted, but I believe in you and I know that you can get through it. You are strong and more than competent.\n\nGood luck with everything\n\n<3",
