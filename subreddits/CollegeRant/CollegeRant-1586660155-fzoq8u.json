Well one of my scholarships is &\n$2,500 per semester. That\u2019s a lot of money but it requires me to keep a 3.0 GPA.\n\nThis drives me nuts because sometimes you just get a bad professor. Some classes are impossible to pass with a B. Right now I\u2019m working my ass off to get a D up to a C while keeping all of my other grades at an A for a buffer. It\u2019s really starting to stress me out because I can lose this scholarship!!", "author": "GabbyTheLegend", "created": 1586660155, "retrieved": 1632843568, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"fnwydhy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fzoq8u/scholarship_that_require_yo_to_maintain_a_high/fnwydhy/", "text": "Yep I\u2019m at like a 2.7 when I need a 2.9 after a truly awful transition to college.
