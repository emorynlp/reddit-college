  "text": "So I'm trying to study for a calculus exam and I'm going over the exam review and additional worksheet and I honestly don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I've looked over my notes, I've watch hundreds of videos, I go to tutoring and office hours bit I just don't understand anything and I just feel like an idiot. \n\nI get that calculus is known to be a difficult class but I feel so behind compared to everyone else. I'm the only one who ask questions in class (usually asking to elaborate or explain what he did and why) and everyone just goes on there phones while he explains it. Am I the only one who doesn't understand?\n\nI just feel so pissed and angry and useless. People tell me how smart I am but I feel like such a jackass",

I suggest watching black pen red pen. \n\nCalculus requires a lot of prerequisite knowledge. \n\n\nSay taking derivative requires binomial expansion. \n\nMaybe u can ask the question here and see whether we can help.!",

      "text": "The people who aren\u2019t asking questions or are on there phones are likely just as confused as you. It\u2019s either they\u2019re too afraid to ask, or they don\u2019t give a shit about their grades.\n\nYou just have to keep pushing and doing practice problems until it clicks. But be proud of the fact that you\u2019re putting in the hard work and commitment to try and do well. College is more about studying and dedication than it is being intelligent.",
