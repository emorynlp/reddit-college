  "text": "So many awkward & cringe stories these past two years of remote school. Breakout rooms have personally been such a missed opportunity and have potential as a concept, but somehow so poorly educated they get all students to quit zoom once the professor announces breakouts. Has ANYONE had them go well? how??",

          "text": "Absolutely this. I fluctuate between thinking of it as \"group leader\", \"designated adult\", and \"TA surrogate\".  I feel like I take on that role so often even when I don't really want it, but otherwise the limited time is wasted. My biggest gripe is I think it presents me as knowing more than I do or thinking higher of myself than I do.",
