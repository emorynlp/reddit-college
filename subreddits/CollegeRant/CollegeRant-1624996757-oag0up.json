SO MUCH", "text": "Now in my grad school search, I realized how important location is to college, career, and transitioning to life after college. I am glad I picked a local university first over one in a dense city where I would have to start from the ground up and feel less safe doing things alone at like 18.\n\nI realized as I compare graduate programs in other locations that I don't want to live in a campus bubble. I've been trying to look at the community as a whole and see how I'd fit into it.  Not to throw shade, but there are some amazing schools in the *worst* areas (in terms of safety, affordability...) and I just don't have the energy for all that...looking at you Chicago and Baltimore\n\nAs someone who moved around a *lot* growing up, to begin with, I think going to a small school in an area near family was the best choice I could've made for myself. Partly for the financial aid and then COVID, but also because it was easier to get to know people. In that sense, I had quick access to local professionals in my field of interest. Interviewers relate to me because their kids go to the same high school I did or they also went to my university. We can talk about like restaurants and events. Literally was invited to eat out after a remote interview because I already live in the area.\n\n**TL;DR** After cost and program I would prioritize location and can't emphasize it enough for those who forget there's a life beyond the campus", "author": "odgoodli", "created": 1624996757, "retrieved": 1632842156, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"h3h8wfm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oag0up/for_college_location_matters_so_much/h3h8wfm/", "text": "Thank you u/odgoodli for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Went to the university that was right where I grew up. Tuition was a steal for a top tier research university. I still have a lil bit of debt from that. But the silver lining is that my grad school will be paid for when I move to hawaii. I really wanted to study out of state in my undergrad but just wasnt sure what my niche was and didnt want to waste my money. Looking back it was a good idea for me to not get my debt doubled and be naive in a new environment. Found that patience and persistence is key. It is not sacrifice but making the hard choice that will benefit you in the end", "author": "ernkrellteam", "created": 1625021491, "upvotes": 3}, "h3i246f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oag0up/for_college_location_matters_so_much/h3i246f/", "text": "I realize not all have the luxury of a good home life and/or geographical convenience, but for those who have the opportunity to go to a local university while still living with their parents, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend doing so if you can stand to. The \"college experience\" is pretty overrated and it is infinitely more worth it to save money. Between not having to pay for housing and the scholarships I earned, I was able to graduate debt free and I am beyond thankful now to not have any student loans hanging over my head. You can still network with your professors and hang out on campus; any networking loss from paying for an overpriced dorm is negligible.", "author": "Eighth_Octavarium", "created": 1625010789, "upvotes": 4}}}
