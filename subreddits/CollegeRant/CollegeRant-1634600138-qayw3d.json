  "title:": "Anyone else setting their alarm clock early in the morning even on the days they don't go to college just to have the satisfaction of closing it and going back to sleep again?",
  "text": "I wake up for college 6.30am to be there on 9.30 and waking up for me is awful. I hate when I have to wake up at the sound of the alarm and having to leave my cozy and warm bed being covered in blankets.\n\nI hate it so much that I put it on even on the nights that I don't have college the next day just to have the satisfaction of closing the damn thing and continue my peaceful sleep. Kinda retarted I know, but it's my way of taking revenge on the thing.\n\nTL;DR: I put the alarm on, on the days that I don't have to wake up for college just to have the satisfaction of rejecting it.",

My friends find it weird that I do that on the days I have off. \n\nBut it\u2019s this feeling I get, like how you described it. \n\nI purposely will wake up 6am on a Friday (don\u2019t have classes on that day) and I like to stay awake for 2 hours, then eat and then I want my body to feel tired just so I can go back to sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s weird but I enjoy it.",
