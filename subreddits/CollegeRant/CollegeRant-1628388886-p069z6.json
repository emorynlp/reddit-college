I have been trying to get them for over a year and nobody has been able to help me. Only now, in my third semester of community college, have they finally been granted to me. \n\nEVEN THOUGH MY SAT ALONE QUALIFIED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. \n\nAnd now, for some reason, even though I can SEE THE MONEY in my student account, it won't go through. And nobody can help me.\n\nI hate my school's financial aid department. And sometimes I wish I just went to public school so my damn records were all in the same place.", "author": "depressedstudent25", "created": 1628388886, "retrieved": 1632841657, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h84i4ev": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p069z6/just_need_to_vent_about_getting_financial_aid/h84i4ev/", "text": "Thank you u/depressedstudent25 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
