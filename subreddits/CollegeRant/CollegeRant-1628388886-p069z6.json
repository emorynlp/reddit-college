I have been trying to get them for over a year and nobody has been able to help me. Only now, in my third semester of community college, have they finally been granted to me. \n\nEVEN THOUGH MY SAT ALONE QUALIFIED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. \n\nAnd now, for some reason, even though I can SEE THE MONEY in my student account, it won't go through.
