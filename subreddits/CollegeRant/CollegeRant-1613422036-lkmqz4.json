Finishing my degree this semester and couldn't care less about my grades. Professors are making my life insanely hard. Online college is so fucking shit that I wonder if it's legal for them to charge us for it.

I was lied to in high school about college and my college advisors have lied to me.\n\nBut by saying that, I feel unstoppable. I will not let any decisions be affected by others and will do everything by myself. I will not fall into traps made to make money and I will never get down of my knees to give head to some superior I will be working for. Don't get sad, Get angry.
