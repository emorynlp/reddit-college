  "text": "I know in my heart it\u2019s because I got out of an abusive relationship, was made homeless twice, COVID, working 65 hours a week etc. I just can\u2019t shake the feeling of being a failure. \n\nMy advisor also pushed for me to graduate - hard, despite it being a semester early and I told her I wasn\u2019t ready. Now I\u2019ve missed course enrollment deadlines and I\u2019m confused and hurt. Idk if I can even get my scholarship for next semester now.",
