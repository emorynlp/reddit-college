  "text": "TLDR: my university is forcing me (an immunocompromised person) to attend in-person classes or else they\u2019ll take my scholarships. \n\nI\u2019m so angry towards my university! I am an art student at a large school in the Midwest. All of my art classes are being held in-person or hybrid (12 credit hours this semester) and my gen-ed English class is online (three credit hours). The in-person component of my classes does not bode well for me because I have asthma. I can\u2019t take the risk. I also don\u2019t want to take online art classes... because why would I pay $24k per year to take online ceramics and painting classes?? \n\nI decided a couple months ago that I was going to stay home this year. My only concern was my scholarship package, because it says in the fine print that I have to be a full-time student and I have to finish in 4 consecutive years. I can\u2019t afford to go to school without it. So I talked to the person in charge of awarding the specific merit scholarship, and he said I should write an appeal letter and not worry too much. \n\nI wrote my appeal letter and attached a note from my doctor with proof of my asthma. Well, today I gotta the official response: it basically said \u201ctoo f*cking bad... you need to come back to school.\u201d Ugh!!!! It feels like the university doesn\u2019t care if I live or die, they just want my chunk of $$$$$. I\u2019m still hopeful that I can register with disability office and ask for this as a reasonable accommodation, but with classes starting in three weeks, that\u2019s not a lot of time to wage war with the admissions office, disability office, financial aid office, and whoever else I have to talk to. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",

I know you\u2019re also trying to avoid shitty online classes, but most colleges seem to be providing online versions of their in person classes (live video lectures, online exam options, etc). Even if you have to go back, you may still be able to do it safely",

In fact, steroidal medication used to prevent/manage asthma may help reduce ACE2 expression and prevent a lot of the inflammation seen typically in COVID-19 patients. \n\nThat all being said - I understand not wanting to take the risk. I understand and agree with everyone here posting about how OP needs to advocate for themselves.

I have been working with a great advisor all along so I talked to her and stopped going to class in early March, before the school went online and blah blah very random small technicality lost all my aid (and I am full-ride) so fucking yikes. \n\nI was zooming with my advisor like every other day and she had to really dig deep and appeal to tons of people but she was determined and got it fixed for me. I never could have done it on my own.\n\nThis is my second go at college and the first time it didn\u2019t even cross my mind to find an advisor beyond basic required meetings because I knew what best for me of course. Well I cannot advocate for it enough. Idk if I am just lucky and got a good advisor but she has helped me so much and just knowing I have someone who I can turn to when idk who else to ask has been so valuable.",

But the university I have already given a small fortune to won\u2019t do the right thing. So frustrating!!! Working with my advisor is a great idea.

All I ask of my university is two things: a high quality education and a safe environment. My quality of education will be severely diminished, in addition to my safety concerns. Being an art student means nothing when I can\u2019t intern at the local galleries, go to networking events, get to know my professors, use the studios, work with the resident artists, etc. Ya know? \n\nI still like the idea of getting everyone involved. I\u2019ll definitely make a Zoom appointment with my advisor and my mentoring professors. I already talked to my favorite professor whom I respect a lot, but even he said that masks will lowkey not be required in his class and he thinks this is just the flu. Even if I did get the courage to go to school, I anticipate having be surround myself with idiots who believe this is just a hoax or political stunt or whatever. If the virus doesn\u2019t kill me, then seeing a bunch of morons doing risky shit might lol\n\nAgain, thank you for your insight.",
