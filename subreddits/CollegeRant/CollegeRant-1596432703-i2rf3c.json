If I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t afford to get my degree.", "text": "TLDR: my university is forcing me (an immunocompromised person) to attend in-person classes or else they\u2019ll take my scholarships. \n\nI\u2019m so angry towards my university! I am an art student at a large school in the Midwest. All of my art classes are being held in-person or hybrid (12 credit hours this semester) and my gen-ed English class is online (three credit hours). The in-person component of my classes does not bode well for me because I have asthma. I can\u2019t take the risk. I also don\u2019t want to take online art classes... because why would I pay $24k per year to take online ceramics and painting classes?? \n\nI decided a couple months ago that I was going to stay home this year. My only concern was my scholarship package, because it says in the fine print that I have to be a full-time student and I have to finish in 4 consecutive years. I can\u2019t afford to go to school without it. So I talked to the person in charge of awarding the specific merit scholarship, and he said I should write an appeal letter and not worry too much. \n\nI wrote my appeal letter and attached a note from my doctor with proof of my asthma. Well, today I gotta the official response: it basically said \u201ctoo f*cking bad... you need to come back to school.\u201d Ugh!!!! It feels like the university doesn\u2019t care if I live or die, they just want my chunk of $$$$$. I\u2019m still hopeful that I can register with disability office and ask for this as a reasonable accommodation, but with classes starting in three weeks, that\u2019s not a lot of time to wage war with the admissions office, disability office, financial aid office, and whoever else I have to talk to. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated.", "author": "sjbbg", "created": 1596432703, "retrieved": 1632950754, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g2yhl52": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i2rf3c/if_i_go_to_class_i_could_die_if_i_dont_i_cant/g2yhl52/", "text": "As a fellow asthmatic with scholarships to lose this is a really tough decision to make that you shouldn\u2019t have to.
