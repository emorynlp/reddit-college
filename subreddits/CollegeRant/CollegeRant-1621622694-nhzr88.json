I have been fully virtual for the 20-21 school year, and it was my freshman year so that kinda sucks.\n\nOver the course of this year, I have not missed a turn it date or deadline for any assignment. I cannot say the same for my peers but that is not my doing, so I understand when teachers say any late work is a 0. This makes sense when we are in person, but when we have to sit in front of a zoom window with a teacher just lecturing us for 8 and half months and deal with sitting in front of a computer (something I do anyway) to do all of our work, without all the resources that we would have on campus, just feels wrong. \n\nThis last quarter has been the most work for me, and I have been a bit overwhelmed for a few weeks now. I had forgot to turn in an assignment paper by a few days, and instead of taking off a few points like he has done for other assignments, he just didn't grade it. His only remark on the paper was one word \"Late.\"\n\nI understand that they are just preparing us for the industry, but when you think about how much of a shit show the last year and a half has been, you would think they would give a little leeway. I don't think it will make me fail the class, but it is something that bothers me a lot. The teacher also is really lazy and barely teaches us anything so it's not a huge shocker that he has a policy like this.", "author": "Absoluteidiotmoron", "created": 1621622694, "retrieved": 1632949994, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.27, "comments": {"gyzjxc9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nhzr88/missing_a_turn_in_date_shouldnt_result_in_failing/gyzjxc9/", "text": "If a prof needs to put in a grade, and they have nothing to grade, then what grade do you think the student should get?", "author": "renebeca", "created": 1621631333, "upvotes": 6}, "gyz93k2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nhzr88/missing_a_turn_in_date_shouldnt_result_in_failing/gyz93k2/", "text": "What does it say on the syllabus?

They can\u2019t have everyone submitting their late assignments.
