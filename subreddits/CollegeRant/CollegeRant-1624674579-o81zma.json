Covid really screwed with my social life this past year, as all of our classes were online and I overloaded my schedule so I didn\u2019t have much time to do anything besides schoolwork. And because I took a year off before coming to college this past year, I\u2019ve failed to make any real friends at my school, and my closest relatives are eight hours away. The few people that I did know here went home for summer. In short, I\u2019m incredibly lonely. I have tried reaching out to people in the nearby hiking group, but that really didn\u2019t work out, people flaked.also no school sponsored clubs are meeting this summer and jobs around here are scarce, but I\u2019m trying to find something so I can have some social interaction. Idk what I\u2019m trying to get out of this post, maybe I just need to vent, maybe I need advice. But yeah. College can be reallyyyyy lonely.

There's gaming subbed to join if you like video games.
