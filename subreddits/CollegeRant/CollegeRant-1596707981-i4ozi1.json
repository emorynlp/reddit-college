To be frank, people that didn\u2019t excel in college might find tons of success and happiness comparing to a Harvard Grad. Student debt until you are 40, declining mental health, low quality of education with a high price tag... This whole stuff only sounds like rich people\u2019s playground with that over fetishized school pride.\n\nEdit: Sorry this whole post is terribly worded (I was sleep deprived and just thinking about random things) \nJust want to tell all those people out there that it is totally fine to get a low SAT/ACT score and not going into an Ivy League. Your success is indicated by your work ethic. Some people just don\u2019t thrive well in college scene, and that is not the end of the world.
