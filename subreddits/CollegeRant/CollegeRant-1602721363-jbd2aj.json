So, as any reasonable person would do, I fired off an email to my professor telling him that hey, it's like 10 minutes from being due and I'm trying to submit it, but the people that run the server decided that it would be a good idea to do server maintenance BEFORE literally all assignments for that day are due instead of AFTER, as all quality IT professionals do. And I didn't get a response from him. However, apparently there are like-minded procrastinators in my class, because he got multiple students that did the same thing I did. His response was not \"If you turned it in a little late, You're good this time, probably stop trying to finish everything 4 hours before the due date\", which would be acceptable, but instead \"You all got it in on time, but if you hadn't I would have given you a 0 on the assignment. Technical difficulties aren't an excuse for late submissions.\" Oh, I'm sorry, I was under the assumption that the service that I have to use to submit my assignments will be online and functioning at and on the due date. I was under the impression that I had all of the time until the due date to finish and turn in the assignment. But no, I suppose if the server goes down the day of it's my fault for not submitting it on time then too, huh. For reference, the server went basically non-operational for 20 minutes, and only let me submit the assignment 5 minutes before it was due. I'm so done with professors feeling so self-important. Ok dude we get it, you're the most important Calc II professor at the school. When are people going to start understanding that when many of your students send you an email claiming the same thing, maybe you could be a little flexible. If he stays true to his word and doesn't accept a late assignment in those circumstances, then that professor should not be able to make their own late work policy. Professors acting so self-important really pisses me off.", "author": "Ecrfour", "created": 1602721363, "retrieved": 1632843422, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"g8w69vr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jbd2aj/professors_really_need_to_get_over_the_whole/g8w69vr/", "text": "They aren\u2019t.
