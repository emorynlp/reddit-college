Girl. Fuck u. \n\nThis is week 5. \nProfessors literally think we\u2019re all dumb. \nAnd they talk to us any kind of way because they CAN. \nAnd half of the time it\u2019s mistakes on their end. Of course you lost track of your emails because who the fuck uses only email to grade and review assignments for multiple classes. We have blackboard for a reason: organization...and she uses it for everything else BUT grades. \n\nI hate it here.",

I recently asked for a clarification about the requirements on an assignment and the professor answered my question but told me to basically read the syllabus better. And of course I had already read through the syllabus a couple times, hence why I asked.\n\nMy school has been almost entirely virtual with most classes having prerecorded lectures, I\u2019m not even sure what they\u2019re paying the professors to do aside from grading.",

That's so much more work than just posting it. She's making it harder and more disorganized just for the sake of being stubborn and not using the software. You should definitely report this because the fact that she's not using the school administered program AND the fact that she was disrespectful to you for a mistake that SHE made is a valid concern and I think it's worth bringing it up",

              "text": "I\u2019m an instructor and intentionally don\u2019t show my students their average. I show them the points they\u2019ve fully earned in the course. Whenever I show averages as we go, students always end up complaining to my department head that their grades dropped inexplicably. However, I explain to them that the grade of 100 they got on the five quizzes worth 1 percent apiece don\u2019t do much to raise the essay grade they got of a 70 that was worth 10 percent. They don\u2019t understand how they can drop from a 100 average to an 80 with just one assignment. I tell them that they can, if they like, keep track of their average by hand or in excel like I did when I was a student. They never seem to want to do that. I provide the exact calculations for their grades from the beginning of the semester, including what percent of their grade every single assignment is worth. Not showing their \u201cas you go\u201d average has cut down on complaints immensely, allowing for more time to grade quicker and answer emails with more valid concerns.\n\nHowever, I do believe it\u2019s important to keep all grades posted in Blackboard. I tally no grades outside of Blackboard, nor are their secret grades that don\u2019t appear in the Blackboard gradebook. Are all of your grades available, OP? Is it possible you could calculate them by hand using [RapidTables.com\u2019s Grade Calculator?](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html) I point all my students in that direction because you can have it work for literally every class. Honestly, excel is Better, but this one creates formulas on the fly based on grades and weights that you enter. You can adapt it to work with every single teacher\u2019s grading breakdown. Granted, the one disadvantage it has against excel is that you can save your grades to the site and come back and add to them like you can with excel. \n\nIf I had to guess, though, it\u2019s likely your teacher just gets massive anxiety when trying to work out a grading column\u2019s calculations in Blackboard. I\u2019m pretty technologically proficient, but that shit SUCKS. It\u2019s one of those designs where if you make an error at the 13th step of the process, you have to completely start over. It\u2019s absolute shitballs. Blackboard has so many errors and glitches it\u2019s not even funny. For example: every semester I have to manually go to every quiz and hit submit before I adjust any due dates for assignments because if I don\u2019t the dates get hung and don\u2019t change over, but only for the assignments you forgot to hit \u201cedit, submit, edit, submit, edit, submit, etc\u201d on. Also, any time I modify a link in my course that goes to another part of my course, it automatically bumps the resultant edit to the very bottom of whatever folder it\u2019s in. Realize I misspelled a word on accident or got a date wrong? I now have to manually reorganize the whole damn folder again. Blackboard looks nice on the surface but [honestly this is closer to the truth](https://i.imgur.com/wu2GlvQ.jpg).",
