Tests count 50% each. We can see each other\u2019s test grades)\n\n- The same professor corrects tests in one afternoon. We finished in the morning and by 3pm, the results were out. He corrected 60 development questions in a couple hours. Each question required a minimum of 2 written pages by hand. For the first test he corrected 90.\n\n- Same professor again decided to do a in-person test after we only had horrible online classes. We told him we were having lots of difficulties understanding the material and expressed concerns over the test, the result was a harder test compared to other years and majority of scores under 10 (the maximum being 20, 10 is the minimum to pass).\n\n- Other professor was unreachable. They would take 1-2 months to reply to an e-mail asking for instructions (they didn\u2019t teach anything either, their classes felt completely self-taught)\n\n- Bibliography given in other languages that students can\u2019t speak or read. When asked if there was anything else in english or our language, we were just told to learn the language by taking classes in university. Each language module costs 200\u20ac. \n\n- Some professors don\u2019t have a syllabus and when there\u2019s one they don\u2019t respect it.\n\n- Sometimes they dump material on us the day before a test. \n\n- Our tests are not anonymous and are corrected by the professor (there are no assistants or anything, only one professor per class). They\u2019re graded based on what the professor considers the best answer from all of the students. We have no access to correction or any test. \n\n- Internships that feel like modern day slavery. We don\u2019t get paid, not even transport or food, depending on the case. If accommodations are included, expect the worst. Generally dirty mattresses, sometimes on the floor. They\u2019re mandatory to do. It feels like they don\u2019t want to pay for actual workers so they make students do it. \n\n- Same professor that corrects tests in a couple hours, went on a 1 hour rant after we expressed concern over how classes were being taught (he only reads his powerpoints, they\u2019re not full of text, they\u2019re made in a \u201cshopping list\u201d style). He told us we were destroying college education, among other insane things. There\u2019s footage of this but I don\u2019t believe we can even show it to university due to privacy laws.\n\nThis and among other things going on have been making me feel horrible. I usually try to ignore it and just focus on my education, but even on summer break I have nightmares that make me feel miserable. The only motivation I have is to get into Master\u2019s in another university. I hate my major now. The professors seem more confused than students, the only difference is that some professors have a superiority complex. I dread my university and I only want out. \n\nTL;DR: Things happening in university make me feel miserable. I keep having nightmares about it during summer break.", "author": "zkfour", "created": 1623659883, "retrieved": 1632842226, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 184, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h1pm041": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nzi7gr/im_having_nightmares_about_college_even_during/h1pm041/", "text": "Thank you u/zkfour for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
