  "text": "I am so fucking annoyed. I just paid for my campus parking pass and it was $100 + $2.75 processing fee. I think I just have issues because that $2.75 really pissed me off. As if this stupid fucking college that charges out the ass for every damn thing can't eat the processing fee like what the fuck. I know that a $100 parking pass is arbitrarily priced too. Also for context, my school's tuition is $54k per year, a little over $11,000 per year for two semesters (8 months) of dorm housing, and when you live on campus the \\~$3,000 per semester meal plan is required! Then textbooks, then parking, then $20 if you lose you ID card. My purse got stolen in new york once and the school made me buy another ID card when they cost nothing to print. I was looking at my school's pre-covid financial statements and I am just so disappointed that our spending on professors is way less than 1/3 of the operating expenses. We do not even offer calculus classes ffs.\n\nI do not know where the fuck the money goes because it is not an artistic school by any means. The other operating expenses are \"academic support\", \"institutional support\", \"student services\", \"auxiliary services\", vague ass shit. It's a smaller school and half the students pay full tuition. They are bureaucratic as fuck and whenever I go to any administrative department they are unable to help me because of a policy their department invented to prevent them from helping anyone ever.\n\nThe college should recognize that these costs are so massive and it should charge $20 for a parking pass, $5 for a card reprint (just as incentive not to lose cards). they should eat the small fees and make the customer feel that they are attending a college that treats you with some respect. Oh and I have to park like 15 min walk away from any of my classes for $54,100 a year.\n\nTLDR: Everything is so expensive. I took a look at my school's financial statements. There is not adequate transparency.",

If I have to print more than 20 sheets of paper from the school library, I HAVE TO PAY 10\u00a2 PER PAGE. Gimme a break, college! You\u2019re already charging me thousands of dollars per quarter to go here; wtf does 10\u00a2 for printer paper matter to you? Do you really think I\u2019d abuse my power, given infinite printing privileges, and gradually but methodically rob you of my entire tuition\u2019s worth of printing paper? (Because I would, you cheap-ass sons of bitches)",

      "text": "Most of the institutions they give you for filing legitimate complaints are just filled with puppets who will listen to and behave in the best interest of their masters (bosses) aka University presidents and other higher ups who profit from all the terrible shit they hurl at students. Their job is to make the least amount of concessions possible. Remember that.\n\nMost Universities hire staff based on how much profit they'll bring to the company, oh sorry, i meant to say \"\"\"\"\"\"\"University\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but it would be more fitting to call it the former. They just require these researchers teach to students as well (at least where I'm at) so they don't have to pay someone who actually knows how to teach. \n\nEverything is a money grab, and they use vague terminology to fool the more compliant students.\n\n The worst thing isn't even this. It's the fact that the students walk into a University and all pretend that they're \"educated\" and \"scholarly\" individuals and protest about social/political issues but at the same time never complain about any actual injustices that occur literally infront of their faces.",

      "text": "I paid $200 for my on campus parking pass through may\u2026. it\u2019s in a deck where people have permits and also where people can pay by the hour. My school has 40,000 students and 20,000 parking spots, and the pay to park shit has fucked me over so many times. I\u2019ll work early in the morning (so I can\u2019t get to campus early) and my deck will be full with all the stupid non-permit people when I get there for my 11 AM class, and I have to go find another deck to pay to park in. \n\nI added it up yesterday- I\u2019ve spent $215 since the semester started on parking tickets and paying to park in other not full decks. I paid $200 for a year parking pass. No matter how many times I complain to parking services nothing changes :)",
