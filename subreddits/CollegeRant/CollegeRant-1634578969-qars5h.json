  "text": "I hate myself more than you believe. I hate every fucking thing about my life. Rant incoming but be aware that I blame myself and not society for this, so spare the nasty comments:\n\nWas homeschooled in HS, so I had 0000000 frinds for 5 fucking years. Got into college, computer science, still live with my parents. Everything is garabage. I met a nice girl, got along great. But I just had to change majors. It is so much work, assignements its absolutely insane. Math professors didnt explain shit in linear algebra and analysis, truly dont give a fuck. No wonder 80% drop or fail out. Fucking assholes. After a month I couldnt take it anymore, switched to business. Still makes me sick.\n\nI am alone at home all day where I have to study. Its literally impossible to make friends. Everyone knows each other from high school and im a month late anyways. Im not even in the fucking whatsapp chat. 300 fucking people in one lecture fuck everyone gets home after that. How am i suppised to maje friends? Commuting is 1h30 a day for me. Why should i even go there what the fuck ? I can do everything online. It makes me miserable though. Going there makes me miserable too. So i stay home, procrastinate, fap to porn like the good for nothing POC that I am. Nothing changed. Home alone all day doing fuck all. I am behind a month. Have 10 different lectures that i should be studying for! Ill never pass tests, i could but idk. I hate myself. Please god let lightning put an end to this misery. \n\nSorry everyone! I am not like you guys!!! I am not as smart, well put together, disciplined, strong willed and clever as you are. I am nothing. Ill achieve shit all in life and die a young death. Fuck this capitalist dystopia. Ill go fucking kill myself now idgaf",

Although it just sounds like you don\u2019t enjoy college as a whole, not just the no friends part. Maybe take next semester off or take a gap year to figure out what you want? Or stick it out and see if it gets better or at least tolerable.",

Why dont you rent an apartment closer to campus? Why dont you work on your time management skills? Why dont you ask people in your class to study with you? Why dont you transfer to a different school if you hate the one youre in?",

Though, it still doesn't solve the college sucking issue.\n(PS: my fucking roommate breathes so fucking loud in his sleep he needs to clean his damn nose please help.)",
