  "text": "Title really says it all, to say much more just embarrasses me and forces me to explain things that I don't feel up to: Math is freaking hard, I have never understood it and I missed/didn't understand many of the basics even in elementary which has led to quite an issue as I go through intermediate algebra classes for my gen studies in my associates degree. I plan to be a lawyer and I feel very stupid and useless not being able to understand or properly do math. When it comes to many math problems I find myself needing to get a lot of help usually through Desmos or other shortcuts. People say practice makes perfect and I won't learn if I don't try but how on earth can I try? How can I even begin to try something that makes me drop a billion tears as soon as I see more than a couple of numbers in a row, how do I stop feeling that pit in my chest when I see words like polynomials and exponents and quadratics and I know that if what I'm studying/testing on NOW is hard, what is coming next is harder? How do I stop myself from just giving up? I literally hate math and math classes so much that I'm considering dropping out and giving up on my schooling because  while my advisor said this was the one math class I need left, I am positive that I will end up in at least one or two more during the many years I will be attending and I swear I can't do it anymore! It makes me so frustrated that I want to begin breaking things and screaming, I can't stop crying and cussing, why is it so hard? And some people it comes so easily to them...",

      "text": "Math is really foundational, if you\u2019re not strong in the basics intermediate will be hard.\n\nI placed in intermediate over the summer and had to drop it in favor of elementary algebra. I felt like such a loser because it set me back, but without it I was lost. The first lesson in my intermediate class was factoring polynomial fractions. It was way over my head.\n\nI\u2019d really recommend taking a lower math class/math emporium at your school. There is no shame in going back to the basics. It really helps a lot for the math that comes later.",
