  "text": "Amidst the projects, finals and homework\u2019s, I put about an hour aside today to look at any jobs.\n\nI\u2019m graduating in the spring with a bachelors in engineering. I have no internship experience. I have a project and a small tutoring job for experience.\n\nI broke into a cold sweat as my erratic brain wondered\u2026.\n\nAm I doomed? I\u2019ve seen others in my situation before, panicked and asking the same questions. What they were told was \u201cyou\u2019ll be okay\u201d\n\nI mean, by all logic maybe I will be okay. But my emotions keep bubbling up, if I think about it too hard I actually start to break into a cold sweat.\n\nWill I really be okay?",
