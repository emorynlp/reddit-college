  "text": "Amidst the projects, finals and homework\u2019s, I put about an hour aside today to look at any jobs.\n\nI\u2019m graduating in the spring with a bachelors in engineering. I have no internship experience. I have a project and a small tutoring job for experience.\n\nI broke into a cold sweat as my erratic brain wondered\u2026.\n\nAm I doomed? I\u2019ve seen others in my situation before, panicked and asking the same questions. What they were told was \u201cyou\u2019ll be okay\u201d\n\nI mean, by all logic maybe I will be okay. But my emotions keep bubbling up, if I think about it too hard I actually start to break into a cold sweat.\n\nWill I really be okay?",

It might help to spend some more time thinking about projects or problems you would like to work on rather than looking at every and any job available. Being passionate about a project is the #1 way to get hired",
