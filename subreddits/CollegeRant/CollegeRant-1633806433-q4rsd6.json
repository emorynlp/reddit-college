Mine is much longer, but still I wish I'd told the IRB I was doing this instead lol.\n\nQuick note - the first question says \"are you an undergraduate or graduate student\" with the options to answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" Is that meant just to screen for folks who aren't students, or should the response options have let people indicate which they were (undergrad or grad)? Just felt I should say something in case it was a mistake. Good luck!",
