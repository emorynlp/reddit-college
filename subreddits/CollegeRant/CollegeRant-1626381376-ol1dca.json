Professors teach differently, and I think RMP should be used to describe their policies, marking schemes and teaching methods, so that if you have sections to choose from, you can pick the teaching style that fits your learning style best.\n\nBut my BIGGEST PET PEEVE is when ratings are vague and irrelevant. Here are some of the ratings on there that drive me nuts:\n\n\"He SUCKKKKKS. I HATE THAT GUY HE KILLED MY GPA, MY FAMILY, MY DOG, IM NEVER GONNA BE A DOCTOR, IM GONNA DIE ALONE\"\n\n\"She's really hot so that helped ;) She's like a young Dolly Parton, you'll know what I mean when you see her.\"\n\n\"Such a cool person, so nice, I wish they were my best friend B-) YOU ROCK\"\n\n\"DONT TAKE IT WITH THEM, I CHEATED ON MY PAPER AND THEY PENALIZED ME FOR IT EVEN THO I SAID SORRY. THE COMMUNIST MARXIST PIG TRIED TO BRAINWASH US\"\n\n...and my favourite:\n\n\"good.\"/\"bad.\"/\"alright.\"\n\nTL;DR: If you write ratings that are uninformative and irrelevant to the prof's teaching delivery, don't bother writing them at all.", "author": "idont_excel_at_excel", "created": 1626381376, "retrieved": 1632950792, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h5irx33": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ol1dca/rmp_is_being_used_wrong/h5irx33/", "text": "A lot of my students tell me that they 1.) never write reviews, and 2.) don't scroll past the overall rating to read anyone else's reviews.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with RMP is the selection bias - the majority of reviews are on the extremes (either 1s or 5s).
