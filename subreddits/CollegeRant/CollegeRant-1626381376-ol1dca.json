  "text": "I find that Rate My Professor can actually be a really good tool for students when looking to enroll into courses. Professors teach differently, and I think RMP should be used to describe their policies, marking schemes and teaching methods, so that if you have sections to choose from, you can pick the teaching style that fits your learning style best.\n\nBut my BIGGEST PET PEEVE is when ratings are vague and irrelevant. Here are some of the ratings on there that drive me nuts:\n\n\"He SUCKKKKKS. I HATE THAT GUY HE KILLED MY GPA, MY FAMILY, MY DOG, IM NEVER GONNA BE A DOCTOR, IM GONNA DIE ALONE\"\n\n\"She's really hot so that helped ;) She's like a young Dolly Parton, you'll know what I mean when you see her.\"\n\n\"Such a cool person, so nice, I wish they were my best friend B-) YOU ROCK\"\n\n\"DONT TAKE IT WITH THEM, I CHEATED ON MY PAPER AND THEY PENALIZED ME FOR IT EVEN THO I SAID SORRY. THE COMMUNIST MARXIST PIG TRIED TO BRAINWASH US\"\n\n...and my favourite:\n\n\"good.\"/\"bad.\"/\"alright.\"\n\nTL;DR: If you write ratings that are uninformative and irrelevant to the prof's teaching delivery, don't bother writing them at all.",

The data just isn't useful.",

I\u2019ve written reviews before, and I can only describe a couple of things about a professor and how they teach a class before I hit the word/character limit. I think it\u2019s okay if they have a word/character limit so people don\u2019t write entire essays on RMP, but they definitely need to raise it from what it is right now.",

Eventually I presume most of us are thrown into the real world and will have to work with complicated and toxic individuals and taking a course blindly in my opinion pushes you out of your comfort zone.",

          "text": "I like your point of view, but I have to say that I disagree in the sense that I would rather not have to take a calc 2 course with a professor who mumbles and does not know anything about technology (even more important during the last year of online learning) if I have the option.\n\nBeyond that, most upper year courses are taught by professors that rarely have ratings on RMP, so being pushed out of one's comfort zone is a given. But RMP is mostly good for those gen-ed courses you want to take for enjoyment. Why would I choose a grueling 1st yr course as my gen-ed if the rest of my course load is already grueling?\n\nIt is good to be pushed out of one's comfort zone, however I don't believe taking a course with a random professor is the best way application to real world adaptability. The website was designed with a specific purpose in mind; why not use it for that purpose?",
