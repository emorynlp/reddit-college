  "text": "I know everyone's experience is different but Has anyone else had this feeling where you wanted to major in something and you thought it would be good for you like everyone says but then you just get exhausted of it and depressed and the one thing you loved to do everyday, now you cant wait for it to just end because of all the deadlines, expectations and assignments being thrown at you from like 7 different people every week and all you get is a grade for it. Maybe just me.",
