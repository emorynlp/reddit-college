  "text": "I accidentally missed my midterm\n\nThis is a little bit of a vent. \n\ntl;dr: I made a really petty, but stupid bonehead mistake and missed my mid-term. I got the times mixed up.\n\nSo I essentially got the midterm times mixed up. The exam times was broken up into 2 sections. The first section had to take there exams at 9:00 and the second section had to take their exam at 11:00am. I was in section 1. I actually ended up waking up early at like 7:00am, but miss-understood an email and thought that I had until 12:00pm to submit it. I went back to sleep and actually woke up around 9.\n\nI hopped on a discord where students were going over some practice questions for the exam (and some were even going over the exam) and the discord didn\u2019t end until like 10. I check back at the announcement board and come to find out my exam time ENDS AT 10:05 am. A lot of people\u2019s heart would have dropped, but mine didn\u2019t anymore. \n\nI was simply just..angry. I was extremely pissed at myself for making such a very stupid mistake. There was an email that was send out a little after the first email saying that \u201cwhile the last email made it seem like all the exams close at 12:00pm, this is NOT the case. You must take you sectioned exam at your designated time.\u201d\n\nI was so pissed. If I would have just checked the second email, and announcements while I was in the discord, I would have been fine to take it.\n\nUnfortunately emailing my professor was a no go because the answers were listed after the 2nd section exam.\n\nNow I\u2019m gonna have to retake this comp-sci class AGAIN, hopefully in the summer. \n\nI\u2019m getting extremely pissed thinking about it and I can\u2019t believe I made such a stupid mistake.",

      "text": "The same thing pretty much happened to me last semester. Professor told us a time we had to take an exam but they were not good at communicating and explaining what time we had to take it. I missed the exam and was freaking out and even cried. They wouldn\u2019t let me have another chance to take the exam either and I was so disappointed in myself. Brought my grade down to a D and it wrecked my GPA. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, though! These last two semesters have been awful and it is unreal how much work we all have to do since schools are online/majority of classes are online. Students definitely have way too much to handle right now and things like this are going to happen. Just sucks that professors are expecting so much from us. Fortunately, it\u2019s not the end of the world and I actually find summer classes to be a lot better or easier than Fall/Spring classes despite the shorter time frame. You are definitely not alone in this. Wishing you the best.",

I 100% understand this. \n\nTalk to your professor, explain what happened and just maybe your professor might be understanding and give you a make up exam. I doubt you would want to go through this class again. \n\n2 semesters ago, I missed one of my midterms cause I over slept. Luckily my professor was extremely nice and understanding that he let me do a make up exam cause I was doing really well in the class anyways. Passed the exam and didn\u2019t have to retake the course. \n\nHopefully you\u2019re professor will try and come up with something for you so you don\u2019t have to retake the class. \n\nGood luck OP, update us if you can on how it went.",

I already missed a bunch of days for \u201cno good reason\u201d (mental health). I just let myself dissociate from it all.\n\nI failed the semester which made everything much worse for much longer. My professors reached out and said they would have been happy to work with me if I communicated with them. One even gave me a D even though missing the final should have made me fail outright.\n\nReach out and be honest. It can only help.",
