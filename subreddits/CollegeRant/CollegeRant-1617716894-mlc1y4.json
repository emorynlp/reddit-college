I got the times mixed up.\n\nSo I essentially got the midterm times mixed up. The exam times was broken up into 2 sections. The first section had to take there exams at 9:00 and the second section had to take their exam at 11:00am. I was in section 1. I actually ended up waking up early at like 7:00am, but miss-understood an email and thought that I had until 12:00pm to submit it. I went back to sleep and actually woke up around 9.\n\nI hopped on a discord where students were going over some practice questions for the exam (and some were even going over the exam) and the discord didn\u2019t end until like 10. I check back at the announcement board and come to find out my exam time ENDS AT 10:05 am. A lot of people\u2019s heart would have dropped, but mine didn\u2019t anymore. \n\nI was simply just..angry. I was extremely pissed at myself for making such a very stupid mistake. There was an email that was send out a little after the first email saying that \u201cwhile the last email made it seem like all the exams close at 12:00pm, this is NOT the case. You must take you sectioned exam at your designated time.\u201d\n\nI was so pissed. If I would have just checked the second email, and announcements while I was in the discord, I would have been fine to take it.\n\nUnfortunately emailing my professor was a no go because the answers were listed after the 2nd section exam.\n\nNow I\u2019m gonna have to retake this comp-sci class AGAIN, hopefully in the summer. \n\nI\u2019m getting extremely pissed thinking about it and I can\u2019t believe I made such a stupid mistake.", "author": "TallSwaggOVO", "created": 1617716894, "retrieved": 1632950329, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 207, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gtnnv0x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mlc1y4/i_accidentally_missed_my_midterm/gtnnv0x/", "text": "Literally the same thing happened to me with my bio test and crim midterm.

They wouldn\u2019t let me have another chance to take the exam either and I was so disappointed in myself. Brought my grade down to a D and it wrecked my GPA. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, though! These last two semesters have been awful and it is unreal how much work we all have to do since schools are online/majority of classes are online. Students definitely have way too much to handle right now and things like this are going to happen. Just sucks that professors are expecting so much from us. Fortunately, it\u2019s not the end of the world and I actually find summer classes to be a lot better or easier than Fall/Spring classes despite the shorter time frame.
