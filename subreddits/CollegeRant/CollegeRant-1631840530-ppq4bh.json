Any time I try doing something I enjoy, all I think about is how I could be working. I'm eating, I think about how I could be studying. I'm showering, I'm think about the work I'll do after I shower. I'm trying to fall asleep, I think about how I could be working. I feel like I'm going insane. My entire life is nothing much studying \n\nThey say you should give yourself a break so I did. Spent a weekend hanging out with my family and relaxing and now I'm behind on everything. I hate what I've become, I never have time to hang out with any of my friends. Every time it's always \"sorry, have to finish some homework\" or \"I've got a tutoring session in 10 minutes\" or \"I have a test coming up\" \n\nI guess I'm happy to know that I'm working hard but it's just so much. It's gotten to the point where I forget to eat. I eat when I wake up and then right before I go to bed. This can't be health but I'm worried if I back away I'll start failing", "author": "nooter70", "created": 1631840530, "retrieved": 1632841029, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hd5gme0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppq4bh/i_cant_relax/hd5gme0/", "text": "Thank you u/nooter70 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get it, no grade is worth more than your mental and physical health. Find a balance that works. A\u2019s mean nothing if you\u2019re burnt out/miserable. What helped me was when I took time to meditate or take my mind off my studies I thought of it as getting me ready to homework and if I wasn\u2019t as stressed I could work through my homework a lot easier. When you shower, eat, sleep, or just decompress it\u2019s helping you get ready to take on your next task so it\u2019s not a waste of time. Take it easy dude and pm me if you need to talk.", "author": "Scran_Dad", "created": 1631842611, "upvotes": 3}}}
