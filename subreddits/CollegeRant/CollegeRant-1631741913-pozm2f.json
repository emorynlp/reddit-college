  "text": "things felt so much easier in high school (duh), but i feel like there were 24 more hours in a day in high school than it feels like now. i feel like i was able to enjoy classes and have a good time with friends, go to multiple after school clubs a night, eat dinner with family, get homework done, and still have time to do whatever the hell i felt like that night. \n\nobviously the work load is much larger, but man, i can\u2019t even fathom joining a college club because it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a large enough block of time that i can take out of my already stressful day to add something else to the schedule. and that\u2019s just me going to classes, TRYING to catch a meal a day, and going to bed. where the hell did the time go?",
