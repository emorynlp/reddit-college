  "text": "I\u2019m a junior conservation bio major but I don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s gonna last. I\u2019m having troubles deciding if this is what I want to do. Everyone always says you should peruse a career in something you\u2019re passionate about but like what does passion feel like? I wake up, go to class, do my homework, study for exams but like I\u2019m not motivated to do it? I just do it because I have to or something. I thought this is what I wanted. I thought I wanted to do my part and push for more research in how we\u2019re fucking shit up and maybe fix some of those problems, but I\u2019m worried that by the time I \u201chave the degree\u201d to do that they\u2019ll be nothing left or there will be an IPCC report that says \u201cwelp we\u2019re fucked, we tried\u201d. The more I try to think long term the more it seems like its too little too late.",
