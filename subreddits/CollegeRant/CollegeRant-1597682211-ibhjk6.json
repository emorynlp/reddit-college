  "text": "\"Here's the textbook, have it by tomorrow.\" You're the one who waited until the last second to let anyone know about the textbook and you expect us to be ready to use it the next day? I have to pay for it with my own money because the bookstore isn't open anymore and it's definitely not going to be here by tomorrow. Don't you know that scalpers jack up the prices of textbooks right before class starts? I have to buy from some online service so let's add shipping costs to that. And don't forget tax! Oh, and it costs just as much to rent. Tell us at least a week in advance if you want us to have the book by the next day!\n\nTL;DR: Don't expect us to have the textbook ready if you wait until the very last second to tell us what it is!",

      "text": "I\u2019m not sure if every college is like this, but at mine when you look online in the course catalogue at a course, it tells you what book is used. When you go into your student portal/profile (where you can view your financial aid/transcript/grades/sometimes register for courses) there\u2019s a \u201ccourse search\u201d and if you go into there and find your course and click it, at the top there\u2019s either a button that says \u201cview book\u201d OR it\u2019s at the very bottom if you scroll down. May be worth a look if you haven\u2019t tried to see if your school has something similar! Nobody ever told me this, I figured it out myself. There have been a few times the book wasn\u2019t actually required bc there was an online resource or the professor decided they\u2019re not using it and I had to return them, but I\u2019d rather do that then panic at the last minute/pay more and that\u2019s only happened a few times - I\u2019m almost done with my associates degree.",

      "text": "Apologies. Prof here. I sent my book orders to the bookstore way back in like April. Normally they post the information to their website. But due to chaos in the bookstore they never posted that information and or possibly someone who quit sabotaged the system, we don't know for sure.\n\nAnyhoo, things got pretty crazy when a week or two before classes, we all found out the book information hadn't been compiled and released. The administration told us \"just open up your online classes two weeks early to release the book information\", which was a nope for a lot of us who were still reorganizing our stuff (no one needs to see that mess behind the scenes!). I tried to email my students but that is not the best way to get ahold of everybody.\n\nOn the other hand, It's basically a federal mandate that all schools release all textbook information when enrollment first begins for those classes. Sometimes it's tricky to find that information but it should be online even without your instructor having to tell you personally. (though I do acknowledge some instructors might not make that information available even to the bookstore in advance)",
