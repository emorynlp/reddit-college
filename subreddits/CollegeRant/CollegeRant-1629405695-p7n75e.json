I emailed like 10 labs and got 1 response back and was able to get an interview. The interview was literally like 3min cuz all they asked was my availability. They said my schedule might be a conflict so I changed my whole schedule. But I didn\u2019t end up getting the position. I feel like they should have asked for our schedules first before even asking for interview. It just felt like I got my hopes up \u2026 idk what to do anymore. I literally have no motivation to keep emailing labs anymore. I feel like no one will take me. I\u2019m already a junior. I have no experience in anything.  I fycking hate school.

But also part of it (everything) is a numbers game. You have to play a lot, and lose a lot, to win sometimes. Might help if you can find a mentor to help you out, but also you just have to develop a thick skin and get rejected a lot.
