Definitely not conducive to  a a good test taking experience. Then again though, what is?",

I had so much pressure to do good on that exam I puked in the bushes afterwards.  I did nail it though.",

Proctors kept taking over student exams because they couldn\u2019t keep straight which students they were trying to perform functions for.

An hour and a half before I got to write my exam because they wanted to inspect my room again and check my ID.
