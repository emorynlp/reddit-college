To the original point, yes, I agree that a PE req in college is pretty ridiculous; and I'm glad my school (seemingly along with many) don't have such a req. I also agree that college is a scam in that no degree is ever gonna really be \"worth\" $100k+; but because of this, the next best option is to try and milk its advantages (whatever those may be in one's particular school or field) as much as possible in the meantime. Administrative bloat is usually the biggest culprit of this.\n\nBut to the point of gen eds: hardly any academic subjects exist in isolation. There's so much that can be learned from areas outside of your major. That's why it's called an education. If you want job training only, go to a trade school (which is a perfectly good option too and one I think more people should tend to go with). Why do STEM majors need at least some humanities, arts, and social sciences? B/c you learn to analyze rhetoric, form and support arguments, and deconstruct others' arguments, in addition to a plethora of content which may make you a more responsible and aware global citizen. Pretty much the same could be said in vice versa in terms of filling in informational gaps. And each different field of study introduces & utilizes different approaches to problem solving, which can prove helpful in many other situations. Being \"well-rounded\" isn't just a throw-around phrase. Narrow mindsets are why many college educated people still seem ignorant to what should be basic knowledge (e.g. climate change is real, a plethora of political issues that I won't go into detail on, etc.)\n\nYes, some courses can be a wash. But if you choose your gen eds wisely (there's usually a variety of classes that fulfill any given req) instead of passively letting your advisor randomly pick them, you might find a bit more meaning in those courses.", "author": "bucs2013", "created": 1589234428, "upvotes": 1}, "fp9by2p": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/g1f95t/college_is_mostly_a_scam/fp9by2p/", "text": "So true man.
