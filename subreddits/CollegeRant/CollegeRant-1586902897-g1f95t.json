      "text": "Wow some of these replies are toxic. To the original point, yes, I agree that a PE req in college is pretty ridiculous; and I'm glad my school (seemingly along with many) don't have such a req. I also agree that college is a scam in that no degree is ever gonna really be \"worth\" $100k+; but because of this, the next best option is to try and milk its advantages (whatever those may be in one's particular school or field) as much as possible in the meantime. Administrative bloat is usually the biggest culprit of this.\n\nBut to the point of gen eds: hardly any academic subjects exist in isolation. There's so much that can be learned from areas outside of your major. That's why it's called an education. If you want job training only, go to a trade school (which is a perfectly good option too and one I think more people should tend to go with). Why do STEM majors need at least some humanities, arts, and social sciences? B/c you learn to analyze rhetoric, form and support arguments, and deconstruct others' arguments, in addition to a plethora of content which may make you a more responsible and aware global citizen. Pretty much the same could be said in vice versa in terms of filling in informational gaps. And each different field of study introduces & utilizes different approaches to problem solving, which can prove helpful in many other situations. Being \"well-rounded\" isn't just a throw-around phrase. Narrow mindsets are why many college educated people still seem ignorant to what should be basic knowledge (e.g. climate change is real, a plethora of political issues that I won't go into detail on, etc.)\n\nYes, some courses can be a wash. But if you choose your gen eds wisely (there's usually a variety of classes that fulfill any given req) instead of passively letting your advisor randomly pick them, you might find a bit more meaning in those courses.",

However, I think the big, massive, ugly lie is that college is the only place to get an education.  It's not.  It's not even the best place to actually learn.  All college teaches you to do is be a subordinate, follow mundane directions, and kiss ass with professors to pass.  Oh and all those worthless electives they try to tell you are to make sure you're well rounded?  Bullshit.  They'd lose an extra year of your money if you didn't take the classes, that's all.",

Your university does not have a capacity for 25,000 students per year. It has a capacity for 100,000 total students at any given time. This number is based off things like, how many classrooms are available, the capacity of those classrooms, how many instructors they want to hire, etc. If the university suddenly started offering all 3 year degrees by getting rid of gen ed requirements, they would aim to admit enough students to get back to capacity and you would have about 33,000 students per year. Since your university sounds like a major state institution with those kind of numbers, I doubt upping the number of admissions would be a problem.",

The only way it loses out on the $200,000,000/year figure that you gave is if it has 25,000 (again your figure) fewer students are enrolled per year. If that is the case, then necessarily, your university is operating at 25,000 students **under** its capacity. If it is not operating at capacity, then by definition, it has room for more students to be enrolled.\n\nAgain, this is because the total number of students enrolled is what matters. The number of students per graduating class is largely irrelevant.\n\n>Before you randomly start spitting out numbers.\n\nI used your numbers. They were not random. You stated your university has 25,000 per graduating class, not me.",
