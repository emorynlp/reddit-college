Those thoughts put me in a dark place for a long while.\n\nOne thing I had to realize: theres more to life than college, than this. You might feel terrible now but in a year or two, you'll look back and think \"wow, I cant believe I felt that way.\".\n\nThat's whats beautiful about the passage of time, things move on, things change. I couldn't imagine if we stayed frozen at our lowest moments.\n\nBut yea, I got neuro disorders and im a slow learner as well, so i totally get where you're coming from. Ive dropped many classes, as well as retook alot of them. Theres no shame in doing those things.\n\nOne thing that really helped me these last few years was remembering that we're all different. We're all on different journeys in this life. Some of us have it a little more difficult than others, but that doesn't make our journeys worth less.\n\nWe have to go at our own pace. Forcing yourself to go at the pace of others will destroy you. Be patient with yourself, even when other aren't. \n\nIve even had profs in my department tell me I should switch majors or dropout. I almost believed them. But now...im basically done with my degree, it took longer than most, but I did it.\n\nAnything's possible for us, we just take a little longer than others sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nAlso: I basically have no friends in uni rn either. My advice is to just focus on making yourself happy.

I\u2019ll be an incoming freshman, and I just want to say I have no idea how stuff works sometimes. So if I\u2019m talking my ass off, then feel free to dismiss my reply\n\nBut I relate to you a lot. I learn things slower than most people, not to mention I have a tendency to not understand things until days or months after everyone else has mastered it. Growing up I was always behind, even when I constantly had tutors and additional help to guide me\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been there with being suicidal about my intelligence. Don\u2019t care if people tell me now I\u2019m smart or not, having years and years of struggling with stuff people usually get right away, especially when I had resources and still manage to fail is not going to be reversed by a pep talk. I kind of got into this mindset of \u201cI just take up more resources without actually benefitting the world\u201d and that led to a lot of suicidal thinking. Hell, I couldn\u2019t even imagine myself surviving college for the longest time, and I remember being convinced I would become homeless and jobless when I grew up\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you your thinking is right or wrong. I don\u2019t really believe the majority of thoughts can be classified as right or wrong. It makes sense though. Society tells everyone academics is important to get a job, and if you can\u2019t do academics everyone is going to turn you down and you have nowhere else to go. I don\u2019t see anything wrong in thinking that way when it\u2019s the narrative that gets pushed onto us the most\n\nBut it\u2019s wrong. Or at least it\u2019s been proven wrong countless amount of times. If you want some long-term reassurance, I use to constantly browse r/SimpleLiving whenever I felt like the most I could do was get a minimum wage job. A lot of them praise themselves for taking lower wage jobs and just cut their overall spending in order to focus more on their personal problems, and it really helped me feel like if worse comes to worst I had a community to give me advice. \n\nI also remember once talking to a friend about degrees and college advice, and we agreed that even if your degree sucks or is useless, it\u2019s not the end-all-be-all for non-STEM related jobs. For most jobs, experience is what matters the most (except for STEM jobs. Those almost always require a specific degree), and it doesn\u2019t have to be job experience. Volunteering counts as work experience, and if you have the time I recommend looking into volunteering programs that seem doable for you. And while this doesn\u2019t count as work experience, certain activities and hobbies are taken account for as experience, although they don\u2019t carry as much weight as work experience. \n\nFor short-term advice (which I\u2019m assuming is what you wanted in the first place\u2026 oops) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late for this but I recommend looking into professors instead of academic areas. I suck at everything but I remember a good handful of times where I got an easy A cause the teacher was an easy grader and didn\u2019t assign too much or too complicated work, and there\u2019s got to be at least one professor who teaches like a high school teacher. Well that is if you still need to complete General ED classes, since more specialized classes usually don\u2019t have easy professors. Basically, just use and abuse RateMyProfessor.com\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if you also struggle with your major and stuff like that. I\u2019m going to assume you aren\u2019t since you never specified it in this post, but if you are let me know and I can give my upcoming freshman perspective on that as well\n\nNo but seriously, I hoped this helped, and if it didn\u2019t well\u2026 I haven\u2019t even gone to college yet", "author": "Monthly_Vent", "created": 1630445862, "upvotes": 4}, "hb3t0q0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pf7fnv/im_too_stupid_for_this_life/hb3t0q0/", "text": "You will always be able to find a job, I promise.
