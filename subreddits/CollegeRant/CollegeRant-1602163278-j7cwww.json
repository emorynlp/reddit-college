I told my parents about it but they\u2019re so tired themselves, that when they\u2019re asleep at night they can\u2019t even hear her because they\u2019re knocked out or my mom\u2019s at work. So they don\u2019t really do anything about it unfortunately (which i understand, they work so hard already, they aren\u2019t narcissistic) and when i beg her to shut up she just forget 20 mins later and starts her antics again. i tried headphones/my airpods but she\u2019s so loud it surpasses the damn things and honestly they fall off in my sleep so then i hear everything again. Preferably as well, i dont like to sleep things in my ears. it just feels so weird and uncomfortable. i can\u2019t sleep anywhere else because all the rooms are taken, and the children sleep in the living room where they blast the TV (since they\u2019re scared and the sound of the TV comforts them). The second oldest is pretty chill, but he has a learning disability and can\u2019t really help my other siblings even though he tried. \n\nim the oldest so all the responsibility is put on me. Its been like this all my life, i get that, but my STEM studies are so important. after not doing so well my freshman year bc of toxic unrelated things, i\u2019m trying to aim for all A\u2019s. i\u2019m required to lead and clean up first and tell the kids what to clean but they never listen to me. they don\u2019t clean their dishes, pick up their toys, spills, and literally leave a tornado in their path. as you can imagine, the mess piles up within minutes even though it was clean. they don\u2019t do their own homework/studies, they just play video games all day, yet since i\u2019m \u201cthe smartest/oldest\u201d i get yelled at if i\u2019m not helping them with their homework...how can i help them if i can\u2019t even help myself with studying. I have work (part time work-study) and a side hustle of tutoring to pay for school, but my classes are literally like a 9-5 job because i start at 8am then end at 5pm on most days. then, after that i have to complete homework, assignments, and study for upcoming tests. i want to understand and grasp the material, but everyone around me either cheats or doesn\u2019t care, including my classmates/friends (no judgment to them of course) so it\u2019s like nobody can help me other than myself. I sincerely want to learn the material. I have like 9 professors and 3 of them assign a test every single week. i am non stop studying and i fear failing. Because of these circumstances i barely sleep. I just want to sleep for a whole week and not wake up. hell, i even fantasize about finally falling asleep when it\u2019s so hard to fall asleep in my bed already. at least when classes were in person, i could dorm and be away from it all. it may just be me bitching though because i feel like others are having a worse experience than me bc of online school, but SHIT i just need somebody to relate to because everyone I know currently is having the time of their lives on unemployment checks and vacationing (again, i\u2019m not judging but damn i can\u2019t lie im a bit jealous and wish that could be me for just A DAY).", "author": "PandaaRiceeBall", "created": 1602163278, "retrieved": 1632842955, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g84nhgi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j7cwww/i_just_want_school_to_be_over_already_to_start_my/g84nhgi/", "text": "I'm sorry things have been so stressful for you! My situation isn't nearly as bad but I live in a basement and above me are people who rent out that space and between them, their 3 loud cats who have no sense of time, the mom who comes home at odd hours of the night (she's a night nurse I think)  and God knows whoever keeps banging stuff (it sounds like they're hammering) between 7 and 10pm, I get the frustration of just wanting to study but noise being distracting. This is gonna sound weird and I'm not sure if it will work for everyone, but I started doing my work outside in the evenings. Around when the banging starts. It's a way to get out of the house at night. It's more peaceful. Lighting sucks but it's worth it to actually be able to concentrate. \n\nIn terms of your parents giving you grief about helping your siblings, F that. At least tell them that you're not helping them anymore if they're not gonna actually try. Or if they actually want help THEN they can come to you. You're not their teacher you shouldn't be expected to teach them when you're literally doing everything you can do keep up with school. \n\nI feel the same way about sleeping with stuff in your ear. Something strange I've actually found was that gaming headphones were the least offensive. Because they're pretty flat it's not too much of a transition sleeping on them whereas other headphones not. Plus it completely covers your ears. \n\nI know these suggestions may not help you since solutions to these kind of things vary from person to person, but I hope things can open back up next year. Is there anyone close you can stay at their house at night with? They might sympathize.

Of those kids don't wanna listen to you so be it. Let your parents yell at you and say your a disappointment all they want but YOU know that YOU are trying your best. Do what is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY for your siblings and NOTHING else. If they decide to play video games that is their issue not yours. You are paying for school and doing side hustles and everything under the sun. \n\nGo tell your little sister to stfu or buy noise cancelling ear PLUGS from Amazon that swimmers usually wear (they WORK, trust me). Then wear some headphones ON TOP of them while you are working if you need quiet music while you are working and your sister is loud. I know it's hard, I deal with loud ppl too. I put on my headphones and get to work. I try my best and I'm pushing through the best I can despite the circumstances. I haven't been on vacation for years and have never been outside of the U.S. or any major U.S. cities besides D.C. DONT feel like everyone is living their best life and are on unemployment because that is NOT true. There are many people that can relate to you and you aren't alone. \n\nI'm a 19 year old college senior and despite being perfectionist and sometimes failing...I remind myself that I am at least proud of trying so hard against all odds. Remember that. Don't give up. Do what you need to do for yourself. Leave the parenting to the parents and if they say something they can put a sock on it.

I am an adjunct professor, teaching at a community college and at a private university, and I seriously get it. Believe it or not, I feel the same way you do, a lot of the time. \n\nWhen my students come to me with stuff like this - and they do, all the time (I teach writing, so a lot of it winds up in their essays), I tell them these things:\n\n* Most schools have things/services in place to help students with issues like this - both in \"normal\" times and during our insane pandemic times. You should make use of those services, as best you can (you're paying for them, after all). There's counseling, definitely (my schools are both doing this work online, meeting with students, etc.). There are also tutoring services and academic services available that have moved to online as well.\n* Talk to your teachers. If any of them are holding office hours (online) go to those office hours and tell them you're struggling. They know your school and what the school can do to help, so they can get you to the right place. They also can (if they choose to do so) give you extensions on homework and whatnot. Just don't go in there demanding things, but instead asking for help, and you'd be surprised what you hear.\n* Not everyone is living their best life during the pandemic. Unemployment is disappearing for most people, and many will be homeless because of it. I realize that some people are acting irresponsibly with their money, but that's just about the dumbest thing you can do - you don't want to be broke AND sick AND struggling in school. Don't compare your situation to theirs - everyone is different, and you need to be focused on you and what you need.\n* As to your home situation - I suggest you get some noise cancelling ear plugs (not ear buds, but plugs - the foam ones) to start with. It sounds like you need to be firm and patient and just keep going back to your sister and telling her she's being too loud and she has to respect your need for quiet after a certain time (I mean, it's not like you want her to be silent 24/7, but just during sleep time, right? Like from 10-7? Or something?). \n* You can't do everything, for everyone. Helping the kids with their homework, when they are being extremely unhelpful to you, seems like it should be the lowest thing on your list of concerns. And if your parents get upset with you, just tell them what you said here - you're PAYING for school, whereas the younger kids are (presumably) going to public school and are definitely not holding down jobs and side hustles to pay for that. So imo the kids and their need for homework help can kick rocks. \n\nJust struggling on, silent and put upon, is going to get you exactly nowhere - you have to advocate for yourself, in all ways (at work, at home, in social situations). Nobody will do it for you - you have to stick up for yourself, find out what's available to help you out, and then go get it. \n\nGood luck - I know you can do it!", "author": "Readthesyllabus3", "created": 1602170323, "upvotes": 13}}}
