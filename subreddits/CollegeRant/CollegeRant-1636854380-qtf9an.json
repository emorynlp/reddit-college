          "text": "When it's relentless (over 2 years) and across a countless range of communities (running, military, college, even general discussion subs like unpopularopinion and lifeprotips are sick of him), not to mention the repeated ban evading (and continuing to do the same things that got him banned in the first place), people can get pretty hostile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I think the snooroartracker folks can chime in better but he's not here to ask for help. He just wants to whine and complain and get pity points on the internets. I personally tried helping him with running but the discussions go nowhere. The flow of the conversation is always the same.\n\nSnoo: I need help with this and that!\n\nHelping person: Have you tried, X, Y, Z?\n\nSnoo: Did all of those, nothing works. (Or some bullshit excuse for why he can't do X, Y or Z). My life sucks, poor me and my genetics.\n\nOn top of that he always tries to find \"A HA! GOTCHA!\" points in our posts to invalidate any advice. And that's pretty tame. Others have told their personal struggles and resolutions as advice, and he responds by using those stories AGAINST THEM as a means of saying \"your advice is invalid\".\n\n It's EXTREMELY difficult to have any sort of reasonable form of communication with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe he has indeed attempted some solutions, but judging by the inconsistencies in the posts, he's likely bullshitting/fabricating/overexaggerating so people can feel sorry for him.",

Blocking and ignoring usually works with trolls. Unfortunately, he makes maybe like 30 alts a week so blocking turns into endless cat and mouse, and ignoring just sprouts new posts (he doesn't lose interest from lack of response, it aggravates him even more).",
