  "text": "I am so close to finishing school, but I had to take an elective this term. I chose to take a religious studies course since I\u2019ve taken one before and I actually enjoyed it.The first week came by and the amount of work in this course was way too much and I instantly was turned away from the subject. It\u2019s too late to drop it, so I\u2019m just trying to get through it. I\u2019ve also maintained a 4.1 gpa while in college, but I have a feeling this class is going to take me way down and I may or may not pass the course. I\u2019m frustrated but also I\u2019m extremely burnt out so at times I could really care less (I actually do care, but I can\u2019t afford to stress myself out right now). Anyway, thanks for letting me vent.\n\nAny advice or words of encouragement? I am definitely taking a break once I graduate in summer.",
