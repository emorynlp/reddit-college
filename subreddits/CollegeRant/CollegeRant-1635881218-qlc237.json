  "text": "Just wanted to get this off my chest quickly so sorry for any grammatical errors. \n\nI took my stats test last Friday. I\u2019ve always struggled with math but there were a lot of things that I had to do for this unit. I tried by best to prepare for it and watched videos on the things I was struggling with but ultimately some things just didn\u2019t click with me. I somehow managed to work through all of the problems, and even the extra credit problem, but I don\u2019t even know if I used the right things to solve them. I feel as if everyone knew what they were doing except for me. \n\nMy professor usually grades our tests really quickly, but he hasn\u2019t been feeling well lately so we haven\u2019t gotten our grades back yet. I already have a C in this class and I\u2019m not looking forward to see how I did. It doesn\u2019t help that we don\u2019t really have any other graded work besides discussion posts (that he doesn\u2019t grade in time for some reason).",
