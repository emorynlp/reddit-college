  "text": "Just wanted to get this off my chest quickly so sorry for any grammatical errors. \n\nI took my stats test last Friday. I\u2019ve always struggled with math but there were a lot of things that I had to do for this unit. I tried by best to prepare for it and watched videos on the things I was struggling with but ultimately some things just didn\u2019t click with me. I somehow managed to work through all of the problems, and even the extra credit problem, but I don\u2019t even know if I used the right things to solve them. I feel as if everyone knew what they were doing except for me. \n\nMy professor usually grades our tests really quickly, but he hasn\u2019t been feeling well lately so we haven\u2019t gotten our grades back yet. I already have a C in this class and I\u2019m not looking forward to see how I did. It doesn\u2019t help that we don\u2019t really have any other graded work besides discussion posts (that he doesn\u2019t grade in time for some reason).",

      "text": "Not exactly the same situation, but. I took college level stats back in high school and no one knew what they were doing on some of those tests. Especially the final. Our valedictorian barley scraped by in that class. Stats just sucks. Even our teacher hated it, and they were one of them strange math loving people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also had that lost feeling you are experiencing during most of the class, not knowing if you are using the right thing.  I think I barley got out of there with a C-. So in short I would be too hard on yourself. You can only do your best. No one can expect anything more from themselves.",
