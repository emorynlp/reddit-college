I am an honor's student, have maintained a 3.8 gpa unweighted, am working on a minor, and am one of the most disciplined students at my school. Last semester hit me very hard. From about Easter break to the end of the semester, I was averaging around three hours of sleep a night, working on the largest theatrical production I have ever worked on (I am a theatre major), and grinding out both classroom work and honor's coursework. I missed many friend group meet ups, making my social life completely nonexistent for this time. It felt like one month of being awake, solely fueled by a fight response in order to survive, or like a husk of a human being producing all that was asked of him.  Following the final assignment that I turned in, I broke down into tears of both depression and joy. I was free, and before going back to my job for the summer, I wanted to take a week to do nothing but relaxing things. However, here I sit with a sense of guilt for taking a \"lazy\" week (even though I have even done some productive things this week, just not nearly as much). I can say that my drive has always been fueled for a desire to be a successful human being, but I can never slow down for even a short time without a sense of anxiety and guilt sweeping over me. It is tremendously unhealthy for me to grind as much as I have. I skip meals, miss out on social life, and rarely sleep. What should I even do? Any advice, encouragement, or critique is appreciated.", "author": "Cswag113", "created": 1621477368, "retrieved": 1632842349, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"gyrwysc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ngo7cg/why_do_i_an_incredibly_disciplined_student_feel/gyrwysc/", "text": "Thank you u/Cswag113 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also have a huge guilt complex over spending time for myself that isn\u2019t used doing something \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\nTry reframing down time in your mind as something that is healthy and necessary to be your best. Because it is! Adequate sleep, meals, free time, and socialization are extremely important to our mental and physical health. Denying yourself those things is not sustainable in the long term (I found out the hard way). \n\nEven if you can\u2019t make yourself feel like you need the down time, remember that you do deserve it after working so hard.", "author": "GeeseEnPointe", "created": 1622058044, "upvotes": 1}, "gz0obpb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ngo7cg/why_do_i_an_incredibly_disciplined_student_feel/gz0obpb/", "text": "It sounds a lot like burnout, and yes, you do deserve rest. Everyone needs it from time to time.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to talk with a therapist about it - sometimes they can help find healthy coping techniques that will allow you to manage the anxiety and feelings of being trapped.", "author": "caracarakite", "created": 1621653164, "upvotes": 2}}}
