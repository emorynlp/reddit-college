      "text": "So this can be pretty common with majors and when students do accelerated PharmD or BS/MD programs this is always my biggest fear. Have you observed pharmacists working, do you enjoy the aspect of observing and the day to day job of a pharmacist? You need to figure out if you are burnt out from school in general, online classes are making you lose motivation, or you no longer have a love for pharmacy. I\u2019d recommend talking to people in the field and taking some time for your mental health to relax and minimize burnout. Are classes online this year?",

      "text": "I\u2019m personally going through that a bit myself. I\u2019ve yet to actually take classes in person relating to my major, so I\u2019m giving it a shot. With how much school costs though, I\u2019m definitely on the side of pursuing your other interests if it doesn\u2019t seem to click as well when you\u2019re in person experiencing it everyday again. If it\u2019s getting bad in school, it\u2019s likely not going to be all that long into your career that you\u2019re feeling the same and then you\u2019re stuck. There\u2019s lots of people who change majors and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it at all. You want to make sure you\u2019re doing what you want in life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a bit caught up myself, but I\u2019m giving it a legit shot again with things going back to normal before making any switch.",
