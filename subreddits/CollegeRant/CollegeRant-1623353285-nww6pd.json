I\u2019m taking college algebra, and it\u2019s not a hard class at all. The problem is the damn cengage site is horseshit. I keep missing points because I put an extra decimal point or I add an extra space before a numbers. What inspired me to write this post is that I\u2019m currently doing a homework assignment and we are doing the quadratic formula (not a hard concept at all) but this assignment keeps throwing in equations with uppercase letters, Greek symbols, and letter subscripts and I keep losing damn points because I can\u2019t type the little damn o as a subscript exactly the way they want it. If this were in person the professor would award me the points because it\u2019s right but cengage only gives you credit if you have the exact same answer as them. I\u2019m tired of it.", "author": "tate3223", "created": 1623353285, "retrieved": 1632842242, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h1bficv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nww6pd/i_cannot_stand_online_math/h1bficv/", "text": "Thank you u/tate3223 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
