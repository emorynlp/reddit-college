  "text": "\n\nIncoming rant: I can\u2019t stand physics in any capacity. I understand that if your going to be an engineer , you need to understand physics. But other than that, it\u2019s just taking common sense and making it extremely complicated for no reason other than a grade. \u201cYou pull on a rope attached to a bucket. The bucket is heavy. Exactly how far with the bucket move with how much force and what\u2019s the angle of your penis while this is happening ?\u201d Seriously , bucket = heavy. Put more strength into it or get a friend to help. No equations required. Also, I\u2019m so sick of the \u201c Go see the tutor if your having trouble with concepts\u201d bullshit. Maybe if you taught the class stuff we could actually USE then I wouldn\u2019t need to do that. May as well have the tutor teach the class at this point. End of rant, ty for reading.",

      "text": "As a physics student, I don't really go with my tutors because most are not that good at teaching. I depend on youtube, random websites like hyperphysics or something, and some books.    \n\n\nYes, it seems silly that we do all this work just to find the distance the bucket is moved or how fast a ball is rolling down a plane.  Even as a physics student, it feels like a lot of work because it is! Nature doesn't need to make sense or make itself easier. We don't have math that can solve everything in a single step, or follow a \"procedure\" every time, because there isn't.  Physics is present in every corner of modern life, and common sense doesn't really apply to everything. Especially when you enter special relativity and quantum mechanics.  \n\n\nit's not always about stuff we can use, it's also about cultivating a certain mentality in people. Getting comfortable with the abstract, how math translates to real-life systems, critical thinking and so on. Everybody struggles with physics, including the physicists. Good luck.",

      "text": "I can appreciate where you\u2019re coming from. Physics was my least favorite STEM course in undergrad, but I had to take it and excel anyways if I wanted any chance of getting into med school. Like you, I thought that it was a waste of time for anyone not going into a physics-heavy curriculum. What good was it for me to know exactly how far a projectile shot from a cannon would travel to reach its final position? I wanted to know how medicines worked to cure diseases.\n\nNot everyone is good at every subject, and even before that not everyone could hope to be good at every subject. It\u2019s not a matter of talent, but interest and relevance. I never liked mechanics, and so I slaved away at problems and taught myself how to do only what I had to in order to do well on the test. Later, the material turned to electricity, magnetism, and nuclear physics - and while I won\u2019t be doing much electrical engineering anytime soon, I learned to appreciate that those are the forces that underlie everything else. The biology and chemistry that I was good at, and that I was interested in, were merely macroscopic systems making use of those same things described by equations. That\u2019s not to say it was easy or that I had a lot of fun doing it at the time, but with hindsight I\u2019m very glad I got to learn those concepts, because it helps you put together a lot of other material in science and in the world.\n\nYou\u2019ll probably never \u201cenjoy\u201d physics when you take the courses. The people that do come from a different background and have different interests. They probably struggle with other areas, including some that you\u2019re good at. My area of strength is neurobiology and genetics, which I\u2019m sure some engineers and physicists themselves would dread. Perhaps they feel the same way about it as you do about physics. But I can appreciate even now that physics is at work in all that I do. The brain runs on electricity, and static interactions, electric forces, and yes, even simple mechanics, underlie every protein interaction, which themselves are the mechanism of the great majority of everything that happens in life. Learning equations might not be fun, but your professor knows you won\u2019t remember them in a year. What he\u2019s hoping for is that you will remember an appreciation for breaking things down further and further until you have an understanding of how they work, and then figuring out how to go further. That\u2019s what physics means to me.\n\nIn short, this won\u2019t be the last time you\u2019re stuck with a problem and no great solution. In times like these, very much hard work and frustrating repetition may be ahead. But it won\u2019t last forever, and you just might appreciate it down the road.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, feel free to let me know. It wasn\u2019t too long ago I was right where you are now.",

My physics lecture has over 100 people, and the professor has a certain way that they teach. That method wont be great for everyone, it might not be great for anyone. Thats just how it is. If you want to do well in a class like that you need to put in effort. I got a question wrong in a quiz in a different class, and today I went to the TA's office hours and now I could do the problem in my sleep and will get it right on the exam. You dont need to specifically get a tutor but you need to either go the office hours of your TA or professor or work on homework with other students who know what theyre doing. You need to *something* if the lecture isnt clicking for you. Youre only wasting your own time and money if you dont. \n\nSincerely,\n\nA college student who never ever got extra help the first time around and failed out, who then changed how she approached college and got an associates with a 4.0",

I know I\u2019m weak at math, but I excel in other areas. I don\u2019t want sympathy or someone to tell me in being naive. I want a deductive pragmatic system of solving the problems of physics that efficiently outlines ways to apply kinematic equations to other areas that are behind taught.",
