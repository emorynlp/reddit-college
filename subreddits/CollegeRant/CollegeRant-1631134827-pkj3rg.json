  "text": "but then again, first of all it's only natural for most things to be for nothing and it's just *my fault* because I didn't plan it right in the end, second of all as long as it distracts me, I can just continue doing all these meaningless things forever, and third of all, I can't even do shit most of the time so this inaccurate in the first place. haha, all because of the fear of it being for nothing in the first place - so then my work becomes bogged down with stress and half-assed, and guess what, a self fulfilling prophecy, wow more misery and getting screwed over, time to repeat it once agian",
