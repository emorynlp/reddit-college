It seems like most kids at my school are trying, and when I watch the graduation and google things up I realize that not much people graduate with a GPA above 3.5 with relation to everybody graduating with univ transfer degrees, even among people that don't work full time or have dependents and are getting a AA degree. This and me looking at other forums tells me that most of the people at my cc graduating with honors(3.0-3.4) GPA are actually trying their hardest in alot of their classes, even if they're going for a AA. They aren't slackers at all. I realize this is the case in general for college and university students, even if it's not a science or math degree. Especially if you end up with the wrong professors. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24", "author": "chenthehen", "created": 1586485118, "retrieved": 1632951042, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"frbjxcg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fy65bl/people_graduating_with_a_30_35_are_actually_good/frbjxcg/", "text": "In my major most of my friends had 2.7-3.1.

I agree to some extent. I would say I work really really hard sometimes, but often it doesn't pay off in the end. Maybe it's poor study habits (memorizing than understanding, practicing but only getting the pattern and not the background, etc), maybe from shit professors, or maybe it's just the plain wrong major (boy I hope that isn't true!)
