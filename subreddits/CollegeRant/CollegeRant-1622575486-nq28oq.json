Then I got stuck in a bad situation and my mental health was at an all time low. Online classes were impossible to learn in for me and my GPA dropped to a 2.7. Now I have to work extra hard to get it back up and I can\u2019t even get near where I was. I\u2019m just praying for a 3.0 at this point, but even then I probably won\u2019t get into the grad school I want. \n\nI know it\u2019s my fault. I should have worked harder. I\u2019m so disappointed in myself. I want to retake classes but I can\u2019t financially swing that. I feel stuck and so stupid. Being intelligent was the only thing I had going for me, now I\u2019m below average. I\u2019m so disappointed in myself. \n\nTL;DR Covid ruined my mental health and my GPA.", "author": "Old_Education_9927", "created": 1622575486, "retrieved": 1632949767, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
