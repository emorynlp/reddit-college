On top of that the past few months have been erratic and stressful for me.\n\nMy collegues let me know that the due date for delivering a workbook was this monday, but they didn't provide a time frame when.\n\nI contacted the teaching aid, as my proffesors are not very responsive( one is the dean so i guess I should cut them some slack too). Nope, no answer.\n\nI ended up deciding to deliver the workbook on friday( that's their consultation date). In the meantime I wrote a detailed email to my proffesor about why am I late with the delivery.\n\nNo answer.\n\nLike for heavens sake, I don't need the points, just let me know if you will accept this on friday, or shouldn't I even bother coming. My health was a wreck and yet I still have attended 14/15 lectures as a part time student. I'm trying my best but nobody cares.", "author": "Laughtouseintolerant", "created": 1625665905, "retrieved": 1632949595, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h4ctinn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ofjayk/as_a_part_time_student_they_should_cut_some_slack/h4ctinn/", "text": "So sorry to hear about your health issues. :(\n\nPart time usually means you take fewer courses, but you\u2019d still be expected to do the full work in each of the courses you take.
