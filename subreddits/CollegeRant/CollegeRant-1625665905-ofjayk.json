  "text": "I am a part time student due to chronic health issues. On top of that the past few months have been erratic and stressful for me.\n\nMy collegues let me know that the due date for delivering a workbook was this monday, but they didn't provide a time frame when.\n\nI contacted the teaching aid, as my proffesors are not very responsive( one is the dean so i guess I should cut them some slack too). Nope, no answer.\n\nI ended up deciding to deliver the workbook on friday( that's their consultation date). In the meantime I wrote a detailed email to my proffesor about why am I late with the delivery.\n\nNo answer.\n\nLike for heavens sake, I don't need the points, just let me know if you will accept this on friday, or shouldn't I even bother coming. My health was a wreck and yet I still have attended 14/15 lectures as a part time student. I'm trying my best but nobody cares.",

Are you considered part time because of a smaller course load?\n\nWas the deadline for the workbook given in the syllabus and/or is there a late policy?",

          "text": "Part time here is same course load, but you don't have to attend classes. So basically the same just without the attendance. If i was full time, I would need at least 90% attendance to be able to even try exams.\n\nThe work date was given by the grapevine, no electronic or direct information. I didn't know it was due to that Monday, until the Sunday. I even wrote a mail to the aid that night to ask about the time for the next day, as I was v sick and couldn't just go at 10 and wait till someone showed up.",

For some reason, I\u2019ve noticed that people with health issues don\u2019t actually get helped but, rather ignored. Seems crummy since you do pay like everyone else. \n\nSource: I have health problems. Am in the same boat.",

I had a gallbladder attack in my first year and I ended up bedridden for 3 weeks. Lost 30 ish pounds. Showed up with my specialist notes and a letter for excusion. My mans threw me out of the office. Mind you my specialist was an 83 year old proffesor working at our uni and national academy of arts and sciences. So yeah ego is a huge thing in academia.",
