You want a lasting fix to solve your problems, eh? How many years you got penciled in at that college? After that, how many years grinding every single day for your share of scraps going around with your little piece of paper acting like someone actually cares about it or it matters (let alone cares about you)? Are you studying something now a robot or developing world freelancer can't easily do for 1/10th the cost? Colleges bring you in to make money, greatest credit sharks you'll ever meet. They sell you on a promise to make more but leave you owing one-tenth a million with no experience in the job market. But hey, McDonald's is always hiring. Most college operate like businesses in the USA and most students (to make matters worse) waste their time in college, playing a bunch of video games, jerking off everyday, perusing social media, doing the bare minimum studying, drinking wildly, just checking the box. I doubt the \"best times in someone's life\" are based on studying 8 hours a day or whatever the benchmark is that's set in most classes. Those fond memories likely come from a time when they weren't weighed down witn mortgages, kids, ex-wives, high blood pressure, debt, male pattern baldness, hopelessness, etc. They look at 'being young' with fondness because now they are older and that era seemed more carefree. You write that \"college is overrated,\" well so is a career, so is partying, so is everything that you base someone else's opinion on. College is unneccessary if you have half an idea what you want to do with your life. It's not about a job title, but more about the relationships you cultivate, the passion projects you continually work on, how dedicated and disciplined you are in staying healthy, showing up to work, the people you serve, and the awareness of your life spirit, breath, and moving toward greater happiness. No institution is going to give you any of that. But you can find it within. But regardless, I believe you can make college work for you. Snap judgements two weeks in will not be overarching.
