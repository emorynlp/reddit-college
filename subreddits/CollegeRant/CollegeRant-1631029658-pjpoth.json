But one course, I took during 2020 pandemic while working full time, I have a solid C in and while I'm not made or anything, it is bothering me to the core that I got a C and everything else is Bs and As. Should I retake it to improve my GPA? Or should i get this Bs over with after 3 long stressful near suicidal years???", "author": "KryptonianPug", "created": 1631029658, "retrieved": 1632841140, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbxz619": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pjpoth/to_be_jaded_or_care_too_much/hbxz619/", "text": "Thank you u/KryptonianPug for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
