  "text": "I am so tried and frustrated by Professors and dept heads who think that they are above all. They don\u2019t have any sympathy for anyone and are just trying to make things harder. I think that this is because I am an immigrant and I have an accent so they automatically think that they can boss me around? I have seen it is much worse with my mom since she have a much noticeable english accent. I don\u2019t think that these same Professors will act this way with someone who is white or a male but they are just so much worse with me and I can\u2019t tell weather it\u2019s in my hear or is it normal to be an ass to students ?",
