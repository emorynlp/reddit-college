I had a choice of in person with this professor who had great reviews but it was 2 hours Mon-Fri, or this other professor with below average reviews but it was online and had no meeting time. I didn\u2019t think the reviews would matter that much for an online class for something simple like algebra. Boy was I ever wrong. The reviews were a bullseye. The common complaints about the professor were noticeable by day 2. It literally feels like deja vu living all the complaints I read about. Do yourself a favor and check rate my professor before you sign up for classes!\n\nFor fun I checked some of my favorite professors and the lowest average for one was a 3.9. The app isn\u2019t just used to complain about professors.

In my case, the courses I've taken with profs that have low ratings have always been positive. It just depends on the student. \n\nPlus if you look at the rating and that's the only prof that teaches it so you have to take it with them, and they have low ratings, you will now be (unintentionally or intentionally) biased against that prof even if they are actually really good. This could end up hurting you in the end.\n\nBuyer beware when it comes to RMP ratings, don't base your college schedule and courses solely off of it.\n\nETA: not saying it doesn't have its correct ratings but I've seen some of profs I loved that had very poor ratings. Including some that I knew who the ratings came from and they did poorly due to their own issues, not the profs.
