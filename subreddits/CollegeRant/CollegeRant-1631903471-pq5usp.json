  "title:": "When over half the class is failing who\u2019s really failing, the student or the teacher?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m in a class of only about 7 people including myself.  It\u2019s a 4 part class and I\u2019m currently in the third part this semester.  Anyway, I\u2019ve talked to 4 of the other students and, along with myself, are failing, the other 3 students are just skirting by.  Of course, our teacher has been doing what we do for over 40 years so when we ask him questions he acts as if we should know what he\u2019s talking about.  He says and explains how he\u2019s always open for questions but I find it EXTREMELY difficult to ask because he gets short tempered and acts like a smart ass when we try to ask questions.  Not only that, he explains things in ways that he understands the concepts and not in ways we understand them so even after asking questions I\u2019m left in the dark and don\u2019t feel obliged to keep asking the same questions.  All that being said IMO he\u2019s the one who\u2019s failing us, not the other way around.  It just sucks seeing my classmates and myself fail right now and not knowing how I\u2019m gonna get back on track.",

      "text": "It depends on the class. Most professors teach the same class every quarter with a relatively normal class average. Occasionally, there is one class where half the students fail; it's entirely possibly to get dealt a bad hand with a bunch of low-achieving students. \n\nThe time that the class is offered as well as the general education offerings each semester determine the number of students interested in a given class and the reason for their enrolment. If they are enrolling out of interest or because it's a course for their major, they tend to do well. If they enrol to fulfill a GE they tend to do poorly.",

I did not understand  jack shit what the professor  said for that  entire semester but stick by cause I don't  give jack shit about math either. (But I tried my best) I was definitely  failing and my classmates  too. The teacher pass us all. I knew something  like this could happen, if it did not...

Not really but in their mind. \n\nNot to say that there are not lazy unprepared students. There are. But, if that many people are failing, as an instructor, you need to look at the clarity of the lessons, the connections being made and how assessments are set up.",

To be a successful professor IMO you should be consistently getting your classes opinions.\n\nI had a professor last semester do entirely honest surveys every month about what we thought of the class. Were we learning? Were his methods right for us? If we could change anything, what would it be? Lots of free text space to say what we think and how we feel and because it was entirely anonymous we didn\u2019t risk getting punished at all. THATS a good professor. At least to me it is-your job shouldn\u2019t be to pass or fail people. It should be to help them learn in a way they enjoy and are interested. \n\n\nThis is why, when applicable, I LOVE progress based professors who don\u2019t grade you on your grades, but grade you on how much you improved throughout the semester (obviously this doesn\u2019t work for every subject.",

I used to say it\u2019s the teacher and well, after retaking it I realized that it just required the work they say it requires will most classes will take way less then what they say. So I know tend to say, it\u2019s usually either students who are underprepared or a mix. Everything after school is usually not just lecturer as long as they don\u2019t purposefully fail students/classes. Which lecturers usually don\u2019t do, they have no reason to. But it does happen. \nMy tip here, look for a) alternative publications to read BEFORE class, so that you already got a good grasp on what he\u2019s teaching you b) asking him for further lit recommendations (if he doesn\u2019t already have a list in his syllabus, in that case check out the list and see if it helps) and c) look for classmates who are still doing well or upperclass students who already passed, and ask them. Maybe someone is willing to form a study group? \nI think it\u2019s a typical case of, if you don\u2019t get a basic grasp of it, you can\u2019t follow him. But I am afraid it might not be just him, but the class in general. That sucks but there are some\nClasses like that for all of us",
