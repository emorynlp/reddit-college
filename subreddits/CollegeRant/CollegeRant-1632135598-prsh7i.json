I was also lucky enough to get into the nicer dorms my first year and the meal plan made life so easy. However, I have always been a homebody, so moving back home wasn't too bad. Even then I was still tired of being at home all day for over a year. I was excited to be back in-person school as I felt like I was doing well in classes without actually learning anything.\n\nHowever, now that I have moved back on campus as a third-year (meaning that I will be in the apartments now and have to learn to clean and to adult), I'm finding that my homesickness and anxiety is at an all time high. I just moved in yesterday (which was also my bday and made that even more sad), and I have already had multiple crying sessions and breakdowns. Just thinking about my parents make me cry (even now); just this day, mom called and wow that breakdown happened real quick (idk what it says bout me but I tried my best to hide it, it worked though). I'm not sure if it's the adulting getting to me or realising that I'm in my third year of undergrad, really hoping to go into medicine, but not knowing if I can do it since other than my GPA, I've got nothing.\n\nI wanted to know if anyone is dealing with the same thing after in-person classes returned? How did you deal with it? I read that exercising could help, but I've always been self-conscious and I'm not sure any friends would go with. Also, any long-tern mental health support will require a ride and I don't have a car; it's not really within my budget to uber so regularly. Also, I have never had any breakdown except for one time during high school junior year but I blame SATs", "author": "what_ami_doingT_T", "created": 1632135598, "retrieved": 1632840993, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"hdkrr93": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/prsh7i/college_anxietyhomesicknessdepression_and_how_to/hdkrr93/", "text": "Thank you u/what_ami_doingT_T for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Look into online therapy; many places do video calls. But other than that, you just moved in. It'll get better in time. The first week I was in my apartment, I was definitely feeling homesick and majorly anxious, but it got better with time. Build a routine for yourself.
