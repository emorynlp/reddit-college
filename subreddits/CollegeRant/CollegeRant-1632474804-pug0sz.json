I\u2019ve had this professor the past two semesters, but online only. This semester we are face to face and in the lab. \nLast semester online I asked about a problem in the book, end of chapter review (not homework) and she told me to \u201cjust ask your classmates\u201d Isn\u2019t it her job to help us? \n\nSo now, next semester in- First day of lab and she rattles off some terms and points to pictures of cells on the wall. This is an eos, this is a baso, this is a neut, ect, like I said just pictures, nothing telling me what they are besides her. I asked her if there was a chart in the book or online she could point me to to help learn. She looks at me and says I just told you what those were. I said I\u2019m very much a visual learner and need to see it multiple times to get it to sink in. She goes, \u201cthose are pictures, how much more visual do you need?\u201d I lost it and said yes they are but I don\u2019t know WHAT they are. \n\nWeek or so later we\u2019re looking through the microscopes and I ask her to come by to see what type of cell I\u2019m looking at. She goes, \u201cwell what do you THINK you\u2019re looking at?\u201d  I tell her I think it\u2019s a baso. She then says to me, \u201cif you called that a baso in a real lab they would laugh at you\u201d. What kind of teacher says that?! Having the smart mouth I do, I responded well that\u2019s why I\u2019m in school to learn. \n\nAnother girl in class is pretty smart and a lot of us go to her asking for help, the teacher told her to \u201cshut up\u201d Another time the class was talking about genetics and the professor was having trouble getting a point across. A girl corrected her on it, and she says to her \u201cKatie, you\u2019re not that smart\u201d I\u2019m glad I had my mask on because my mouth dropped open! Again who says that to a student?!\n\nThen in the same day, she can be really nice outside of the class. I can see her in her hallway and she\u2019ll compliment me on working hard, and getting good grades. \n\nI can\u2019t go talk to the head of the program because they are best friends. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to keep my head down, only speak when spoken to, and keep quiet. \n\nAny other advice? \n\n*My processor is a bitch but nice outside of class.", "author": "TBunny33", "created": 1632474804, "retrieved": 1632840985, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"he2jye0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pug0sz/professor_is_a_bitch/he2jye0/", "text": "Thank you u/TBunny33 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
