  "text": "I specifically took fully online classes through a college with a dedicated online program due to personal circumstances. My math professor is requiring me to go to in-person, handwritten proctored tests instead of online proctored tests. To make it worse, she's the only one teaching this class.\n\nEdit: She's also requiring all homework assignments be handwritten.",
