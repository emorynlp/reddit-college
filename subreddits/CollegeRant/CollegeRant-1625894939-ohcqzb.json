I have been receiving goods and bads of majoring in international business. Operations and SCM is one of my majors, and I am thinking of taking international business as my second major. However, some people said this is a weird double major combination, and some said IB is not in demand in the current market, and you might not find a job related to IB.\n\nCan anyone please give me any suggestions?", "author": "TiffanyFu123", "created": 1625894939, "retrieved": 1632841795, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"h4o9590": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohcqzb/is_international_business_a_useless_major/h4o9590/", "text": "Thank you u/TiffanyFu123 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As for whether it\u2019s useless, I think it depends on 2 things. 1) what do you want to do with it, and 2) have alumni from your school placed there. \n\nEx 1) finance and international business major from CSUMB - this is a non target school, chances are - most alumni will not make it to investment banking. More likely to take on some admin role or analyst at a local company in some financial capacity\n\nEx 2) marketing and management major from Wharton - target school and has a decent chance at bulge bracket (BB) investment banks and large consulting firms.\n\nHaving been at a BB, I don\u2019t like the culture at BB banks and consulting. I\u2019d much rather do interesting things at a local smaller firm with larger scope of projects. That said, i would not advise someone to study international business for employability reasons. Study it if you are genuinely interested in it.", "author": "SellingRunePickaxe", "created": 1626117191, "upvotes": 1}}}
