I have been receiving goods and bads of majoring in international business. Operations and SCM is one of my majors, and I am thinking of taking international business as my second major. However, some people said this is a weird double major combination, and some said IB is not in demand in the current market, and you might not find a job related to IB.\n\nCan anyone please give me any suggestions?", "author": "TiffanyFu123", "created": 1625894939, "retrieved": 1632949570, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"h4yburh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohcqzb/is_international_business_a_useless_major/h4yburh/", "text": "Note that IB tends to mean investment banking in the finance world rather than international business - that might tell you something about its exposure. As for whether it\u2019s useless, I think it depends on 2 things. 1) what do you want to do with it, and 2) have alumni from your school placed there. \n\nEx 1) finance and international business major from CSUMB - this is a non target school, chances are - most alumni will not make it to investment banking. More likely to take on some admin role or analyst at a local company in some financial capacity\n\nEx 2) marketing and management major from Wharton - target school and has a decent chance at bulge bracket (BB) investment banks and large consulting firms.\n\nHaving been at a BB, I don\u2019t like the culture at BB banks and consulting. I\u2019d much rather do interesting things at a local smaller firm with larger scope of projects. That said, i would not advise someone to study international business for employability reasons. Study it if you are genuinely interested in it.", "author": "SellingRunePickaxe", "created": 1626117191, "upvotes": 1}}}
