          "text": "Agreed! I'm very much an extrovert, and have always loved group projects. Now that my school is 100% online and campus is closed at least through the end of the summer, our \"group time\" happens via email exchange, text message, and voicemails. Our age ranges are early 20's through late 50's, and while we're all more than willing to cooperate, we have to take what we can get when it comes to work right now, so Zoom is rarely an option. Even my professors simply record lectures and post them in the virtual classroom. So yeah: at this point, it feels like group projects are nothing more than social media interactions.",

              "text": "I have to create all the methods to communicate with my partners. Because if it was not for me, we would never meet. I have to create group chats, emails, the actual intro of the project, be the leader, zoom meetings, etc. Every project i am assigned to I automatically become the leader because everyone is so lazy/uncooperative and everytime I host a zoom meeting with them to discuss our plans they never even turn their camera on. It sucks and I have to spam notifications on the group chat to get them to do their part for the project because they do it last minute... At least when it was physically I could contact and work with them after class in the library or study room.",
