  "text": "This is the cycle every semester:\n\n- Walk into the semester with a \"refresh\", aim for a 4.0 GPA.\n\n- Do homework, maybe struggle on some grades. Maintain hope.\n\n- Bomb a test after studying.\n\n- Grade drops, 4.0 is unattainable.\n\n- Feel unhappy for the rest of the semester as I try to pass through difficult classes (with a A or 2).\n\nI KNOW NO ONE IS EXPECTING PERFECTION. I KNOW A 2.0 IS ALL IT TAKES TO GRADUATE. I KNOW CONNECTIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT, YET ANYTHING LESS THAN A 3.0 BOTHERS ME. I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS TO MYSELF. I AM NOT GOING TO STUDY VERY INTENSELY EITHER, I WILL NOT LET THE SYSTEM CONTROL MY LIFE.\n\nI'm just frustrated right now again. That's all.",

I\u2019ve really struggled with motivation this term, but I\u2019m still clinging to that 4.0 GPA. I know that I just have to pass the class, but a big part of me wants to keep the streak alive\u2014as lame as that sounds. \n\nHopefully we can both let go a bit if we have to :)",

Also, GPA really is not a factor after graduating and getting your first job so don\u2019t fixate on it too much. You\u2019re absolutely right that networking is more important, spend your time doing that.",

I know maybe I could get good grades but I'm too distracted/focused on exploring other things than my school. I don't like the college system. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter but I also want to be best at everything. My guilt/importance for grades has diminished over time and I hope it continues to do so without affecting what I can achieve in my life.",

I am working part time and I am full time student. My major is fashion design and merchnandising. I am also prt of many clubs and im in a sorority also. \n\nThe design part is fun but whole lot of work. This particular class, My senior collection which is retrrospective should be easy, no my teacher is making things tens times diffcult. mind you i need a C. I have a C in the class now. My blood always goes up because she tells me my stuff is wrong even though she provides NO FEEDBACK actual feedback to help me. Its beyond fustrasting cause she is pulling grades out of her ass. Nonetheless i ask how i can improve it is walys \"idk its your design\" like bitch ur the one grading me. The professor dead ass talks to me for 5 minutes and leaves. And making the garment in 2 weeks ?! Most designers take a good month. \n\nThese are trying times. It is impossible to do everything. I took a step back from my clubs. but damn I am hardest working person. I get little to no aknowledgement. College has made me drink on the weekdays. \n\nLast semester I was at my lowest & burn out is real. You are not alone in feeling like this",
