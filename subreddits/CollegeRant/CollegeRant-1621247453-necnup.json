Take a breather, give yourself a break. We\u2019re in a pandemic with crazy things happening, nobody is expecting you to have it all together and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t. School is a big part of our lives but that doesn\u2019t mean it should have a big control of us. I was once in the same boat as you are during my freshman year of college. I ended up failing one class and continued to fail two more during my future years but I\u2019m still here, trying my best to earn my degree. You can always retake the classes with a better understanding of the class structure (if you have the same professor) and also remember that you have resources around you such as your academic advisor and your school\u2019s mental health services. There are many students going through the same thing just as you. Take a step back, look over what you need to do, and plan things one step at a time so that you can figure out what you need to catch up on. If you use Canvas, you can also try to calculate and see what a passing score is so that you can pass your finals. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, don\u2019t focus on getting that A+, just focus on passing so that you can have a little more weight lifted off your shoulders. \n\nFailing a class isn\u2019t shameful. As long as there is a will, then there\u2019s a way! If you happen to fail a class then talk things over with your academic advisor and come up with a plan so that you can stay on track for graduation. You got this! Also remember to reach out to your fellow students as well if you\u2019re having trouble with your classes. This is all the advice I can give, but I hope that it helps you out in some way. Keep going! You can do this.", "author": "c_squeezy", "created": 1621248221, "upvotes": 5}}}
