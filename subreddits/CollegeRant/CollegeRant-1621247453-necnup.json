      "text": "Stop. Take a breather, give yourself a break. We\u2019re in a pandemic with crazy things happening, nobody is expecting you to have it all together and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t. School is a big part of our lives but that doesn\u2019t mean it should have a big control of us. I was once in the same boat as you are during my freshman year of college. I ended up failing one class and continued to fail two more during my future years but I\u2019m still here, trying my best to earn my degree. You can always retake the classes with a better understanding of the class structure (if you have the same professor) and also remember that you have resources around you such as your academic advisor and your school\u2019s mental health services. There are many students going through the same thing just as you. Take a step back, look over what you need to do, and plan things one step at a time so that you can figure out what you need to catch up on. If you use Canvas, you can also try to calculate and see what a passing score is so that you can pass your finals. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, don\u2019t focus on getting that A+, just focus on passing so that you can have a little more weight lifted off your shoulders. \n\nFailing a class isn\u2019t shameful. As long as there is a will, then there\u2019s a way! If you happen to fail a class then talk things over with your academic advisor and come up with a plan so that you can stay on track for graduation. You got this! Also remember to reach out to your fellow students as well if you\u2019re having trouble with your classes. This is all the advice I can give, but I hope that it helps you out in some way. Keep going! You can do this.",

          "text": "hey. thanks a lot for this comment. i actually happen to be in my freshman year of college so all of this is new to me.\n\ni have at least been talking to my fellow students in class group chats and sharing my pain and stress with them, but i do think maybe i should try to reach out to the mental health services at my school. i just desperately want not to fail and i don\u2019t think i\u2019m really used to having to deal with four different papers/projects at the same time for four different classes and on top of that final exams. if it was just the final exams i think i\u2019d be fine. but the papers .... i am trying not to stress so much about writing them, but they are a huge part of my grade and i just feel like dying because i have so many to do. i\u2019m paralyzed when i think about having to write for them\n\ni think i\u2019ll see too if i can talk to someone, anyone, at my school\u2019s mental health center before this semester is over. i have a therapist but sadly just as i was about to have another appointment with her last saturday it got cancelled at the last minute which sucks. i just want to be okay. i desperately want a time extension too so i can manage all this better, but grades are due and unless i file a petition to have an incomplete it\u2019s not gonna happen plus i really don\u2019t want to burden my professors either. my mental health is at an all-time low and there are things i desperately want to live for but i don\u2019t know if i can survive anymore. i want to die so bad\n\nbut i will try. i will try......i will try. i\u2019ll try because it\u2019s the least i can do",
