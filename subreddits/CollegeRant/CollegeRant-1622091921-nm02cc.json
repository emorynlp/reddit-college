I felt like I really worked hard to reach my goal of transferring to GA Tech, only to fall short compared to the GPA I was expecting. I applied during my HS senior year (when COVID didn\u2019t exist in the US yet), but I didn\u2019t get accepted and luckily was given a guaranteed chance instead through a transfer pathway offer for Fall 2021 as long as I met some requirements.\n\nFirst semester almost became a total wreck to the point where I had to withdraw from Calculus I and get the credits from elsewhere during winter break, and almost failed my writing class. My organization for second semester was so much better, but I eventually got gassed towards the end with the increased workload. I met all major requirements except the cumulative and math/lab science GPAs which should both be a 3.3 or higher, but I only managed to get a 3.161 and a 3.083 respectively. Not to mention, I only have A\u2019s and B\u2019s on my transcript now, and took a total of eight courses for my spring semester. One of those courses was a retake of my writing class where I improved very significantly, and two others were 300/400 level courses. \n\nAt this point, I just pray that I still somehow have a chance to get in. I\u2019ll still be sending my final grades to admissions anyway. It\u2019s been one hell of a year for a lot of students, and colleges really need to start understanding our perspectives. As of now, I believe that courage should be valued much more than perfect scores until everything goes back to normal.", "author": "RALPHY88_", "created": 1622091921, "retrieved": 1632949783, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"gzvwpxs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nm02cc/i_didnt_meet_the_pathway_offer_gpa_requirements/gzvwpxs/", "text": "If GT is your dream school, you will find a way to get in, even if it\u2019s not this year.
