I graduated college last spring semester with a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering, and tbh I was not happy about it. My parents\u2019 one wish was for their kid to go to college and get a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. I went to community college and got my associate\u2019s, but I wished I stopped there because I recognized how much I hated school (especially when coronavirus hit). \n\nAs a result, I had no motivation in university. It was worse because I wanted to pursue a career in the arts such as video game design, but my parents wanted me to pursue something more financially stable. So, I went with engineering as an alternative, and I hated it. \n\nOnce I graduated, my family happy and I *smiled* to take photos. But once I got into bed, I cried that night not out of happiness, but out of anger and frustration. I was angry at myself and everyone else for putting me in a situation where these 4 years were 4 years of stress, anxiety, and depression because I was trying to make people happy. \n\nThis feeling also happened when I got my driver\u2019s license. It wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t wanna get my license, but I wish I was taught with more rationality and easier. As a result, I still to this day get anxious when I have to drive other people, especially older people, due to the fear that they would nag at my driving.\n\nNow, idk what to do in life and I am left knowing that I got debt to pay. I know I sound ridiculous and ungrateful, and I might be the only one feeling this way. However, I just wanna get this out of the way, and I hope to hear some advice.", "author": "doccopham178", "created": 1630960608, "retrieved": 1632948814, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hbwlpi4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pj7xoo/not_happy_and_regretful_about_going_to_college/hbwlpi4/", "text": "If you did computer engineering or anything of the sort I\u2019m sure you could work for a video game company or smt", "author": "a_ri_a", "created": 1630998929, "upvotes": 1}, "hbw850j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pj7xoo/not_happy_and_regretful_about_going_to_college/hbw850j/", "text": "What kind of engineering?", "author": "SouthernRhubarb", "created": 1630989293, "upvotes": 3}}}
