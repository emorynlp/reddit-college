  "text": "I have not been able to sleep because my entire floor stays up until 2 am (maybe a bit of an exaggeration but it is like 8+ people right across the hall from me each night). I have classes at 8 am and my body naturally wakes up at 6. I have been getting between 3-5 hours of sleep a night since I got here. The clubs I am in are all physically intensive and I do not have the energy to do them due to this lack of sleep, so I have not been going. I kinda just spend all day trying to do work without any ability to focus from being so tired.\n\nI have contacted housing many times and they have done nothing.\n\nMy academic advisor has given me no help and I have no idea what classes to take for next semester. I have no direction in what to do. I want to switch majors and I asked my advisor for advice and she gave me nothing at all.\n\nThis college is not helping me, it doesn't care about me.\n\nI want to transfer out but deadlines for spring are far past.\n\nI will finish this semester but I have no clue at all what to do for the next. Advice anyone?",

      "text": "Transferring seems excessive. For most majors, you\u2019re probably doing mostly general education anyway so it should be fairly easy to pick a few classes. That\u2019s not ideal, however. Have you tried to meet with an advisor in person? I\u2019d say the same for housing, have you tried talking face to face with them or is it just emails?",
