So it was the fall of 2020 and I am taking an ethics class at an online university to fulfill a pre-req for a program I got into this spring. I am cramming the pre reqs in this past semester and taking a total of 7 classes. I\u2019m taking classes at my home campus in person and another school online. I\u2019m giving these details maybe to justify my scrambling and load management tactics I was engaging in on a daily basis. The semester is going on and I\u2019m crushing all my classes but halfway through this ethics class starts to receive less and less of my focus and I\u2019m just turning in assignments and passing tests with minimal effort and completing them by hitting all the points in the grading rubric to get an A but the effort isn\u2019t heartfelt and maybe the professor notices. Also, I am not spending much time on the readings and I\u2019m sure the professor can see my time logged into her class. This comes to a peak on the final assignment where we have a group project. What happens is there are legit technical difficulties with the website where some student can open the assignment and others can\u2019t. This frustrates the professor with all the emails she gets from the issue (also she\u2019s older and just didn\u2019t understand what went wrong). So my group finishes the assignment before the assignment is due and turns it in. There\u2019s a handful of people in the class this happens to so she begrudgingly makes new smaller groups to do the assignment. From the emails she\u2019s really giving off the vibe that she thinks we are just lazy and faking the technical difficulty. First red flag. As the assignment gets closer to being due no one in my group has worked on it. I forsee a catastrophic incident brewing where I imagine my group mates won\u2019t do their part. The due date approaches and my group has excuses with having to work etc. lucky for me I thought this would happen so I had completed everyones part in anticipation of this with like a good 24 citations total and just a great project complete. I turn it in and get the grade back to my complete and utter disgust. She graded it to deprive me of just enough points to where I would get a 89.9 or B. It pissed me off so much because she wasn\u2019t even subtle. I got 0\u2019s in like three categories including citations and formatting which were done properly. I wanted so badly to report the situation but I knew if they really looked at everything they\u2019d realize I did the whole project and also my logged in times were low throughout the semester etc.. I know I earned an A by the rubric but I also gave generic answers and didn\u2019t give much effort all semester so I accepted my lone B for the semester. I\u2019m still pissed that she would bomb my last assignment like that. Also, post scriptum, group assignments online suck ass. Also , Phoenix is a joke and that one old lady ethics professor is trash.

I went to the dean and everything! Guess what? I still ended up with a B even though the dean agreed that I should have gotten an A on the final and therefore an A in the professor's class.
