If I wasn\u2019t so close I\u2019d drop out.  \n\nI just can\u2019t pay attention on zoom. It feels like I\u2019ve learned nothing this semester. I\u2019ve tried everything. Snacks, water, keeping my phone under my bed. I even locked myself in my closet for one class so I wouldn\u2019t have any distractions. And I just watched the shirts on the hangers. I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nMy school has no universal online school work policy (I don\u2019t know if other schools have guidelines, but our professors are left to their own devices). And many professors have been making supplementary assignments to make up for classes not being in person. \n\nI\u2019ve been missing assignments because we have many supplementary online assignments. Discussion boards, voice recordings, peer reviews, and things we normally wouldn\u2019t be doing during the semester on top of what we would normally be doing in a semester. I\u2019ve got Bs and Cs but that\u2019s not enough to keep my scholarship. \n\nWe have had no set midterm week. So I have been doing midterms, supplementary midterm assignments, and draft assignments since September. Now we\u2019ve moved into finals. I\u2019m screaming. I\u2019ve gotten no breaks. I had 4 mid to large scale assignments due on Halloween. \n\n\nI\u2019m so burnt out. I\u2019m struggling to keep up. On top of this I have a puppy, part time work, and an internship. I cry literally every night. I feel as if my time is not my own. My hair is falling out. It feels like everyone else gets this online school more than me and I hate feeling this way. I\u2019m so so far behind. \n\nSo please. I could use some encouragement. Some de-stressing tips. Some empathy. Anything. My support systems have been mostly unhelpful. Mainly giving me the advice \u201cjust do your work\u201d but the anxiety and stress is usually too overwhelming to even start. And I\u2019m super afraid my professors won\u2019t be sympathetic.

I start hearing my own heart beat and freaking out). I usually just put on low-fi music on youtube. It's a continuous string of really chill music. Helps you focus in since the music isn't super busy. Kinda like white noise. I set it to be just under the audio of zoom. It's called \"chill beats to study to\", many of them will show up and it's always live.\n\nIn terms of not having time, I'm really sorry that you've been under so much stress. Although it's counter intuitive, it could be helpful to take little breaks in between long amounts of work (10min break every hour or something). As long as you commit (and it sounds like you're super committed to trying to make things work) it can help. I procrastinate when I feel overwhelmed so the breaks help me gather my thoughts of what I'm gonna do when my break is over into smaller increments. instead of just \"I have to write this essay NOW\" it becomes \"after this break I'm gonna do a paragraph. Then kinda do whatever while passively brain storming and walking around or getting a snack.\n\nI've DEFINITELY been frustrated about the work load. You're absolutely right. There's so much supplementary work just to fill in the time slot. Just because an assignment SHOULD take up a missed hour of class doesn't mean every student CAN finish it in that time. Especially if instructions are unclear or students have other shit and it's hard to keep track. I rarely had to interact with students the entirety of my college career, but now for one course we get put into different groups every week so we constantly have to reintroduce ourselves and it's part of our grade. Why not just keep us in the groups we were put in? The excuse of using discussion boards to help interact with other students the way you would in a class setting is total BS. unless there's some pre-planned group assignment you never were going to have to even talk to your classmates lol \n\nIt's pissing me off how much they're trying to justify bitch work. Give me ONE assignment that takes enough research/critical thinking to take up class time for the week and then a normal Assignment and call it a day. And it'd also be nice if schedules and dates weren't fucked too. I have one class that says I'm on break this week? When none of my other classes are. So during Thanksgiving I'm gonna have a shit ton of work for that class while I already have to do a bunch of work for the other classes that you normally get right before break\n\nSorry this is so long, guess I needed to vent more than I thought lol\n\nTL:DR play \"chill beats to study to\" music on YouTube to help focus. Take incremental breaks when doing longer assignments.
