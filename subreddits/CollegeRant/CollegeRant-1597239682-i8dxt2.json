I get making midterms due in the middle of the day if you\u2019re in person or synchronous online. But who in the fuck makes a final essay \u2013 which is supposed to be a minimum of 8 fucking pages \u2013 due in the middle of the day in *summer*???? People are still traveling because it\u2019s summer and they can\u2019t control what their family wants!!! People have jobs so that they can\u2019t work on essays during the day, and by night, they\u2019re too exhausted to do both our *normal* assignment *and* our final essay. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep up because he wants so much and it\u2019s like, dude, just fucking make it due at midnight, and you\u2019ll get papers that reflect what we\u2019ve learned, not something that we haphazardly threw together because of your fucking demands. Like, seriously!!! It\u2019s one thing to make it due at midnight, I don\u2019t care about that, and it\u2019s one thing to make a test due at class time when there *is* a set class time, but when it\u2019s a work at your own pace???? The fuck???? Why can\u2019t it be due at midnight, or 11 pm, or hell, **9** pm????\n\nAnd what makes it even more infuriating is I have two professors this summer semester, and one of them is doing great. In fact, I\u2019d almost say his assignments are harder, and they certainly are time-wise, but far more manageable. Our final and midterm essays were clearly outlined by him, and he said that he only wanted 5-6 paragraphs and made the papers be due at midnight. It\u2019s workable. But this other prof, who has the *audacity* to request a minimum of *8 pages* gives us less than enough time to actually write it and makes it due in the middle of the day!!!! It\u2019s not even a class for majors only, so idk what the hell he\u2019s trying to do, make people not want to major in this subject????\n\nAND besides that, he either never responds to emails or he takes ten years to respond and by the time he\u2019s responded to your time-sensitive email, you\u2019ve already worked around it and threw something haphazard together. What a fucking asshole, and I have to take him again in the fall (I didn\u2019t fail this class, I just have to take another major requirement which he teaches). And!!!! It\u2019s the same situation!!!! Online, work at your own pace, finals and midterms due at 2 fucking pm", "author": null, "created": 1597239682, "retrieved": 1632951368, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"g1hkg1f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8dxt2/who_in_the_hell_makes_final_and_midterm_projects/g1hkg1f/", "text": "Some professors have weird deadlines. I understand that professors can set deadlines for whenever they want, as long as the deadline is after the class starts and before the class ends.

In college, I had a professor with some strange deadlines, and I had to plan for her deadlines. The class was an education class on Tuesdays/Thursdays from 9:30-10:45. Some of her assignments were due on Wednesdays at 9:30 AM, even though we didn\u2019t have class on Wednesdays. Some other assignments were due at 9:30 AM on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but she wouldn\u2019t grade them before they were due (regardless of how early we submitted them), and we never used any of the assignments in class activities or class discussions. I never understood what the point was of having assignments due before class if she wasn\u2019t going to read the assignments before class or incorporate the assignments into her instructional materials for the day.", "author": "Fleur498", "created": 1597440558, "upvotes": 3}, "g1gwa22": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8dxt2/who_in_the_hell_makes_final_and_midterm_projects/g1gwa22/", "text": "are you.... writing the essay the day it\u2019s due? moving up the deadline a couple hours wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you started working on it earlier- aka how you are supposed to write an essay", "author": "archilochus4875", "created": 1597429614, "upvotes": 2}, "g1ale3h": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8dxt2/who_in_the_hell_makes_final_and_midterm_projects/g1ale3h/", "text": "Wait didn\u2019t you choose to take a summer class?", "author": "picklepepper1", "created": 1597291701, "upvotes": 3}, "g19vr6l": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8dxt2/who_in_the_hell_makes_final_and_midterm_projects/g19vr6l/", "text": "So you\u2019d rather the professor work around your schedule is what your saying.
