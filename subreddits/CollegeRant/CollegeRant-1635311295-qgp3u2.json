  "text": "NSFW: Language\n\nIt's the middle of the damn semester, these fucking professors haven't marked any of my stuff, yet pushed for me to submit on time (I HAVE NO IDEA OF MY ACADEMIC STANDING) . I FUCKING PAID THOUSANDS of dollars out of pocket for tuition (I'm poor and don't qualify for student aid), they tell us to BUY textbooks worth Hundreds of dollars, and we only use 2-4 chapters OR THEIR POSTED SLIDES, and then...THEN have the audacity to say \"when we posted it on the \"REQUIRED textbooks section\", it was just a suggestion\".\n\nAdditionally, my accounting professor wants us to NAME OUR WORK FILES HER FUCKING WAY SPECIFICALLY, OR WE GET A 0 FOR THE ENTIRE FUCKING ASSIGNMENT (Bitch, I have the content correct, and it opens fine on your pc IN FUCKING PDF FORMAT). FUCK THIS BITCH ESPECIALLY.\n\nIN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING SEMESTER, DURING A PANDEMIC, I HAVE TO GO TO A DAMN FUCKING RESTAURANT MILESSS AWAY FROM MY HOME TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS REPORT ON THAT BUSINESS FOR MY BUSINESS CLASS.\n\nTHEN...THENNNNN I HAD TO PAY CLOSE TO $600 FOR ONLINE LAB PROGRAMS FOR MY STATS AND ACCOUNTING COURSES...WHAT. THE. FUCK.\n\nAS A FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT, I SEE THIS AS SOME HIGH-QUALITY FUCKERY.\n\nI'M ONE SEMESTER AWAY FROM GRADUATING, BUT THESE FUCKERS ARE TESTING ME TO MY ABSOLUTE FUCKING LIMIT.\n\nI'M BROKE. I'M DEPRESSED. I HAVE NO TIME. I'M SLEEP DEPRIVED\n\nI KNOW I'M NOT FUCKING DUMB, BUT FOR SOME REASON, EVER SINCE THIS ONLINE FUCKERY HAS OCCURED, I JUST FUCKING FEEL DUMB, AND USELESS. WHAT THE FUCK TYPE OF SORCERY IS THIS EH? I'M AT THE END OF MY ROPE, AND ITS A SHORT FUCKING ROPE.\n\nIN CONCLUCION: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : College is really fucking with me at the moment, and I've had enough.",

We\u2019ve spoken with professors, they said they\u2019ll don\u2019t A but instead do B or nothing at-all.\nI\u2019m not carrying out this thread anymore. My bottom line is; I paid my hard earned money, I want my service to be well done.",

An excuse is when you do something wrong and are trying to, well, excuse it.

Complaining is fine, especially considering *this is a rant sub* which I dont think you fully understand. Shit could ALWAYS be worse. Yes we are privileged to be in college and have clean water and all that. That doesnt mean we can never ever complain lmao, if that were true then no one except tortured sexually abused orphans could complain which is obviously ridiculous. Again. This is a rant sub. Its important to get feelings off your chest. \n\n>quit whining.\n\nSir, this is a rant sub. I seriously dont know what other kind of content should be expected here.",

You wanna get a good degree and make good money? Oh ok. But ofc you don\u2019t want to do any of the hard work for it, you just want something for nothing for the rest of your life.
