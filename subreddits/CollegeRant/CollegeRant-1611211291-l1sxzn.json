They are not \u201call knowing\u201d and they make mistakes all the time. They are just like us. Don\u2019t be afraid to stand up for yourself. Yelling at someone in any capacity is unprofessional and just plain old rude.\n\nIf I was a student in your class and saw that I can guarantee you 100% I would be looking at the professor poorly.

Some are downright rude, others email you incessantly to ask about things on the syllabus. And professors can be total idiots.\n\nJust keep showing up. Chances are, this professor interacted with 30 students this week and doesn't even remember you. And if they do, but you show up repeatedly in other ways as a good student, that matters more. \n\nAnd even if the worst thing you're imagining IS true, this class will be over eventually and you'll never see any of those people again.",

No professor I know earns six figures - only admin get salaries like that unless you\u2019ve been there forever and are publishing a lot. As an adjunct, if I taught a full load of classes every semester ( which I\u2019m not allowed to do), I would make roughly $30K a year. I\u2019m happy not to be full time faculty because, just like public school teachers, they work much more than 40 hours per week and have tons of duties outside of teaching- committees, student advising, etc. \n\nThere are rude people everywhere and I\u2019m sorry this professor is one of them. That can really ruin a student\u2019s experience. If it\u2019s early enough in the semester, consider transferring to another class so you don\u2019t have to be stressed all semester.",
