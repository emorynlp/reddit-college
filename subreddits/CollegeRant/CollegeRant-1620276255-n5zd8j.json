  "text": "For context I type all my papers in Google docs and I use Google docs at work to make custom signs when I need.\n\nJump to tonight and I'm working on my final 8-10 page ethics paper. I get 3/4 done the first page and I realize there's no way I'm gonna be able to reach those page numbers. I've been typing what felt like at least a page and a half but nope not even close. Then I notice the page width seems odd. Turns out I changed the page size to tabloid at work and it never changed back. I've been typing everything on tabloid sized pages this whole semester. In case you didn't know, that means I've been writing papers that were 2-3 times the length they were suppose to be. I hate my life.",

      "text": "jeez, this hurts but it also sounds like something that those study accounts on ig would go nuts over as a hack to trick yourself into writing a long paper but it not feeling as long. if it makes you feel better, i've got like 3 papers due and all my brain can manage is perhaps a form of beaded craft time, at most, so props regardless",

          "text": "Thats a good point, one of my projects I wrote that I thought was 2 pages turned out to be 5.5 pages. It really didn't feel like I wrote that much at the time but  it certainly helped make it a better paper imo. \n\nI wish you luck with your 3, maybe you can convince them to let you turn in some sort of interpretive bead craft instead",
