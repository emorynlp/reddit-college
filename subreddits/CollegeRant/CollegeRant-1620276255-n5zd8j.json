I get 3/4 done the first page and I realize there's no way I'm gonna be able to reach those page numbers. I've been typing what felt like at least a page and a half but nope not even close. Then I notice the page width seems odd. Turns out I changed the page size to tabloid at work and it never changed back. I've been typing everything on tabloid sized pages this whole semester. In case you didn't know, that means I've been writing papers that were 2-3 times the length they were suppose to be.
