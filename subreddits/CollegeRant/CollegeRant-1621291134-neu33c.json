Not because the workload is difficult, it\u2019s extremely manageable, but the social isolation has made me extremely depressed and anxious.\n\nI just feel like I\u2019m in prison doing classes remotely from my tiny college apartment. Even worse when all my friends from home are in the semester system and are off for summer already. I\u2019ve seriously never hit such a mental low than I did this year and I even scared myself with how bad my depression was some days. I feel like I\u2019m crawling to the finish line at this point. This is really just one rant to sum up how I\u2019ve felt since September. To top it off I was broken up with, had family issues, lost my dog unexpectedly, and had roommate issues which just worsened the situation. I\u2019m so so sick of feeling bitter, tired, unmotivated, unworthy, and sad. \n\nClasses are in person next year, but I can\u2019t help but feel nervous that it will be as horrible as this year was. I really don\u2019t want to feel that way since it will be my senior year, but this year wrecked me and my love of learning. Does anyone else feel similar or have advice of how they pulled through the final weeks?", "author": "hotcoco-jo16", "created": 1621291134, "retrieved": 1632950144, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {}}
