We have to do online homework using the online homework tool created by the textbook company. In order to get access to the online homework, you have to buy one of their textbooks ($350 for the physical textbook, $200 for the ebook), and then you need to buy the access code ($30-40 on top of the textbook). So if you take the cheap option you're spending at least $230, but if you buy the print version we're looking at a cost of at least $380...it's a total rip-off.  \n\nSo, I usually put up third party cookie blockers on all of my browsers due to my hatred of targeted ads, because I've given up on actual web privacy and now I'm annoyed about the little things. Well, I went in to do the homework for this class at the beginning of the quarter, and it said there was an error with my account. I tried everything, double checked login information and class registration number, and nothing.\n\nFinally, I read on reddit (of all places) that some sites will lock you out of your account if you don't allow them to track all of your activity and sell it to other companies. Sure enough, I turned off my third party cookie blocker and was immediately granted access. I tried making that site the exemption and nope! It still flipped out. \n\nThis means they charge us a ridiculous amount for their actual content and then on top of that, THEY SELL OUR INFO TO OTHER COMPANIES!!!! They make a killing on us, and all we're left with is their crappy glitchy web homework that doesn't even work half the time. I am going to talk to my professor about this tomorrow, but I don't think they have much control over it.\n\nI'm just so angry because that's like a month of groceries I have to drop on my textbook and homework, and you're going to make us pay to have our personal data sold for a ridiculous amount of money. \n\nGreat. That seems fair. Not like most of us are barely getting by and mentally screwed by this pandemic or anything. \n\n**TL;DR:** Textbook companies charge us way too much for their crappy services and they sell all of our activity and data to third parties, and it makes me **ANGRY**", "author": "Joyfuloops", "created": 1617340586, "retrieved": 1632843488, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 40, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gt43j01": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/midknf/screw_textbook_monopolies/gt43j01/", "text": "Thank you u/Joyfuloops for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd much rather just get the book and leave the crappy web service but no. We have to use whatever useless tool the access code gives us like highlighting text on screen and read aloud features?? Random BS that I literally don't need to pay $200 for. I don't get why we can't just buy the book itself (which are usually cheap for rent) and then do separate work. Can't the professor just copy the problems from their version of the access code? That way they'd still have the answers and problems. You'd literally just have to copy and paste or retype it. But no it's easier to just make already broke college students pay for that.\n\nI didn't know about the selling information part either! That sucks. Usually the second I finish a class I get rid of the site but that's still total BS. I get enough spam in my email every other hour from random sources that I have no idea where they came from. My one teachers textbook is on some random website that I've never heard of and it's shady AF. I still remember my one professor who used a book she wrote for the class and you paid for the pdf on paypal. As in you didn't get the book through the university. You literally had to buy it from her just for her to not teach it to you. But you had to get it because all the answers for her questions were super specific and came directly from the book.
