  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman talking intro to computer science , Calc 2, philosophy and Arabic. I\u2019m planning on majoring in computer science however I wanted to take Arabic to be able to speak to family and we\u2019ve been looking forward to that my whole life (learning the language and speaking to family back home). And it would be so cool. \nHowever, the class requires a ton of work, probably more than I\u2019ve ever done in my life for a class. I knew college was going to be hard but this class on top of my others like computer science (which this is my first time learning programming/coding ever) has been a lot. I have to stay up late many nights to make sure I\u2019m getting my work done and studied enough. \nThis has taken a toll on my mental health and physical well-being. I haven\u2019t been eating or sleeping enough. Keep in mind I\u2019m only a freshman. \n\nI got sick this week with a bad cold and haven\u2019t been able to get better. Everytime I think I\u2019m well enough to do something I get worse. This has forced me to stay home all week and I haven\u2019t been able to get much done. Because of this my mental health is spiraling. \nMy friend decided to drop Arabic and she was my speaking partner for weekly group assignments. \nI am doing well in this course so far, but the effort required is not worth it to me. I can\u2019t keep it up. \n\nPeople are telling me that I\u2019ll have a permanent record of this and I\u2019ll regret it if I drop it. But I seriously don\u2019t know if I can continue to push through. My parents also said they\u2019d be disappointed. \nI have no idea what to do. Push through and risk my well-being or just drop it? It\u2019s not even related to my major.",
