  "text": "It's been about 4 weeks into my freshman year and I've already broke down crying. It's all just some much work and I don't feel like I'm learning much in some of my class. I tell my teachers and they tell me just go talk to the tutors. They kinda help but I feel like I need more. My chemistry teacher has told me that I can drop out into an easier class but I'm too stubborn and want to pass. It's all just so much and I just want to cry. \n\nThis is a really just a rant, I know I probably sound like a baby but I need to get this out somehow",
