It's all just some much work and I don't feel like I'm learning much in some of my class. I tell my teachers and they tell me just go talk to the tutors. They kinda help but I feel like I need more. My chemistry teacher has told me that I can drop out into an easier class but I'm too stubborn and want to pass. It's all just so much and I just want to cry. \n\nThis is a really just a rant, I know I probably sound like a baby but I need to get this out somehow", "author": "nooter70", "created": 1631760126, "retrieved": 1632841042, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hd16u33": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp4r6r/first_mental_breakdown/hd16u33/", "text": "Thank you u/nooter70 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
