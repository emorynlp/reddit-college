Especially during COVID where we didn't have any face to face time. Why become a professor/teach students if you're not willing to talk/respond to them? Don't they have to check their emails incase their colleagues or bosses email them? I don't see why they ignore student emails and answer other emails.", "author": "anothersadsister", "created": 1597270173, "retrieved": 1632843391, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"g1c4kki": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8nf5r/why_do_some_professors_not_respond_to_emails/g1c4kki/", "text": "They probably have an influx of emails.", "author": "Ether_of_Joti", "created": 1597332707, "upvotes": 1}, "g1c2dyc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8nf5r/why_do_some_professors_not_respond_to_emails/g1c2dyc/", "text": "The only times I feel the urge to not respond to a student is \n\n(1) when they ask something that is answered on the syllabus or other class materials\n\n(2) when they make a statement and I don't know what the question is\n\nBut I still reply ... maybe with a little snark but I reply.", "author": "ThatProfessor3301", "created": 1597331710, "upvotes": 2}, "g1bfvey": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8nf5r/why_do_some_professors_not_respond_to_emails/g1bfvey/", "text": "They've got a  lot of other priorities.

If I was going to give benefit of the doubt, I\u2019d say it\u2019s because they get so so many and sometimes emails just get lost in the pile. Happens to me every once in a while. But honestly there\u2019s no excuse. Some professors are bums about it and don\u2019t prioritize students. My wife had a professor that only cared about one school club and nothing else do students would put that club in the subject line to get him to actually open their emails. It\u2019s a shame but it\u2019s good experience for cold calling and persistence in the real world I suppose. If you\u2019re having a ton of trouble, just go straight to the chair and say you can\u2019t get a hold of the professor. If that doesn\u2019t work, email the dean. Don\u2019t come off as emotionally charged. Just say you\u2019re having trouble reaching the person and they haven\u2019t responded to x number of emails in x number of days.", "author": "collegehacked", "created": 1597314653, "upvotes": 21}, "g1b02re": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8nf5r/why_do_some_professors_not_respond_to_emails/g1b02re/", "text": "Well, from their perspective, they're hugely interested in their own work, and thus went to graduate school to get a PhD to continue publishing research.
