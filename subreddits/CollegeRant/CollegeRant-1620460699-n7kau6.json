  "text": "Edit: Sorry for late response about uni's negligence. My uni didn't conduct any classes (online or physical) for few months (4\\~5 months)  saying they would decide after situation calms down a bit. Online classes started after that but it was confusing whether we have to prepare for 1st semester finals or just go on with the 2nd semester courses. The online classes were not consistent. No any notice was supplied about how the exams would take place and the exam for 1st semester took place 10 months after the semester had ended and the covid situation had significantly calmed down and the schools had already started operating normally. After exams ended, they conducted physical classes for 1.5 months and again the situation got too bad too fast and again we are back to online classes which is not consistent.\n\nIf it was normal times, I would be in 4th semester rn. But due to covid and uni's negligence, I am still in 2nd semester, preparing for 2nd sem's finals which was initially planned to start from June 13th but has been postponed due to extreme spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nI already wasted a year doing nothing, just waiting for 1st semester's exam. I don't want to waste another year doing nothing.",

On top of that, they downgraded their network (for god knows why) and it constantly goes out and has caused us to lose more than a week of courses because the courses couldn\u2019t have online attendance without the network. Every course I\u2019ve had has been crammed with assignments and all but one of my professors have basically had no remorse for students who are burning out and falling behind. My cumulative GPA prior to this semester is a 3.8, this semester its a 2.3. I can guarantee there are many students who have failed classes due to the shitty instruction and that will put them years behind. A lot of our courses are taught only during fall or spring so if you fail a class this spring you have to wait a whole year to take it. And to top it off, they continue to raise our tuition, even during the pandemic.",

Their role is to do the best they can to deliver the programs they can, with the resources they have available to them. And yes, doing so in a pandemic will not ever go as smoothly as during normal times. Courses which were designed for and taught for decades as in-person suddenly shifting to online of course aren't going to be as good as during normal operations. Schools are losing staff and almost all of them are also facing massive budget shortfalls. \n\nAnd that's not even looking at the impact that the pandemic has on student's ability to study properly. Which of course the university has no influence over whatsoever. \n\nNo one wants students dropping out and no one wants students to be delayed in their education, but it's not something that you can just magically fix.",
