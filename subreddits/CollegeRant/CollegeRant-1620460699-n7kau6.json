Both university and college don't give a f about students' future.", "text": "Edit: Sorry for late response about uni's negligence. My uni didn't conduct any classes (online or physical) for few months (4\\~5 months)  saying they would decide after situation calms down a bit. Online classes started after that but it was confusing whether we have to prepare for 1st semester finals or just go on with the 2nd semester courses. The online classes were not consistent. No any notice was supplied about how the exams would take place and the exam for 1st semester took place 10 months after the semester had ended and the covid situation had significantly calmed down and the schools had already started operating normally. After exams ended, they conducted physical classes for 1.5 months and again the situation got too bad too fast and again we are back to online classes which is not consistent.\n\nIf it was normal times, I would be in 4th semester rn. But due to covid and uni's negligence, I am still in 2nd semester, preparing for 2nd sem's finals which was initially planned to start from June 13th but has been postponed due to extreme spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nI already wasted a year doing nothing, just waiting for 1st semester's exam. I don't want to waste another year doing nothing.", "author": null, "created": 1620460699, "retrieved": 1632842832, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 210, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gxd8fj1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n7kau6/covid_has_extended_my_4_years_degree_to_5_years/gxd8fj1/", "text": "Thank you u/panda1679 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
