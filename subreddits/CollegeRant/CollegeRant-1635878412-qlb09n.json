  "text": "Its been a hell of a week.  I've always been a cry baby but now its starting to get ridiculous. Im crying everyday now and its for minor insignificant things. Normally i can handle stuff but im so stressed. Ill just go over the reasons I cried this week.\n\nThusday- ran out of class crying because I did the assignment slightly wrong and had to start over \n\nFriday- didn't cry but sat in class not talking to my friends just staring down at my desk for hours.\n\nSaturday- cried at a Halloween party because my friends little brother said his dog didn't like me because im black/dark skinned.\n\nSunday- cried because I looked fat in a dress.\n\nMonday- cried because I couldn't fall asleep, eventually fell asleep at 5am and woke at 9am\n\nToday- and the reason I made this post. I got a $37 parking ticket on my college campus. (My fault) I parked at my school to get food for 5 minutes. I came back got a ticket laid on the parking lot and started crying and screaming, I was loud enough I guess cause security came and asked if I need medical attention I said no. I then went to my car started screaming in it for like a minute, I can see that dude watching me in the corner of my eyes so I just started the car and sped off before he called the cops or something. I tried driving but the road got blurry so I parked at a random parking lot and cried there.\n\nI think I need some kind of therapy or counseling but I dont know where free resources are. I'm feeling stressed, anxious, and tired and idk what to do.",

I sought out therapy, but there was a waiting list, so I started medication treatment because my anxiety was so bad - I couldn't attend classes without an anxiety attack right before and couldn't drive without crying. My partner was stressed out because I was so emotionally unstable. It was bad. \n\nJust breath. Call your mom, or dad, whoever listens well. Rant and explain what's stressing you out. Everyone gets stressed out and depressed.",
