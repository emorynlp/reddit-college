This week is finals week and it's a nightmare. I have a tooth infection and have to get an emergency root canal tomorrow - and currently having to take tramadol because half my tooth had to be removed last week and the pain is so unbearable its making me vomit and unable to sleep. Well, I have a final tomorrow, and not only will I be doped up on opiates but I will be recovering from the root canal - and possibly having my tooth pulled. This is an absolute nightmare and I'm unsure of what to do. Will I be able to function during the exam?
