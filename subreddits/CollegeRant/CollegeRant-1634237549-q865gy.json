  "text": "I am in my final year of Chemical Engineering (21,m) Undergrad (shifting into aerospace for my masters)  \nThe personal growth that I had in the past two years since 2020 makes me get angry and cringe so hard on my dumb college decisions, which I believe started to affect and it is only now that I am able to see those effects, I wish I could go back in time and do things differently.  \n\n\nThe main reason why I feel this is that I believe that I wasn't mature enough for my age when I was still in college campus, I never explored the options and clubs that my college offered, I thought I knew what I wanted to do, and I was afraid to be proven wrong, hence I shut myself and told myself that I dont need any clubs since they didn't adhere to my then interest, but had I been more open, exploring clubs, talking with seniors and also being mature enough (meaning not slacking off by not listening to classes and preparing last day, I would be at a much happier place),   \n\n\nI do believe CoVID also kinda played a role ? I am not sure exactly (I am still at my home since 2020 meaning I lost a huge chunk of my last 2 years)\n\nIs this something common that students face, taking immature decisions and regretting it once they mature ?  \n\n\nI wish I went to college when I was a bit older, but again taking a break in my country would hamper my chances of getting a job.  \n\n\nHow do I move forward and how do I ensure that I learn the lessons from this ?",
