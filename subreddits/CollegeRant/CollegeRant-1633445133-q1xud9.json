      "text": "Why can't you just change your major?\n\nAlso if you're this unhappy, I would take a year off. Maybe look at a trade school. Having debt from a degree you hate or can't use won't do you any good. Talk with your college about your options, but be mindful they might try to talk you from dropping out. Even so, talk to them.\n\nAlso if you DO drop out make sure to withdraw from every class correctly or if you go back it's going to be a nuisance and mess to sort",

              "text": "Then you should probably try a trade school. While you can get by without a degree at all, you'll need at least some training to do a job, so you'll want either a trade school or something with on the job training that pays a living wage. Most other jobs, despite the fact they SHOULD pay a living wage, don't actually do because minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living, at least in the US. May not be applicable outside that country.\n\nKeep in mind, you don't have to be passionate about your career, you just need to be able to tolerate it. Don't buy into that live to work drivel. You work to live and do the stuff outside of work that you enjoy.",
