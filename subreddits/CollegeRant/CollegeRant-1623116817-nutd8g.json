They just wanna go back home and work at their regular minimum wage job in the summer and return back to campus with nothing learned. \n\nLike why would you not give a fuck about professional development when you're in college? It's embarrassing and frankly sad to see how people are so disinterested in making their careers. \n\nIt's literally not that hard to get internships and get paid well as well as gain relevant industry experience, but no, mfs don't want any of that", "author": "yypts4576", "created": 1623116817, "retrieved": 1632842267, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.18, "comments": {"h0ze07m": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nutd8g/why_do_college_students_not_give_a_fuck_about/h0ze07m/", "text": "Thank you u/yypts4576 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
