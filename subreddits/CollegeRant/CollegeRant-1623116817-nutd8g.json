  "title:": "Why do college students not give a fuck about internships",
  "text": "Been recently seeing alot of my classmates and friends not giving a fuck about internship. They just wanna go back home and work at their regular minimum wage job in the summer and return back to campus with nothing learned. \n\nLike why would you not give a fuck about professional development when you're in college? It's embarrassing and frankly sad to see how people are so disinterested in making their careers. \n\nIt's literally not that hard to get internships and get paid well as well as gain relevant industry experience, but no, mfs don't want any of that",

Watch and learn and don't become like this one.\n\nMost internships are infact not unpaid, atleast in the US, unpaid internships only account for 43% of all postings. It's pretty easy to find a paid internship, all you have to do is look and put in some work. But you entitled mfs think yall deserve internships just cuz u have good grades.

I really do see a lot of value in them because I've seen several people get an internship and then realize that the field they're in isn't the field they want to stay in for a career and so the switch majors instead of going through all 4 years of effort and money.",
