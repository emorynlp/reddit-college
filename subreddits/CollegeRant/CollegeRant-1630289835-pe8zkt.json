  "text": "Hi, i recently moved into uni, i'm now a thousand+ miles away from my parents (intl student) and I've been feeling pretty helpless on literally everything i do. I can't even muster up the courage to go talk to the person who's sharing my bathroom and do stuff alone.\n\nit's weird, but I like going with friends i'd made back home and doing work or things like buying groceries even if they're not directly helping, despite me maybe being an introvert. doing stuff alone is soo overwhelming. i've lived a pretty sheltered life, not going out alone much, maybe 5-10 times my entire life as a young adult.\n\nhow do i deal with the stress and the overwhelming feeling of not knowing how to do anything? sorry, just needed to vent.",

      "text": "Hey. I was an international student several years ago - first time out of the country, thousands of miles from home, no support system, etc. I remember being overwhelmed and depressed, just like you. I feel you.\n\nOver a decade later, and having lived on 3 continents, here's my advice. \n\nThe first step is to understand that this isn't your fault. You spent several years building a support system of friends and family, but you don't have any of that now. Also, you're in a different culture, with different norms, different ways of making conversation, different things to do for fun, etc. You likely don't have the social skills or networks that allowed you to enjoy life back home, and that's what's holdong you back.\n\nThe second step is to recognise that you can easily acquire these skills and build a network. Other international students are probably going through the same thing as you, so they are a natural place to reach out.  People from your own country will be especially sensitive to the adjustment problems you face. Seek them out too, both in and outside University.  Once classes begin, you'll also begin to talk to people there. Remember that you have an amazing set of experiences from your culture, which others will be fascinated by - talk about those. Be hyper aware and observe how norms of conversation and behaviour are different from your home country, and try to change your conditioning to adopt these new norms. \n\n\nThe third step is to not try and recreate what you left in your country, but embrace the alienness of where you are.  Seek out hobbies that work for where you are. For example, I discovered my love for hiking after moving out of my home country. Find out what to locals do for fun, and do that. Take up new sports - I took up rowing when I went to the UK - not a thing where I'm from. Join loads of University clubs, and see what works.\n\nRemember, University is where you grow into an adult and learn to live on your own. Any change is hard - you can only make it easier by embracing it.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for the advice, starting conversations is what has me worried the most, I shall use the knowledge you have given! I just unpacked my bags and put all my stuff into the drawers in the room, that's a big achievement to me tbh.\n\nI'll look into student clubs too! Hopefully I can find those with similar interests there.\n\nIt's nice to ask for help, thank you for reminding me about that as well and your kindness. Have a good day! :D",
