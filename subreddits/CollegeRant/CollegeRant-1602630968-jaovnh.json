  "text": "I\u2019ve been under my covers for awhile now. I am so embarrassed.\n\nI\u2019ll try to sum this up. I made a post about it earlier but this is the latest update.\nI originally took a math test and made and 88! I was so happy because I REALLY needed that good grade. Huge relief off my shoulders. Well we used respondus lockdown browser and for some reason it didn\u2019t record me at all. So I found out today I had to retake the entire exam. \n\nI started taking the test and felt the tears well up because my teacher was watching me on teams (which made me nervous) and since I was nervous I literally drew a blank on how to work any of the problems me I hadn\u2019t looked at them for almost a week. So my dumb self shuts the computer and starts bawling my eyes out.\n\nMy teacher emails me to call her back and I try to ask if she can talk to my mom because I\u2019m too incoherent to make sentences.  I end up calling her back she sees me crying. I then make the great decision of hanging up on her because I was so humiliated. She sent me an email along the lines of \u2018 I get you\u2019re upset. That was unacceptable. This is college and you have to take responsibility\u2019\nIt was harsh but I know she\u2019s right. I would normally give up and says \u2018just give me zero\u2019 but the problem is I genuinely don\u2019t deserve one. I spent hours studying for that test. I worked so hard to get that B , then to get another D or F started freaking me out.\n\nShe\u2019s nice enough to give me another chance tomorrow. So I\u2019m staying up to study as much as possible.  I don\u2019t want to be an adult or a college student. I just want to be a kid and hide under my covers all the time.\nSadly, that\u2019s not how it works out so I gotta put on my big girl pants and be brave. \ud83d\ude2d \n\nJust another cringey moment to add to the book . Thank god she\u2019s nice.",

At least she didn\u2019t she u irl face to face haha. But just try your best and it will be ok, good luck on your test. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not just giving up bc at-least trying is always better than a zero",

      "text": "Bruh, I would've forgotten all the content too. That shit leaves my brain the second I finish the test. It's good that you're studying. Try your best to have a say to calm yourself down in case you start to feel anxiety again. Mid semester is when people start freaking out and breaking down and shit goes wrong. I just had an issue too that I posted about and I just have to take the F. All you can do is try your best to keep moving forward. And I will say, a lot of my classes at University were way easier than my comm college courses. The comm college professors either made things way harder than they needed to or were just lazy and somewhat rude. There were good ones, but i definitely think actual university will give you a more professional experience. That's just based off my experience though. Good luck on your test!",

I need the good grade and I can\u2019t withdrawal from this class. I\u2019ve had online classes in the past, but this semester they\u2019ve all been online and it\u2019s been rough. I\u2019m learning from my mistakes though. It\u2019s actually 1:00 am where I am and I can\u2019t sleep cause anxiety has me up \ud83d\ude02 thank you so much and it\u2019s kinda reassuring to know it\u2019s not just me- I\u2019ll have to go read your other post . College is just ughhhhkwiwnejrnrjeiiwmrowpakaiendn! Haha",
