The worst part is that they don\u2019t even warn you about it. When I registered for the class, it didn\u2019t  say anywhere that I was going to have to pay an extra $300 for an access code, no warning. I took classes in the summer that didn\u2019t charge anything for their digital books but this class wants to charge $300 for it and I can\u2019t even keep it forever, you only get it for 24 months. I don\u2019t recall any physical books costing anything remotely close to that. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that there is no warning of this when you sign up for the class. I have to imagine some people may not be able to afford to pay that much for an access code, especially during these interesting times. I probably wouldn\u2019t have signed up for the class knowing this access code would cost $300.", "author": "NoSpaceAlien", "created": 1598130764, "retrieved": 1632950881, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 96, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g45li2q": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ieqk2u/300_access_code/g45li2q/", "text": "This happened to me for a 200$ access code for economics.
