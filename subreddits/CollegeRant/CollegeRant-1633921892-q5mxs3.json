  "text": "I tend to go to bed around 12 or 1 am every weekday night since I have classes in the morning (10 am). My roommate has late afternoon classes and evening classes. Almost every day or every other day she gets back around 3 or 4 waking me up since I am a very light sleeper. \nI have talked with her about it and told her that I am an extremely light sleeper and she should try and get back a little earlier. She said she will try, but she still is getting back very late almost every night.",
