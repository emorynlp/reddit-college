I was so pumped for a solid year (starting first year Nursing) and now I\u2019m contemplating taking a year off so that I can get that in- person learning.  I also signed a very expensive lease for an apartment away from my hometown and now it\u2019s going to feel like a waste. Am I insane for second guessing my choices?
