Everyone seems to make friends in their freshman dorm and thats about it. My roommates all already have friends and we all have separate bedrooms so we dont talk that much. Im in a couple gen ed classes i had to make up and the 3 core major classes, and a transfer seminar for people in my major. So basically I cant make friends with all these freshman cuz I\u2019d feel weird and old (im only 20 but I still feel weird) I tried to make a friend with a girl in my seminar that said she didn\u2019t know anyone so I texted her but she barely texted me back. Im so jealous of the freshman who have it so easy to make friends. The first 2 days I was here and today i was so sick and nervous I couldn\u2019t fucking eat I can\u2019t fucking handle this I should have stayed at home atleast I could be comfortable. Im so afraid I wont have anything to do labor day weekend. I cant go home cuz im 6 hours away. Idk whether to talk to my roommates more or not. One of them still hasn\u2019t moved in yet. On top of all that my grandmother passed away yesterday (not unexpectedly) but it still hurts obviously and I can\u2019t get it off my mind and made this all so much worse. I\u2019ve given up all hope, I think I absolutely hate it here but I\u2019m stuck.", "author": "aj011922", "created": 1629831739, "retrieved": 1632841566, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"ha738cm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/patuot/im_not_going_to_be_able_to_make_friends_and_i/ha738cm/", "text": "Thank you u/aj011922 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was never easy for me to make friends regardless of how old I was. The thing is, after working, taking courses and now finally studying a career I came to the conclusion that (whether I want to or not) I have to talk to people. And it's awkward and weird at first, sometimes it doesn't even work but you have to do it. Waiting in public transport, while you're eating out even listening to the conversation of others when they name your city. You have to talk to them, ask about the time, the weather, the courses, the teachers, anything. In the long run you realize that the more acquaintances you have they facilitate other things. Even in the end you find people who have the same tastes as you and they end up being close friends. It's almost impossible now with virtual classes (in some places) but if you have the chance to attend in person you have to swallow and talk to strangers no matter how upset and out of place you feel at first.", "author": "szngu", "created": 1629936258, "upvotes": 1}, "ha9clbb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/patuot/im_not_going_to_be_able_to_make_friends_and_i/ha9clbb/", "text": "Hi! I'm also 20F and I'm in the exact same boat. I just got to my transfer university a day before classes and my plan is to just involve myself in as much as I can :/ \n\nit also sucks because the majority of my class sessions are online, so it's hard to meet people.\nI've been feeling super down lately because I feel like I'm missing out on the \"typical\" college experience and that I'll be miserable my next two years.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need a ranting buddy <3", "author": "roshniii", "created": 1629869738, "upvotes": 1}, "ha78ufs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/patuot/im_not_going_to_be_able_to_make_friends_and_i/ha78ufs/", "text": "I'm the same way, I have transfered in state tobcome to my dream school and really pumped to be here but everyone already seems to have their own niche and friends and I'm the only guy walking around looking for folks. Heck even some of the folks on Reddit who are at my school and say they don't know anyone don't bother responding to my msgs. Roommates stay in their rooms all day playing COD or Madden and don't do sht lol\n\nI get what you're saying ppl were like wait for classes to start you'll be fine but now it's day 2 of classes it's the same. I don't understand since with Covid I would think people are looking for new friends since no one has seen anyone or done anything in 1.5 years but who knows. Heck even freshman who are 3 days old here are having a better time making friends. I just don't feel bold enough to interrupt folks and try to insert myself but some people are able to do that and get away with it. Unfortunately it seems like that's most people rn lol\n\nSorry for the rant lol sure you don't want to hear this but kinda bummed rn, hopefully things change as we really get into the semester", "author": "seantaylornation21", "created": 1629833982, "upvotes": 2}}}
