  "text": "So I\u2019m a sophomore right now who switched from engineering to biology, my plan was to either go to med school or go to a masters degree of some kind. But here\u2019s the big \u201cwas\u201d I am failing my physics class which is literally 3 exams and we\u2019ve taken 2 (both failing) I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to come back with this last exam. \nAm I done for? Or can I come back from this some how? \n\nI was told that the physics class I\u2019m in to begin with is meant for engineers which would make sense since my major since would there be a difference in how I can make it up since this class is overboard on my required physics. Sorry for the text block I\u2019m just frustrated.",
