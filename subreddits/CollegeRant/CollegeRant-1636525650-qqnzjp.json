  "text": "My schedule is so fucked up\n I sleep at 2 after all the assignments and studying and wake up at 11 feeling like shit. I usually get back on track after 2 weeks but this has been going on for 7 weeks and I don't know what to do about it. People just call me lazy but I'm juggling between assignments and work and trying to do something about my blog too. If anyone has tips on how to get back to sleeping at 9 and waking up vy 4 (i used to do this!!!), Please drop things that work. thanks.",

      "text": "I totally get what you're going through, having been through fucked up schedules multiple times myself.\n\nWhat I would suggest could be agonizing for a day - sleep at 2 like you do, but wake up by 7 at least.\nThat way, you'll feel sleepy early, if not on the same day, at least you will the next day!\n\nAnd dont get too worked up about it. Drink plenty water and eat at least 2 meals a day. Its perfectly normal to be drained and having a twisted schedule in college. Just know that its temporary. :)",
