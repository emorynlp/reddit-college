Not only do you need to write several essays, bug professors for recommendation letters, retain an average 3.0 gpa throughout all four years of school, and put yourself several thousand more dollars in debt, but you also have to take a bullshit entrance exam that's basically a more annoying SAT? Fuck that. God forbid I don't know what the word \"sycophantic\" means, or what the answer to a shittily-worded math question is. Shouldn't it be enough that we fucking *graduated?* \n\nI feel like this same thing could be said for any form of standardized testing, but this just seems completely unnecessary for something like graduate school.", "author": "EccentricEggplant", "created": 1599456134, "retrieved": 1632950891, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g4de4i8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/io1l0d/the_gres_are_stupid_and_grad_schools_ask_for_way/g4de4i8/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1599509394, "upvotes": 2}, "g4ddhr0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/io1l0d/the_gres_are_stupid_and_grad_schools_ask_for_way/g4ddhr0/", "text": "So many colleges don\u2019t require the GRE it\u2019s unreal.

Some colleges drop all of those requirements if you already hold a masters degree. I went to Western Governors University which requires no letters or test grades to enter most masters programs. I completed their MSML program in one term (6 months) with a scholarship paying for $2500 of $3400. Its a management degree that I needed to get a promotion for a job in my department that\u2019d allow me to earn enough money to get the degree I really wanted from the school I wanted. Turns out the school I want to get into waves all regular Application requirements of one already possess is a masters degree. So instead of needing to get three recommendations (two professors and one professional), GRE scores, 3.5 GPA and a 4.0 scale, transcripts, submitting a writing sample of 10 pages, and a personal statement\u2014I can just submit my transcripts. \n\nIt seems like a long workaround, but I\u2019m excited for it. I didn\u2019t plan it that way, and I\u2019m not sure if planning it that way is advantageous or not but if you\u2019re interested that might be a way? Lol. My Experience was completely by accident, and I\u2019ll use the MSML degree regardless. I learned a lot and it was a great program. WGU is a college that just tries to break down the barriers to education, like expensive testing ,overpriced programs, etc. Not all masters programs allow for application requirements to be partially or completely waived, but I would look into the colleges that you are interested in and see if that something that they offer. You might be able to find a workaround with applying with a graduate certificate completed. Sometimes those entrance requirements can be waived if one shows work toward the Masters program theme by way of graduate certificate as well. In my experience most graduate certificate programs don\u2019t have Extensive application requirements.\n\nNote: I\u2019m very sleepy after a long day and used voice to text.
