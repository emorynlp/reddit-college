Which means that we had to post a reply to someone else alongside the discussion board post we made. \n\nYou may be wondering, how did you suddenly come to find out about the policy and why was it after the assignment was graded? Well...the professor added a submission comment telling me to look at the 2-post policy AFTER he locked the damn assignment. \n\nI sent the professor a message back pretty much asking where I could find the 2-post policy since I couldn't find it on neither the schedule nor the syllubus. I also told him that I had no intention of slacking off in this class and that the grade I had in there has left me worried sick. I have a grade within the 60s and I am not even sure I can bounce up to an A from that. Should I fight this or carry it to the higher ups?", "author": "toofeduptocare", "created": 1629926770, "retrieved": 1632949036, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hae9pft": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbku41/just_got_a_5_out_of_10_for_failing_to_follow_a/hae9pft/", "text": "This is one discussion board assignment at the beginning of the semester, it\u2019s not going to hurt your grade unless you have a wonky grading scheme.
