I messaged my professor, but today was the due date and I'm really hoping to be given another attempt for this test since it crashed on me. I just really wish I could've just gone to the testing center instead. I've always done online classes, but even then I just miss not having to deal with the hassle of doing every single thing virtually. With everything opening back up, why can't they give us the option to make an appointment at the testing center or the lockdown browser? I'd rather be in a quiet place where I know there's less of a chance of something like this happening.", "author": "GroovyGravyBaby", "created": 1625022664, "retrieved": 1632842154, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3iphg5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oao98f/completely_over_the_virtual_everything/h3iphg5/", "text": "Thank you u/GroovyGravyBaby for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I fucking hate Respondus. I hate studying my assoff for exams only to lose a fuck ton of points because it first takes the program way too long to pass my facial detection check, leaves me an anxious mess starting time test, slows my computer down so far that ticking answers is ridiculously annoying, and, of course, the coup de gras...lowering my score a full six points because it freezes and I cannot I put my answers.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get into a ridiculously competitive program.
