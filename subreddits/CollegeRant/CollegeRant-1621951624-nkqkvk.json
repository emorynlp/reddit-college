I have a year and a half left to graduate and I just absolutely hate my major. To be honest it wasn\u2019t something I ever thought about majoring in, however when I finished high school I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do so I chose engineering. A year later we were asked to choose which field to get into. I thought my choices are limited and I\u2019ll just go with what I know. Meaning that my sister is majored in this specific major and I thought okay I could figure my way out of this too. Spoiler alert, it was a mistake. I genuinely don\u2019t know what I am doing here, my parents have these high expectations and I honestly feel like a loser. My GPA is really good but it took a lot from me mentally and emotionally to get it. At this point I am just passing to pass and not let anyone down and to make it seem like I got my shit together when in reality I really don\u2019t know what the fuck I am doing. I hate it, I wake up with anxiety all the time, and sleep with it too. The minute I know we have a project to work on and submissions I just get super depressed. I don\u2019t have the patience of sitting in front of a laptop to design a building and come up with concepts and all the things that come with architecture. I\u2019m so closing to dropping out but I can\u2019t as I have no other options I still don\u2019t know what I enjoy and I feel so lost right now. My sister who\u2019s really good at what she\u2019s doing keeps saying that I\u2019m creative and I can get through this and how she also went through this. She doesn\u2019t realize that maybe despite her doubting the major sometime in her life, she\u2019s got way more experience and creativity and perhaps passion more than I ever will. So comparing her situation to mine really doesn\u2019t help. And my parents expectations of me to be like her are just another source of anxiety for me cause I know I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m so dependent on her to help me. And when I don\u2019t get the help I need I just feel like I can\u2019t do it.

I was scrolling through and I read the \"I am so lost\" and \"architectural engineering student\" together and I just knew this was going to be exciting. Because I know I can add my part of ranting onto how Architecture had to be the worst decision of my life.\n\nLittle background here, I do a five year architectural course. I'm currently nearing the end of Year 04. This means all my classes including thesis are done. A year onto interning at a firm, and I should be getting that piece of paper that will let myself a prefix before my name.\n\nI stand a similar spot as yours. Day 01 into Architecture, we get asked why we chose the course, and I was hella clueless. I must have slipped in a lie then, if I remember it right. Difference between us would be (might be huge), I do enjoy some fields of design and softwares are kinda my thing. But, architectural design by itself is not really my forte. I have almost skipped through every other site visits, site analysis, conceptual whatever you call, structural classes and what not. I just can't. I show myself absent those days and manage it through my friends or freelance it. I do my designs for the sake of passing and nothing more. My skills on aesthetics, graphics, drawing and doing things \"extra\" helped me score marks even though it had absolutely no relation to Architecture. I can relate when you say your GPAs looking good, but, everything behind the scenes looked ugly. Architecture has turned me into this numb person, I don't effing laugh anymore. Days where I actually laughed out loud are gone. It has turned me into a 'everything's about me' and my relationships are almost in shambles (has done me a favor though... I can focus on myself).\n\nAnd my only reason to hold on to all these years was because, 01., Just like you, I wasn't sure what would be an alternative. I still haven't decided now that I've fixated on the fact that I won't be continuing Architecture down the road and 02., I know architects are quite a deal. The only factor keeping me running right now is knowing that I will have a degree to add on to the list. And let me say, to convince myself this was so fucking hard. I don't really know how to explain this but I had to teach/ trick this to my mind. \n\nAnyways, I've decided to opt a year break before my internship year. That is soon after my Year 04 is done for good. Hopefully if my university permits as well. That's where my story has brought a conclusion to. I'm hoping to do more of what I loved and since it's COVID, there ain't any hurry and I know I can give me some self-love. Convincing parents wasn't necessarily the easiest but I did get through it. \n\nAs with you, all I can say is, sit with your self, talk with your head, ask her what she needs in life; if that certificate is something she values... You might not find spot on answers, which is why it's hard as well. But, once you do figure out 'something', you will find a safer place where it's easier to breathe. I took nearly 3 whole years to stand where I'm today. You need to remind yourself that there is no such wrong in having to lose your gone years. The whole life is left to yourself. A little narcissistic, but stop having to live your life for others. Do yourself a favor and live one for yourself. \n\nHere's a quote that keeps me striving \"It's not the things we do in life that we regret on our death bed, it is the things we do not\" - Randy Pausch.", "author": "icnw3la003iii", "created": 1621965645, "upvotes": 5}, "gzemxf7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nkqkvk/i_am_so_lost/gzemxf7/", "text": "I'm feeling that too with the whole high GPA, but at a cost. Also a year and a half left assuming I do summer semesters too. I'm at a 3.8 GPA atm, but I definitely had a few sleepless nights and stressing the fuck out to get to that point. When I stress out, I can't focus. It sucks ass.\n\nHang in there! No shame in changing majors if you need to!

While I didn't hate my major, I started to hate going to lectures and was doing enough work just to pass so I could graduate and be done. I did okay, but GPA wise it was my worst semester and I didn't retain a thing. My mental health was also at its worst and the pandemic was only adding on to it. What helped me was to take time off and reevaluate college entirely. If you can afford it, take a semester off. Having a break from the stress is so important and it will give you the time to decide where you want to go from here. Maybe you will find the inspiration and finish, or maybe you'll find the dropping out/ changing your major and pursuing a different path is right for you. Neither is wrong. What's wrong is doing something you hate for the rest of your life purely to please others. Take the time to actually figure out what you want, and even if your answer is simply \"not architecture\" at least that gives you a place to start making changes. College will always be there for you to go back to if/when you feel like you are ready for it.", "author": "Bored_Dragonborn", "created": 1621955951, "upvotes": 30}}}
