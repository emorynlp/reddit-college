  "title:": "Pearson makes me genuinely angry",
  "text": "Look, I\u2019m not an angry or hateful person normally but using the Pearson site for my classes (masteringbio, mastering chemistry, etc) genuinely makes me lose my cool every fucking time I log in or do an assignment. I\u2019m trying to access my e text for a course, and it let me enter my credit card info and purchase AND THEN it says my course code DOES NOT EXIST and I can\u2019t even access the book. And I\u2019ve been trying to cancel the order so I can get the book from a website that actually fucking works, but there\u2019s NOWHERE to view order history or even an option to cancel or refund. I just paid $40 for something I can\u2019t use!! Not even mentioning the fact that the site is terrible to use ANYWAY. I literally just needed to rant because I\u2019m irrationally angry at this shitty site. I guess if anyone knows how to cancel an order that would be great too. \n\nTL;DR Pearson sucks and maybe stole my money and I hate everything",
