I don't \"leave\" school, I'm constantly in the same environment. \n\nAdditionally, because I have school on my mind (but struggle to do the work for mental health reasons), I can't do any fun things until I've done the work, but I can't do the work, but I can't do the fun thing either, so then I just end up doing nothing. As long as I have any sort of school thing on my mind (which is almost all the time with all the lectures and assignments I have), I have no capacity to even consider picking up any of my hobbies.

For me it's that I'm having so much trouble creating a space to study in my home, which my brain has already designated home as a place to relax. I need a library or a classroom to fully focus. Otherwise my thoughts bound out across the walls. I get distracted easily, etc. If I go to the dining room I want to cook. If I go to my room I want to make music. If I go to the garage I just want to learn more about Soldering or fix up computers. And so my grades have suffered a bit.\n\nI used to be the type of guy that thought the world would end if I got bad grades (not literall,y but you get what I mean). Now I'm not terribly concerned anymore. I'm focusing on life and enjoying it as much as possible. If it's complete insanity the amount of homework they give, do yourself a favor and just give yourself breaks here and there. There will be times you have to strategize on which courses matter more and which courses would be more beneficial to your future career, but it's necessary. Why? To keep your life in balance. Just doing one thing forever (especially studying) is the fastest way to get depression. I've been there several times. So find balance or take a break if you really need to, for school isn't worth damaging your mental health over.\n\nIf you still want to go but also achieve more balance, there is one thing that's made my life a little easier. Going part time. I had to do this because the levels of homework I was getting would make a savant cry.
