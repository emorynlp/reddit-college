I have zero work ethic and zero motivation when I feel that things are overwhelming, useless, or unfair. and no one cares, it's just me in misery alone, because why should it be otherwise. I can't even die or talk to anyone or be a regular human - I tell myself to spend just 2 seconds, 2 seconds running my eyes over the things or contemplating how to fix things. I can't do even that. this is so, so completely, utterly lame. it doesn't matter how much I wish I could know more things or even just die. even though I'd hate it, I wish someone would come kill me already.", "author": "lItIltItlIltItlItl", "created": 1622665936, "retrieved": 1632842288, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"h0cvyni": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nqvkub/nothing_that_a_friendless_addicted_loser_like_me/h0cvyni/", "text": "Thank you u/lItIltItlIltItlItl for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
