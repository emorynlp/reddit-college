Two happen to have discussion post assignments due every week (they're pretty short, but the reading takes a while) and two also have around 4-5 short essays for the class (it goes from 500-1000 words).\n\nBut even with this small amount of assignments I've had so far, it's been a bit much. I'm talking scrambling to bullshit my way through an essay (i have one due tomorrow where I have to pretend like I care about ethics issues in engineering) and pulling up SparkNotes so I can pretend like I know what I'm taking about when I'm discussing the book that I forgot to read that week.\n\nAnd I can already tell finals week is going to be a nightmare (two projects and three final essays anyone?!). I don't think I'll bother dropping any of them since they're all required credits that I'll have to take anyway. and I think I'd like to just get everything out the way now. Plus I think since this is another COVID semester, there's a good chance my college will do pass/fail again hopefully (just in case I start slipping into B and C territory, I can keep my 4.0 GPA in tact). \n\nThis semester is just reminding me why I decided to go into Computer Science instead of English. I like to think I'm good at writing essays and reading between the lines of books, but I'm really not. It's mostly just complete bullshitting on my part and getting the tl;dr version of required readings I couldn't force my way through (lowkey i'm depressed and it's very difficult for me to focus on books these days). I'm pretty sure I'd have a mental breakdown if all I had were English classes.\n\nThe best classes I have this semester are the ones that are like \"do these math problems\" or \"write a Java program that does this\" and that's all they want from me. Which in hindsight, even though I doubt myself a lot, I made the right choice going into the Engineering school.", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1612725431, "retrieved": 1632950889, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gmjw784": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/let957/i_have_a_very_english_heavy_semester_for_a_stem/gmjw784/", "text": "Bro I am in the honors college and I can so relate.

It\u2019s those English essays I had to write on those fiction novels that really made me want to tear my hair out. Like, unpopular opinion, most fiction on the adult reading level is incredibly boring and not mentally stimulating (for me) in the slightest, and writing 5 page papers on them just adds insult to injury.

Or did you just show up to an advisor, accept the set of classes that you were supposed to take this semester, let them pick the section numbers for you, and take the classes?  \n\nThe reason I ask is, while the degree plan may seem prescriptive, there is some leeway to influence your own schedule. I saw an advisor to help schedule classes only twice during my time at my university, in my freshman year, which was once to drop music as a major, and once mid-spring to declare English as a major and get a degree plan. After that, I logged in and found my own classes on my own time, researched the best instructors to take for those classes by talking to other people, checking RMP, and looking at class sizes and offering times. I also looked at where they got their degree, what in, and their photo on the university website. Generally, their photo was pretty indicative of what they were like, for whatever reason, although I may be misremembering that fact entirely.\n\nThe reason I went off-script and made my own schedule through mix and matching the degree plan was that, basically, even as an English major who enjoys all of the English stuff, I\u2019m a slow reader who likes to enjoy the reading I do. The degree plan had me taking all of my majors courses during my junior and senior years, with all of my basics courses during my freshman and sophomore years.  I didn't want to do that because that would put me reading a novel every two weeks in three classes at the same time, or taking Brit Lit and Shakespeare and Linguistics and Spanish all in the same semester.  That was dumb.\n\nSo...what I did was rearrange my degree plan by trying to take the hardest classes first, especially the ones that required a course sequence.  That meant I took Intermediate Writing: Non-Fiction first so I could take Advanced Writing: Non-Fiction later, and I also began my Spanish Sequence, of which there were four to complete.  And then I would also provide a counterbalancing English course like a literature to go alongside a writing, or pick linguistics to go alongside a class I knew I would enjoy (since I'd probably hate linguistics).  \n\nIt may benefit you to approach your major this way instead of having tons of unrelated classes all at once without having a chance to get into your major and make sure you like it.  You'll also not end up slamming yourself with a bunch of majors classes all at once in your junior year, and you'll also be able to start sequence classes earlier.", "author": "chrisrayn", "created": 1612754486, "upvotes": 3}, "gmiwfnm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/let957/i_have_a_very_english_heavy_semester_for_a_stem/gmiwfnm/", "text": "With those classes you learn more about how to successfully find info on the internet that will get you through than actually reading the books.
