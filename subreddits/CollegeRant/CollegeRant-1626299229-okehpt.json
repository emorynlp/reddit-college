  "text": "Warning; sexual assault mention\n\nI'm currently working part-time and have taken the summer off of college and I'm already so tired. The idea of going back to class (given that I also can't drive) is so stressful to me. I'm deciding on dropping out or not. I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. I'm an art major and I want to open my own business inspired by my art but I'm not sure how or when to start and if getting a degree is even worth it. I originally wanted to go to college to move to New York and I worked my ass off to get there; high grades, applying for scholarships, saving money. I thought going to college in new york was my ticket to leaving the trauma of my home and life in this town. However, it was just too expensive for me. So I stayed home and went to a local college. I hate that I'm stuck in my hometown. I feel like the only reason I'm even attending is that I forced myself to work so hard despite going through sexual abuse during high school and I don't want it to go to waste. But now, I'm not sure if college is what I want or if it's worth it. I don't know how to handle a part-time job and full-time school. I hope to move by January to a new city so I may sit out this next semester and work a lot but I'm just so lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; I was a try hard in HS and I'm in a college in a city I don't want to be in and I'm not sure why I haven't dropped out yet.",

      "text": "Hey, I relate to a lot of what you said even though I don\u2019t really have any advice. I\u2019m so sorry you were assaulted. I also worked my ass off in HS and feel like it wasn\u2019t worth it, I ended up stuck in my same shitty hometown too. I just wanted to go to a school a few states away that might have people more like me, but it didn\u2019t work out and now this school is the only one I can afford.  I\u2019ve lived with my parents ever since the pandemic and I did drop out for a whole year because I think online classes are so depressing.  I really hope you can move in January and wish you the best of luck in everything, I know you\u2019re questioning everything but it sounds like you have a really good plan even if you do sit out the next semester.",

      "text": "I also want to drop out internally lol, but I would say get therapy. It\u2019s cliche but I don\u2019t want you to get ptsd or something. Again, I apologize if I can\u2019t give that much advice because I\u2019m going through shit too when it comes to college. However, I am lucky that I never was sexually assaulted (even though I have been harrassed), so I\u2019m sorry that you went through that.",
