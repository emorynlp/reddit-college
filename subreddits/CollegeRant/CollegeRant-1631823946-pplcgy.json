I\u2019m even contemplating whether I should submit my lab half assed, or just not submit it at all. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing; neither do my classmates. He expects you to know certain things and he makes you feel stupid for asking a simple question. \nI\u2019m hesitant to submit my lab because I can tell he\u2019s one of those professors who will call you out if you did a trash job or if he suspects you googled how to do the lab.\n\nUgh. I\u2019m so annoyed. This lab is due in a couple of minutes and tbh I might just submit it half assed. \nBarely a month into this semester and I\u2019m already over it", "author": "cloudieh", "created": 1631823946, "retrieved": 1632948515, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {}}
