  "text": "I just never understood the orderly system we are supposed to follow. Never cared about grades either, as long as I passed I'm good. Apparently our age group is supposed to have X amount of internships experience or/and X amount of volunteering experience..... wtf? I don't even have a linked in account \n\n\nI guess I never see myself working under people. It makes me mad just thinking about it. Naturally been in the entrepreneurial / freelancer mindset. \n\n\nI hate school. I hate my degree and I feel so forced being here. I'm on my final year so I should just pull through because 1. Money spent 2. Time wasted. You'd think being in college would give you some direction to your life but because I've forced myself to be in this stupid shit hole I unfortunately have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life. It's like a trap.\n\n\nI absolutely hate college. I hate schooling. I feel like my OWN life is against me , keep doing shit I don't want wanna do. I hate existing. And my school won't stop emailing me like just shut the fuck up y'all only care about money anyway",

      "text": "Yeah I totally get what you mean. I\u2019m 20 years old and have no work or internship experience. I feel like I\u2019m the only one at my college that\u2019s never had a job. I don\u2019t care to get a part time job right now I\u2019m just trying to focus on school. I just feel really behind and I sometimes question if I picked the right major. I\u2019m a psychology major and I am enjoying it a lot, but I have no idea if any related career choices will suit me? \n\nI need to go to grad school after I get my bachelors, but the process to apply is very tedious. I need to write a cover letter, resume, 2-3 pages of my statement of purpose, an interview, and 3 letters of recommendation. I\u2019ll be lucky to have 1 professor write a letter for me since I\u2019m sure all my past professors have forgotten about me by now. I just never cared to talk in class or stand out. \n\nOverall, college just kind of annoys me sometimes and as I get older I\u2019m realizing how annoying it can be to be an adult. I miss the carefree days of being a kid. ):",

          "text": "I feel if you like your degree then it shouldn't be too much of a problem at the end of the day. From what you said probably the application process would be the biggest obstacle \ud83d\ude2d I agree, I miss the freedom of being a child. I'm also turning 20, we're at the age where we're supposed to adult but nobody teaches us wtf we're supposed to do so it's so stressful and I personally feel so lost. We're also at the age where people stop sympathising with us so we gotta be prepared to get scolded for everything we don't know (tho weren't taught), how unfair \ud83d\udc80 \n\nI only worked at those temporary jobs like retail and whatnot during the school holidays for extra money, but it's not like I can put it on the resume. So... they're also useless. \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\n\n\nI have new interests now but it goes against the norm, especially where I am where it's conservative and education matters. My high school results are absolutely donkey shit so dropping out with absolutely no certification is more than a leap of faith to me. Which sucks ass cuz I really don't wanna study anymore. Sigh",
