I end up having to \"assign\" tasks to my own team mates because if I don't, nothing will get done, and when someone actually *does* do something, it's like they're a robot executing a task with no thought. I have to question them, point out what doesn't make sense, and then think further for them, like I'm their manager/teacher/supervisor. I *do not* like this. I like to discuss results equally, like if I do something, I want people to ask questions if they don't understand why I did something, point out when my reasoning is flawed, because I do not know everything I am doing.\n\nFor example, I have to do a group master's thesis right now (sucks, really sucks) using raw data we have to extract meaning from and build a predictive model. Obviously, it takes a lot to actually understand the data and I myself am continuously noticing new things. But when something obviously doesn't add up, they don't even try to think further than the surface layer of \"filter on this and then clock out\".\n\nIs this normal? Like is everyone acting like this and I'm just overdoing things? I just don't understand. Every person I've been in an assignment is like this. Do I just have bad luck?\n\nThis is a master's thesis, we shouldn't have to wait for our supervisor to tell us exactly what to do. Like there's no curiosity whatsoever beyond them doing as told when we're supposed to do the thinking! My supervisors get so exasperated and I feel for them, because this doesn't seem acceptable at all.\n\nAnd we aren't in the US, so there's no concept of \"getting into grad school\". We graduated from a bachelor and just signed on for a master's degree that is accessible with our bachelor, don't have to prove anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; Find myself working with people who don't question anything they do or are told to do when it's obviously wrong, wondering if this is normal or I just have a huge trail of misfortune in partners.", "author": "gilgameshen", "created": 1615119685, "retrieved": 1632950585, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gq640fv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lzpmp7/is_it_normal_for_students_to_not_think_in_group/gq640fv/", "text": "So, you're the Jeff Winger of your study group; the natural leader.
