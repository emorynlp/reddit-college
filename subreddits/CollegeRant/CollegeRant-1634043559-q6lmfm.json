  "text": "3 semesters into my college experience and we are STILL 99% online. I'm sick of it!!!! When I imagined myself in college I thought I'd at least be able to see people in real life and hopefully make some friends but now all of my friends from high school have moved away for college and I'm stuck at home with 0 social interaction and 0 friends to be around because my college can't just get it together and start having in person classes again. This fucking SUCKS dude. And it's fucking painful having to see people get to have even a sliver of a real college experience while I'm stuck wasting my time in front of a laptop. I just miss!!!!! being around other people!!!!!! god.",

I got along with my coworkers really well so I was able to meet my social quota that way. Plus making money is always fun. And it's a lot easier to work while you're in school if your teachers record lectures.",

      "text": "If your school doesn't plan to go back to normal next semester you could possibly look into transferring.  Plenty (almost around me?) of schools are relatively back to normal.\n\nI was pretty mad at my school for being online this spring but I have forgiven them for keeping things pretty normal this fall despite pressure from some people to shut down.",
