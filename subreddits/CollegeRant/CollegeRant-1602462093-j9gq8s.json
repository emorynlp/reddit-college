  "text": "I am taking an online class called intro to natural resources, and the teacher for it is AWFUL! Before now all we have had are quizzes for video lectures, but this week we had an assignment for exponential growth. I started this assignment on Tuesday and its due today (Sunday). On Tuesday I was quite confused on the assignment so I completed it to the best of my ability\u2019s and then Sent to him asking for feedback. \n\nThere is a lot of math involved so I was expecting a detailed answer or a request for a zoom meeting to help and I got neither of these things. I emailed him on Tuesday and didn\u2019t get a response until Friday. I emailed him early in hopes that I could email him a few more times through the week if was still confused. After the initial email.\n\nWhen he did respond, he was absolutely no help. All he basically said that I did it all wrong and didn\u2019t give me any idea how I did it wrong.  All he did is send me another video to watch. The video cleared some thing up but made other things more confusing.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to other classmates and they said they were just as confused as I was. I already have a C in the class and I\u2019m scared this assignment is going to be the nail in coffin.",

I also work a full time job so it tough to go their when they are open. \n\nI am planning on saving the emails and if the continues then I do plan on contacting the dean.\n\nAs for other students, I have a friend who emailed him about something else on Monday and also didn\u2019t get a response until Friday. Thank you much for your help!!",
