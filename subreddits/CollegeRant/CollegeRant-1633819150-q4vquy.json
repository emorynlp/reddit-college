  "title:": "My roommate who's never here stole the single room. Now I need to share a bedroom.",
  "text": "I'm 20, I'm straight up too old to be sharing a bedroom with anyone other than a significant other. My school doesn't allow us to live off campus cause it's in the middle of nowhere. I'm living with two other roommates and we split two rooms between the three of us. I'm sharing with a friend, both of us are homebodies and our schedules overlap so I'm never alone. They bring their boyfriend over all the time which is annoying cause I'm doing schoolwork. My other roommate who NEVER HOME took the single room before I got there and didn't ask me if I wanted it. I'm pissed because I value my privacy and alone time and I would use the room more than them. But because they got to it first and they brought a metric ton of shit from home they get the space all to themselves.",
