  "text": "I'll be paying thousands of dollars soon to work at a company FOR FREE LOL. The school pockets my money and I have to slave for a company, probably gonna be ill treated since it's the typical internship experience. People suck. I kinda wanna *not* go for the internship and do community work instead lol, idk man. My sibling was paid for hers so I don't understand why my school is so greedy that not only they pocket thousands of dollars per student, they also structured it in a way where we won't even get a dime back.\n\n\nAlso by pocketing I don't mean they pocket my pay, the company doesn't pay at all, instead they pocket my semester fees. Like.... they really have the audacity to charge me thousands of dollars worth of semester fees when I won't even be using ANY of their facility, talking to any lecturers etc etc like wtf????????\n\n\nAnyway.... I'm probably not gonna get the internship so I'm cool. Everything is just making me angry these days lol",

As in, talk to businesses and arrange for them to set aside spots in their internship programs specifically for students from the university. If there aren't enough spots, the university would create an internship program  to fill in the gaps.\n\nThere could even be a stipulation that the business internship programs select the best applicants regardless of whether they meet the stated requirements.\n\nThen the university can say, \"Hey students! You don't need to worry about securing an internship. Here's a list of internship programs we have prior agreements with:\"",

          "text": "Yes, I've always advocated for a degree-apprenticeship model that would allow students to work half the time and learn theory for the other half. The work does not have to be paid (at first) as you are learning on the job. I don't see how that's any different to paying to learn at university. The only thing is that those schemes would be extremely regulated to ensure that the employees/interns are actually learning valuable stuff on the job. Once you are actually performing job duties however (once a specified amount of stuff is learnt), the companies must pay you like a regular employee. Then, you can set up learning centres or even in-house company learning centres where you can learn the theory. Companies that do this would get offered a lot of federal funding provided that they meet regulations. \n\nThe important thing about this is that the money must go strictly towards education and assessment. Administrative bloat and flamboyant extra services like what universities have would not be tolerated. Funding would be withheld and if serious enough, admin could even be fined or jailed for that. That's how things work with Accountancy and Engineering regulations, I see no reason why we shouldn't hold government funded education to the same strict standards. \n\nMedical degrees already have this anyway. These would really suit accountancy, law, software development, engineering, etc. Because honestly, those are the jobs that are in demand and the ones that a lot of people want to do. Only about 10-15% of the population actually benefits from attending university and that's only if they have ambitions to perform research or for certain highly theoretical jobs like a quant or R&D. \n\nWhat's happening nowadays is an absolute scam. However, I'm definitely not in favour of free college. That solves nothing. We are still dependent on these universities and that dependency needs to end. The free market has proven that education can be provided in a cheap and efficient way online. A free market based for high school leavers on company educational programs could offer the same thing.",

Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure enough other people would agree with this.\n\nWhat if, instead of building whole new learning centers, we incentivized universities to focus their tuition dollars on helping students develop the skills they need?\n\nLike, we could base the amount of federal student aid on the ratio of time spent doing research vs. time spent teaching & grading, or the percent of university graduates that get a job in a field related to their major.\n\nWe could even specify that universities accepting student aid must dedicate at least 50% of student aid to anything needed for students to complete major-related coursework. This would theoretically force universities to reconsider what they offer as pay raises to administrators. They'll think \"Sure, we need admins - but do we really need to give them a $X raise?\"",

They are fantastic at producing researchers and great for people who are passionate about a subject (which is only viable once you have a financially stable job). However, very few students nowadays are suited to it. I think downsizing universities would be the best thing and maybe replacing some universities with that. \n\nIf people want to branch into research after their course (in Engineering, etc) they can take a 1 year long conversion course to get a Bachelor's and then proceed along the traditional academic pathway.\n\n>We could even specify that universities accepting student aid must dedicate at least 50% of student aid to anything needed for students to complete major-related coursework.

This, if anything, is part of the problem as it maintains the conflict of interests between faculty and students that's such a huge issue now.",

I got an internship my sophomore year and my school refused to count it because I got it 'too early'. Same thing happened to my boyfriend, he was hired by the company as a part time employee going into a career directly related to his major. He got into the company 'too early' and it 'wasn't an internship' so the school was arguing that they couldn't count it for credit. His advisor told him he needs to quit and get an internship, even if its unpaid. This job even offered him a salaried position upon graduation, and the university was telling him that he wasn't allowed to graduate unless he got an internship. It was so damn insulting. \n\nAt one point he considered applying for the internship credit using a different business name (I think the parent company name was different enough to fool the school into thinking he got a different job). but his advisor finally gave in once his company gave him the opportunity to design and propose his own app concept that he could lead development for once he graduated.",
