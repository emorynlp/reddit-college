I wound up in hospital. don't let it get that far!\n\nSorry if this sounds a little harsh but it sounds like you know this is a slippery slope so look after yourself, talk to someone at your school's MH service (most have them) and failing that, talk to a friend, your student advisor, your hall person (if you're in residential halls on campus, not if you're remote) or someone else who might be in a position to help. I list \"friend\" first because they may actually be least well positioned to give you more practical mental health assistance - and that should really be the position of a professional - but they can give you moral support and talk to you and help you understand what's happening, which is a start.\n\ndon't let this slide even more out of your control. good luck!", "author": "coyotesandcrickets", "created": 1614906870, "upvotes": 7}, "gppluoi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lxs5kb/ive_developed_unhealthy_coping_mechanism/gppluoi/", "text": "I have also developed a coping mechanism. It's not as bad as yours but I started stress cleaning. I'm generally a messy person and was always made to feel like shit for it since my family is VERY particular about cleanliness. I'm living with my fiance and I started to stress clean in am attempt to justify not doing work because hey! At least I'm still doing something right? Everything's fine! But I'd literally sit there scrubbing at the floors while crying about the fact that I knew once I was done I'd have to do more work. I kept noticing/thinking about more things that I HAVE to do because there's no way I can POSSIBLY do school work when there's so much cleaning I have to do. I was starting to just reclean everything anxiously. One day my fiance finally asked me if I was okay because I woke up at 1 and immediately started cleaning. He pointed out that I just seemed like....a nervous wreck. I ended up breaking down then spent the rest of the week in a depressive state just not doing anything at all. That one week literally almost cost me my grade for the semester of one of my mandatory classes for graduation. \n\nI think we all try to deal with this stress and normally college students can drink or party or hang out with friends but it's different when youre literally either doing work or thinking about doing work and nothing else. It sucks ass. I wish I had better advice for you but I'm still a mess. Honestly all I can really say is try to schedule in time to have snacks during the day. Don't have to commit to an entire meal but try to eat regularly. It might actually help you focus more. The mind doesn't do well when your body is being ignored, ya feel me? I hope things get better.

Whether it's an oil filter clogging up cuz you haven't changed it, tires losing their grip on the road, or spark plugs not firing correctly, things will inevitably deteriorate. After a certain point if you keep neglecting those things driving that vehicle becomes dangerous-- best case scenario your car won't start one day, worst-case scenario you become a danger to yourself and others on the road.\n\nIf you make a point to keep up with scheduled maintenance you can drive that same care for much, much longer. Instead of a year or so, you could theoretically drive the same vehicle for 20+ years.\n\nThat's how you need to think of things. College is a marathon, not a sprint. You HAVE TO make self-care a priority. I know that when you're terribly busy self-care can seem like an inconvenience, but if you make a point to at least do the minimum, I promise you'll begin to notice that the quality of your performance will also improve.\n\nFood, drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, getting some exercise. All those things are great mini-breaks in your study routine that your body actually needs. Even taking a long shower when you're a bit overwhelmed with coursework can really revitalize you.\n\nIf you're as busy as you've suggested I'm sure by now you've crashed due to exhaustion at least once. Here's the thing tho... exhaustion is cumulative. If you keep doing that to yourself your body (and performance) will inevitably suffer. Again-- think car maintenance.\n\nI know that this already a lengthy post but here are a few applicable suggestions on how you can spend less time doing the things I've mentioned throughout the workweek:\n\nFOOOOD:- Breakfast is usually the fastest thing to fix. Eggs and toast, oatmeal and fruit, bagel with cream cheese-- all things you can make in under 10 minutes.- Lunch I highly recommend you meal prep on the weekend. It seems daunting at first but its not hard. Rice-cooker and an oven and you're done in 2 hours.- Dinner you can meal prep too, but I'd just cook it fresh every night. Not sure if you enjoy cooking. But it really can be a creative outlet, and a welcome break from the books. The more you cook the quicker you'll be at it and its really a worth while skill to learn.- If you have a cafeteria in your university then things are much simpler.\n\nWATER:- Get reusable bottle of water. Highly recommend you get nothing smaller than a liter. I have a Nalgene bottle that takes about 1liter max and I just make a point to drink that about 3 times a day.- If water is too plain or whatever you add some kind of water flavoring like MiO.\n\nSLEEEEEEP!- You've gotta put a hard stop to the work and get to bed. Its often better to get some rest when you notice that your performance is going down due to exhaustion so that you can wake up super early and do the work.- Regardless of what you choose to do, make sure you're getting at least 6 hours of sleep a night. That's still less than the recommended 7-8 but it should be enough to keep you going at a good level.\n\nWORK-OUT:- No idea what you do to work out if even if you do a workout, but even a quick walk around the neighborhood can be beneficial if you don't currently workout often. If you already are working out often, don't stop. You need that to maintain sanity.\n\nLastly, I want to say that's very important to have a support network you can turn to when you're feeling overwhelmed. It could be friends, family, or even fellow students that are likely having very similar experiences. Just someone that you can shoot the shit with to get your mind off things makes a huge difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR-- You have to make self-care a priority if you want to finish the marathon that is college.

This makes it routine and you can count on it everyday, like I would always plan on eating dinner around 6 and whatnot and set aside half an hour to prepare food or go to a dining hall. But you can NEVER make excuses for this time. I would always say i\u2019m too busy to eat and to just take care of myself, but would just end up feeling worse. That\u2019s what helped me at least, but everyone is different :) i hope things get better!", "author": "olivia_ruffy", "created": 1614893026, "upvotes": 57}}}
