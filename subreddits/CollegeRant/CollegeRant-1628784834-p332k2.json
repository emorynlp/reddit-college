Now I usually don\u2019t respond to any other name than mine so I guess as a \u201creaction\u201d I didn\u2019t answer at first however since he was still waiting for a response I then answered anyway (even though I wasn\u2019t sure if he even meant me because again he said a completely different name). I felt embarrassed when this happened but went up to the professor after class to clarify that that\u2019s not my name. He did apologize and explained that on the sheet he had us fill out at the begging of the semester (we are about 30 students so not a huge lecture hall more like a normal classroom) with all our names on them corresponding to where we were sitting in class he must have confused one row of seats with the other. (This seating arrangement also meant that we could never change seats throughout the semester).\n\nAnyway scrolling through reddit I just remembered so I thought I\u2019d share because as much as this was an honest mistake afterward I just kinda felt dispensable as a student and wondered why I even give a single sh\\*t about class when my professors barely care about who their students are (I attend a smaller community college where you pretty much know and see everyone even without being a social butterfly). Especially during the pandemic with online classes this just really hit differently.\n\nBtw this is my first time posting on here.", "author": "daisyshwayze", "created": 1628784834, "retrieved": 1632949118, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.13, "comments": {"h8qrgq5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p332k2/professor_called_me_by_the_wrong_name_in_front_of/h8qrgq5/", "text": "I had to correct my professor multiple times for calling me by another persons name.
