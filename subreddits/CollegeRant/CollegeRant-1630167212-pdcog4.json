I don't  enjoy coding. I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that my lecturer is really dead but it feels more like homework than something I have interest in. Prior to deciding to go into Computer Science I was interested in pursuing Mechanical Engineering but decided against it because the only career options in my country were maintainence based jobs. I enjoy maths a ton, computing tech is fantastic, physics is great and I like business studies. But I just can't seem to click with coding. \n\nI was thinking of switching to electrical engineering but my issue is that electronics/electricity isn't my strong point, but the idea of working/designing audio equipment and hardware is a ton more ideal.\n\nSo reddit, should I stick it out? I'm not doing badly in classes, I could opt for Data Science, but my gut isn't sure.", "author": "attackonthethrowaway", "created": 1630167212, "retrieved": 1632949009, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hasnc5v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdcog4/thinking_of_changing_majors/hasnc5v/", "text": "If I was you, I would definitely choose another related specialty for my Master's program. Thus, you'll get 2 majors anyway. And even if you don't like both (or it seems too difficult to deal with), you can just pass some short course on an additional specialty (it may be even online marketing, for example). Then you'll be multiskilled, and you'll understand your preferences while working after college.\r  \nThe other way is to find some work while studying, try it in practice, and then you'll understand what you should choose for your Master's program.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "James_Korbyn", "created": 1630239979, "upvotes": 1}, "hap7dhf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdcog4/thinking_of_changing_majors/hap7dhf/", "text": "Data science is over saturated. Don't do that, seriously. My job is hiring for one and while I don't remember the exact number, the amount of applications we got was so insane I couldn't believe it. In the several, several thousands. In contrast, we are also hiring for quality engineers and quality analysts, and we got maybe 20 or 30 applications each. \n\nIf you hate coding I don't recommend sticking with it, but if you're only three weeks in, you may not have enough data to be sure. Other options include actual IT work (all programming companies need IT), which I believe still involves coding but not nearly as much as an actual developer job.\n\nThere's also quality assurance, and it comes in multiple types (manual, grey box, white box). It requires data literacy (not to the level of data analysis), and depending on the job itself it may require programming, but it may not. At my job specifically quality assurance acts a little bit more like a cross between grey box testing and project management for the quality of the game (we direct quality engineering in what to build, we direct dev on what grey box hooks are needed, we tell manual testers how to test, we do some grey box testing ourselves, and so on).", "author": "SouthernRhubarb", "created": 1630169003, "upvotes": 2}}}
