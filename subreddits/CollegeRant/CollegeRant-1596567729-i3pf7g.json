I'm ready to go, I put in my 2-week notice to my summer job and told my on-campus job I'll be back. I have classes and housing waiting for me, so let's do this.\n\nBut, of course, there's a good chance school closes riiiight before I move in. Cause that's just my luck.\n\nIf they're gonna close, tell me now while I can make financial arrangements to do online schooling. Or stay open till Thanksgiving so I can rely on my job at school.\n\nBut for the love of god don't wait till the day before I move in (or wait 1 week into the semester) to tell us \"oops we're gonna close now lol\". Yeah, sure, it's for safety reasons, but tell me now while I still have a job and a place to stay!\n\nThis is just a rant because I'm sick of all these schools dragging their heels about closing or potentially closing a week into school. Make a decision and stick to it.\n\nTL;DR: my school needs to stick with their decision regarding COVID or at least give me time to prepare to be 100% online.", "author": "mb121b", "created": 1596567729, "retrieved": 1632950862, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g0gbmlw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i3pf7g/dear_college_please_just_stick_with_your_decision/g0gbmlw/", "text": "My school told us about a month ago that our first day of classes is August 31st.
