  "text": "I just want to know what my school is gonna do regarding COVID.\n\nI move back to campus in a week or so, and so far my school is luckily staying open. I'm ready to go, I put in my 2-week notice to my summer job and told my on-campus job I'll be back. I have classes and housing waiting for me, so let's do this.\n\nBut, of course, there's a good chance school closes riiiight before I move in. Cause that's just my luck.\n\nIf they're gonna close, tell me now while I can make financial arrangements to do online schooling. Or stay open till Thanksgiving so I can rely on my job at school.\n\nBut for the love of god don't wait till the day before I move in (or wait 1 week into the semester) to tell us \"oops we're gonna close now lol\". Yeah, sure, it's for safety reasons, but tell me now while I still have a job and a place to stay!\n\nThis is just a rant because I'm sick of all these schools dragging their heels about closing or potentially closing a week into school. Make a decision and stick to it.\n\nTL;DR: my school needs to stick with their decision regarding COVID or at least give me time to prepare to be 100% online.",

I am quite nervous about it since I really want to go back but it\u2019s the uncertainty of everything that is making me stressed. So I understand how you\u2019re feeling and I\u2019m right there with you.",
