  "text": "I\u2019m a journalism major that\u2019s part of a student group that simulates a working television studio. We used to provide weekly news shows about local news and school sports, I say used to because now the dean of the school of journalism is forcing us to change our structure and unilaterally cancelled the show so that we focus more on \u201cstorytelling\u201d (literally not even they now what the fuck they mean by that). They claim that the show in studio format is antiquated, even though every single reporter or journalism student from another school says how lucky we are to have a system like that. They also say that they want to change the \u201cphilosophy of instruction\u201d and to \u201cinnovate\u201d. My position on innovation is this: innovation is good, but it MUST be lead by the innovators. I\u2019m really pissed at the way we\u2019ve been mandated this bullshit by the very top, and I know I\u2019m not the only one. They are killing the group, everyone I\u2019ve talked to in the activity hates the changes and we\u2019re all thinking about leaving. The school would never admit this, but I\u2019m convinced the cancellation of the show is a cost saving measure.\n\nTL,DR: my school is basically killing my favorite student group and I\u2019m super disappointed and depressed about it.",
