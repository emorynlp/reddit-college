  "title:": "attended 2 info sessions for scholarships, feeling frustrated & wondering who has been able to gain significant research/community service experience & develop strong relationships with 3(!) faculty over the past 2 years??",
  "text": "At the beginning of the pandemic I was a freshman. Now I'm a junior. On one hand, I've been waiting for my \"real\" college experience to start this year. On the other hand, now I'm eligible to apply for upperclassman/post-grad scholarships, whose eligibility/application requirements require \\*significant\\* research experience, community service, and leadership & \\*strong\\* letters of recommendation from THREE faculty. Seriously, WHO has been able to accomplish all/any of that in the past two years??\n\nI was remote from the start of the pandemic to the beginning of this semester. Forget strong relationships with professors -- my past professors probably don't even remember me. Community service? I wasn't on campus; I couldn't get involved in community service organizations. Research experience? I worked (for free -- because of no funding) at a lab remotely; my only responsibilities were data entry. Leadership? A bit, but again, remotely. Who has had the opportunity and motivation to be highly involved in research projects and be excellent leaders who \\*spearheaded\\* fabulous projects that benefitted their community? There must be someone. I don't know how they did it.\n\nI just feel so lazy and unaccomplished, even though getting through this pandemic has been the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I was proud of myself for doing well in my classes, but grades hardly even matter in scholarship applications anymore because everyone applying has good grades! And even though I have some research and leadership experience, they were not very transformative nor revolutionized my field or community. I'm just so frustrated and I could barely sit through the scholarship info sessions because of the ridiculous requirements and tone of the presenter -- like all of the requirements were simple and straight-forward.\n\nI just needed to get this off my mind. I don't need pity or to be reminded that I am just not the caliber of student these scholarships are intended for. I will search for smaller scholarships with less requirements instead. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "I manage several scholarships at a large private university. We understand the last two years have made networking and research difficult. So when you apply, tell us what you were able to do, and what you hope to do with the scholarship. We honest, humble, curious, and prepared. And for the record, LORs are so hit and miss they RARELY make or break a scholarship app at the undergrad level.",
