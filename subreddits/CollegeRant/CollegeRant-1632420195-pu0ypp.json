They\u2019re probably feeling even worse because of their homesickness but also with their roommate not being friendly too. They probably feel like they don\u2019t belong. Since you\u2019re going to be living with them for a while, maybe you can try to help them get used to their new environment? Idk your situation too well but best of luck!",
