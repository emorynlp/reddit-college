Got two 55% and one 60%, after hours of studying. Extremely difficult exams (lack of time and very difficult questions).\n\nOnline school don't seem to help me.. I have anxiety, no concentration, etc. It's the first time in all of my life where I failed this much, always had A in all of my courses (never less than 85% and a top R score).\n\nThat's not even the worse part. \n\nAll of my midterms class averages are 70%. Because half of the students failed (45-50% range) like me or they got great grades (100%). I will let you guess why half of the students got 100%... Cheating during exams in big zoom groups. Seriously.\n\nThe school administration and teachers know about it (online difficulty and cheating), but they seem to close their eyes on these problems.\n\nI'm done with university. If they don't do something about it, I will drop out.", "author": "LaCremeFRESH", "created": 1604499165, "retrieved": 1632950837, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gb7kdiw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jnxd7g/done_with_university/gb7kdiw/", "text": "Just pass and get that degree man", "author": "fruithat123", "created": 1604564098, "upvotes": 3}, "gb6u99s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jnxd7g/done_with_university/gb6u99s/", "text": "Honestly I've hated college my whole life.
