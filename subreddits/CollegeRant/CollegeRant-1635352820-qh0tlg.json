  "text": "So I\u2019m about to finish my masters in journalism with a minor in psychology. I plan to apply in the same university for a masters in creative writing but\u2026idk. I want to wait and apply for august but my mom thinks I should start the masters right away. But the thing is I haven\u2019t written in a while, and I feel I\u2019m lacking. I wanted to take a break from school and better my craft. I\u2019ve been in a deep depression these last few years that have stopped me from doing what I love. On top of that I\u2019m scared my resume won\u2019t have enough experience for them to accept me. I plan on starting a freelance blog which I could apply to the resume but besides that idk what to do. Help please",
