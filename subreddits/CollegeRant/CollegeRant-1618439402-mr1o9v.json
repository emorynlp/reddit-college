I spent the last 2 days studying and I felt pretty good on most of it and when taking the exam some of the questions didn\u2019t even look familiar to stuff we talked about. \nI cried pretty hard and ofc now don\u2019t even see the point in pursuing my major if I can\u2019t pass an exam in the literal class about it. \nI need at least a 3.7 and idk how I can do that if I don\u2019t get a good grade in this class I have a 71% now and just feel like quitting Bc I do awful on every exam. \nI don\u2019t know what else I wanna do with my life and I need this major to accomplish that. I just feel like I\u2019ve already failed and it\u2019s only my 2nd semester ever.", "author": "Cooch_2119", "created": 1618439402, "retrieved": 1632843424, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 52, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gujhjj6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mr1o9v/just_massively_failed_an_exam/gujhjj6/", "text": "Thank you u/Cooch_2119 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So, really, not that bad depending on how heavily weighted that test was. \n\nAlso 71% isnt awful, you can DEFINITELY bring it up if you want to. Idk what 3.7 to percent is tho. Also, you shouldnt feel like crap being tossed in a class for your major. Im taking a notoriously evil course called Algorithms in Computer science. Its a third year course, the class average on our midterm was a 42%. The whole class is THIRD YEAR CS majors and we still couldn't do it. It got curved but it shows that its okay to have gaps in your knowledge, its okay to get ass blasted in a test.
