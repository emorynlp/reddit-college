There are three whole lots that are actually decent to park at making it a knock down drag out fight for those three. The system is shitty which means you get kicked out or never move up in line or get there then can\u2019t log in, all the while the precious few spots are filling up. The alternative is to walk to one of the farther lots (it\u2019s Phoenix so like over 100 for a while still) or street park and pay $4 an hour which adds up to be ridiculous. If I paid this much for any other service and it was this terrible it would be shut down. Build more parking structures. Make it cheaper. Design a purchase system that actually works. \n\nTLDR: Fuck colleges that make you pay for parking then only have enough spots for like 25% of people.", "author": "sciencesoul4", "created": 1626889156, "retrieved": 1632949354, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h62qodx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oouwjw/parking_nightmare/h62qodx/", "text": "At that rate ($800?!), maybe you\u2019d be better off just taking an Uber or carpooling and just offering the driver gas money.", "author": "ThrowAwayIdk6", "created": 1626917359, "upvotes": 5}, "h623i15": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oouwjw/parking_nightmare/h623i15/", "text": "Can tell this is downtown ASU.  ASU's parking in general is just shitty.  Even in Tempe they seem to own all the parking within a mile or two of the campus, and there still isn't enough parking.  Some people are able to move up/skip the wait-list because they have internships and are employees, so they're prioritized.
