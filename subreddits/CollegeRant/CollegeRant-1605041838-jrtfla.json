  "text": "I really can't take this anymore. I'm struggling so much with online classes. I feel overwhelmed every second of everyday and I'm constantly worried about what's next. I mentally cannot do this anymore. I don't understand why they even bother telling us it will be the same as in person because it just isn't. I cry all the time. I want to be done. I know there isn't much time left this semester but even that seems too long for me. I can't fucking do this anymore. I don't want to withdraw because I've already put in so much work but I don't know how to finish this semester either.",

I\u2019ve been going through the same thing so I know saying it gets better doesn\u2019t help but there are small things that make this less miserable. Try focusing on those sometimes. Right now I\u2019m struggling with classes, feeling lonely, and dealing with social anxiety. I feel stuck in a loop but the little joys in a day help me to get through it",
