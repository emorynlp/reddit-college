  "text": "I can't be the only one.\n\nCurrently the only thing I see are people that provide you with textbooks and assignments to do, and you can ask them questions if you are stuck or something. Most of the teaching is done by textbooks. If they do lectures they follow the same script\n\nI really want someone that already knows what I know, and can teach me things in a very efficient manner since they are aware of everything that I already know. I think that would be pretty cool. I think this is the human aspect that no artificial intelligence can replace.\n\nAnyways, that's what I had been thinking about.",

I don't think I am taking a step in each chapter",

They teach other people things too, but only if they actually pay attention to what's being said in class AND read the bits of the textbook it says in the syllabus you should. Weird hack, I know, but it works.",
