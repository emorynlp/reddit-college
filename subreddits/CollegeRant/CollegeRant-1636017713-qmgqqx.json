I was promoted easily to manager multiple times at past jobs when I had no college degree on top of that most of the higher up managers had no college degree. \nIf you\u2019re already in a business degree you\u2019re there to rub elbows and meet people who will take you into a high paying job. But the degree itself, it\u2019s not worth much.",
