Paper 2 is due tonight. \n\nWe need to have paper 1 graded to build on paper 2. Plus, I want to see what I did wrong on paper 1, so I don\u2019t make the same mistakes the second time. Her instructions are very confusing. Myself along with my classmates have contacted her \n\nLet\u2019s say worst case scenario, I don\u2019t get my grade until Tuesday (or later). If I bomb this paper, I will probably fail the class.
