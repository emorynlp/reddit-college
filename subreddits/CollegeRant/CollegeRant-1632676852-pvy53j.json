  "text": "title says all. i lack social skills and covid made it twice as hard. someone has to keep the conversation going. no one would want to unmute. it's like talking to the damn screen all along. and once out, the professor would have someone to share with everybody else what went inside that breakout room and no one in your group would speak cuz nobody said anything. so you decide to spare your fking group and do all the fake talking and sh!t and the hardest is you gotta have to fight anxiety for bloody hell's sake. i cant fking do this for another time. not anymore.",

You have to speak communicate with other people being it family friends workplace etc. I genuinely feel for the professors, luckily In most of my class there\u2019s interaction. Imagine teaching to people with their cameras turned off and no one participating. Breakout rooms aren\u2019t bad if it\u2019s a group project but besides that if it\u2019s for introduction it can be weird cuz people don\u2019t speak",

              "text": "I have no problem with it if we have some sort of task or project we need to finish. I can keep people on task pretty easily. My issue is when professors aimlessly are like \u201chave a discussion on x\u201d and don\u2019t tell us what we\u2019re supposed to accomplish from that discussion or if we\u2019re presenting our points or what. Also even if you don\u2019t speak to people frequently in in-person classes you can get a sense of their vibe from being physically around that person and gauge how a discussion can go. Online, I get\u2026nothing. I have no idea how intelligent the person is, if they were paying attention in lecture, if they even care about the class, so it\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable. This situation isn\u2019t an accurate representation of how any real life interactions go. You either need body language (beyond what a webcam can show), familiarity, or a distinct goal to accomplish to make this weird fake environment work. In business, when you hold a meeting, there\u2019s a point to it and an itinerary. If you talk to friends and family, you have familiarity. A lot of discussion based courses don\u2019t give you ANY of that.",
