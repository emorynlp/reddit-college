I apologize if this is really long for y\u2019all to read, but I got so much to say from my own dang memory and mindset. \n\nI grew up in a Vietnamese-American family where the family values are so important, that every family member knows about each other\u2019s business whether they\u2019re part of it or not. They have high religious and cultural values in which they devote so much of their lives into them. On my dad\u2019s side are a family of Catholics, my mom\u2019s side are Buddhist; so faith is very crucial to the family. Many of the older, adult generations in my family had their own stories of immigration to America. My dad (who passed away last year) was the very first to immigrate to the U.S. back in the mid-eighties. He suffered at a young age in being forced to immigrate, but tended to survive to pursue his dreams. My mom immigrated later after meeting my dad for a while. Besides my dad, I rarely ask my older relatives (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc.) about these issues such as the Vietnam War and immigration since it\u2019ll obviously traumatize them as well as the language barrier I have with my family, especially my grandparents who couldn\u2019t speak English at all. There were very few school assignments in my life where that involved my grandparents to participate, but of the language barrier. I get frustrated when it comes to the language barrier in my life because I\u2019m the person who understands and speaks the least Vietnamese to my family even though I know the culture, but speak very few phrases and a couple of words. Even my cousins and older twin sister know more than me. I always feel ignorant and guilty when I struggle with that. I grew up and am still in the middle class even if my family could afford going on a few luxurious trips to places like Cancun, Mexico. Because of my dad\u2019s death, (he was the breadwinner) my family and I are quite cautious in our finances since we\u2019re in a lower income status. So that\u2019s the backup and now I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all my main problems\n\nDuring my childhood, I was not like most Asian-American children and I\u2019m still not to this day. I was born with a speech delay in which I was unable to speak from my mouth nor have the mindset to know how to socialize. My parents have to speak more English to me instead of their Vietnamese mother tongue in order to not cause confusion in speaking. They still speak their mother tongue and express the Vietnamese culture to me. As I grew up as a kid, my academic progress in school was poor such as getting bad grades, I didn\u2019t fit in much because I was an introvert, I was picked on for being who I am, and scapegoated for making simple mistakes. Due to these problems, I would sometimes react by being angry, cry, stay silent, talk or fight back to gain strength, or fake my feelings by smiling. At home, my parents were the typical strict Asian parents even if they have a little bit of leniency in them. They wanted me to have good grades in school and succeed. My mom chose most of my outfits and required me to wear them. My dad had me do chores around the house. They were very demanding through the most simple tasks like house chores or calling them after arriving home from school. If you didn\u2019t do a task especially calling them, they would get easily concerned, especially my mom since she would have a temper towards me. Throughout my life, my parents compare me to other Viet-American kids they know who meet those standards of high intelligence, discipline, respect, silence, obedience, and adaptation to Vietnamese culture (basically the model minority myth which I don\u2019t associate with at all). \n\nAs I grew older after those dark elementary school days, I started to get emotional in high school, crying so many tears when something happened. The smallest mistakes ruin my days and make my mental health so low. Now, I\u2019m in college, the problems have gotten worse. During my years of community college, I wanted to major in photography since I loved the concept of art and business in a way that I could make a decent living, and do what I love. That changed when my dad and mom did not accept my choice and that I had to change to a general major because I didn't know any other majors that would fit me. The general major helped me, but many colleges rushed me to choose a major. I\u2019ve been stressed out in taking classes that will fit my requirements for graduation taking me 3 years to receive my associate\u2019s. Next semester, I am transferring to a university where I\u2019m choosing marketing as my major\u2026for now (I\u2019m still undecided).\n\nThroughout my current life including the pandemic life; my mental health has been really low in which I\u2019m having counseling meetings, doctor visits, and journaling because I need so much mental support because of what I go through as an Asian-American. The only problem is that because of cultural value, they cannot relate to what I go through. My mom has been pushing my sister and I more to higher success without doing our own ways such as dropping out since my dad\u2019s passing. During the year 2019, I almost committed self harm in cutting my left wrist. I forgot what I was specifically thinking, but I was really overwhelmed and suicidal during that time. I still am to this day. It\u2019s hard to explain to my mom how I am feeling about my college life due to the language barrier, my rocky relationship with her, and she didn\u2019t attend college herself. Many of the adult women of my family did not attend college and I wanted the bachelor\u2019s to break the legacy. My cousin got hers, why can\u2019t I? At the same time, I don\u2019t know if I could handle the work routine at the University. I\u2019m also unemployed, so I couldn\u2019t find a job that I\u2019m interested in working. I never have time to take a real break from the academic hustle-culture.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been emotionally bitter, cynical, angry, irritated, and depressed amongst the Vietnamese adults (aunts and uncles) of my family to the point where I could disrespect them which I don\u2019t want to do. I currently don\u2019t like my huge family compared to the past memories I have with them. So I avoid attending too many of their gatherings. I\u2019ve been so negatively impacted with everything in my life unable to gain any positivity. There are still good moments, but they don\u2019t last long for me. I can only relate to the cousins within my generation. They can relate to my sister and I too even though they have backup plans with positive attitudes. I tried to show positivity and not make a scene at family occasions; but they were not working. It\u2019s also worse because of my college crisis and dealing with the loss of my dad. I loved my dad, even if he is still that Asian parent who wants their child to reach a level of success he never had. He was patient, logical, intelligent, and never cried because he loved to have a great time. My Asian mom is hard-working and beautiful; but has a sense of temper and emotion when it comes to these hard times. Recently, she doesn\u2019t really know how to do the important tasks like filling out business forms because my dad would do everything in the household. My sister and I had to help her even though we\u2019re still young because we\u2019re more educated. \n\nAll I want from everyone who will see this is to give simple advice and help me get through my life in a different way. I need a way to help me gain the happiness I want without regretting the choices I made.

I have a really hard time thinking what i would do if I were in that situation. In my honest opinion due to the very authoritative hold asian parents have on their kids, to the point where things like this happen, I would no avoid my family but confront them about the issues and if they choose not listen or force me down a different path then that\u2019s the end of it. Living up to expectations can be a boat load. I think since this has been a long time coming it\u2019s about time to focus on self. Even if that means cutting out certain family as I previously said. Though i am not asian so I can never experience or even make a similar connection to it I can\u2019t help but feel deeply sad by this. I really hope you get through this thick obstacle.

I would like you to continue your photography passion as from what I read so far, I don't really believe you have a burning flame to go into marketing.
