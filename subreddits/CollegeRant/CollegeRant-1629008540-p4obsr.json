  "text": "Now this post is purely based on my experience.\n\nI studied at a small university. We had classes of 20-30 people. After the first year this was narrowed down to 12 people.  18 people quit after the first year.\n\nThere is alot to say about college and its differculty. The reason why there are so few people with degrees is becuase the system is designed to get rid of the people not prepared to do the work.\n\nIf you survive the first year you have obviously done the work. If you haven't it will come back to bite you. The work load and the level gets progressively harder as the degree continues. There is no cakewalk in college. You either do the work or your fucked. Either now or later.\n\nDegrees in my country are only 3 years as most of the time as the foundational year can be skipped.\n\nI hate to say it but there will be weeks where everything feels hopeless. There will be weeks where you have pulled all nighters for 5 days to get work done. If you miss a class thats on you.   There are scheduling tools out their to ensure you don't. Use them and you will be successful.\n\nI am aware many of you are dealing with online classes right now. I know its differcult but one thing you need to know about online classes is that you should not take shortcuts.\n\nDo you believe taking shortcuts will help you with your bachelor thesis. Unfortunately it won't. Many times universities tell students to pick a topic or choose a topic for themselves they would like to research. Then they offer you a project, with an obscure subject matter relating to your general topic. This prevents cheating as the research might not even exist for you to cheat off.\n\nTLDR: College is not like highschool. Get used to it!",

I've talked to others about it and they seem to agree for the most part.\n\nI could be that my first 2 years was hell with lots of overnight studying that you just get used to it on some level later down the road haha",
