But as soon as classes started I knew it would be bad. Too many long papers and essays to do (most feel unnecessary and excessive). Too many modules and reading materials. Requirements that need us to go out and risk getting infected. Little to no clarifications and explanations for modules. Clarifications with professors are difficult. A very unengaging and buggy online management system for learning. The anxiety of not seeing a requirement in the learning system. The anxiety of seeing all your requirements at once. Honestly, I am not sure if what I feel is valid. Maybe college really has this much requirements and readings with almost no breathing room. Maybe I am just irresponsible enough to miss some announcements and deadlines. This is also my first time dealing with online classes and I just made this weird meme to let out my thoughts (the format is odd and kinda ugly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - My online class experience is bad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iljrq2jlrez51.png?width=3750&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73e3af5757663bf89447da22f8a2e7d7236673a", "author": "kerotOG", "created": 1605447956, "retrieved": 1632843204, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gcg0nfm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jum3bs/weird_meme_about_my_thoughts_for_completely/gcg0nfm/", "text": "I wish cheating was possible but its difficult to message people in class and ask if they can help me pass the class without the fear of being weird or getting ratted on, fuck online school", "author": null, "created": 1605486935, "upvotes": 3}, "gceo97j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jum3bs/weird_meme_about_my_thoughts_for_completely/gceo97j/", "text": "Online classes were easier when they were formatted well to be online.

It worked better for my situation.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udcab\n\nNext semester I am planning to just do mainly Monday and Wednesday classes and I  have Friday\u2019s off.
