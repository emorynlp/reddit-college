  "text": "\nI had to take an online exam on canvas. The prof said it was open note and we could use textbooks. My notes were on google docs and, to check my notes, i would switch windows during the exam. I didn\u2019t consider the possibility of canvas detecting this prior to the exam. Could canvas detect this? I don\u2019t know how im going to prove I didn\u2019t cheat if im questioned about it",

I use my computer for all my notes and take exams with them still on my computer. This means I also technically leave the browser window, but I have never once been asked to \"prove I didn't cheat!\" \n\nI wouldn't worry about it too much. If they do ask for some reason, you have your notes to say, \"This is why I left the window.\" It's not on you to prove you WEREN'T cheating, its on the professor to prove you were.",

In my experience, since covid at least, when profs say open notes and not proctored, it means they don't care what resources you use. Even if canvas does track when you go off browser, if they aren't filming you, you could just get around that and cheat with your phone or some other device,  so I doubt profs are really checking it at all.",
