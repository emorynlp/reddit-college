  "text": "Dude, fuck teachers that literally just post hour long fucking videos of some random people losely discussing the topic she's meant to be teaching us about and then flat out refuse to teach any of the material thats assigned to us via assignments, projects and hws.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI literally could fucking do this teachers job. She reads right off the powerpoints (which literally have nothing to do with any of the homeworks or work she assigns- 0%), ends class early without answering questions, gives stupid long assignments that are brutal and she grades crazy hard, oh and my fucking favorite part of this class is that she uses recordings of reality television programs as a means of \"seeing the real world of marketing\" when the fucking clips are from the early 2000's and not even relevant or useful to watch at all. I've gained more experience and knowledge from interning 2-3 years ago than I did in this fucking class. I've gained more knowledge from my marketing teacher in community college than I did in this prestigious overpriced bullshit school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can't fucking do this.  Her fucking rate my teachers page is cluttered with kids complaining of the same shit, literally every single one. How some of these teachers land jobs is beyond me. I'm not saying all teachers are ass, but this one really fucking is.",

      "text": "Dude. Most likely, they do not care. I had an issue with with the class where half of the students organized a cheating circle and screwed over the class average. That had been going for half of the semester. I had to withdraw because the teacher was shit, and the skewed average made him think that he had been doing a great job at teaching us. Emailed the Dean with the proof, asking to refund me my money. Nothing was done.",

      "text": "Get used to it. It's not going to change. Teachers and professors are there to help you become self-sufficient. You cannot rely on them for everything. They're there to supervise you as you learn. If you don't do your part (e.g. watching the lecture videos, finding external sources of information, etc.), then you won't learn. Besides. One hour of lecture is the same as one hour of class time, but a little bit easier. For one thing, you can take breaks. You don't have to watch it all in one sitting. Second of all, most video platforms have option to change the playback speed. You can make a lecture go by much faster if you take it up to 1.5 \u00d7 the original speed. It doesn't have to be overwhelming of you just adjust your process.",

I do adjust the playback speed, but when I have to rewatch a video 5 times because the answers are not in the video then thats a problem. When I'm able to figure out how this teacher half assed chose this video (its the first fucking video on youtube/google how lazy can you be) and grades extremely harshly despite never teaching this shit and then further going on to assign a term project on this info without teaching is a problem. THE FACT THAT I GO TO OFFICE HOURS and she's still just as unhelpful is a fucking problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not a slacker, I work extremely hard dude and my health is starting to get affected by this shit. Fuck these lazy fucks for teachers, I pay 60k a year to learn not to get fucked over by some overpayed class moderator which is what, no offense, you're making these teachers sound like. Dude I'll show u the fucking reviews of rate my professor, it's not even just bitter students it's general complaints about how terrible of a teacher she is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not gonna sit by and justify these teaches shitty fucking ability's to do there job, fuck that.",

There's nothing you or I can do to change the way your teacher teaches, but it might help to find some external resources. Is there tutoring available for your class? Is there a student success center other academic assistance department at your college? Are there other reliable videos available that could give you a better understanding of the material?",
