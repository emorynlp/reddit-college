I submitted an internship credit request form.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear back, so I thought I hadn\u2019t been approved. I let it go and focused on my other classes\n\nInstead, I was registered!

Grades are due in ten days.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to figure out what to do!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate, just for fun: It\u2019s going to be fine.

A 1 unit class isn't the kind of thing that a professor should be a big stickler about... \n\nWhen my grandpa died during finals week a few years ago I just took off for home and ditched all my finals. I emailed all my professors about it after the fact and asked for incompletes so I could retake the finals over summer. It all worked out.
