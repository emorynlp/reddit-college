  "text": "engineering is so dahm hard and I have no school life balance during the semester. School/clubs/tutoring take up so much of my time I can\u2019t even see my friends anymore. It sucks complete ass I can\u2019t have a normal fun college experience bc it\u2019s just busy work every week. Every week is the same thing. I miss summer when I could actually have fun. Doesn\u2019t help my professors this semester all suck. Why do some professors idk suck at teaching or don\u2019t wanna help students?",
