              "text": "It's pretty severe. A degree is a credential. Do you want to be treated by a healthcare professional who cheated their way through school? Do you want your children to be taught by people who cheated their way into a childcare or teaching degree?\n\nIt also makes things harder for fellow students who don't cheat. Faculty don't start using tools like online exam proctoring for the fun of it. They use them after they discover their exam on Chegg. Now everyone in the class is punished because a few people decided to behave unethically. \n\nShort answer: you help put underqualified professionals out into the world and you fuck things up for your innocent classmates.",
