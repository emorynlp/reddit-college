I had to have my leg amputated through the knee and my doctor wanted me at home resting and healing for six weeks. Most of my professors have been amazing and they've worked really hard to help me keep up and be successful even with the situation at hand. I have one professor though that's making my life difficult. He said he would record and send me the lectures, but he finally told me that the lectures weren't recorded and that he'd record them and send them to me. I still haven't gotten them and the test is Monday. I'm freaking out, but I'm also really scared to keep bugging him about the lectures. I'm a 4.0 student and this is kinda my worst nightmare come to life. I worry that he's going to get pissed at me for pushing him for the lectures, especially since it's like 5 hours of material, but taking the test without that information is just setting me up for failure. Anyone have any suggestions? I have all the official paperwork from the University about the absence and I've been in contact with disability services. I just don't know what more I can do.", "author": "ScubaLevi20", "created": 1612397981, "retrieved": 1632843575, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"glxg9ur": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lc2lxh/frustrated_with_my_professor/glxg9ur/", "text": "Thank you u/ScubaLevi20 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
