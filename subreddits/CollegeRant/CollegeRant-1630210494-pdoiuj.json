However I guess there\u2019s at least 4 months of prep time for it, as I do my driving test next month, but I\u2019m also scared of driving onto the freeway every morning, potentially crashing my car or making a wrong turn or turning at the wrong exit and being late for a class. I definitely cannot do housing as it\u2019s much cheaper to stay at my home as that\u2019s also close to where I plan to work next week. Oh my god work. I\u2019ll probably have less time to finish the hw and etc for other classes, and especially later during the year when I\u2019m given paper due dates and projects and etc to work on. God if my School could just somehow have some classes next semester online that I can use for my gen ed requirements, that\u2019 give me so much prep time. I can\u2019t revert back to high school me, because I actually want to be a better and productive student but that could just all change next year.", "author": "_munit_", "created": 1630210494, "retrieved": 1632841495, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"harll1r": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdoiuj/freshmen_online/harll1r/", "text": "Thank you u/_munit_ for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
