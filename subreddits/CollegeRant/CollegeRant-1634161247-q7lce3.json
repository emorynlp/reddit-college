  "text": "Says one of my professors as he sees me in the hallway,\nI\u2019m here because I have an appointment for another professor, whose class I also didn\u2019t show up for today.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I go? Because in the morning I was still exhausted from the absolute avalanche of assignments and studying I had to do for the beginning of this week, and sleepy me thought, \u201coh great time to go to that class where I take no notes and learn nothing, then go to the next class where I do the same thing, and then the next class where I rinse and repeat\u201d(also I have insomnia, which is fun)\n\nAnd I decided not to go. I feel a bit of guilt but I was starting to become manic, which happens when I don\u2019t get enough sleep, or am just too stressed. So I decided that this would be my time off.\n\nI told that professor that I couldn\u2019t make it, I think he knew I was lying but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve missed his class.\n\nAs for the other two classes, well I just took an exam for it yesterday, so uhhh yeah a break from that. And the other class? Yeah that\u2019s what I made the appointment for.\n\nI\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m not falling behind, I just wanted to rest a bit more. But that feeling of guilt still lingers.",
