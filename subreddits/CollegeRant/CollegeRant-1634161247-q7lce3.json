  "text": "Says one of my professors as he sees me in the hallway,\nI\u2019m here because I have an appointment for another professor, whose class I also didn\u2019t show up for today.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I go? Because in the morning I was still exhausted from the absolute avalanche of assignments and studying I had to do for the beginning of this week, and sleepy me thought, \u201coh great time to go to that class where I take no notes and learn nothing, then go to the next class where I do the same thing, and then the next class where I rinse and repeat\u201d(also I have insomnia, which is fun)\n\nAnd I decided not to go. I feel a bit of guilt but I was starting to become manic, which happens when I don\u2019t get enough sleep, or am just too stressed. So I decided that this would be my time off.\n\nI told that professor that I couldn\u2019t make it, I think he knew I was lying but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve missed his class.\n\nAs for the other two classes, well I just took an exam for it yesterday, so uhhh yeah a break from that. And the other class? Yeah that\u2019s what I made the appointment for.\n\nI\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m not falling behind, I just wanted to rest a bit more. But that feeling of guilt still lingers.",

      "text": "I wouldn't think too much of it. As long as you get good grades in class, that's all that matters in my book. They say that there's a positive correlation between class attendance and performance, but this isn't always the case. There's no point in going if you're not getting anything out of the lecture. Unless your grade *absolutely* depends on you being there in class, you can get the work done outside of class and perhaps do great.\n\nPeople skip class because they're sick, got called in for work, had an emergency, and believe it or not, sometimes we just need a mental health day. It's not widely accepted afaik, but I feel that it should be valid.\n\nDo your profs know about your insomnia? Maybe they'll be more understanding of you if you told them, and maybe even accommodate you.",

          "text": "I second this. And I think after a few classes and the exam, people have a good indication if they need to show up to do well in the class or not. There is one class that I would absolutely do poorly in if I didn't ever show up, but for instance, one of my 100 level classes is super easy so I don't really show up that much (also, it's a big class so attendance is not required). Also, many of my classes require participation during in-class discussion, so I would be fucked if I didn't show up for them. \n\nBut yeah, it really depends, but some classes you do not need to attend to do well in. And missing 1 or 2 classes a semester is NOT the end of the world either.",

At the very least, they could help you figure out some self-care tips that might work for you. I know there's a lot of bs out there about it (like using it as an excuse to get a $50 manicure), but it's important to take care of yourself and allow yourself even a little time to reset mentally and physically. Otherwise it'll only get worse.",

It wouldn't be that weird if you were particularly close with this prof & he said it jokingly, but I sense that this is not the case.",
