My anthropology professor though must not know what the word means because he blatantly refuses to do things that make any sense. First and foremost, he assigns us at least one quiz (sometimes 2) each week, not so bad right? Well, these quizzes are due the same exact day he assigns them (essentially forcing us to do it in a timeframe that's convenient for him).\n\nOn top of that, these quizzes have a 7 minute time limit but always have more than 7 fucking questions total, like how does that ratio make any sense? Even more annoying, nearly every single announcement, email, and assignment is riddled with spelling errors and weird grammar mistakes, making it very difficult to read something without feeling like I've had a stroke. Plus, he just loves to use the classic \"...\" Like he's a sad middle schooler who watches Bart Simpson edits on fucking youtube. I really need to learn to trust RateMyProfessor sometimes because I'm going 2 for 2 this semester with bad professors that had bad ratings.\n\nTl:dr \n\nMy anthropology professor doesn't know what asynchronous means and assigns us work thats unfair in it's question to time limit ratio and makes reading announcements very difficult.", "author": "SurprisinglyThicc", "created": 1604752602, "retrieved": 1632842972, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gbgvwl4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jpq52l/asynchronous_classes_are_wack/gbgvwl4/", "text": "At the beginning of the semester, it took me 4 weeks of back and forth with my professor and just reaching out to the book publisher by myself to get the textbook I needed for a class.
