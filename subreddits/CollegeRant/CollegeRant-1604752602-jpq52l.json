  "text": "Now don't get me wrong here, I chose to take all asynchronous classes this semester, mainly because they're easier for me. My anthropology professor though must not know what the word means because he blatantly refuses to do things that make any sense. First and foremost, he assigns us at least one quiz (sometimes 2) each week, not so bad right? Well, these quizzes are due the same exact day he assigns them (essentially forcing us to do it in a timeframe that's convenient for him).\n\nOn top of that, these quizzes have a 7 minute time limit but always have more than 7 fucking questions total, like how does that ratio make any sense? Even more annoying, nearly every single announcement, email, and assignment is riddled with spelling errors and weird grammar mistakes, making it very difficult to read something without feeling like I've had a stroke. Plus, he just loves to use the classic \"...\" Like he's a sad middle schooler who watches Bart Simpson edits on fucking youtube. I really need to learn to trust RateMyProfessor sometimes because I'm going 2 for 2 this semester with bad professors that had bad ratings.\n\nTl:dr \n\nMy anthropology professor doesn't know what asynchronous means and assigns us work thats unfair in it's question to time limit ratio and makes reading announcements very difficult.",

              "text": "I've been in college for like 7 years. I know the drill. It wasn't a paper book hardback. Our book is completely online. The library gave me the wrong code for the book even though I told them exactly which class I'm in. I contacted my professor because in all my years of being in school, I never had this happen. I'm aware that professors have more than just one class and that I'm not the only student, but the fact that she didn't help solve the problem at all and that she didn't even remember that I had the problem until *I* reminded her but letting her know I solved it myself is what upset me the most.",

I understand that it was frustrating as hell but it still wasn\u2019t for your instructor to deal with or even remember TBH their job is to teach, research too if they\u2019re at a research institution. Not hand hold. Some are nice and try more than others but it\u2019s not their job. All of my classes have said here\u2019s the book, figure it out.",

Even if they say its to ensure you won\u2019t be browsing your notes, a 15 min time limit would be enough for 7 questions and its less pressuring.",
