  "text": "Projects are going to be the end of me. I honestly don't know how to make it through the next two weeks. \n\nI'm trying to get through a part of a project and I'm using stuff I haven't done since last semester. So confusing to do while trying to teach myself new stuff at the same time. \n\nCollege is a scam right now lol. End of my rant.",
