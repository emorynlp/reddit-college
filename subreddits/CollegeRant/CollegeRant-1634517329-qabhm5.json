  "text": "I'm currently midway through an exercise due in 2 hrs but was extended for 2 weeks now and I'm only making progress on it again right now. I don't really know what to do, I want to force myself to do it because I actually can but I don't understand a thing and my outputs are crap at this point.\n\nI haven't felt inspired and motivated by people around me who has been people I looked up to before, in my degree. I promised myself to do this semester better since I have harder classes but I still failed to do so. I felt that I haven't had proper sleep nor routine in the last months and my life's been a mess, I hate myself for not knowing what I wanted or even applying to a school based on the application and learning I'll have there than just mere for the name of the school. \n\nHow do y'all recover from burnout and get back on track? My mental health has not been great since summer, I wish I could just drop everything and rebuild my life but that's not as easy esp in a pandemic.",

I just felt like college has been a waste of time. I don\u2019t feel like I know what I wanna do when I get out. It\u2019s okay to not know where you wanna go in the future. I don\u2019t wanna sound cliche but just do your best and take it one day at a time.",

I\u2019ll try to pass it today even at the expense of a few pts deducted.\n\n+ I also felt that college should\u2019ve been an exploratory time for us to get to know different fields instead. I just can\u2019t grasp what\u2019s the purpose and meaning to all of this esp online.",

It\u2019s such a headache because there is limited resources and if your stuck on something you can\u2019t just call up a professor sometimes. Are u thinking about going on campus next semester? Maybe that could help. Good luck :)",
