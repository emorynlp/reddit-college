During in-person exams I always skip questions that I don't get at that moment and come back later. It's very frustrating not to have the option to do that. Having to instead spend my time on questions I don't get so I'm rushing questions at the end of the exam that I may have gotten if I had time. I don't know, just wanted to get that off my chest.\n\nEdit: Hey, thank you all for commenting and such! I think the the arguments for cheating are completely valid. The only thing that kind of differentiates this case is that Honorlock is a proctoring system. So before the exam I have to show ID and show my work space. It also has guidelines that prohibit background noise, so my roommates have to be silent. With a system watching me take the exam through my camera recording me, and recording my screen at the same time, I think that the cheating issues wouldn't be that big an issue.
