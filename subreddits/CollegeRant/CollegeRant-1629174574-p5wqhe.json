      "text": "When you consistently lose focus and the material is sleep-inducing, and, as a result, can longer envision yourself having a career in that field.\n\nI'm on my fourth major switch. Went from business to criminology to computer programming/science to, now, medical sciences. The past 3 choices were mistakes and the longer I stayed the more I couldn't see myself following through or enjoying life for that matter. I've just started my medical sciences pathway (AA) which I honestly hope to parlay into a BSc in Biomedical Science.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with shifting around because that's life. Not everyone is fortunate enough to immediately realize their interests. So if you feel that the material just drones on and on and you can no longer have hopeful or positive thoughts, definitely understand it's time to leave your degree program.\n\nHope this helps.",
