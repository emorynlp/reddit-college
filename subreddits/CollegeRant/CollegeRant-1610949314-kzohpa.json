Last semester, i carried my group members and aced 2 group assignments. I did almost 75% of the stuff all by myself. And yes i did ask them nicely to cooperate, when i do, they would just add one or two new sentences and sent the document back to me and call it a day. With online class its even more hard to work together. Im seriously sick of it when someone gets their undeserved credit when i do almost all the stuff. \n\nI know when you start to work, they will be time you need to work in group. Tell you what,  i worked a couple years before i join college. And i have never experience this frustration when working in groups, someone refuses to cooperate? Call the manager and everything will be set, even funny is that some will get fired and you get to do everything and get every credit for it. I complaint to my teacher and she said its my duty to convince them to cooperate. Excuse me? There is no leader in the group, everyone is equal, despite that i did tell them to improve their shit and yet got ignored most of the time. \n\nBefore everything started, i asked my teacher can i do it solo? You know what she said? \"Do it in group or zero mark\". I predicted all these shit will happen so i volunteered to work alone but got rejected AND those shit actually happened. FUCK IM SO MAD. \n\nLast week new semester starts, a look at my syllabus, i saw some group assignment again and its like 40-50% of the total final marks. Fuck my life. Fuck covid.  Fuck online class.

At least here in Texas, instructors are required to utilize group assignments of some kind in a certain percentage of classes, usually decided by major, because there are metrics that have shown that colleges that include group assignments have higher passing rates. \n\nHowever, I think instructors should be more cognizant that the point is to get students to work with others and not necessarily make a student\u2019s grade dependent on the worn of others. I found the attempt to create a group assignment so frustrating that I abandoned it in favor of an assignment that has students work together, but without as much fuss (a peer review).\n\nI think the reason it\u2019s helpful is actually something that has nothing to do with the work itself; it requires students to communicate and network with each other. It adds a support system and communication channel that didn\u2019t exist before, and when I implemented it that one time, I Did notice that students were communicating outside of class about items that had nothing to do with the group project, likely because it was easier to contact another student about a class question than the teacher.\n\nNow, on a separate note, I once came up with an idea for two simultaneous sets of GPA in college. It would be a very difficult system to implement, but it would require all colleges to have group assignments in their classes, and it would produce a separate GPA for each class, and they would be called \u201cIndividual GPA\u201d and \u201cCooperative GPA\u201d. You may end up with a high individual GPA if you\u2019re brilliant, but a low GPA if you\u2019re terrible at working with others. It would suck, but it would make a lot of the focus in college go on working together on Coop GPA so that you keep it high as well. If you can\u2019t keep a high Coop GPA, it shows you aren\u2019t as good at working well with and motivating others.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the interesting thing. When I have talked to various people about it who have hiring power at their places of employment, they all told me, when presented with the idea, that \u201comgosh...that\u2019s ridiculously unfair. I would hate that if I had to do it in college.\u201d But then I said, \u201cokay...but if you were hiring for any position, which GPA would you think was more important when hiring?\u201d And then they all looked a little horrified because they admitted they would barely care about the individual GPA and mostly care about the Coop GPA, because the primary reason that employees end up not working out at a place of employment is generally because of a problem working with others, not their personal work ethic.", "author": "chrisrayn", "created": 1610988526, "upvotes": 2}, "gjqc0av": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kzohpa/fuck_group_assignment/gjqc0av/", "text": "Tbh I agree with you, group projects are the most annoying things that I ever go through in high school and some college classes in my first year.
