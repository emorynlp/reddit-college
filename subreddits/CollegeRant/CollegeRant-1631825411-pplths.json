  "text": "I\u2019m not even anxious or shy about going to the dining hall, going to the gym (actually scratch that I\u2019m still working on anxiety going to the weight room), using the shuttle to go places, going to the library, but I just\u2026.hate all of it now. No one that checks in on you, no one that hits you up, no one that really cares at all, just kinda me doing everything alone. I lm trying clubs, and the likes of that and doing all that, trying to focus on my goals, but still, I just hate it, I hate it all.",
