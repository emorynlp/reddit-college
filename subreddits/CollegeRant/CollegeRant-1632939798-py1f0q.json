That's what I thought I was good at, what I thought I enjoyed, but I've started to sour on CS as a career during college. I've always loved music, and my music teachers in K-12 have always been my favorites, and after seeing music teachers post online about getting stared with the school year and videos of their curriculum I realized that's what I want to do. But I'd need at least 14 classes, plus 2 more gen-eds that would've been part of my CS degree that aren't major-required classes anymore *and* a year of extra courses and student teaching, or a masters, because my school doesn't offer an undergrad degree in music education. \n\nI'm incredibly privileged to have parents with the means to pay for my education, but I have about 1.5 years of that left, and I see no way to finish a music BA in that time frame coming from CS", "author": "BecomingCass", "created": 1632939798, "retrieved": 1632948362, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"her4gxs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/py1f0q/i_finally_figured_out_what_i_want_from_a_career/her4gxs/", "text": "Too late is kindof a ridiculous characterization.
