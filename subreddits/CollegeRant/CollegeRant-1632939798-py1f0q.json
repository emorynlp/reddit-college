  "text": "I'm 3 years into a CS degree, because that's been my plan since like middle school. That's what I thought I was good at, what I thought I enjoyed, but I've started to sour on CS as a career during college. I've always loved music, and my music teachers in K-12 have always been my favorites, and after seeing music teachers post online about getting stared with the school year and videos of their curriculum I realized that's what I want to do. But I'd need at least 14 classes, plus 2 more gen-eds that would've been part of my CS degree that aren't major-required classes anymore *and* a year of extra courses and student teaching, or a masters, because my school doesn't offer an undergrad degree in music education. \n\nI'm incredibly privileged to have parents with the means to pay for my education, but I have about 1.5 years of that left, and I see no way to finish a music BA in that time frame coming from CS",

      "text": "I don't want to scare you but as a former music ed major, it's not worth it unless... \n\n - you absolutely have an unconditional and undying love of music and are proficient at at least one instrument. Most music teachers now are not expected to specialize in one thing but be great at multiple things (choir orchestra, band & marching band, gen music, music appreciation/history). You will also be required to learn a secondary classroom instrument. \n\n- you aren't concerned about $ and doing heaps of extra work to get by. A common thing I see is most music teachers do WAY more work than they have to and stay at school hours after the day is done. You might also need to teach private lessons or have some other form of income.\n \n- You are able to adapt if they all of a sudden start cutting art programs. This happens so much and although you're working at a public school which is quite stable, you will have to be prepared to constantly defend why music is just as important as everything else.\n \n- You love working with children and can teach them more than just music but life lessons. Also you should generally have an outgoing personality, and not afraid to make a joke out of yourself or be theatrical. \n\n- You are willing to take extra time and put in extra work to complete your degree. With all the requirements, auditions, performances, student teaching, observations, workshops etc. It gets overwhelming quickly. You might be forced to take classes that are 0 or even 0.5 credits depending on your school, and most definitely those 8am classes. You really have to commit to the work and be a consistent, organized person. \n\nif you have that 100% undying passion for all things music and are willing to take all the classes, I would say go for it. I met plenty people in my music school who realized it was their passion to teach music instead of their jobs, and they were very successful in the major.\n\n*I also forgot to mention if you can afford doing it of course, but I think that was already discussed",
