  "text": "Hi all, so I am a first year college student who got placed with a random roommate. We have been living together for about 10 days now and although she is nice, I am having an unfortunate problem. She has terrible body odor, which can be smelt all over her side of the room. We share a closet so whenever I open it I almost gag from how bad her clothes smell. In the 10 days we have been here, she has not done any laundry and has only showered twice. I can tell that she is rewearing clothes she has already worn several times (laundry is free this year at my school). I bought a diffuser for my side of the room which keeps it smelling nice but her bed is right by the door and unfortunately the diffuser isn't strong enough to reach her side. I know the smell is not me because I shower everyday and wear perfume. I have absolutely no idea how to go about solving this problem. She is Indian so I fear bringing it up directly would make her feel that I am perpetrating a stereotype when in reality this problem just happens to apply to her. I am considering talking to our RA in private but I'm not sure what she would do either as my roommate would know it was me who brought it up if the RA spoke to her. I don't want to have an awkward relationship but it is becoming a basic hygiene issue and it is making it hard for me to spend time in our room. I don't want the smell to start to cling to my clothes as well or for it to deter my friends from visiting my room. I'm not sure if she's insensitive to smell but a few days ago she cooked broccoli in our microwave while I was out and I came back and the awful smell stayed in our room for hours (I did bring this up to her and she said she wouldn't do it again). If anyone has any advice for how I can solve this problem without ruining our living relationship I would really appreciate it. Thank you!",

      "text": "You gotta talk to her yourself first. She may be nose blind, and not know that she stinks. Communication is key in situations like this, ignoring the problem just leads to resentment. You could then talk to your RA about it if your roommate dismisses you. However, you can't force your roommate to change their habbits, so you may just be stuck with a smelly roommate regardless of what you do.",
