I leaves zero room for error which just makes it all the more nerve wracking and as a result more likely to make a mistake.\n\nOne of my classes the exams are worth 90% of my grade, another 70%, and another 50%. I can bear 50%, but man the other two? Almost makes you destined to fail.",

That class was absolutely miserable. By the end of the term, I think it was only myself and 7 other students who had made it through the final exam. I aced every single exam, which part of me is really proud of. But it was at the expense of my health. Those exams used to give me chest pains.",

We no longer live in a world where information needs to be memorized and regurgitated: we have smartphones with the answer to every basic question that we could possibly have at our fingertips.

Instead, we should be training students to think critically and solve complex problems, skills that are necessary to be successful in today's workforce.\n\nCramming for a high-stakes final does not lead to a high level of retention for the information that is presented in the class, and missing this critical information can affect the student in their higher level courses and even later in their careers.
