YAAAY! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\nSome of you describe it something that's easy. Well maybe it is when you already have the skill for it. But for now, I try to do everything to get friends but I didn't find them yet.\n\nSometimes even finding the places where you can socialise can be difficult. Especially when you didn't do it that much before and there's no easy method that you know of. I wish how to socialise would be taught at school.\n\nHere's the issues : First, I'm autistic and so it's sometimes harder to communicate. Second, I'm at a place where I don't know any \"student associations\". I don't live in the US, and at the college style called \"DUT\" in France, here's how it works : while I'm in a campus, I'm also basically always only next to the people of my own education, programming.\n\nThere's like 200 students at programming. Not that much. They're basically classmates. I actually do talk to them and with some I actually make some small groups where we talk together during the recess time. But most of them are kinda occupied outside of school or just don't want to hang out and so I can't become real friends with them in real life.\n\nThere is a campus but yeah during recess we only talk to the people of the same department. There's no place for anyone to hang out. At least not one where my classmates went. There are the places where the people of other departments who study other things go. But they're usually in groups of friends and I think it'd be weird if I approached someone and tried to become a friend. I even tried, but like I've never seen them again. And it's a shame that for now I only talk to people from my department because it looks like it'd be cool to talk to a more diverse range of people. For example there's almost no girls in my department and I would like more gal friends.\n\nI don't really know if in all of the campus there's any such student activities. At best there's online activist groups. I've never heard about any of that. Maybe I'll try to ask more but I'd be surpsided if there are. I mean there's a library but that's about it. And also even if there were, when would the students evcen go there? Going on the campus on the weekend when we want to be finally rest after school? Or at 6PM when we also have 1 hour to commute? Idk, but unfortunately my college isn't some Hogwards fairytale. Actually, because of my loneliness it feels like a nightmare.\n\nAnd it's not at all better outside of school. yeah I don't go at any activities like sports yet, and I'll try that. But honestly what if I won't like the activity? It has been hard finding a place for socialising with people of similar interest of me. Should I go to an activity where I won't understand anything just for socialising? And also I don't drink and don't really know how to socialise at bars or cafes either.\n\nAnd it's also way harder when this loneliness has alreasy been a big problem of mine during the summer holidays, but now it all didn't become better, but actually worse because now I have to think of all that stressful, very anxious and extremely difficult actual LESSONS and I have 8 hours a day of them! So I have way less time for even trying to socialise with my already existing classmates. And it's also harder when BECAUSE of the lessons I have less time, I become more irritated and visibly anxious and it's even LESS possible to become friends with the people I already know (Last year, I even had a problem where I started ranting about some stupid political shit because of that)!\n\nI also don't really like my lessons even tho I thought I'd like programming too, but that's too complicated to explain here.\n\nTL;DR : I try everything to find friends but usual advice haven't worked for me, at least yet, It's not that easy and I don't have that much practise :(\n\nHonestly, my life just seems the worst that it could be! \ud83d\ude22 I just hate everything and honestly sometimes I even have suicidal thoughts but often I dream of just never ever studying in my life ever again! Or at least to finally be happy and actually hang out with someone \ud83d\ude2d", "author": "throwayaygrtdhredf", "created": 1631728442, "retrieved": 1632948526, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hd5fr8m": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pov96f/im_very_lonely_even_tho_i_try_everything_to_get/hd5fr8m/", "text": "Hang in there man.
