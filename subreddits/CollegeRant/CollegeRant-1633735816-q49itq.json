  "title:": "I hate weekends",
  "text": "In high school, weekends were the best because they were a two day break from school. Now, half my assignments are due Saturday at 11:59 so it's not a break from school. And I live on campus so there's not any leaving school. The only difference between weekends and weekdays is that on weekends I have no social life and it depresses me. I don't have a car so I can't go out and do anything. I don't have any classes to go to. Everything on campus(gym, library, dining halls, etc) are open shorter hours so I don't go as much. All I have to do on weekends is sit in my dorm doing nothing and I hate it. I've only made like 1 1/2 friends in college, and they both live off campus so I can't hang out with them because, again, no car. I have friends two hours away I could visit, but no car. I'm not friends with any of my roommates so I don't really talk to them, and half the time I go the entire weekend without saying a word to anyone. I hate college in general for a lot of reasons, but weekends are the fucking worst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: weekends suck bc there's still homework and i have no social life ",

      "text": "I sympathize with you! I've had semesters like that, now they're more spaced out with my more \"consistent\" class' assignments being due every Tuesday (or every other Tuesday depending on how fast the lessons go). My other classes barely assign anything.\n\nNot sure what you're classification and major is, but if you haven't gotten to this point yet, just know that it might get a bit easier once you get out of your gen ed classes. Maybe. I've heard it's just gotten harder for some students, but in my experience, my school is a lot more researched based--The professors are stretched more thinly so they don't really have time to be given out assignments to be checked weekly and shit. Overall things may get a little more sporadic, and a little more enjoyable. :) \n\nAnd what's your bus situation in your town? I'm sorry if you've already tried this and you didn't like it or it never worked out. But throughout the week if you have any lulls in your schedule maybe it'll be worth it to take some time off and catch the bus. \n\nIt *might* be the same or different for you, but in my town college students ride for free with just a swipe of our student cards. \n\nI research places I want to go, find the nearest *walkable* bus stop to that place (if I can't feasibly walk once the bus drops me off, I'm not going), catch the bus off campus and then I just go. Depending on wear I go I don't have to spend any money either. One time I went to a park to do homework for example. \n\nCan't so speak on the friend thing since I'm more of the loner/asocial, more introverted variety(not like how people mean social anxiety, but as in I don't really need people to explore and feel energized), but I hope you figure out something soon! Like getting to meet up with them in mutual places around town. \n\nIf you can help it, in the future (again, not sure if you're like a freshman or something) try to schedule your classes so that you have break days (no classes or 1 or 2 classes that end earlier in the day). Rn my break days are Tuesday and Thursday, and shit's sweet lol. I use them as days to either get off campus and clear my head, or I use it to catch up on work and study. \n\nGood luck! I hope things get better. :)\n\nI also think college sucks, but for some reason it saddens me when other people agree with me so I always try to give solutions to help. Maybe bc I don't want them to be miserable like me.",
