  "title:": "So I'm definitely failing my anatomy course",
  "text": "I have a 40 hour work week along with school, but I'm not balancing the two very well. I've been able to stay afloat with my other two classes but my anatomy grade is about to crash and burn because of one godforsaken program that should be cast to the depths of hell: Proctorio.\n\nThis professor does not allow any sort of notes, help, or even a second monitor to be plugged in during quizzes/exams. I have ADHD and my memory is dogwater, and even after spending the little time I have watching the videos and doing the practice work, my brain simply erases the information I have by the time exams come. \n\n\"But nijimari,\" you might say, \"Just get tutoring from your professor to help? Do you have disability accomodations?\"\n\nI do have those, but they're only for extending time on tests. I guess it works but it does not remove this POS software or its dictatorship requirements. And tutoring? With a 40 hr/wk job where I get home at 9pm and am too exhausted to do anything else? \n\nMy mental health has begun to spiral in the past few months. I've been missing assignments in all three of my courses, and while my grades for the other two are fine, I am 100% positively without a doubt sure that I will fail the anatomy class. The kicker? I missed the deadline to drop with a W by A FEW DAYS.\n\nI'm not used to failing a class. My parents are perfectionists and want me to succeed. How do I succeed when I feel like a failure in everything I do? I hate my job (I cannot quit, my parents won't let me,) I hate school and my major (I cannot change it as that would delay my graduation even more than it already has,) and I hate my life in general (Can't change that either for obvious reasons.) \n\nAt this point I just wanna sleep in my bed and just. Skip the rest of the semester. \n\nTL;DR: I'm about to fail my anatomy course and since it's the first time I've ever flunked a class I'm feeling like a total failure.",

      "text": "You cannot be a full time student and a full time worker. I've never seen that successfully done; the most I've seen is part time job with full course load (usually bad grades) or full time job taking one MAYBE two courses per semester (can sometimes work well but takes forever to graduate). What do you mean when you say your parents won't let you quit? Do you live with them? Did they go to college? I would sit them down and talk about all of this and tell them that something has to give.",
