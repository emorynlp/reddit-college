I have 4 more days and I\u2019ve spent every day trying to work on it, crying, and then wasting the rest of the day anxiously. That\u2019s not including the 30 hours a week I work as a pizza delivery driver to pay my rent and worrying about my elderly grandparents and all this shit in general.\n\nSorry for the rant.

Sometimes, we just have to push ourselves to do the task. It sucks, but sadly that's the norm. Especially with the current COVID-19 pandemic compressing our education.\n\nHave you emailed your professor for help on understanding concepts? While it seems embarrassing, it is one of the options for us students. Looking up some videos about your topic is also great. Any information gathered will eventually create a path.\n\nProcrastination right now is common, so is fear. You will pull through this.

You are going through A LOT. No wonder you're feeling burnt out. It's hard enough to be working in the service industry and caring for an elderly loved one on a normal day. You're doing this through the worst time in our history. Cut yourself some slack and take this day by day. And do not let any one of these days be a measure for what you are capable of. We are all being tested beyond our capabilities right now. These are not good times to judge our abilities other than to just take it day by day.
