  "title:": "Rant about a certain type of professors",
  "text": "Background... I am a grad student in engineering.\n\nIt's so annoying when a class is particularly easy and then the exam comes.... I don't understand why some professors decide to throw these curveballs on a test. Why is it a thing to test students on a problem they've never encountered before? I know that's life - we are going to encounter things we've never encountered before throughout our lives... But on tests? On top of that, every single problem is super tedious and need to be done by hand. And when I say tedious, I mean long algebra. We are bound to make a mistake somewhere in the math.\n\nI have a midterm coming up and my professor gave us last years midterm to use as a study guide.... He didn't post the solutions, nor did he go over the exam. Every single question has some weird curveball that I haven't seen in lecture or the textbook for this course. Luckily some of them, I have seen in undergrad... but what if I didn't? And I know grad school is supposed to be hard. But All the students come from different backgrounds. I am currently studying Aerospace Engineering, but I know some students in my major that did their undergrad in computer science and chemical engineering. I know for a fact that they would struggle with this exam.\n\nIt's just not right... it takes the 'equal opportunity' out of the course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr professor puts problems that we've never encountered before on exam.... The overall theory is taught in class and we see in the homework, but then there's just a slight addition to the problem that makes the problem completely different....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am beyond pissed now that I have taken the exam. The professor said he designed it to be a 1.5-hour test and he can complete the exam in 30 mins. THE EXAM TOOK ME THE ENTIRE 4 HOURS for just 4 problems.\n\nI work significantly slower when I am working with long equations that are all symbols and the first problem was a coupled differential equation that I needed to decouple, convert to first order form, and represent in its state-space form. Decoupling equations that are all symbolic, are long AF, and nothing cancels out is absolutely terrible. ",

If that\u2019s not enough, then the professor isn\u2019t preparing us well enough for the exam.

Don\u2019t just put random stuff on the test and expect people to know it.  Hours of studying, getting tutoring etc, no longer becomes the student\u2019s issue if they\u2019re failing. It becomes yours because you\u2019re intentionally allowing them to fail. \n\nPeople in the real world look stuff up. Learning is not about making someone else\u2019s life hell.
