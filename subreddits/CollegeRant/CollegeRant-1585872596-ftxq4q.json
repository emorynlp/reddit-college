When i post something here (like, specifically Rant, for example), i expect some... idk, understanding. Something to make me feel better you know? Or, at least nothing nasty.\n\nInstead, on my last rant I got some dude telling me to cool it and added a really unhelpful advice and i'm like: ...it's a RANT, this subreddit is for rant, if you're not gonna be supportive and helpful please don't comment and let me RANT.'\n\nOn one hand, he wasn't impolite, per-se. on the other, the reply definitely felt arrogant and pointless i wanted to down-vote the shit out of him, maybe reply back aggressively... but I didn't do it because i know how it feels to feel anxiety and dumb after someone talks down to you. Every Reddit post makes me stupid sensitive and i'm scared i won't get positive reviews. For that matter, it's like that in my college group chats and facebook and... every social media and even worse in real life. It's a borderline social anxiety thing. Reddit is just easier to deal with because I hide my identity.\n\nDon't let someone or something make you feel stupid.", "author": null, "created": 1586024991, "upvotes": 1}, "fma4x0h": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ftxq4q/i_joked_in_my_groupme_and_this_dude_responded/fma4x0h/", "text": "Eh f them, they\u2019re just arrogant assholes anyway!
