But getting self-taught is difficult, so I went to university anyway. The high school I went to had a class that was literally just straight in doing practical assignments related to it, I LOVED that class very much, but 1) it was only offered in junior years and 2) I had graduated from high school so I can no longer take more formal classes on it, plus getting informal meetings with that teacher would be inconveniencing that teacher's life.\n\nWhen I got into university as a freshman, I was shocked. I thought it'd be like that class all day, but nope, I had to take irrelevant units. There will be more relevant units into the 2nd, 3rd year onward, but the 1st year and its irrelevant units has to be passed through first and foremost. It didn't matter at all that I hate(d) these units or whatever, those credit points were all that mattered and if I don't take those irrelevant units and at least pass ALL of them, my graduation's screwed (aka delayed), and *even just ONE fail will* hurt my reputation.\n\nMaybe the assigning of compulsory off-topic irrelevant units was deliberately designed to increase the fail rate, and students failing = more $$$ for the institution.

For some, the bachelor's degree curriculum is designed to prepare the student to think critically in the world and have exposure to a wide range of topics related to the major. From the bachelor's degree on, it is up to the student to become a subject-matter expert. Unfortunately, as workplaces become more demanding of practical skills and hands-on experience, the ability to think alone is not enough to get hired. And the university also tends to feel that these classes are necessary for the student to have some context about the world they are in as they learn about their chosen field.

The ones that do it better are the ones that realize 90%+ of the students in those courses aren't going to ever even consider switching majors to whatever area the course covers so they instead focus on what skills they can teach that will apply to all students (so scholarly writing, research skills, class discussion skills, and other more broadly applicable skills). These courses are supposed to be there to teach and reinforce these skills since, for example, an English composition course would be a better place to teach the proper way to write a scholarly argument which all students will have to do in their major. Another example would be how a science lab better teaches students how to problem solve or how an art history course better teaches students how to interpret and reason with evidence while making connections. However, most schools and instructors seem to forget that this is why these courses were originally required.\n\nI will say more high schools need to do dual-credit courses (and it needs to be dual-credit) so students can get out of more of these Gen-Eds in college since there is a huge overlap. And it needs to be dual-credit courses since by law regionally accredited colleges and universities have to count the credit of academic courses (so not yoga or Taekwondo) from other regionally accredited courses (especially for gen-eds). From experience, AP credit acceptance can be pretty hit or miss (even for 4s and 5s) with some schools taking basically all credit and counting it toward actual requirements, others who count it for students overall credits but don't let them use it for any required courses, to others who just flat out don't accept any of it.", "author": "squirrel8296", "created": 1594059131, "upvotes": 2}, "fx417sx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hm5b5x/please_dont_consider_this_spam_why_do_we_have_to/fx417sx/", "text": "Honestly, I have no idea. Some classes such as English I found beneficial later on. However, some general eds such as geology, biology and astronomy weren't from me.

I did not have the math skills for the class and was struggling so much. I do agree with you about not seeing the point of those classes but I was trying to find some sort of benefit. It would be nice if we just went straight into majors. Take some gen-eds around these majors so that we could get in. This is what my college did somewhat but not nearly as much as I could see it happening. \n\nTL:DR no idea but see a benefit to learn to care about stuff you don't for studying.
