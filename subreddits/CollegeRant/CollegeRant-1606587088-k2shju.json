  "text": "I AM SICK AND TIRED OF FUCKING GROUP. WE DONT HAVE TIME FOR THAT SHIT\n\n4/5 of my professors assigned group work for the remaining semester. 3 of them are pretty long research projects and the other one is just a quick one.\n\n\nDon\u2019t they know how hard it is to get everyone to meet with each other??? HUH???? We all have different schedules. \n\nI\u2019m working 3 jobs, I cannot quit cause I need to pay my tuition. \n\nFinals are coming up and these motherfuckers had the audacity to give us these long group projects???\n\n\nFUCK YOU!\n\nI fucking swear, if I see more group work next semester I will fucking lose it. Just give me my individual assignments I DONT WANT TO RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE TO GET A GOOD GRADE",
