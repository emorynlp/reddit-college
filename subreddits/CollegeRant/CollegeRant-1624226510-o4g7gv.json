I am the oldest so I help my mom with a lot but being a junior now in college I really regret not dorming. I feel like I missed out on making friends, growing as an individual and experiencing living on my own. All things that I greatly wanted to do. I still have a chance to dorm being a junior and all but im scared to against my mothers wishes. All she imagines is the worst things happening and its never open for discussion. I want to just put my deposit in and tell her on moving day lol. But is dorming really that great? I am making a mistake that isnt really worth it? What if I get there and i feel like a wasted my money and my time? Any advice on what I should do would be great. honestly any input lol.", "author": "somaligirl12345", "created": 1624226510, "retrieved": 1632949665, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h2m6wgd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o4g7gv/i_wanted_to_dorm_but_my_strict_mother_would_not/h2m6wgd/", "text": "Definitely try it out, this kind of experience would never show up after college, and the kind of friends you make and the kind of interactions you have are all worth it.
