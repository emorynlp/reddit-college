  "text": "My professor just gave us another 3,000 word count minimum essay to do that I have to submit in 2 weeks and I\u2019m just mindblown at how some professors think that\u2019s enough time to complete an essay of that size\n\nI\u2019ve had smaller essays that I was given 1 and even 2 months to do and I\u2019ve had friends from other colleges tell me they\u2019ve been given 2,000 word essays to do and they got around 2 months to do it \n\nIt is a 15 week class but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reason to give us 3,000 word count minimum essays in such a short and unreasonable amount of time, on the last 3,000 word essay they gave us 2 weeks and I pulled all nighters almost every day of that week and I still barely finished within the hour that the essay was due, my health suffered a lot from trying to get that essay done and now we have another 3,000 word essay to do that we need to finish to pass the class\n\nI am so exhausted and I want to just not submit the assignment and even drop the class but I would be getting a W as a result\n\nShould I drop this class? I already have a lot of completed classes so I dont think it would affect FAFSA, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d owe anything to FAFSA for dropping this class at this point in the semester since we\u2019re 3 weeks away from finishing. I could try toughing this semester out to the end but I know I\u2019m going to have to sacrifice a lot of sleep, most of my thanksgiving break, and a bit of my mental and physical health to hopefully be able to finish in time, I stress cried multiple times when we had that first 3,000 word essay due and I dont think I\u2019ve ever been that stressed before\n\nThank you for reading! Sorry for the huge rant\n\nTL;DR: Have to do 3,000 word count minimum research paper, only given two weeks (instuctions for essay barely posted today), not sure if I should drop class (and get a W as a result) or not",

We don\u2019t get the instructions until two weeks before it\u2019s due. The only class I\u2019ve had two month essays in was history 101. But there was a ridiculous amount of reading and research required for it.",

Just do a bit everyday and you\u2019ll be fine. Your college rant alone was a good 500 words or more at least. You\u2019ll be fine man. You can do it.",
