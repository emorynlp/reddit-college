Then I start this semester with elective professors that think their class is the most important class of your life.  These professors are already assigning multiple chapters in the first week. \n\nIt doesn't help that their online class structure is atrocious with the pettiest of requirements.  Navigating these classes requires its own handbook.

I have been taking online classes for three years now, and this is the first semester where all four professors think that the student\u2019s lives should revolve around their one class. I have never had so many issues with navigating canvas than I do with all four of these people because they are all using it completely differently and some of them are making us do every step within canvas. Some of the professors that are not savvy with technology or making my life extremely hard. \ud83d\ude11 One of them even had an assignment due the second day back from class. I hadn\u2019t even looked at it before he sent an email to some of us that hadn\u2019t even touched it yet.
