  "title:": "I\u2019m losing my mind over a 5 page paper that\u2019s worth 20% of my grade",
  "text": "I have a 5 page paper due in a week that\u2019s worth 20% of my grade, but it\u2019s part one of another paper that\u2019s worth 30%. Together, they make up 50% of my grade. I\u2019m having trouble choosing/narrowing down a topic and every time I see my professor about it, he gives me different advice on what to focus on. So I emailed him today with my plan and asked for his approval and he responded by saying that he was shocked that I was so confused because he thought we were on the same page. He gave me some suggestions that were different from what he told me at our previous office hour meeting.\n\nI like this professor, he has great lectures and he\u2019s a really nice guy. But I\u2019m crying and stressed out over what he wants me to do because it\u2019s something different each time I talk to him.",
