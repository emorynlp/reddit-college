However, this semester they have decided to schedule the midterm exams around the Easter break, meaning my heaviest and most difficult exam is scheduled for the day after the Easter Monday. I'm quite used to not having an entirely free Easter break, in high school we would usually have some assigned readings, but I have never had such an important exam on such short notice after the break. On top of that, I study abroad but currently staying in my home country, and my country always traditionally celebrates the Maundy Thursday as well - all university students get a day off on that day, but since my foreign university doesn't celebrate it, I had an exam on a day when all of my friends had a day off.\n\nRight now, my entire family is just laying around, watching movies and eating cakes and I'm sitting in my room studying all day. A part of me wants to just say fuck it and join them, but I have been struggling with this subject recently and I know that I risk not passing the exam if I don't practice all day. On top of that, we get no break after the exams as well, the classes are resuming the day after the last exam, so I have nothing to look forward to. I have never felt so burned out and bitter that my family gets to do nothing all day long. I know it's just a few days, but I have been really looking forward to it, since I have been studying pretty much non-stop for the last few months (neither the country where I live nor the one where my university is located has a spring break), and because the only break we had, back in January, I spent working full time.\n\nTL:DR No Easter break because of the exams and feeling miserable because of it", "author": "neshoba77", "created": 1617471569, "retrieved": 1632951486, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gtb6kkq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mjd99j/my_university_scheduled_the_exam_week_around_the/gtb6kkq/", "text": "Just be happy you get any kinda break.
