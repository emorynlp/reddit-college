I got a 60! Which isn't that high I know but the last 2 times I took this class I got a 20 and 30 on the midterm, so this is a huge improvement and makes me more hopeful that I can graduate! I cannot wait to get my goddamn degree and abandon academia forever lol\n\nTL;DR I may actually pass a class that has held me back from my degree, and even though I'm taking it for the 3rd time I'm proud of myself\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards and the kind comments! I didn't expect this much support and it's so nice to receive it- I hope you all have amazing days and are able to treat yourselves to something nice in the near future!

I\u2019m not good at math or languages. My degree has nothing to do with either, but they\u2019re required. Blugh! I\u2019ve considered just getting a General Studies degree with certificates that are micro credentials that are supposed to build toward the Bachelors degree. \n\nAnyways.
