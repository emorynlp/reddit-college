  "text": "After failing my math class that is required to graduate twice, having it cost me my scholarship, and being a breath away from changing my major just to avoid it, I passed the midterm for the first time! I got a 60! Which isn't that high I know but the last 2 times I took this class I got a 20 and 30 on the midterm, so this is a huge improvement and makes me more hopeful that I can graduate! I cannot wait to get my goddamn degree and abandon academia forever lol\n\nTL;DR I may actually pass a class that has held me back from my degree, and even though I'm taking it for the 3rd time I'm proud of myself\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards and the kind comments! I didn't expect this much support and it's so nice to receive it- I hope you all have amazing days and are able to treat yourselves to something nice in the near future! ",

It sucks that passing or not passing a course has an impact on your major, I really did not want to change my major.",

I\u2019ve gotten A grades for every single class in my bachelors program, but \u201cfailed\u201d College Algebra once with a C- (a C or higher is required...so close...might try to CLEP out or something) and now French 1 and 2 is causing a similar situation. I\u2019m not good at math or languages. My degree has nothing to do with either, but they\u2019re required. Blugh! I\u2019ve considered just getting a General Studies degree with certificates that are micro credentials that are supposed to build toward the Bachelors degree. \n\nAnyways. Congrats and keep up the good work!",
