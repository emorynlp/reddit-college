  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a 20f college student. Although I don\u2019t go back to school until late August, it\u2019s July and I\u2019m already thinking about how it\u2019ll be. I\u2019ve been in college since fall of 2019 and I\u2019ll finish in a year. Ever since I started college I have just hated my life. I live at home with my dad, and I have to work a part-time job at all times. And I absolutely hate it. When I do this, I don\u2019t have a life at all. Also factor in that I have a high school sweetheart too that I have to make time for. It\u2019s seriously very tiring and degrading. I suffer this whole time mentally and I can\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s almost like I want to isolate myself from the world until the semester is over. Not to mention how irritating it is when I\u2019m always in school when someone wants to go on a trip. But when I\u2019m actually out for a few months, no one wants to plan anything. I just don\u2019t know, I hate life. I don\u2019t think it would be bad just going to school or just working, but doing both is the equivalent of hell.",
