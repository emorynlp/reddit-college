I'm starting to question my life choices, thinking that this is not going to be worth it in the long run. I couldn't bring myself to work on anything, and now deadlines are piling up. I know there's an end but it's project after project. I really want to maintain my GPA, and finish strong but there's also a lot of tension at home, and it doesn't help that I'll be stuck doing things online for the rest of the semester. I don't have the best support system so I decided to vent it out here. For some reason I couldn't bottle it up this time like I used to.", "author": "Anyaness", "created": 1620962973, "retrieved": 1632842394, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gy25kci": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nbzakl/burning_out_during_the_finals/gy25kci/", "text": "Thank you u/Anyaness for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I let my external life problems get the best of me before and I lost motivation and stopped caring. Headspace really is important. Write down your goals and things you want to buy when you land that internship or get your degree. Get away from your home if you can whether it\u2019s studying at a close friends house or a family member that can take you in. Do what you need to do so you can make the money and time paid for these classes worth it.

Deadlines will always be there. The date never changes. But the more you push yourself after you already crashed and burned, it\u2019s not going to be good. During spring break, i had a butt load of assignments to complete. I sat down the thursday before and all of a sudden a huge wave of anxiety and stress of not only the work itself, but what I am doing and what career path/Major I should take just hit me. I said fuck it. I\u2019m not going to let college destroy me. So I didn\u2019t even check my emails or did an ounce of homework during the spring break. I worked out (I found for me, when I am stress I need to be physical I.e run or biking), did yoga, went to the park with my dogs, JOURNALED A LOT, spoke to family friends, watched some netflix, ate some bomb ass food and just relaxed. After the break, I resumed and although I had a shit ton of assignments to finish, I was in a better state of mind. So if you have two weeks left or so, here is what you should do (if this works for you): before you put a pause, plan every hour of your day in regard to your homework so you feel in control and more structured. So when you come back from your break, you know where to begin. After you have planned out ur assignments, RELAX. Take two or three days off and pick yourself up again. You will have work to do, but you\u2019ll feel a lot more refreshed. This worked for me but I know everyone is different. Semester is almost over. You got this.
