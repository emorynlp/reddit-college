  "text": "I'm majoring in communications but have no idea what job I'm even gonna have (or even desire) after I might graduate. I'm already so behind year-wise after switching from my community college. I failed my first year at my university in pre-business then switched over to my now current major, I'm in debt, on probation, and hate my retail job. I feel like I'm wasting the money I have on classes for this major cause I have no idea what to do with it. I don't know how to even apply for a subsidized loan and I don't even know if I could apply because of academic probation. I really need to go to the career center or something, But I feel so stupid whenever I ask questions to any administrator, I never know what's going on. I like such a loser... thank god for Lexapro or I'd be crying every day.",

That is as long as you haven't taken out more than the maximum amount of loans already.\n\nKeep in mind that a bachelor's degree is often the entry level bar for a job of any kind that pays decent.\n\nIf you don't want to go to school anymore you can start learning a trade and get paid to learn. \n\nI'm in a major right now that I can't say that I love but I'm in it for the money. I know after 10 years of using that degree towards the job I'll be able to retire.",

I get two regular paychecks a month from the 40hr a week job. One goes for bills with a little left over. The other goes to investing and business building. \n\nThe other money I get from my crypto mining, delivery business, entertainment business, and stuff flipping business all goes towards investing. \n\nI got all of my debt paid off beside my student loans which are in deferment until six months post graduation. I will be able to reach 1 million in networth in the next 15 years.\n\nI'm working hard at increasing my income even more then I already have in the last two years.

I came to and understanding that it was time to change my relationship with money. I spent the last year last 3 years doing that. When I grew up my parents told me that investing in the stock market was gambling. In my personal finance class in high school we had a stock broker come in and tell me that he wouldn't even invest in the stock market. So very early on my ideas with money was pretty messed up. It really wasn't until I met my current partner and just set some different life goals that things started to change for me.\n\nI cut my teeth on Dave Ramsey too. I found the r/fieryfemness group which I think you should join. It's pretty awesome on here. After Dave Ramsey I started binging on Graham Stefan and wow my eyes were opened so big. \n\nI've actually started to think about and consider starting some kind of class to teach what I have learned. If I could just show people that they too could be millionaires if they just plan and work towards it. Not talking about any silly get rich quick scheme. That's all bull crap. I have been thinking about ways in which I could potentially get a class put into the curriculum at the junior high level.",

Two real estate investors. Three three old money where they inherited the money in the first place. This is according to kiplinger's financial magazine. \n\nWhen it comes to investing in the stock market don't pick single stocks. There are these investment instruments called index funds. That means that you can buy one share of a piece of a pie that owns 500 of the top income earning companies in the nation. You can also buy an index fund of the top income producing companies of other nations as well to protect you in the event of an economic downswing in our country.\n\n How much to invest in the stock market and crypto really comes down to how much do you want to live off of when you retire. Do you want to try to live off of $36,000 a year or $250,000 a year in retirement? Do you want to retire when you are 40 years old or do you want to retire when you're 70 years old? These are all things that you need to ask yourself and figure out and start running some financial calculators. Mister money mustache blog has a really great calculator on it that can help you figure out how much you need to invest in terms of what percentage of your earnings you need to save and how long that you'll need to save that up for. If you start looking up and using retirement calculators you get a better idea of how much you might need when you're older. \n\nBut the first step in financial wellness is to have an emergency fund. The emergency fund should cover all of your expenses for 6 to 12 months.\n\nIf I could go back to when I would say 20 years old the first thing that I would do would be focusing on increasing my income as much as possible through obtaining a higher education. Then I would work on building my savings rate as much as possible. The more you save the quicker you get to retire. I would have also been very responsible with credit cards and start building good credit at that time too.\n\nI'm with you the stock market can be kind of confusing. That's why it's best to just stick with index funds because even the people who are paid the big bucks to pick stocks still lose money. It's generally seen as more of a gamble to pick individual stocks versus index funds.",

If you don\u2019t know what you want to do with your major, find jobs that require it online or try getting a minor in something that you do find interesting so you can incorporate that in your job hunt as well.
