I'm already so behind year-wise after switching from my community college. I failed my first year at my university in pre-business then switched over to my now current major, I'm in debt, on probation, and hate my retail job. I feel like I'm wasting the money I have on classes for this major cause I have no idea what to do with it. I don't know how to even apply for a subsidized loan and I don't even know if I could apply because of academic probation. I really need to go to the career center or something, But I feel so stupid whenever I ask questions to any administrator, I never know what's going on.

That is as long as you haven't taken out more than the maximum amount of loans already.\n\nKeep in mind that a bachelor's degree is often the entry level bar for a job of any kind that pays decent.\n\nIf you don't want to go to school anymore you can start learning a trade and get paid to learn. \n\nI'm in a major right now that I can't say that I love but I'm in it for the money.

But honestly now that I\u2019m so close to graduating, (3.0 GPA, aiming for a 3.5 before I graduate) I can tell you that it is worth it in the end. Take one problem one day at a time. If you don\u2019t know what you want to do with your major, find jobs that require it online or try getting a minor in something that you do find interesting so you can incorporate that in your job hunt as well.
