It's perfectly normal to not know what you want to do. You're only in your early twenties and are being forced to decide your entire career path. It's a lot. Be kind to yourself and take it one day at a time. If they don't have any services like that, maybe find one online as well. Good luck, and be kind to yourself. You're trying your best.",
