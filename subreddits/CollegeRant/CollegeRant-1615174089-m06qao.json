Skipped many more classes than attended, and not paid any attention to the ones I have. I have zero zero zero interest in my modules. It\u2019s all so shit. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with life any more. COVID only makes all this shit worse. I would like to use it as an excuse but I just have no interest in anything I\u2019ve done in college. I hate it all. What\u2019s the fucking point. I\u2019m just wasting my time stressing about college when I know I\u2019m just going to drop out and amount to nothing in life. What\u2019s the point in anything anymore. When I drop out what am I even going to do? Just find another reason to be depressed? Everything just feels so meaningless now. What am I going to tell my friends? I\u2019m going to just be a failure. I don\u2019t want to do this shit anymore", "author": "inbredburner", "created": 1615174089, "retrieved": 1632950846, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gq83bde": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m06qao/im_so_fucked/gq83bde/", "text": "Congrats, you played yourself.", "author": "OsculatingPlanes", "created": 1615220552, "upvotes": -5}, "gq6y0lm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m06qao/im_so_fucked/gq6y0lm/", "text": "I'm in this post and I don't like it.", "author": "Floppy_Onion", "created": 1615193308, "upvotes": 5}, "gq6xb3m": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m06qao/im_so_fucked/gq6xb3m/", "text": "I feel this. I lost my drive and don't feel like doing anything. I rather drop out but only \"having a year left\" and not disappointing my parents is keeping me.

I feel like I'm fucked whether I drop or not anyways cuz I'm getting this major for nothing. Only joined it cuz I thought it was interesting enough and needed something to fall back on when changing from comp. sci.
