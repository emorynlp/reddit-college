  "title:": "My University is Overpriced",
  "text": "My University is dreadfully overpriced for many reasons. I go to an Ivy League. I'm not saying the name since I still want to graduate. Considering the amount of mental and physical damage I have endured in this abusive school, they should be paying me more. I've had a plethora of incompetent professors, many arrogant, gas lighting professors. I literally had one ask to pay for my freaking wi-fi over the pandemic. So uncalled for, incredibly invasive and insensitive. One asked a poorer student why they didn't buy the books yet a week into the semester  in front of the whole class and they had to say they couldn't afford them yet. I've had two professors call me lazy, one suggest I go to the office of disability just because I asked to take a quiz in her office (an arrangement I had with a previous professor or the same subject.) One prof would get up and sit next to me every class, even though I tried to sit as far away from them as possible. Another would give me the turkey neck confused face whenever I asked a question in class. I straight up had to say \"yeah, seriously\" before he would answer my questions. I had a couple near death experiences (because I became very ill and almost died) and I had hoped my professors would try to be a bit flexible with my grades and stuff, but they told me to drop their classes instead. And this is just the professors and it's not even all the stories I have on them.\n\nOther than the professors, the student community is toxic as hell. The perfectionism is overkill. Students dick measure by asking how many hours you've slept a night. If you have a healthy sleep schedule, you're not working hard enough. If they don't see you in the library until 1AM at least twice in the semester, you must not be working hard enough. If you don't feel the need blackout drunk once a week, you must not be working hard enough. If you aren't trying to go vegetarian or vegan, you must not be working hard enough to save the world. If you don't go to protests, you must not be working hard enough to save the world. If you get a B in a class, you must not be working hard enough. If you don't have color coded notes, you must not be working hard enough. Don't even get me started on the hookup culture, it's wild af.\n\nNow for some miscellaneous stuff that damn near broke my soul once I finally became depressed from this oppressive atmosphere. My dorm didn't have heat in the winter. The vending machines charge you 6 dollars for a small bag of Doritos (what a mockery to poorer students). The dining halls aren't good at labelling things for food allergies. One of my friend's nearly died a week into my first year because of this. There are few mental health resources that I know of despite the school having one the highest suicide rates in the country. General conversations between students and even staff are excruciatingly shallow. I asked to make a bakery and my Head of College, suggested I do a coffee shop with \"avocado on toast\". She knew already that I've never tasted coffee in my life. It was a big point in the conversation prior to this moment.\n\nOk, I'm done--Oh! Yeah, I caught covid and had to withdrawal, but the policies are keeping me from reenrolling. lol bye\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nTL;DR : Many of the professors suck, student community sucks, no care for mental or physical health. Not worth the money.",
