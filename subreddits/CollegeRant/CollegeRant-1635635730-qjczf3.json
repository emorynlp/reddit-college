  "text": "Btw this is just me ranting, I'll be perfectly ok eventually!\\~ I've been powering through to get my AA at the academy of art. I know. An AA should be a breeze, especially art. Hear me out. I got into college right after high school, did almost 2 years, then dropped out. I got into a dark place, and then after some life experience, started trying again at 22. Hearing the academy of art was nationally accredited and had a degree for something I was interested in was good enough for me, I'm no Einstein. As my journey in this school continues, I'm starting to understand why there's like a 25% graduation rate. After I met my girlfriend, I got a boost of motivation and decided to take 4 classes. This was an absolute meat grinder. It's funny because I'm sure that any STEM degree is not any easier; I commend you guys very much. The only thing is many of these classes, being a private school and all, find value in quantity over quality, but the classes were at least interesting to someone with my taste. Last semester, I had around 72 paintings, entire 3D environments, a plethora of digital sculpts, and a host of art essays. I spent so many all nighters learning different softwares, artistic fundamentals, technical skills, and put in the work to prove it. After finishing these classes with all A's, I thought I could dive into 4 classes again. \n\nNow, I feel like the classes I'm taking were designed either thin the herd, or make them fail so that they can \"try again\" with full tuition price. I spent all last semester and semesters before proving to this damn school that I can design, draw, model, sculpt, paint, write, and program. The classes I'm taking now are absolutely abysmal, and midterms were absolutely disgusting with the workload. I'm designing, drafting, modeling, animating, and programming about 30 hours a week for ONE class. I'm writing math essays every god damn week, going from statistics and probability one day to linear algebra the next day (let me do the homework, I don't want to write essays about how Anthony's fucking toes represent the golden ratio). I'm writing papers every week for Art History, which regurgitates information like a broken JSON file and expects top tier analysis with thousands of words per paper. I'm doing the equivalent of creating block meshes for AAA games when the process of drafting, prototyping, animating, lighting, and modeling is the work of a team, not one student who's already getting his shit kicked in by other classes. My 4th class is pretty cool, the programming teacher gives us a good challenge project per week and he's enthusiastic, not so bad. These other 3 are basically all their own full time jobs in the amount of content they are comfortable giving each week. Of course, these 3 are the ones that are all module based, not zoom based, so as long as they have a 5 year old video of one of their peers explaining these regurgitated concepts, then they feel comfortable giving a fucking ton of assignments without having to do ANY teaching. \n\nMy back and brain are breaking. I'm doing so much and taking in so much that I feel like I'm not learning anything. I do udemy courses just to learn the information and skills needed to finish the assignments. I'm at my desk 24/7. How do you tell your friends that the few hours of free time a week you have want to be spent in peace? I'm missing all my family and friend's birthdays. My girlfriend who has a lot of health issues, and I'm grateful for her company, but taking care of someone else while managing all this is stressful beyond belief. I'm allowing the world to pass me by because I refuse to fail college again. I'm blessed for the opportunity to go in the first place; shit ain't cheap, and I don't want to fuck it up because of this semester, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna take these classes again. Fuck these classes, I'm working more than anyone who complains about a 9-5! rant over\\~ have a blessed day",
