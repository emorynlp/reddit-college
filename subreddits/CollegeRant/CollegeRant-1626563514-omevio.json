I can't say my experiences are the same as yours, of course, but I feel like we are going through similar circumstances. \n\nI also don't have a social life. Since the pandemic, I did my whole sophomore year online, and I'm also worried about going back to school and worrying if I'll make new friends or I'll straight up embarrass myself trying to (I have social anxiety because I tend to overthink so much on social situations and worry about them sm). And with your friend leaving, I literally feel like I've gone through that too even though I haven't (it's weird to explain but hopefully you get what I mean). \n\nAnd I also have my fair share of \"Christian\" girls/ppl and I'm even Christian and I'm sorry you have gone through all of that. But tbh they are so two-faced? I have a friends who post bible verses on their IG story every. single. day. Have I seen them live up to those verses? Nope. Have they treated me like shit and only talked to me when they needed \"help\" and then ignored me when they don't? Yep. It's some kinda pattern with \"Christians\" that go with the saying \"they can talk the talk, but can't walk the walk\". And I live in Texas and can understand your views on it.\n\nYeah I pretty much just ranted, but I really empathize with your situation and hopefully I could provide some idea that you def aren't the only one who's experienced this. :)", "author": "jjyuuu", "created": 1626828882, "upvotes": 1}}}
