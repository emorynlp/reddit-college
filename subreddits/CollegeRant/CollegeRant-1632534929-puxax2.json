      "text": "Honestly a couple days ago I had this issue in which I got kicked out of a exam utilizing the lockdown browser before I even answered the first question. I'm not the only one that has this issue. As a result I have a zero recorded for the exam and my grade immediately jumped from a B to a F. The professor did create another version of the test for me to take, and I took it. However, I was at a B before the test and I know I got a B or a C on the other version of the test that the professor created so it doesn't make sense for my grade to be only at a 32%. I emailed the professor and TA and they didn't really respond. I then emailed my whole class via blackboard, and then everybody says that they're having the same issue and that the professor and TA is not responding to their emails either.",
