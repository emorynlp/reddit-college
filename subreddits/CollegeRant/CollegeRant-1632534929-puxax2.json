I'm not the only one that has this issue. As a result I have a zero recorded for the exam and my grade immediately jumped from a B to a F. The professor did create another version of the test for me to take, and I took it. However, I was at a B before the test and I know I got a B or a C on the other version of the test that the professor created so it doesn't make sense for my grade to be only at a 32%. I emailed the professor and TA and they didn't really respond. I then emailed my whole class via blackboard, and then everybody says that they're having the same issue and that the professor and TA is not responding to their emails either.", "author": "malarkeyasian", "created": 1632681467, "upvotes": 2}, "he9coc2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/puxax2/i_love_getting_a_zero_on_an_essay_7_minutes_after/he9coc2/", "text": "If your college professor isn't acting like crap, you aren't his student.", "author": "ItsTheUltimateBob", "created": 1632599978, "upvotes": 3}, "he94qzh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/puxax2/i_love_getting_a_zero_on_an_essay_7_minutes_after/he94qzh/", "text": "HMU for help with those essays.
