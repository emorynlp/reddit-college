  "text": "So I'm a 2nd year Junior (been in college 2 years but have the credits to be a junior) and My grades in Organic Chemistry have been slowly dropping no matter how much I practice different problems. We have a total of six exams in this class. First exam was an 82, which ended up being an A. Second exam an 80, so a B. Third exam a 65, a C. Then this fourth exam, which I thought I understood, was a 43, an F! \n\nI practice for hours, making sure I get them right. And it's not even the professors fault, he is explaining it in such an easy to understand way and I go to office hours and he said I should do well on the exam and then I didn't! The next two exams and all of Organic Chemistry 2 builds on this past test, so if I don't understand then I will fail.\n\nI need this class for graduate school or else I would have dropped it by now since I'm a biology major. But no, stupid Chemistry has to be taken with it. \n\nAdd on top of that, my mother's income went up by 13k and so I'm losing the biggest grant that I always got for next year which means instead of having everything paid for like I have for the past two years, I will owe 7k that I don't have! My parents don't help out with college at all!! It's all on me. I can't afford it. But I love the atmosphere of this university and the people and everything. \n\nTLDR - failing a class I need for graduate school and had a grant revoked so now I'll owe about 7k",
