The best advice that must be learnt is to stay in your lane and not to give a fuck what minor people in your life have to say about your plans / dreams. I am with you in that you should walk away from people that say \"that's hard\". They're not worth your energy. It's better to focus energy on people who naturally believe in those around them and want to see others win at life rather than bring others down because of preconceived notions of difficultly or insecurities.
