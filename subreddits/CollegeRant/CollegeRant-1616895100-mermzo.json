  "text": "I don\u2019t understand why some professors won\u2019t allow you to go back and review previous answers  on exams and quizzes like I know they do it to prevent cheating but it\u2019s just a bad method. Just proctor or use lockdown browser with webcams instead because that\u2019s more of an equivalent to testing precovid. I have a professor who uses lockdown browser with webcams and doesn\u2019t allow us to review previous questions and it\u2019s so annoying because it\u2019s harder to gage my time and I don\u2019t want to be stuck on a question that I can\u2019t answer. If professors think people will still cheat with the other anti cheating programs in place, then not being able to go back to questions isn\u2019t going to stop them from cheating either way. It\u2019s like how in-person exams still has people cheating. Honestly I feel like there are better methods to prevent cheating online than not being able to go review questions.\n\nTLDR: Exams that don\u2019t allow you to look back at previous questions sucks and doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent cheating.",

I always thought it was strange that I couldn\u2019t review answers before submitting them or go back to a question I was stuck on.",

      "text": "Omg I have a genetics professor who doesn't let us backtrack on our exams, and it's a really hard class. We use lockdown browser too. There's lots of math involved and I would encounter a hard question with lots of points and it sucks because it requires me a very long time to think I want to go to the next question and come back to that question later. But no...I gotta figure it out. When that happened to me and I couldn't understand the question, I literally had to guess because I didn't want to waste any more time thinking and I have more questions to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm literally doing bad in that class all BECAUSE I cannot backtrack. Literally my test taking strategy is to skip the hard, complex questions and go back to it when I am done with my other questions. \n\n It's so annoying I don't see the point. I would rather have them watch me on cam than backtrack.",

I had a professor who did this along side respondus lockdown browser and she did not tell us about not going back during the first day when we went over syllabus. Most of us flunked our first test and when she asked why the biggest complaint was we couldn't go back. My test strategy is to answer the ones I know right away and then go back to the ones I struggle with. Her reasoning was it was open book and open note. It takes longer to search through a book or notes than it does to get the answers you know selected.",

      "text": "Professors and universities are as responsible for cheating as cheaters are at this point. If they would focus on actually assessing learning instead of assessing rote memorization of minute facts they could easily prevent cheating (or at the very least more easily spot it) without the use of any lockdown browsers or proctors. American higher ed in general is stuck in a pre-internet way of teaching that simply is not relevant anymore and never will be relevant again. Even for in person exams, if you have to go to pretty extreme lengths to prevent cheating then you and your assessment are the issue, not the students taking it.",
