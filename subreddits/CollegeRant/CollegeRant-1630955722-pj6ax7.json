First off, it has nothing to do with loans. In fact, my entire college education was covered by scholarships I applied for. I graduated with no student debt. However, I hadn't been more miserable while in college than I had any other time in my life. I had goals in life. Goals I saw myself achieving before college even crossed my mind (in which it only eventually crossed my mind because my family wouldn't stop bringing it up after high school). My very first part-time job was in high school. I saved every dime I made. I was also obese in high school (bullied, picked on, etc). By the time I graduated high school, I was pressured by family to attend college but I envisioned a different goal. I continued to work a retail job and volunteer over the next few years. In my early 20's, I went to college to try it out since my family wouldn't let it go. I switched my major several times. I used accommodations, studied and practiced problems for hours on end, got tutoring, but still struggled. I gave up my social life to try and at least do adequately in grade performance. I never truly decided what I wanted to do in college, only what I envisioned for myself since high school.\n\nOne day, I stared an advertisement board for Victoria's Secret while at the mall with my mother. She looked at me. \"Honey? There's just no way. You're obese. Those type of women have strict requirements, I'm sorry. You'll always be beautiful in my eyes though. You should continue your studies. You're doing great!\" To say I was furious was an understatement. So over the next two years, I was determined to achieve my goal. My REAL goal. By the end of those two years, I had lost 100 pounds and was accepted to an agency. I was officially a model. At that point, I dropped out of college, at least for the time being. By my mid-twenties, I bought a house, invested in stocks, and was still modeling. Eventually, I went back to college part-time just to get the degree done and say I completed it. Eventually, I stopped modeling as some years had passed and my next goal was to do more investing. So I invested in crypto. Fastforward to today, and I'm doing very well in life.\n\nMy boyfriend was in the same exact situation as well. He struggled miserably through college. Learned absolutely nothing about the subjects nor anything about himself that he already knew/learned to begin with. He graduated with average grades. Fastforward to today. He's also an investor (stocks, real estate, etc) and is doing incredibly well). He told me his biggest mistake was not doing this sooner. He, too, saved up money from his job in high school and job during the beginning of college. He was truly contemplating on ditching college all together and following his dream of becoming a successful investor and businessman. But his entire family pressured him, saying he'd be wasting his time and that college would be a much better route for him so he continued his education and dealt with all the stress.\n\nBy the middle of college, he was truly getting tired of everything and began investing in crypto on the side. He was also doing research on starting his own business. By the time he graduated college, he used half of his crypto profits, put a down payment on a house, began a small business (that grew). By his late 20's, he had a successful business, multiple investments, a paid off house, paid off car, etc. All because he followed his original dream. Granted, he did end up graduating college but it was to get it over with like me. By the time he graduated, he had already been in the process of his goals and his degree is completely unrelated to business, finance, etc.\n\nHe and I are millennials by the way, in our early 30's. We were originally promised good careers regarding our college education as long as we worked hard for it and graduated. We ended up having to go our own way. We learned nothing in college about ourselves that we didn't already know. We don't remember any of the subjects we learned. We only remember what we envisioned ourselves before we even thought of college. We were pressured into it, and it's one of our biggest regrets. We do understand that college can be a good choice for certain people, but the fact that college gets painted as this end all be all solution is rather disappointing in our opinion.

This whole time, ever since I quit my college, I\u2019ve been given indirect sh*t. And I started to resort to telling people that I\u2019ll go back soon. But I know I won\u2019t. At the very maximum, I\u2019ll attend CC, but that\u2019s it. I feel like everyone looks down on me, but I know there\u2019s a way to survive society without college. Everyone can go screw themselves.\n\nI was once told that college is only useful for networking, and I still believe that. It hasn\u2019t even been 4 months and I\u2019ve already forgotten most of what I\u2019ve learned. I have a good plan in action right now. And if I continue living by the way I want to live, with no pressure about college this or college that, I believe I\u2019ll be able to follow my dreams of traveling and have money left over. I\u2019m sure people have worded this differently but I\u2019ve also been told that \u201cit\u2019s not how smart you are, but how you are smart.\u201d", "author": "wallnutea", "created": 1630969302, "upvotes": 2}, "hbutggm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pj6ax7/my_boyfriend_and_i_regret_going_to_college/hbutggm/", "text": "college is not for everyone, and you and ur boyfriends story has proved this. unfortunately, high school students everywhere are pushed into it when they arent ready/dont want to which leads to wasted time and in some cases really, really bad outcomes. \n\ncongratulations on ur success! u deserve it. never tell anyone what u shld do, only you know what u need <3", "author": "gguerr07", "created": 1630963624, "upvotes": 9}}}
