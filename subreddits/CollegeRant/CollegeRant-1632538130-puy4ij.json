I think they can be great if someone needs clarification on a concept or the instructions for an assignment or just to vent about how awful the prof is. However. 80% of the questions people ask are very explicitly answered in the syllabus. Probably 15% of them are answered in some kind of announcement in writing on the LMS. Y'all. What makes you think some random student knows what percent of our grade an exam is without having looked at the syllabus? or what date the final is? I generally don't answer those questions because I know I'll struggle to do so without snarkily saying \"according to the syllabus...\" and it usually takes another student 10min-several hours to respond, so why wait several hours when you can just log in to the LMS? I really struggle to believe it takes fewer key strokes to type the question into a group chat than type the LMS website name anyway.", "author": "giraffarigboo", "created": 1632538130, "retrieved": 1632840984, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"he6a3vh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/puy4ij/check_the_syllabus_before_asking_the_class_gc/he6a3vh/", "text": "Thank you u/giraffarigboo for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
