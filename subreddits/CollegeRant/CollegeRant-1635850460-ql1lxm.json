Stop requiring freshmen to live and eat on campus. You even have to pay just to graduate (registering to graduate, not just the cap and gown).\n\nThe huge availability of loans incentivizes colleges to charge as much as they want because they know it'll always be paid for by the government or loan agency. Colleges don't have to worry about whether or not the student can pay the loans back because they've already gotten paid. We should move towards taking out fewer loans and paying for college in cash and scholarships/grants. Literally just a few decades ago, most people could go to college and even with just a part-time job, they could pay for it. Nowadays it's still doable, but you'll need a full time job.\n\nOn a semi-related point: if colleges require internships to graduate, they should all be paid. Unpaid internships are exploitive and diminish your own value as a worker.",

Internships are still jobs, the difference is that they're typically shorter term and to fulfill your resume and/or your education requirements. I know people within my major (mechanical engineering) who went to a relatively affordable school and were able to pay for a lot of school with their internships. It's something that not enough people take advantage of imo.",

Too many students are in school not knowing their potential because school makes things like  getting a degree, a good grade, or material things our purpose as students. We are going through the default path they created without the encouragement to create well defined goal. We are left not knowing what is good for our futures and lost about who we are. \n\n I want schools to stop teaching such useless things especially in middle and high school, and focus on developing skills that we can use in the real world. We should be learning about our abilities as individuals and how we can use those towards our own purpose in life. Of course we touch on this in school but it's just not discussed enough.",

      "text": "Allowing all units to have online classes. \n\nI'm in Australia and my uni doesn't have an option for every unit to be done online. There's 2 main reasons why it sucks:\n\n1) many students haven't been able to come into the country and then my uni was forced to do an online restricted version for them in semester 2. This could have been easier if there was already an online version.\n\n2) I deal with chronic pain, don't drive, and it takes 1hr 10 mins to get to campus 1 way. I know that walking 800m causes me to be in bed for a few days, so getting onto campus would mean I need to spend the rest of my time in bed to alleviate pain. Online classes allow for me to not be in as much pain and be able to sit at my desk + have an easier time completing assignments\n\nETA: forgot to mention that a lot of units don't state having an online class option so I usually have to choose from ones that state online option or enroll, see if there's an online option, and change units if there isn't an online option to enroll in",
