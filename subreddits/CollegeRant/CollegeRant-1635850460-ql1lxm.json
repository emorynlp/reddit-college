Stop requiring freshmen to live and eat on campus. You even have to pay just to graduate (registering to graduate, not just the cap and gown).\n\nThe huge availability of loans incentivizes colleges to charge as much as they want because they know it'll always be paid for by the government or loan agency. Colleges don't have to worry about whether or not the student can pay the loans back because they've already gotten paid. We should move towards taking out fewer loans and paying for college in cash and scholarships/grants. Literally just a few decades ago, most people could go to college and even with just a part-time job, they could pay for it. Nowadays it's still doable, but you'll need a full time job.\n\nOn a semi-related point: if colleges require internships to graduate, they should all be paid. Unpaid internships are exploitive and diminish your own value as a worker.",

Also, the host city in crowded area (again, like Berkeley), probably wants to reduce traffic caused by the presence of the university for the benefit of the city residents.\n\nin short, they do it for the same reason we have a \"carbon\" tax: to put a price on the negative externalities.",

And at that point it would be more cost-effective to just direct that money towards financial aid.\n\nSo yes, it is more cost-effective to let rich kids drive and park on campus.\n\nAt many schools with scarce parking they explicitly reserve student parking for commuter students that live outside some boundary, so the rich kids, who will all live in a dorm or apartment very close to campus, will not be allowed to have a parking permit.",

And, since my parents were paying, I wanted to be able to use my \"free college\" time on a subject/path i did want to pursue wisely. Parents had none of it and massively pressured me to go straight to college.\n\nOverall has been an unpleasant experience. Not fun lighting 4 student-loan-debt-free years of university on fire, knowing what it's gonna take to pay off what will be double or triple what I will end up taking out for loans. I really wish i had that breather.",
