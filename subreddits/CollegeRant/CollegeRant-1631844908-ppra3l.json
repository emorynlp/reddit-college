I love making study flashcards on Memrise, then they\u2019re always available on my phone for car rides or lines or whatever. I just made one with some problem approach tips for my math class because I keep ending up staring blankly at problems because I can\u2019t remember how to start. But I go to tutoring and chip away. First test in this class coming up and I am thinking I have a shot at a passing grade. A HUGE deal for me in algebra. Def feel better than when I used to cram it al into a couple days", "author": "AppleTreeBloom", "created": 1631957656, "upvotes": 2}, "hdars9x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppra3l/cried_in_class_today/hdars9x/", "text": "I have been studying biology for 9 years and a lot of times still don't know what I'm doing. It's ok to be lost and frustrated sometimes, no one knows all of the answers. Being a STEM major is hard and you will inevitably encounter classes/assignments/exams that kick your butt. How you respond to taking an L is what is most important though. Regroup and figure out what you need. Do you need to meet with your professor and ask questions? Do you need to try new ways to study? Are you taking good notes? When I was an undergrad, in my first few years one thing that was a game changer for me was talking to people in my classes and finding a group of students in my major that had to take all of the same classes as me. We formed study groups. We commiserated together. We helped each other out.\n\nBut the moral of the story is that I got a 59% on my first exam in college in a required chemistry course, but now I'm a PhD candidate in biology. It's ok to screw up and not know what's going on as long as you self evaluate and figure out what you need to succeed going forward.
