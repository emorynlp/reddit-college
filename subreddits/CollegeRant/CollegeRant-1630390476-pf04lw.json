It\u2019s insane to me that I\u2019m paying 60-80 dollars to do my homework. Like I don\u2019t even use the books because the professors don\u2019t even use it. I\u2019m soooo done with these online homework platforms taking more money from my broke ass. Sick of this bs.",

As a student now, I'm so thankful for the easy, electronic homework available.",

      "text": "It is a travesty.  Pearson is a good company, with a lot of good people and you're going to be seeing more of them and their peers in the future, not less.  To my mind, though, the problem isn't Pearson or even the $300 in digital subscriptions you'll need to buy each semester to 'complete' your courses.  The problem is that college is a business which is indifferent to you or your finances so long as you keep signing over those student loan checks.  It's cheaper for universities to hire unremarkable adjuncts for minimum wage to babysit students who pay tuition and then pay Pearson a fee for the privilege of teaching and grading their work, rather than simply hiring professional educators to teach you properly.  Adjuncts are cheap labor; professors cost money.  Pearson is like a TV that Universities insist adjuncts use to watch the kids while the adults are away -- it's cheap and it keeps you clicking so you don't have time to think about more important things like where your tuition dollars are really going.  Also, I believe that most universities get kickbacks -- $$$ to dept. chairs, etc. -- to use their products.  If you really want to throw a fit, forget about the $300 you're forking over to Pearson -- see what % of your tuition is spent on your education every semester.  I guarantee it's less than 1/2.   That's the real travesty.",

      "text": "You could have paid the same 300 for a printed book to do problems from the back on paper. The price wouldn't change. The publishers are clever. Online HWs are more convenient for students because they can check their work, receive feedback on all problems after the due date, work the HW again, etc.\n\nThat you do not need to reference the book for anything else and that you do not read it ahead of class is alarming by itself.",

      "text": "I offer my students the bundle because it's around $100 cheaper than just the textbook or just the code.  \n\nThe online homework platforms are a must when you have 400 students in a class and some are taking the course remote.  Also, we are required to have the resources available in the bookstore for those that have grants, scholarships, etc.  \n\nOur university is switching LMS platforms, so this will allow us to use textbooks that are free to the students.  It's just going to take a year or two to get there.  \n\nMy classes that don't use online homework I always tell my students \"I forbid you from googling the textbook with .pdf becuase you may find the textbook free and that would be ethcially wrong, instead you must buy the textbook at a gross mark-up in the book store\"  \n\nBookstore manager emails me: we never sell many of your textbooks.....",
