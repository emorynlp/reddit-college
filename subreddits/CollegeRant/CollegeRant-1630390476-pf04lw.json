Pearson is a good company, with a lot of good people and you're going to be seeing more of them and their peers in the future, not less.  To my mind, though, the problem isn't Pearson or even the $300 in digital subscriptions you'll need to buy each semester to 'complete' your courses.  The problem is that college is a business which is indifferent to you or your finances so long as you keep signing over those student loan checks.  It's cheaper for universities to hire unremarkable adjuncts for minimum wage to babysit students who pay tuition and then pay Pearson a fee for the privilege of teaching and grading their work, rather than simply hiring professional educators to teach you properly.  Adjuncts are cheap labor; professors cost money.  Pearson is like a TV that Universities insist adjuncts use to watch the kids while the adults are away -- it's cheap and it keeps you clicking so you don't have time to think about more important things like where your tuition dollars are really going.  Also, I believe that most universities get kickbacks -- $$$ to dept. chairs, etc. -- to use their products.  If you really want to throw a fit, forget about the $300 you're forking over to Pearson -- see what % of your tuition is spent on your education every semester.  I guarantee it's less than 1/2.   That's the real travesty.", "author": "uncl3bob", "created": 1630436159, "upvotes": 4}, "hb3adey": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pf04lw/i_have_to_spend_300_fucking_dollars_to_do_my/hb3adey/", "text": "You could have paid the same 300 for a printed book to do problems from the back on paper.
