  "text": "I\u2019m 30 years old and decided to go back to school for Web Programming and Development. I take night/online classes full time while also working full time. In addition I have 2 kids and decided buying a house on top of everything would be a good idea. I\u2019m overwhelmed a bit. I feel like I\u2019m constantly obsessing over homework and if I\u2019m going to get it done by the due dates. My actual course classes are great but I had to take a Small Business Management class and it\u2019s going to be the death of me. So many assignments and I feel like the professor purposely tries to find ways to dock points over very small things. They won\u2019t fully explain an assignment and then dock you if you didn\u2019t meet their unsaid expectations. They put a question on a quiz that had to do with face to face interaction but we\u2019ve never meet in class or talked over zoom or anything honestly. He later took the question off due to never having said what the question was about.  I\u2019m just ready for the semester to be over already and I\u2019m only 3 weeks in. \ud83e\udd7a",
