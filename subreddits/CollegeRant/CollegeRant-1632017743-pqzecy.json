It seems as if everyone else already has a group of friends even though we\u2019re all new. Maybe they know people from before, or maybe they became instant friends in move-in day. It is really weird for me right now. I just wonder why is it so hard for me to make friends even though I\u2019m a good person? I try really hard but at the end I have no close friends. How is everyone else making friends and I can\u2019t? What am I doing wrong? I feel sad all the time and have no friends. I try to make conversation with other students, but presently I sit alone at the cafeteria and do everything else alone too. I feel like crying every few minutes, I miss my family so much, and I feel very scared and anxious. I know it sounds pathetic but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Do you guys have any tips? \ud83d\ude41", "author": "Michelinda11", "created": 1632017743, "retrieved": 1632841010, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdeug4r": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqzecy/making_friends/hdeug4r/", "text": "Thank you u/Michelinda11 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm a senior now and missed out on making new friends last year because of covid and now people just seem so done with college. All my classmates are about to graduate and they already have their own friend groups and rlly I'm just that one guy from class that people vaguely know. \n\nI also wonder if it's just me, maybe I'm not even trying? Maybe I'm trying too hard? My point is saying this, though, is that you're not alone. My tips are try to be optimistic and have an open mind. Be open to try talking to other people out of the blue, you're a freshman you've legit got 4 more years of this stuff to try and find your group. These things won't happen right away though. It takes a bit of time, but keep your head up.

I remember back when I was in 7th grade, I got separated with my bestfriend and all of my classmates from 6th grade. I was admitted to the star section because of my grades but my friend and my former classmates weren\u2019t. I felt so alone, I had no one to talk to and I don\u2019t know how to start a conversation with a complete stranger because it was my first time being in a class full of strangers since I know all of the students in my previous school. On the other hand, almost all of my classmates in 7th grade already made friends and most of them are friends already from their previous school. Don\u2019t think too much about it. I believe it happens to every student at least once especially if u are in a different location. I transferred to a different school before which was way far from our province so I can totally relate. School has just started, u don\u2019t have to worry about being left out. Just try to start talking to them even though it\u2019s little and all about schools and respond when a classmate ask a question.", "author": "Imsobrokekillmenow", "created": 1632066255, "upvotes": 2}, "hdfhary": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqzecy/making_friends/hdfhary/", "text": "Hey I\u2019m kind of going through the same thing right now, except for the making friends part because I\u2019m pretty introverted (I know that was your main topic). Tbh I would try to join some sort of club or something and if all else fails just try to sort of force yourself into someone else\u2019s conversation and see where it takes you. I can definitely relate to missing your family and stuff though. I literally moved in like 5 hrs ago and I already feel like I can\u2019t live without them. I also didn\u2019t think I was going to cry when I said goodbye but I guess I instinctively did so. I think our main problem with moving in is just that there are waaaaay too many lifestyle choices that were changed instantly and it\u2019s hard for us to keep up. My best advice is to just wait everything out and take it slow. Making friends doesn\u2019t need to happen over night, you can develop relationships over time.", "author": "e-g-g-g", "created": 1632029448, "upvotes": 2}}}
