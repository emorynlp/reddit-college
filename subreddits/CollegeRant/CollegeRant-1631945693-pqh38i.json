Let me tell ya, YES THERE IS. Week 3 just finished and we are going into week 4 at my school. I\u2019m in 5 classes this semester and I\u2019m in GroupMe\u2019s for all of them just in case I miss something in class or need clarification or something. Anyway, it\u2019s like everyone in all my group chats are just dumb. They will literally ask the same question over and over and over. Like if you just took 2 seconds to scroll up you\u2019d see that someone answered that question already. Like they keep asking where to find the textbook when the prof literally explained it on the first day, he put it in the syllabus, and multiple people have already answered in the chat that u can get it from the publisher or Amazon. In another class they keep asking how we turn in our hw cuz we have to use a 3rd party site and once again the teacher said it on the first day and multiple students said how in the chat yet it\u2019s week 4 and ppl are still asking. Or in another class ppl keep asking what is due today when our prof literally put a list of all the assignments and due dates on the canvas home page. It\u2019s like bro if you literally just take 3 seconds to look at canvas or the syllabus or past messages in the chat you\u2019d see that tjis question has been answered a dozen times already holy shit. And on top of asking the same basic questions a million times literally everyone complains about every little thing. They complain about the reading or about how many assignments/ homework problems. THIS IS COLLEGE, YOURE GNA HAVE A LOT OF ASSIGNMENTS. Ya it sucks when you have multiple deadlines at once but it\u2019s college we gotta deal w it. All that time you spent talking in the gc for 30 minutes about how you don\u2019t wanna do the assignment you could\u2019ve already had it done. And don\u2019t get me wrong I complain about having a lot of work too. But they are literally complaining like oh there\u2019s too many questions can someone give me all the answers. Or this is too hard can someone give me all the answers when literally on the hw app if you\u2019re stuck on a problem and click the textbook it\u2019ll take you to the exact section the question is talking about and highlight the answer for you. Like it doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. And most of these assignments are open book and open note so they\u2019re really not that hard these ppl just wanna find something to complain about. Moral of the story don\u2019t ask a question that has been asked 50 times and don\u2019t get mad when professors assign work. It\u2019s college. It\u2019s their job to assign work.", "author": "Rosedawson19", "created": 1631945693, "retrieved": 1632948490, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
