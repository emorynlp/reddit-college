I understand if they have a couple hundred students and an essay to grade for each of them, that would be understandable to me, but I've been waiting since week 2 for a professor to grade a single discussion board for one class.  I have to get everything posted before the deadline or risk losing points, but these professors can take their sweet ass time letting me know how I'm actually doing in their class.  I'm blind as to how I'm doing and I'm sick of putting up with their excuses, you can take an afternoon to just check if I did an assignment that took 15 minutes.  It's gotten to the point where they're going to pile up if you don't do something, and I'm sick of hearing how that's just the way it is when I KNOW they can do better.", "author": "SynthExe", "created": 1632613874, "retrieved": 1632840983, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hea6jdm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pvidqa/grade_your_god_damn_assignments/hea6jdm/", "text": "Thank you u/SynthExe for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
