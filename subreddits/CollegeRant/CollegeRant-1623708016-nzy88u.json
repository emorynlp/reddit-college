  "text": "I\u2019m a criminal justice major. I chose this major because it\u2019s easy and leads to the job I want. I\u2019m a senior and for most of my college career, I was able to scrape by taking classes taught by easy-mediocre level teachers. I\u2019m graduating in December and for one of the classes required for my major, it\u2019s only taught by one professor. That professor is hard as hell and is known for failing students. He\u2019s pretty much the professor every student in the department hates. He\u2019s probably going to be the roadblock that is going to prevent me from graduating this year. I despise him already. If he wants to make the coursework this challenging, he is in the wrong department. For the past 4 years, I have been trying to avoid taking a class taught by him but now, I have no way of avoiding him.",

But at the same time, criminal justice *shouldn\u2019t* be an easy major as people with that major are the ones protecting the law. Making those degree programs easy to get through is what promotes police brutality and similar issues. \n\nLike I said though I believe just about every student who says their professor sucks, cause there are a lot of them. You got this!! Just be grateful this is the only difficult class in your program and good luck!",

Sure, lack of consequences is also a huge factor, but it\u2019s a well known fact that the educational requirements for police officers are insufficient. Lack of education and training of police = poor policing\n\nAlso, I take that good luck back",
