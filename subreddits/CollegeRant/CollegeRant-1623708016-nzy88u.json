I chose this major because it\u2019s easy and leads to the job I want. I\u2019m a senior and for most of my college career, I was able to scrape by taking classes taught by easy-mediocre level teachers. I\u2019m graduating in December and for one of the classes required for my major, it\u2019s only taught by one professor. That professor is hard as hell and is known for failing students. He\u2019s pretty much the professor every student in the department hates. He\u2019s probably going to be the roadblock that is going to prevent me from graduating this year. I despise him already. If he wants to make the coursework this challenging, he is in the wrong department. For the past 4 years, I have been trying to avoid taking a class taught by him but now, I have no way of avoiding him.", "author": "thereis_hope_", "created": 1623708016, "retrieved": 1632949704, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "comments": {"h1sq5hn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nzy88u/hard_professors_in_easy_majors_piss_me_off/h1sq5hn/", "text": "God forbid you have a professor that challenges your intellect and makes you.......work. \ud83d\ude44 You sound entitled, and are going to be your own roadblock with that attitude.
