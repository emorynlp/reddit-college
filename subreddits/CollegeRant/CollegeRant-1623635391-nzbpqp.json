  "text": "I\u2019m doing a summer course and I accidentally signed up for 2 6-week summer courses, both science based with labs. I can only blame myself for that and while I\u2019m in my last week, my grades are actually pretty good. However, my professors decided that during the last week we should have: three exams, all over 4+ chapters, 3 labs, two lab reports and a homework assignment that\u2019s over 20 questions. \n\nI\u2019m very unsure as to why they think this is a good idea and then have the nerve to email students saying that we\u2019re behind? Uh, yeah! It\u2019s a six week course! I spend anywhere between 4-8 hours on my computer a day (including weekends) to stay caught up on top of my job and they somehow think this makes sense???\n\nEdit: correction. We have 4 LABS due this week and 3 LAB REPORTS",

Yes, it'll be a lot of work, because you need to pack it into a shortened time frame. And yes, it'll be compacted more near the end, because that's the way assessments work; you can't have cumulative assessments before you teach the material. \n\n4-8 hours of homework a day is perfectly reasonable for 2 summer courses. In a typical undergraduate course, you're expected to spend 2 - 3 hours of time studying and working on assignments for each hour of class; a usual semester that's spread out a lot more, but that'd be in the ballpark of 125 - 175 hours per course. \n\nSummer courses aren't any less rigorous than courses in the usual semester, they're just condensed. You're going to be spending the same amount of total time, it'll just not be spread out as much. \n\nMoral of the story: don't take two 6 week courses at the same time as working.",
