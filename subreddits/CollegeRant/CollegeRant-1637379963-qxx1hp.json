  "text": "Hi everyone. I (19m) am currently in my freshman year at a local community college.  It has been about 2 1/2 months and my grades are alright I guess.  I\u2019m getting assignments done on time and doing well on essays, exams, etc.  But almost every day that I drive back home from classes, I always wonder \u201cWhat the hell am I doing here?\u201d \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I have no one to talk to at my college, or that the class I\u2019m taking for my major (Computer programming) completely drains me mentally.  I also happened to find out that my current degree doesn\u2019t really let me transfer to 4-year schools after I graduate, which I somehow didn\u2019t know beforehand.  Now I basically have to switch majors but I just feel like nothing interests me. \n\nThroughout middle school & high school, I always loathed talking about college because it was something I never really wanted.  I was told by my dad through my childhood that I had to go to college or else I\u2019d have to enlist in the military.  I guess I\u2019m just tired of a school environment.  I don\u2019t know why some people think that college is necessary, because it\u2019s not.  \n\nMaybe I feel this way because I just go to my classes and don\u2019t talk to anyone.  I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t really a rant but I feel really lost with life and that I\u2019m always under pressure from the people around me.  And if anyone has actually read this far, I really appreciate it :)",

My dad pushes me and my sisters to go to college but I feel like it's not for me. I would rather do sum art sculpture ( like for the holidays and etc) but my dad wouldn't let me.",
