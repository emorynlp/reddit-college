I\u2019m thinking about changing my major from oceanography to kinesiology or nutrition but my university does not have those programs. Also my parents wouldn\u2019t be supportive because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good career and I flew to Hawaii just to study here. Idk what to do now. Biology is not my subject. Help please.", "author": "AffectionateDoctor93", "created": 1630866838, "retrieved": 1632948932, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hbuy261": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/piijiv/thinking_about_changing_majors/hbuy261/", "text": "Talk to your advisor. Is there a school in mind you would want to transfer to that has these programs? I switched my major legitimately 6 times my freshman year. You don\u2019t actually have to decide today. But your advisor can help you sign up for the appropriate gen eds for your new goal and inform you about what you need to do to transfer when the time comes.\n\nMaybe your advisor can help navigate the pros and cons of each major and career statistics that can help you navigate a conversation with your parents.", "author": "shoelaceys7373", "created": 1630965754, "upvotes": 2}}}
