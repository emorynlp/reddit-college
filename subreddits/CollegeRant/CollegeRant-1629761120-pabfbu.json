It was my first day today and it was packed with people, lines with 50 plus people for food and student ID. I commute and the only parking lot was a 30 min walk from my 1st class and it\u2019s about 95 degrees outside. I could have taken a shuttle but I was already late. I took the shuttle back to my car and took forever. Just the hoards of people, pointless classes I could care less about makes me realize how much I hate college and don\u2019t even want to be here. I regret not doing online, I don\u2019t mind online as much. Now it\u2019s too late and I have to suffer through commuting like this everyday until December. Im just so sad and upset and frustrated and I can\u2019t get over the fact im doing it to myself. My parents would disown me if I didn\u2019t finish school so I really feel like I have no choice. Im just so sad rn. Thanks for listening. \n\nTL;DR\nI transferred from a small private school to a huge state school and I don\u2019t even want to be in college in the 1st place.", "author": "sadgirlxxx00", "created": 1629761120, "retrieved": 1632950893, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ha88im5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pabfbu/21f_just_transferred_to_big_university_and_i/ha88im5/", "text": "My fucking commute is just like that.

Are you studying something your parents want you to study that you have no interest in? What are your career goals and what other educational or work path could you take to get there?\n\nI went to both A&M and UT and felt so lonely at A&M because it was my first college experience, I lived off campus, and my classes were so huge I didn't get to know anyone. Just the parking situation and 30 minute walks to class was soul sucking, and I can't imagine how I would feel doing it now in the middle of the pandemic. I transferred after a semester to a smaller school, where I lived in the dorms and later within walking distance of campus, and there I found a good solid friend group when I joined an organization and then another friend group because I worked on campus at one of the colleges and met a ton of people that way.

You could always transfer to a smaller school. But you say you dont want to be in college at all... forget about your parents for a sec, whats your plan? You dont have to go to college but you should have some idea of the career path you want to take. Huge colleges arent for everyone and a small school would eliminate all the annoyances you faced today. Would changing your major help?", "author": "taybay462", "created": 1629767344, "upvotes": 28}}}
