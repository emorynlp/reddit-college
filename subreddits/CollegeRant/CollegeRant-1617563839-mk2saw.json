  "text": "I just don't understand why professors do this and then take off points without elaborating. It costs nothing to, you know, actually elaborate on what you're fucking asking for instead of leading us on some Scooby Doo mystery to read your mind and find out what you want. Deciphering this bullshit has genuinely taken more time than the actual assignment.",

My professor took 15 points off because I submitted my midterm in a zip file and I guess that's harder for them to access with Blackboard, but this was never specified, and the whole point of the midterm was to upload the file containing all of our drafts of our essays to note progression and editing...am I seriously supposed to individually upload over 25 files? A zip is the most practical way to do this. Then they never responded when I asked them about the preferred submission. Wtf.",
