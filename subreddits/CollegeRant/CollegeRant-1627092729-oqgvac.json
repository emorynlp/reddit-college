Per context, I'll be transferring from a cc to a state uni this fall as a sophmore. My parents are funding my education, and I feel like im going to be wasting their money. The only reason im going is to get out of the house (my last cc has only a couple in person options for the fall, and there were a lot of conflicts w driving and all). However, i feel that this choice is only based off emotion and it would be wrong for me to go to uni just to get out of house. \n\nTLDR: I feel guilty about transferring to a uni bc of the cost and my only wanting to go to get out of the house", "author": "acleb524", "created": 1627092729, "retrieved": 1632949211, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h6fd5t5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oqgvac/unjustified_guilt/h6fd5t5/", "text": "Perhaps your parents are glad to pay in order to get you out of their house too.
