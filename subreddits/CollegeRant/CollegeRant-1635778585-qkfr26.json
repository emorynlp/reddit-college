  "text": "First I bombed a midterm even though I made over 300 flash cards to study. Next I missed a midterm because I got the time wrong.\n\nThe midterm I\u2019m not too broken about because the whole class bombed it and honestly reflects on the professor. But I\u2019m mad I missed a midterm. I lost a lot of points that I could have easily gotten. I even sent the professor and email apologizing obviously not expecting a make up.\n\nJust feel like this semester spinning out of control. I ended up spending the weekend in my room just sleeping.",
