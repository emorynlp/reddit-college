Im honestly tired of this life", "text": "\nSorry I just had to rant somewhere obviously this post will get ignored\n\nForgot about a damn online quiz just made me realize how tired I am of this life\n\nI still work cause I\u2019m an essential worker. I work the whole day and I don\u2019t get paid because it\u2019s a family job so 8-9 hours. I got so focused on finishing an assignment from one professor that I legitimately forgot about a quiz in another class. Furthermore I got caught up with the endless amount of tasks at work as well.\n\nShe obviously doesn\u2019t send out reminders (and I know that\u2019s not her job just mentioning the fact) and so I completely forgot. The quiz isn\u2019t 100 points or anything absurd but it\u2019s still a 0/5 points... and even if I manage a perfect score on everything else.. it\u2019s gonna lower my average for that section to a B. Furthermore, the only other grades are exam grades lol.\n\nI seriously am tired of this life I mean I work all day in the midst of this pandemic and I can\u2019t even catch a fucking break! If I even email her about this, I\u2019ll probably get some lame ass statement about how it\u2019s my fault (which is true so it\u2019s on me) and honestly I don\u2019t need to look like an even bigger idiot.\n\nRight now my grade is at an F lmfao.. nice way to get screwed early on", "author": null, "created": 1587195204, "retrieved": 1632950958, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"folw3ph": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/g3jmtm/forgot_about_an_online_quiz_im_honestly_tired_of/folw3ph/", "text": "Just did the same thing for the same reason... my exam was 70 points", "author": "virtualmartyr", "created": 1587871884, "upvotes": 1}, "fntz4jt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/g3jmtm/forgot_about_an_online_quiz_im_honestly_tired_of/fntz4jt/", "text": "I feel you.
