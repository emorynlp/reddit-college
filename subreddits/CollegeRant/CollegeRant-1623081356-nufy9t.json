At my college this past year, I earned a 4.0 first semester and it appeared that I was on track to do the same second semester. Then, I learned that, according to my Spanish professor, I would have to earn a 97% in the class to receive a 4.0 in the class (yet a 90-97% was all equivalent to a 3.7...). This feels like an impossible standard, as I was achieving some of the highest grades in the class throughout the semester and still only received a 94% at the end (which based on most scales would be a 4.0!!). I understand one A- is not going to mess up my GPA forever, but it is extremely frustrating to put so much effort in and know that no matter what I did, I would not be able to achieve an A -- nobody I know has ever made an A with that professor. How can she get away with this?!! That's all, thanks for coming to my rant...", "author": "gwu__throwaway", "created": 1623081356, "retrieved": 1632842264, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h0x6rk0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nufy9t/since_when_is_a_97_an_a/h0x6rk0/", "text": "Thank you u/gwu__throwaway for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
