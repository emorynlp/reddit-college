  "title:": "Since when is a 97 an A?!",
  "text": "I kind of just need to rant, y'all. At my college this past year, I earned a 4.0 first semester and it appeared that I was on track to do the same second semester. Then, I learned that, according to my Spanish professor, I would have to earn a 97% in the class to receive a 4.0 in the class (yet a 90-97% was all equivalent to a 3.7...). This feels like an impossible standard, as I was achieving some of the highest grades in the class throughout the semester and still only received a 94% at the end (which based on most scales would be a 4.0!!). I understand one A- is not going to mess up my GPA forever, but it is extremely frustrating to put so much effort in and know that no matter what I did, I would not be able to achieve an A -- nobody I know has ever made an A with that professor. How can she get away with this?!! That's all, thanks for coming to my rant...",
