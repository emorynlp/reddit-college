The grading is gonna be in a few days with me present and I just want to tell the professor to give me the default point and move on, but I think it's too late now. I also had a lot of personal problems and nothing seems to work out, so yeah... it sucks. I'm sorry it happened to you, it's heartbreaking and I understand how you feel, you're not alone. I'm trying to make myself feel better by saying that there have to be both ups and downs, and I'm going through a giant down rn. Maybe it's for the best and it's a clear sign that I might not have understood the subject as well as I thought I did, so it's gonna be better if I study for it again next time and understand all the concepts.", "author": "Some_Random-Name01", "created": 1625695897, "upvotes": 37}}}
