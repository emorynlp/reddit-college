  "title:": "\"Failed\" online quiz, professor won't correct grade",
  "text": "I took a quiz online, basic dosage/metric stuff, pretty easy. I put down my answers as 0.5 mL, 103.7 f, 36.8 kg, etc. \n\nthe \"correct\" answers were 0.5, 103.7, 36.8, etc. I thought, no big deal, the teacher will go back and fix anyone who did that. After emailing her, she said our grade is what we get and she won't be fixing quizzes. There is nothing in her syllabus on using units or not using units. \n\nShe drops our 2 lowest quizzes, so I could just say fuck it. But I think it's bullshit to being penalized for using units. Should I take this further to the head and to the dean? Or should I just realize she's a bitch and let it slide?\n\ntl;dr, got my answers \"right\" but labeled with units and thereby got them \"wrong.\"",

From my perspective, it looks like she just doesn\u2019t want to change it because she either doesn\u2019t care or because you didn\u2019t put it in the way she wanted you to. \n\nIf I was your professor, I would honestly be happy that you not only did the work and put the actually units, but that you did in fact get it right.",
