COVID shut down most of our library so there\u2019s two rooms. One, the normal study area where people can talk in and the two, the quiet room where people use the school computers to take exams.\n\nFor whatever reason my school had the bright idea to send tours through this room and have them stop for 3-5 minutes and loudly talk about how this is, \u201cthe quiet area where many people who don\u2019t have computers at home can take exams.\u201d Seriously? I get that the tours are scripted, but how can you say this and not realize that you\u2019re disturbing a room of 30 people trying to pass their midterms?\n\nI probably failed my midterm because I ran out of time waiting for them to leave fml\n\nEDIT: I contacted the library and my professor  and explained the issue to them. Hope things change. For clarification about 8-10 tour groups came through the room and there was no warning whatsoever that it was going to happen.", "author": "Substantial-Method93", "created": 1615919028, "retrieved": 1632950247, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 276, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gr7ilrm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m6fos1/why_are_there_tour_groups_going_through_rooms/gr7ilrm/", "text": "I would\u2019ve got up and said get out.

However, that was very disrespectful of your college's tour guides to do that. They could've maybe only showed the entrance to the study area instead of going inside and bothering students. I would speak with your professor to tell him/her to give you an extension in your exam and maybe talk to the ppl in charge of those tours like a dean or something.
