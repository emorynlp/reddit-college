  "text": "I like my room. Sometimes I enjoy being by myself, and far away from social events. I spent my final years of high school chasing thrills and nearly got expelled for doing dumb shit.\n\nI like going to parties, don\u2019t get me wrong, but whenever there\u2019s a large crowd with alcohol and other drugs involved, something stupid will bound to happen. And I\u2019m not about that life. \n\nBut my friends and roommates won\u2019t leave me be for this. They like to tease me about staying away from wild social gatherings and that I will not have any \u201ccollege experience\u201d if I keep up with this, and end up regretting it for the rest of my life. \n\nI like seeing good results from working hard for a class, I like getting drunk with close friends in a less crowded setting or go on walks by myself. I don\u2019t need to go do loud ass parties and blacking out only to wake up on a stranger\u2019s sofa to have a decent college experience.",

      "text": "I\u2019m super introverted and shy, but I\u2019m happy with the life I have now *especially* since my roommates are extremely loud and party a lot. They have no personalities outside of blacking out and bitching about everything. They keep bragging about how fucked up they got at the club/big house parties/EDC/etc (they\u2019re also horrible roommates too since blacking out at parties is literally all they care about \u2014 actively not cleaning up after themselves, being super loud and throwing parties well into 3 am when they know I\u2019m introverted and I hate noise, etc. don\u2019t do random roommates kids) I really don\u2019t see the fun in being in a super packed space, roofies, and lots of sweaty college kids making bad decisions. \n\nSmall hangouts with friends at bars/at home are a lot more fun than giant parties and clubbing tbh. You\u2019re surrounded by people you actually like being around plus it\u2019s less risky since there likely will not be anyone that will roofie drinks (especially if your around close friends you really trust).",
