  "text": "FUCK I am so mad at myself I WISH I HAD TALKED TO PEOPLE AND MANUALLY SELECTED A ROOMMATE INSTEAD OF GETTING A RANDOM ONE. I\u2019m not a mean person I swear but this girl gets on my nerves. We\u2019re freshman in college and she acts like a middle schooler. We were going on a hike with my entire hall last night and she starts shining this unnecessarily bright ass flashlight in people\u2019s eyes because she thought it was funny?? And of course people got mad. A couple nights ago I was playing a game with cards with my suite-mate and my roommate joins and starts fucking spreading the cards around the entire room and literally wrestling with her?? How old are you again??\n\nI know it could be worse. It could much worse. I\u2019m trying to be nice and open minded but she is actually embarrassing to be around(obviously I\u2019m being nice and would never say this to her face). I sort of envisioned having a roommate that was my friend and was to be my \u201cgate into a social life\u201d in college if that makes sense? I have bad social anxiety and having somebody with me to go to events with and talk to other people with is something I wanted. But I was too scared to reach out to people online and figure out a roommate that way and now I\u2019m hitting myself because I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to do anything with her because she clearly doesn\u2019t know how to act and it\u2019s embarrassing as fuck but I\u2019m anxious to put myself out there and talk to other people alone. I know I\u2019m going to have to and I\u2019m going to try but I\u2019m mad because I made it unnecessarily hard for myself. \n\nIt sucks because it\u2019s not bad enough to switch roommates it\u2019s just annoying and I wish I could go back and start this  process over. I hope I\u2019m not being the asshole here.\n\nTLDR: My roommate is really annoying and has made getting involved socially in college harder.",

      "text": "Honestly, you should really talk to her about this if you haven't already. You say you're too embarrassed to tell her how you feel about her behavior but she's never going to change the way she acts if she's unaware of how obnoxious it makes her look or how it affects other people and their opinions about her. Just casually sit down with her and ask her to tone it down a bit.\n\nSo many problems would be solved if people actually talked to each other about what's bothering them.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry about that but you\u2019re not being the asshole. At least you\u2019re trying and not just jumping to another room. I don\u2019t know what your dorm situation is like but I remember a lot of people walking around the hall when they were bored looking for someone to hang out with or talk to. So it might help to leave your door open if that\u2019s allowed. You can find an extrovert to help you meet other people and maybe you can hang out in their rooms instead of yours. My roommate and I weren\u2019t friends but we didn\u2019t have issues. Just neutral. We kinda tried to be friends but just not much in common. But I found other friends on my hall and they helped me meet other people.",
