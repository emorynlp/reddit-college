I feel like I\u2019ve lost a crucial part of myself when I started college. Everyone says science is one of the most creative programs, but so far I haven\u2019t experienced that. All I do is study and try to measure my worth around this \u2018all or nothing\u2019 framework that doesn\u2019t allow for creativity. Everything is so rigid and by the rules in all my classes and I don\u2019t see where the higher level thinking comes in if all college requires is memorizing and cramming as much information to regurgitate onto a test or to apply in a lab. \nWhat do you do when you have all this creativity in you just longing to be let out?", "author": "apollosrose", "created": 1582954373, "retrieved": 1632951490, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fj52goc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fb80fe/college_is_suppressing_my_creativity/fj52goc/", "text": "I'm majoring in graphic design and biology", "author": "gandreeva18", "created": 1583022621, "upvotes": 2}, "fj3zo6k": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fb80fe/college_is_suppressing_my_creativity/fj3zo6k/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1582996898, "upvotes": 2}, "fj3tn72": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fb80fe/college_is_suppressing_my_creativity/fj3tn72/", "text": "I\u2019ve sometimes felt this way too, but it\u2019s not because of science in itself; it\u2019s because of workload and mental exhaustion.
