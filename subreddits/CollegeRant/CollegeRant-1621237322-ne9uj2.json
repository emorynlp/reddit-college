It tried really hard during the first half. But during the second half, calculated the bare minimum grade I needed on each assignment to get at least a B-.

I figured a B- wouldn\u2019t trash my GPA too bad but would also help save my sanity. \n\nI\u2019m getting the final grades for my other classes this semester, and the two classes will be an A+ and the fourth is up in the air between a B+ and an A- by a fraction of a percent. This will annoy me if I get a B+, but for reasons other than my GPA (instructor was trash and changed assignments last minute, messes up grading constantly, can\u2019t remember what class she is even teaching....it\u2019s been rough).\n\nAnyways, my point being is that there are some classes that you try hard at and other classes where you set a cruise control and just do your best for the sake of your sanity.
