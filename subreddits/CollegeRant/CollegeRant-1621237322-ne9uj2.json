But normal people wake up tired and sluggish or wired and ineffective. Letting go of normal things that aren't good for you is the price of excellence.\"  \n\nThe best advice I've ever gotten is:\n\n**\"Do it for yourself\"** \n\nYou might feel like A's are a waste of time, but what you don't see is the way that you're becoming a more disciplined, self-motivated, and hard-working person over time. You're the best thing you can invest in and the skills you develop in school are what's going to get you to your full potential. Don't give up now, keep shooting for above and beyond, it can only benefit you in the long run. Think about the type of person you want to be.",

With that in mind, if you really care about your parents\u2019 validation, you should have an open conversation with them about how you wished they recognized your achievements more.",

I try in most classes, but there have been a few that I just lock up on and don\u2019t do the work with as much vigor. \n\nI took a French class this semester and I was very excited, however, my excitement waned when we received almost no resources (just the textbook and a website to sign up for a supplemental gaming resource), no feedback, and she never lectured once. It tried really hard during the first half. But during the second half, calculated the bare minimum grade I needed on each assignment to get at least a B-.  I literally ended the class with an 80.01%. I figured a B- wouldn\u2019t trash my GPA too bad but would also help save my sanity. \n\nI\u2019m getting the final grades for my other classes this semester, and the two classes will be an A+ and the fourth is up in the air between a B+ and an A- by a fraction of a percent. This will annoy me if I get a B+, but for reasons other than my GPA (instructor was trash and changed assignments last minute, messes up grading constantly, can\u2019t remember what class she is even teaching....it\u2019s been rough).\n\nAnyways, my point being is that there are some classes that you try hard at and other classes where you set a cruise control and just do your best for the sake of your sanity. Don\u2019t let yourself get too low of a grade, but actively work toward that minimum standard and try to learn the basics of the material as much as possible. You might one day regret not caring more about having set a standard for yourself and this can be helpful.",
