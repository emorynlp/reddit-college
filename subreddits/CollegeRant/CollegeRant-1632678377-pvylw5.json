My marks were good and I was your regular smart kid. Plus I have wanted to be a teacher since forever and there was no way around college. Now I'm 22 and will be done with my masters degree next year. Since the pandemic I left campus and moved in with my boyfriend full time which was actually a blessing.\n\nWhen I was 16 we moved and I didn't paint my new room because I was going away for college soon anyways. I decided against a horse because I was going away for college soon and I kept away from dating because you guessed it: I was going to move out for college anyways. \n\nI'm 22 now and am so incredibly jealous of the teen girls here who have horses and the girls my age who waited with college for a year, just worked part time and spent an awesome year with their horses, going to parties and having fun. I'm so jealous of the people who don't always plan 10 years ahead and just do things. I haven't sat on a horse in 4 years and gave up all hobbies I can't do anywhere. As a teen, I always lived in the future. Any decisions had to align with college. \n\nI'll have a good salary and it's only going to be another year but damn: I've never had a life. My parents always encouraged this and now they say I'm too determined and should have more fun. They wouldn't care if my studies took me a semester longer. Where was this attitude when I was 16? \ud83d\ude11\n\nSometimes I wish I would've stayed home. Salaries here for jobs that don't require college education aren't bad. I spent 4 years depriving myself of everything for my education. I could've stayed in a swim team and actually put in effort, have some fun and maybe compete a little. I could've got a horse and and have fun with friends at the stable. I live at home but I'm not really living. I just study, do my internships and go to work. I draw sometimes, go hiking but I can't do anything else. I can't get a horse because I still need to go abroad and I don't have enough money to pay for it anyways because I decided to take a low paying position that allows me to gain some experience instead of money. \n\nI will never get these four years back. I love teaching and can't wait to do it full time but sometimes I wish I had a 9 to 5 and could do whatever in my freetime. \n\nSome people wish they were the responsible, determined type but sometimes I wish I would have decided for stuff I actually wanted. I haven't had so much as a week to myself since 2017. I just hope it'll all be worth it and I can finally breath again in a year.", "author": "ClockLeft", "created": 1632678377, "retrieved": 1632840983, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"hede3oe": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pvylw5/i_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_life_sometimes/hede3oe/", "text": "Thank you u/ClockLeft for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
