Things have been weird with him since the very beginning as we're just polar opposites. We keep to ourselves and our common area is clean and our interactions have always been respectful and normal. Two weeks ago he approached me (with my girlfriend present) and stated that \"My brother is homeless as of recently and he has no place to stay so he's going to sleep out in the living room for two weeks\". He was not asking me, instead he was telling me in front of my girlfriend. I discussed it with him and stated I would not be comfortable with his brother living with us. Fast forward to today, and he gives me a short notice that his brother will be living in his room for the next two weeks, with absolutely no warning. I'm in the kitchen cooking food with my girlfriend and he's trying to talk to me about other things and referencing his brother and I dismiss him telling him I'm going to speak to him about it later. He drops the conversation and goes out. A little while passes by and his brother and him pass me in our hallway, and neither of them say anything. I am absolutely livid. I have already told him how I felt about this situation and he does this?\n\nOur apartment has a guest policy stating that nobody is allowed to spend more than 3 nights in a row, and for a total of 6 nights in a month. \n\nMy girlfriend drives down from her state and stays a few days with me. I've talked with my roommate before when I first moved in and he told me he had no issue with my girlfriend spending multiple nights with me. She's always with me, and we're never outside the room unless we're out making food or putting groceries away. We spend all of our time in my room or out of my apartment doing whatever. \n\nIf I'm to go to the leasing office, I'm afraid that I'll lose out on having my girlfriend stay with me every weekend and cause further turmoil with my roommate. If I do nothing, it is highly likely this two week stay is going to extend into a much longer time period. \n\nI need advice... can anyone help?", "author": "Ok-Quantity-9430", "created": 1632927005, "retrieved": 1632948361, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"heqymgr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxwyhj/roommate_moved_brother_in_without_my_ok/heqymgr/", "text": "That\u2019s extremely rude of him and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it, but if it puts you in a position where you can\u2019t have your girlfriend over, I would suggest waiting a few weeks even if it\u2019s annoying. Then if you have a chance to change your lease I would get out of there and find someone new to room with maybe. I would also consider the fact that maybe your roommates brother is putting him under extreme pressure, and just try to have another open minded conversation with your roommate explaining that you have sympathy but that he needs to find a solution to get the brother out", "author": "milkktteea", "created": 1632937522, "upvotes": 1}}}
