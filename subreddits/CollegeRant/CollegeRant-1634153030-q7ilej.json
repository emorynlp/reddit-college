  "text": "This is my 4th semester and definitely the hardest yet. I\u2019m fully aware that I\u2019m mentally not doing well but can\u2019t take the time to get help because I\u2019m constantly stressing over my work. I want to drop out so badly to focus on my mental health but since I depend solely on financial aid, I\u2019d be a few thousand in debt to the state. I\u2019m 4 weeks behind in a class and literally cannot make myself do it. I\u2019ve never felt so stuck in my life. I\u2019m not sure how to make myself do my work Bc I want to so badly but nothing works. Any thoughts or ideas):",
