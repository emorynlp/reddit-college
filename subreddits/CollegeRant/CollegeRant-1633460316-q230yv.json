  "text": "Self-teaching doesn't apply to everyone. I know not everybody can teach themselves, but in my case, I wish I could take all online classes so I can teach myself. Sadly, not every class I need to take has an online course. I hate being required to show up to a lecture where I don't even learn anything. It's not until I go on Youtube or some other online resource where I find a clear and concise version of the material. \n\nTake Calculus I for example. My professor had a lecture on linearization and differentials, and good god I did not understand a single sentence or concept that he explained. As soon as I went home, I watched Professor Leonard and was immediately able to grasp the concept. All I needed to hear was that the differential is the height up to the tangent line. That's it. That's fucking it.\n\nAlmost every professor I've had throughout college so far, not just my Calculus teacher, either don't know how to explain concepts or explains them in such an overly complicated manner. The only one who doesn't is my computer science professor. His teaching style is just like Leonard's. He makes everything so clear and simple.",

          "text": "Unfortunately, it might be the case that reading straight from powerpoint slides is the most effective teaching strategy for that particular batch of students.\n\nA lot of people won't read the textbook (or slides) by themselves. They just refuse to do it, or too lazy, or no time or whatever. So if the professor tries to assume the class read the textbook, does a review/Q&A session of the assigned reading, then teaches more complex problems, most of the class will be lost. Under this strategy, a ton of people will get near 0 grades on the exam.\n\nBut if the professor teaches (reads aloud) the book, or in your case the slides, then students will get that basic information. This won't leave time for more complex problems, but at least the average student will have learned more, and will do better on the aforementioned exam.\n\nThat's not to say in Caltech and Harvard they assume every student read and understood the assigned reading before class. They can probably assume every student read the book, but maybe not understand. So they still go over the core concepts from the reading, but they won't go at a slow pace, whereas a community college professor will have to go slowly.",

Nothing, but reminders to do the work on Mylab which is grades itself. Inputs grades itself. Teaches you stuff. \n\nI also have a computer applications class this semester, it also uses Pearson's MyLab program. The professor at least posts lectures, but its not needed because the program teaches you. Rest of the time he just sends out really weird and unnecessary emails.
