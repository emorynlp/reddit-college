I like the field, but absolutely hate college. I fucking despise it. Watching a professor with a dead look in his eyes go over PDF slides with a flat voice tone is just killing me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pandemic, or I am just burnt out, but I just want it all to end already. College is not a good representation of the real world. I have one more Final Exam and a Final Project. I have one more semester left, I  just want it all to end already.
