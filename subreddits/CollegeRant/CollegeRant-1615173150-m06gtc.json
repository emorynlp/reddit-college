This is almost the end of my associates degree and I have absolutely 0 idea what I\u2019m gonna do. I think I\u2019m a little bit smart, but I feel like I\u2019m not smart enough to do anything I want to do. I\u2019m a hard worker, but sitting down and doing any homework with any fervency is really really hard for me.

I personally think most students should have just taken a break from school during this time because I was forced to take classes during COVID and that made my depression worse along the side of 3 people I knew passing away 3 months in a row, shit was hard. I don\u2019t like school and I try to find a way to make myself happy when I learn. I just didn\u2019t have that experience at all and was always drowned in school work and anxieties from quizzes and tests. Honestly fuck school. But hey I\u2019m almost finished graduating and now I\u2019m being forced to stay 3 more semesters because of an opportunity in teaching. I don\u2019t want to teach or become a teacher assistant and I probably won\u2019t.

You definitely aren't the only one feeling this way. I am a first year college student and also taking C++ programming (along with several other courses). Doing not too bad *so far,* but I breakdown almost weekly thinking about the amount of work I have to do - at least 2 quizzes, a three-hour lab, and at least 6 assignments due every week - not to mention I have almost zero motivation and have to self-teach. You mentioned that you were thinking about a CS minor and as a CS major myself, I am struggling with C++. My midterm for it is in 2 days as well and I am just waiting for it to all crash down on me. I really respect you for even exploring a bit in a field that differs vastly from your intended major. I can't give you an exact solution for your predicament but so far what has helped me (temporarily) is just finding a quiet place and listening to music (especially ones I haven't listened to before) while doing my work. It's really important to take breaks when you need and hydrate yourself! Good luck man.\n\nAlso since you are just thinking about a minor in CS or learn to code a bit, I'd suggest to not torture yourself with college CS courses and just learn coding in your own time. There's a lot of Youtube videos with pretty good coding tutorials (you'll have a lot more freedom in what you create!) and covers a lot of the basic to intermediate-level CS concepts (which I'd believe are the same level covered by CS minor).", "author": "Familiar-Course-6737", "created": 1615182893, "upvotes": 3}, "gq6helv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m06gtc/online_school_may_be_the_final_boss_of_my_college/gq6helv/", "text": "Keep your head up!
