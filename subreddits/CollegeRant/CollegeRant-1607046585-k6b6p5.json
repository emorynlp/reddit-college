It was a very simple circuit project and slides with the most minimum effort I could put in without it looking too terrible (white background, black text). The actual presentation went okay despite (tech issues getting the videos to work on my crappy laptop, one of my teammates couldn't make the class because of work, other completely forgot that the presentation was today until I emailed him halfway through the class).\n\nThat was easily my least favorite class of the semester and now I just need to return my Arduino equipment and I'll never have to have anything to do with that class again WOOOOO\n\nAND I JUST TURNED IN MY FINAL ESSAY FOR ENGLISH SO THAT'S TWO CLASSES OUT THE WAY!!!\n\nAll I have left is a very easy quiz and worksheet from my two elective classes (both professors are nice and switched up the final assignments because of everything that's happening) and all I'll have to worry about next week is my PreCalc final (which is a class I've been killing all year!)\n\nI CANT BELIEVE I'M ALMOST DONE WITH THIS SHITTY SEMESTER :D\n\nJust one more week and I can just stay up late, sleep in, and not worry about exams and projects and essays for a whole month!", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1607046585, "retrieved": 1632950308, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 218, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gemep16": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k6b6p5/holy_fuck_im_done_with_my_two_biggest_assignments/gemep16/", "text": "Congratulations, THE FINALLL COUNT DOWN", "author": "Tiedbison305407", "created": 1607107622, "upvotes": 2}, "gelwtpc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k6b6p5/holy_fuck_im_done_with_my_two_biggest_assignments/gelwtpc/", "text": "Im currently in a presentation right now (very anxious hence why I'm on reddit).
