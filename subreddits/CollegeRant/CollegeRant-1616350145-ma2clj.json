But lately every night we are out i have a moment of realization that I will never really be the desired one the group, which puts me in a funk for the next couple days and honestly brings down my self esteem a lot. It doesn\u2019t help that a lot of my self worth is based around being smart but I am not doing too well in school this semester either so just nothing is going right. I don\u2019t even really want the constant attention from guys that they get, I just want to for once have someone like me for me and be excited to talk to a guy as more than friends.

You can keep your current friends but it doesn\u2019t hurt to branch out. By branching out, you may even realize that it\u2019s not 100% about physical attraction.

I\u2019m about to give advice based on my experience in the off chance it resonates with you but I understand advice regarding this subject generally tends to come across condescending or forcibly \u201cthink positive!\u201d. These are not my intentions.\n\nThe advice: physical attractiveness is one of society\u2019s most glorified ideals. As a result, to those who don\u2019t have it, it seems having it means everything. To those who have it, they know the benefits run dry really quickly. When you don\u2019t have it though, it\u2019s thrown in your face every day at every turn. Looks is always the criteria people judge people by initially in surface level interactions. And we as people participate in surface level interactions more than we know. Below are notes I keep in mind:\n\n1. People all suffer losses either because they don\u2019t have something (eg looks), because they have that same thing or irregardless of what they have. Life simply runs on its own agenda and there are no guarantees for anyone. In my teen years, I used to perceive my attractive friends\u2019 complaints about life as trivial and a subtle mockery of me because how could a beautiful person have real problems?!! They\u2019re already beautiful! They have everything! Yeah, I was an envious prick. I\u2019ve matured a bit and realize that their problems are very real. Attractiveness doesn\u2019t gatekeep the border between humanness and superhumanness. It doesn\u2019t exempt anybody from anything. In the end, people probably just want to fuck you more, place you on pedestals because they think you\u2019ve exceeded humanness or creep you. Looks are not as deep as we project it to be. \n\n2. Being attractive is one route in getting certain things but other valid routes exist as well. Albeit, getting things by being hot is glorified by society so we\u2019re conditioned to think it\u2019s the only dignified option available. If you think of the entire process of a relationship with another person as steps 1-10, being hot is one of many strategies to get from step 1 to 2. Looks only matter in getting that person in the door. The 8 steps after demand more. You can get from step 1 to 2 by other means but it \u201churts\u201d for the mere fact it wasn\u2019t by our looks. That\u2019s where we need to remove our worth from our looks because it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we can still get to step 2. Different routes are equally acceptable despite society\u2019s ridiculous rules. \n\n3. I understand how people can be so fixated on looks as a product of our society. I mean, I was fixated on looks too but from the perspective of someone losing the game. Once I flipped from resentment to understanding, it made other people\u2019s valuation of looks less of a threat? Less \u201cimposing\u201d? Over time I could relax more and stop perpetuating the overfixation on looks myself. Then i realized my uncaring attitude toward looks influenced others to \u201csee\u201d me despite my less than amazing appearance. I felt less powerless.", "author": "dogsarethenexthuman", "created": 1616402934, "upvotes": 2}, "grsa20y": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ma2clj/its_hard_being_around_people_in_their_prime/grsa20y/", "text": "This hit so hard.

Pardon me but that does not sound very true. I have met many people who are so-called \"perfect\" role model students in my four years of college. Truth is, each one of them had their own struggles: thinking they are not pretty enough, not smart like other people, having bad luck in dating life etc. Even if you guys are best friends, you are still not him or her, which means you cannot truly understand how they feel. No one is perfect, simple as that, I highly doubt that ALL OF your friends are in their prime age right now. \n\nSecondly, you sounded like a really intelligent girl. If your friends are truly so perfect, they must be really selective with their friend group, yet you still made it to be friends with them. That must be telling something about you. Plus, who knows, maybe another girl is looking at you right now and thinking, \"God I wish I was her, so that I can become friends with so many other hot girls\". The way you admiring your friends might just be the way someone admires you. \n\nLast, just because your friends are awesome does not indicate anything about you. You have to know that life is not always about competition, and like many other said, very few people will constantly pay attention to you since they are so busy paying attention to themselves. So why being upset? I just graduated and I can look back and tell myself that every second I spent in my college years I constantly making bad choices.

It sucks. A lot. But my perception of the situation changed when I figured that if no one is actually paying attention to me, then I can be my truly, authentic self. This is a very cynical perspective but since I know that I will never be the girl that pulls anyone, that means I don\u2019t have anyone to impress. I can literally just be myself and wear what I want and post what I want without wondering if people think i\u2019m weird or unattractive. I\u2019ve been having the best time just shitposting to my social media, reaching out to old and new friends, and thrifting an entirely new closet (because I spent so much time in college trying to copy my more attractive peers... didn\u2019t even like those clothes). \n\nIdk if this helps at all. I still have a very bad relationship with dating, emotions, and anything to do with flirting. But since last year I\u2019ve decided to put my dating life on an infinite hold and I\u2019ve never felt better about myself. \n\nI recommend trying to find out what you like about you.
