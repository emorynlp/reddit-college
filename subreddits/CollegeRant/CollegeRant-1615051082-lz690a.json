If we weren't going to be allowed to use our damn calculators, why didn't she fucking tell us in the beginning?! We could have been practicing on a calculator that was similar to lockdown, instead of learning our own calculator. She told us to spend some time getting to know the calculator while taking the fucking quiz, using up time I need to work on doing the exam. Fuck her, I'm using my calculator for midterm. I know the fucking material well enough to know that shitty calculator was giving me the wrong answers.\n\nTl;DR prof. made us use lockdown browser calculator causing me to fail.\n\nEdit:I just want to thank you all for your advice and your comments. I'll try to keep yall updated if anything comes up. She hasn't replied to my email yet, but I know she's been communicating with others.\n\n2nd Edit: Okay, she responded, but she basically ignored all the concerns I spoke about in the email. She just said she hoped we understood that this situation was new to her, too, so difficulties are expected. I'm like, but your difficulties won't have you failing a class and losing money!\ud83d\ude21 I'm emailing the head now because it seems like she's still going to use the lockdown calculator to do midterm, which is a fucking major grade. I spoke with other classmates, and they said they couldn't even finish the the quiz!\n\nFinal edit: Emailing the head worked \ud83d\ude01. We can use our calculators for midterm. Thank y'all!!\n\nLast edit: She's letting us redo the quiz, too!", "author": "Kajones61lock", "created": 1615051082, "retrieved": 1632842736, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 352, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gqcsbyo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lz690a/fuck_lockdown_browser_and_fuck_my_professor/gqcsbyo/", "text": "Thank you u/Kajones61lock for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This pushy \u201cdo as your told\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit professor\u201d changed our regular calculators for respondus calculator so she could better control \u201ccheating\u201d I failed my quiz and then got a shitty exam grade\u2014despite knowing the material well. \n\nProfessors are getting away with an enormous amount of shit by flexing their authority over you so you fall in line to avoid more work for  them\u2014even if that means you end up with a shitty grade!\n\n1. Put it in writing! Send an email to the professor stating that materials were changed last minute, no instruction or practice was taught on the new calculator before assessment, you are not familiar with the features and it unfairly eats up your time during assessment trying to figure it out. \n\nIf the professor has stated on their syllabus that you can use any calculator then that\u2019s your right. If professor stated that respondus calculator will be used in the course and didn\u2019t provide any practice problems or instruction on how it works then they can\u2019t base a grade using that \u201ctool\u201d. \n\nEmphasize that you are well prepared for the course work. You can also say that using respondus calculator to expedite test taking may work to fulfill course integrity but punishes students who have spent countless hours learning the material, are well prepared and are simply failed because of the \u201cassessment tool\u201dbeing used to complete the quiz/exam is inadequate. State that assessment is unfair and you need to retake the quiz.\n\n2. Wait for a response. If negative, send email to department Chair and explain what the problem is. Forward original email sent to professor. Emphasize that you are being proactive care about your education and find it troubling that the professor is not onboard with your educational success. \n\n3. The reason for steps 1 & possibly 2 ( if the professor doesn\u2019t make changes, allows retake or throws out the quiz from final grade calculation for the whole class) is that when you get your grade at the end of the semester and you don\u2019t do well due to using the respondus calculator then you have good grounds to file a grade appeal to change your grade. \n\nYou need a paper trail and pressure from people above. No one likes to look bad. Make certain other students who feel the same way and had the same problem stick together and voice your concerns. The more the merrier as it proves a pattern as to the negative impact on learning in the course. \n\nHopefully it doesn\u2019t lead to this and the professor realizes that they\u2019re hurting their students instead of helping and will change it\u2014but I\u2019ve got to say I\u2019ve come across some real bonifide assholes who are really pissed off for having to teach online that they could give a shit and don\u2019t want to do ANYTHING that will create more work\u2014-your grade be damned!\n\n4. In my case the professor threw that portion of the exam out. Curved 5 points !
