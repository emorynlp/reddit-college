He used to teach level 300 CIS courses at a top uni but \"retired\" to work at a cc. he doesnt teach at all either. throws the book up and reads it. we have labs every class and only the same 4 people know what to do bc they have previous CIS knowledge. know what he does? puts us in breakout rooms with 1 of these 4 people and THEY PRACTICALLY TEACH US THE CLASS!KNEJHBD HE DOESNT TEACH IT THE STUDENTS DO. also he CONSTANTLY mixes up labs and quizzes for the class. he teaches an intro to c++ and a intro to java class. Last quiz he gave us the java quiz on accident and literally refused to curve or drop the quiz because \"theyre similar, youre engineers you could have figured it out\". are you insane. youre blaming the students for a quiz we bombed because you gave us the wrong one. I'm reporting him if I dont get an A in the class. Im keeping a folder of EVERYTHING to spill his fucking ass to the dean as soon as the semester ends. He likes me, because im honestly a nice person and try to participate even if i get it wrong. im sick of this dude, oh and his assignments are bullshit. If you dont do exactly like how he wants he has no problem throwing an F at you. I'm so close to dropping this class or reporting him but im already 6 weeks into this shithole of a class dropping it feels dumb. I also have a B+ and if I keep a B ill be happy but im reporting his ass anyways. Oh his rate my professor is also 1/5 :). I also cant even pick my professors because im in a transfer program and they pick them for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is happening on top of:\n\nfamily member in hospital with cancer, i have a job as a tutor at my school, im a leader of a club as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nim so close to collapsing. i cant take this semester anymore. the only thing keeping me going is my fucking tutoring job because i honestly love it to death and the students I tutor have all been sweethearts.\n\nI need a martini, trip to the bahamas, or a fat joint. hell all 3.", "author": "ttyltyler", "created": 1632800511, "retrieved": 1632948382, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hembolx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwxtwk/i_hate_3_of_4_of_my_professors_this_semester/hembolx/", "text": "Rate my professors.com", "author": "TragicalKingdom", "created": 1632850482, "upvotes": 2}}}
