Depending on the course and institution, there might be a department-wide determination to use one particular book and accompanying software. \n\nMy department just changed to use a new book, which is fine and all, but the accompanying software and hoop jumping for the profs and the students as well has been nothing short of appalling. \n\nI have always in the past either used free online books, or just straight up copied and provided the pdfs to the students. There is truly no bigger rip off than the publishing companies in academia, and I legit LOVED the part of the semester when I got to tell my students that they could pirate the book if they liked and then gave them some sites where they could get it. One semester I had a student ask to borrow my book, then she went and made pdfs of every reading, and sent them to me to post on our LMS. I was thrilled. \n\nAnd don't get me started on that bullshit software that takes your picture every few seconds while you take a test. That's straight up not ok.

It makes no sense that departments in my college enforces the rule that we must pay 125 for a book with an access code to take \u201cquizzes\u201d. How an independent institution makes its students, the consumer who already pays thousands of dollars just to sit in a lecture hall, pay even more money to a company who has nothing to do with the institution itself. To me it makes zero sense. I can find the book for 12.75 for resale; however, my professor insists on doing the quizzes from the book, instead of writing their own. It is the antithesis high educations failure, and the ultimate disrespect of reducing people to numbers on a class sheet, instead of reaching out and teaching students. No wonder people are saying college is worthless! And I feel awful for people who aren\u2019t in the position I am, where I only have to pay for books.

Seriously, send them an email and tell them you don\u2019t have the money to afford an access code.
