  "text": "I'm taking an anatomy course and between all my courses this semester I've had a really hard time studying and focusing on anything, and I'm trying to do some studying for anatomy, and I realized I really messed up. Anatomy is a lot, and maybe i have time to fix things before finals and bring it up to a C but... It's just so much.\n\nThe lab course hasn't even posted any of my grades yet and that could potentially fuck me up worse...\n\nAt this point I've been doing the whole procastination thing for my whole college career, and it's finally catching up, and I'm worried that the only way I'll learn is if I fail.",
