  "text": "I tried my best I didnt want this to be like high school but unfortunately it has come to this. My roommates a cool dude but hes too cool for me, he found a group of friends and goes out and parties with them. I on the other hand tried talking to people but I guess I'm too big  of a loser to make friends. At least when I self isolated in my room before I could cope with being a loser by talking to my parents etc, but now I have no face to face time with my parents or anyone in my family and it's really getting to me now. Its sucks staying in my room hearing people near me have be loud, have fun, and have loud sex. My Fucking mental health cant take this much more",

On the odd chance that they say no, don't take it personal.\n\nEdit: people don't bite and they aren't going to hate you for wanting to socialize like any other person would.",

I got a part time job in my school's outdoors pursuits center, I started hanging out at the climbing wall, and I went on trips with my school. I made a lot of friends like that. There's usually a lot of different clubs on college campuses and it's certainly not too late to make friends.",

Try enrolling yourself in your universities counseling and psychological services; you won\u2019t make a lot of friends feeling sorry for yourself",

I'm not feeling sorry for myself I 100% accept that it's my fault, but I made the conscious effort to meet people I went up to people and tried to make friends it's just unfortunate I have autism shit happens it's how the world works hopefully I can get over it some day.",
