I get it. Some people have it harder than other\u2019s. I understand that\u2019s it not black and white. But I am so sick and tired of classmates who don\u2019t put the effort into the work, then try to get help from others, and or just want to cheat off someone with every assignment. If you\u2019re too busy to attend class or do your homework then don\u2019t be in school. I got a text from a kid tonight asking me to help them with a project due at 11:59, when the professor has given us the instructions 3 times already. Same guy every class who turns on zoom, turns off the camera, walks away from the computer for the whole class time and then to text the class group chat to ask what he missed. Number blocked. I no longer have sympathy for people like this and I will not be that classmate to hold your hand. \n\nFYI: I have no problem helping people that I know actually do the work and help other classmates too. I\u2019m just really aggravated bc i have a life too: full time student, job, family and personal life but I still put the work in. It\u2019s not fair for the students that actually pay attention in class and do the work on their own to always help the students that slack off. I had \u201cfriends\u201d like this that took advantage of me bc they know I would do the homework and I had to stop responding.

My brother psssd away and then my cousin too. I ended up moving away to 590 miles away from home to a horrible apartment where there were 5 leaks so I had to move all my belongings by myself into another one. I think if it weren\u2019t for one of my classmates offering help, I would\u2019ve not passed. I know sometimes people take advantage of others and can be lazy but sometimes they\u2019re truly going through soemthing too! I\u2019m sorry you had that horrible experience but maybe text him and ask him why he is doing this and call him out instead of blocking him ;( \n\nI gave a girl amazing notes from a former class just to be friendly so she can get ahead in class but she ended up never responding to me. I felt like I bothered her but I was grateful someone else helped me! \n\ndisclaimer: I am smart to do my own work but I think sometimes we all fall a little behind \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "author": "ainsleyace", "created": 1616716013, "upvotes": 1}, "gs590mh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mcngjb/i_have_no_sympathy_for_classmates_that_dont_do/gs590mh/", "text": "Ugh i totally feel this. I also feel super guilty because, ya, online sucks for some people and I have many privileges that allow me to still do okay.\n\nBut really, i have some friends who have gotten awfully lazy this year. Always asking for answers. I find sly ways to avoid giving answers. I usually tell them what notes to look at/pages. They might still push like \"let me see so i can get an idea\" but i'll keep pushing back. \"Its right in the notes, just follow that\". :) Works everytime.\n\nIts always the same people/person too, its funny. If you're struggling, it is not my duty to help you pass. I dont mind helping once a while, but every week? Every assignment? At that point I think you need a break from school. Online definitely isnt meant for you and trying to get other people to work for you constantly is inconsiderate. \n\nI might finish an assignment early, and plan the next dew days for rest. They try and juice me for answers which \n1.) Disturbs my rest that i rightfully deserve for working on assignment early. \n2.) Shows how they also dont care about your time. They usually ask the day-of. Really? Clearly you didnt care until it was JUST due.
