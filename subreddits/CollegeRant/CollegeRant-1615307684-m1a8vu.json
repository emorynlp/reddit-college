  "text": "No discussions, lectures, essays, projects, etc. outside of that. Just smartbook, quizzes, and exams. All of which are automatically graded upon completion. It\u2019s easy but painfully boring and I can\u2019t help wondering why I\u2019m paying my school so much money when my professor is literally not doing anything for my course... I could have done this on my own by just paying for the program. It\u2019s so blatantly obvious that I\u2019m just paying for the college credits/piece of paper I get at the end, not the education. \n\nI hate this trend of online homework programs. I wish I had finished school years ago before they completely took over. :(",

Exactly why am I shelling out thousands for something I learnt absolutely nothing from and essentially taught myself? \n\nI agree, college today is very much about just getting the required credits and \"piece of paper\" so that you can get a job. Its a scam. This Zoom U is even worse since it allows the school to basically not give a f\\*k if you learn or not, especially these fully online classes. They are marketed as \"fitting a busy student's schedule\" but in reality its real marketing should be \"you teach yourself and pay us money for the privilege of doing so\".",
