Im really low and depressed yet somehow am supposed to do full time online classes and act like everything is perfect. I dropped out and wasted a whole year, didn\u2019t go to therapy or anything, am neglecting myself lately. Good luck to you, I think you will make the right decision and it\u2019s ok if that means taking time off. \ud83d\udc95",

      "text": "I never had access to mental health care until university. If you go to a school with free CBT, or even group therapy sessions you may feel like they can really help. I even was about to go to a psychiatrist through my university and get medication for much less than I would have outside of school. \nBut if you are worried about how your mental health will be with all the changes that comes with college I encourage you to delay! There\u2019s nothing wrong with waiting. Whatever you do seek therapy & get help as soon as possible, it turned my life around and allowed me to love college. \nI wish you the best\n\nEdit: I saw that you wanted to move away from parents. Which is another opportunity college gave me. I was lucky enough to live alone and meet wonderful people my second semester. It was so hard at some times, but I really feel like college gave me an opportunity for the first time to prioritize my mental health \n\nEveryone is different and all these comments give great advice. You will get through this whatever path you chose <3 and you will learn so much from the journey",

I did \n1.5 mediocre semesters and then the pandemic hit and everything went to shit. A long series of complications later, I have no idea if my school will even take me back because my financial aid is messed up, even though my mental health is getting better (though now I have the added complication of a chronic pain disorder, but that's unrelated).\n\nPlease take a year off and get yourself situated first. Please, please don't be like me. Starting college immediately and never taking time to take care of myself was the worst mistake I ever made.",
