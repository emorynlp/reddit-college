If you go to a school with free CBT, or even group therapy sessions you may feel like they can really help. I even was about to go to a psychiatrist through my university and get medication for much less than I would have outside of school. \nBut if you are worried about how your mental health will be with all the changes that comes with college I encourage you to delay! There\u2019s nothing wrong with waiting. Whatever you do seek therapy & get help as soon as possible, it turned my life around and allowed me to love college. \nI wish you the best\n\nEdit: I saw that you wanted to move away from parents. Which is another opportunity college gave me. I was lucky enough to live alone and meet wonderful people my second semester. It was so hard at some times, but I really feel like college gave me an opportunity for the first time to prioritize my mental health \n\nEveryone is different and all these comments give great advice.

I was you two years ago--ADHD, depression, anxiety, trauma. The works. I did \n1.5 mediocre semesters and then the pandemic hit and everything went to shit. A long series of complications later, I have no idea if my school will even take me back because my financial aid is messed up, even though my mental health is getting better (though now I have the added complication of a chronic pain disorder, but that's unrelated).\n\nPlease take a year off and get yourself situated first.
