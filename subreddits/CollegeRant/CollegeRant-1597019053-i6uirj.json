You sometimes need a lot more discipline to take online classes so that you complete lessons in a timely manner. You also need to pay attention to when assignments are due. Was the due date for assignments not mentioned clearly in the syllabus or somewhere else? If the due date was announced on short notice, then that's on the professor.\n\nPull the hardest all nighter you've ever done and use it as a lesson to not procrastinate as much in the future. Time management is a skill that can be learned, don't sweat it. I really feel for you, I'm not trying to punch you in the gut here.\n\nI will say this, though: it sounds kind of odd for a prof to have six weeks of assignments due at once. I don't know how many students are in your class, but that sounds like a lot of work for the prof to grade at once (especially since many others might procrastinate and turn everything in last minute).", "author": "enriqueg9031", "created": 1597019978, "upvotes": 16}, "g0y2vw4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i6uirj/all_assignments_due_the_same_day/g0y2vw4/", "text": "I feel you man.
