  "text": "I love when assignments are spread out and have due dates throughout the semester. I didn\u2019t even know profs had the choice not to do this. \n\nI registered for a course this summer not knowing it was \u201cwork at your own pace\u201d and I am TERRIBLE at working at my own pace. Every single assignment from the past 6 weeks is due tomorrow (including our exam) and I just started them because I am an idiot. I\u2019m grinding as much as I can and I know if I fail it\u2019s all my fault because I waited so long to do the assignments. I\u2019ve never had this problem before and I want to cry. I don\u2019t know why I kept putting it off. Looks like I\u2019ll probably be pulling an all nighter and it\u2019s all my fault. Why do professors do this!! Why couldn\u2019t we just have due dates spread out throughout the semester like a normal class!!",

They were specifically called \"open entry/open exit,\" so I knew ahead of time I'd have to pace myself.",

      "text": "They do it so students can do the work on their own schedule rather than be dictated to. Their alternative is selecting arbitrary dates that inevitably will be a problem for someone and they\u2019ll need to cram or not give an assignment all their effort. But that assumes students are responsible enough to keep on top of their work and actually attempt to keep up with assignments. \n\nSometimes professors make a suggested due date to offer a rough idea of when you \u2018should\u2019 do things. I think that\u2019s a good middle ground. \n\nThat being said I hope you\u2019re doing well and manage to take care of it all.",

      "text": "Well, this is part of why online classes can be harder than live classes. You sometimes need a lot more discipline to take online classes so that you complete lessons in a timely manner. You also need to pay attention to when assignments are due. Was the due date for assignments not mentioned clearly in the syllabus or somewhere else? If the due date was announced on short notice, then that's on the professor.\n\nPull the hardest all nighter you've ever done and use it as a lesson to not procrastinate as much in the future. Time management is a skill that can be learned, don't sweat it. I really feel for you, I'm not trying to punch you in the gut here.\n\nI will say this, though: it sounds kind of odd for a prof to have six weeks of assignments due at once. I don't know how many students are in your class, but that sounds like a lot of work for the prof to grade at once (especially since many others might procrastinate and turn everything in last minute).",
