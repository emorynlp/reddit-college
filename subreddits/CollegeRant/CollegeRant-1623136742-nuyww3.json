HOLY FUCK, college French is painful. I saw on the grades website for my college that the average was like a 3.2. I\u2019m constantly stressed and struggling to get my homework 1. Done 2. At least somewhat correct. I\u2019ve already taken 2 semesters of French since fall 2020, and my classmates intimidate me because they are obviously not challenged and make me feel like an idiot. Maybe it\u2019s also my Asperger\u2019s. I have no one to turn to and don\u2019t even have time to ask about homework because these summer classes move ridiculously fast. I\u2019m so tired. I can\u2019t even avoid summer French because I\u2019ll forget what I already took and I\u2019ll have no time for a campus job because it eats up your whole weekend (and weekdays too). The cengage busy work is horrible. I have no friends in the class either, I tried to be friends with one girl but I only seem to alert her of things with the homework, and she sees the class as too easy, so she\u2019s not reliable. I don\u2019t know what to do:(", "author": "Missfrizzleswag", "created": 1623136742, "retrieved": 1632842258, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h108rhd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuyww3/summer_french_is_killing_me/h108rhd/", "text": "Thank you u/Missfrizzleswag for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
