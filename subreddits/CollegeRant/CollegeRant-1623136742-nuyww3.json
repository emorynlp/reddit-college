  "title:": "Summer French is killing me",
  "text": "My major has a language requirement and I figured I\u2019d do french since I did it for two years in highschool (then stopped when I was a junior and senior). HOLY FUCK, college French is painful. I saw on the grades website for my college that the average was like a 3.2. I\u2019m constantly stressed and struggling to get my homework 1. Done 2. At least somewhat correct. I\u2019ve already taken 2 semesters of French since fall 2020, and my classmates intimidate me because they are obviously not challenged and make me feel like an idiot. Maybe it\u2019s also my Asperger\u2019s. I have no one to turn to and don\u2019t even have time to ask about homework because these summer classes move ridiculously fast. I\u2019m so tired. I can\u2019t even avoid summer French because I\u2019ll forget what I already took and I\u2019ll have no time for a campus job because it eats up your whole weekend (and weekdays too). The cengage busy work is horrible. I have no friends in the class either, I tried to be friends with one girl but I only seem to alert her of things with the homework, and she sees the class as too easy, so she\u2019s not reliable. I don\u2019t know what to do:(",

      "text": "Drop it.\n\nFrench isn't the most valuable language to be fluent in, far from it imo unless you plan on working around France.\n\nGuess which one is? English\n\nI have a foreign coworker who can speak  perfect PNW English without any accent and he does private tutors English classes in the Philippines for 30k every summer (just 2.5 months)\n\nWhat's the 2nd most valuable language in the US? Depending on the industry, I'd say spanish or manderan.\n\nIve also heard Chinese, english teachers are paid big time. In high-school our most successful 4.0, associates degree running start student spoke/ wrote 4 different languages like they grew up with it. (He was Chinese)",
