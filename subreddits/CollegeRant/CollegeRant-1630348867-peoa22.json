And that feeling is there because of the countless times that I\u2019ve taken every precaution to recheck every part of the assignment with full confidence and then proceeded to get a C. I blazed through high school and felt like a genius. Then I got to college and it felt like no matter how hard I tried, no matter how sure I was that I had the right answer, I would get C\u2019s or worse. College was a reality check. It got to the point where I had zero confidence in myself. Stranger is the fact that I fully understood the material. I was participating in lectures and answering questions correctly in class. Yet it always seemed to come down to some minuscule missing calculation or something that threw the whole assignment off and ended with me getting a C. I\u2019ve slowly overcome this by completely changing my study habits. Now I am a high B or low A student.

No matter how much I think I know APA, it\u2019s always different with every class. \n\nI\u2019ve had a professor tell me to use subheadings every time so I did and then my other professor told me not to. I was told to only use he/she pronouns but then I was told by a different professor to use they. Recently was told to write my titles on my references page with only the first letter being capitalized and the rest of the title as lower case, then I did that with another course and they said I was wrong. Some even said that how I structure my references doesn\u2019t matter as long as I put the link (I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this).\n\nIf I have a chance in the beginning of the course to explain what I expect to learn, I always mention how to format correctly that way they aren\u2019t surprised if I do it \u201cwrong.\u201d", "author": "TheRestIs_Confetti", "created": 1630350934, "upvotes": 16}}}
