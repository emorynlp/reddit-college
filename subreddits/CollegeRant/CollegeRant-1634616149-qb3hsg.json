  "title:": "Can't seem to have fun",
  "text": "I feel like I have always struggled to enjoy myself. I have now been in college for two months and haven't made any friends, but I don't seem to care enough to try. Every time I talk to my friends from high school I realize that I don't know how to have fun. I was just asked what fun things I did this weekend, and I said studying and going to review sessions, like I sounded excited about it. To be fair, that is more than I do on a typical weekend. I have always done well in school, but I feel like I invest too much of my time into it. At the same time, I keep doing it because I have nothing else to do that really brings me joy and want to at least be good at something. I have no hobbies, and every time I am doing something that is supposed to be fun, I either stress about it or feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. All I do is study, watch YouTube, and play the occasional game. I guess I feel satisfied most of the time, but I feel kind of empty, like I have no personality. I can never come up with a fun fact about myself, and I feel like I'm the most generic person out there. My roommate, who is a friend from high school, is the exact opposite of me. He made a friend group within a few days and seems to have so much fun all the time. I hate the fact that I am like this but I seem to be mad that he is having so much fun while I'm just doing nothing. I don't think I'm sad but I feel like I really enjoy something only once in a while just to wait for weeks or months before feeling the same happiness again.",

I tried to make friends in the Zoom chat feature only to have it disabled, so that sucked. This year, I just sit in my apartment and study. I also never learned how to have fun, not sure why.",

Doing well in school gives me some validation which is nice, and then I convince myself that I can make friends by being smart but they are not truly my friends. If I didn\u2019t help with study guides or I wanted to hang out outside of college, they would disappear. The \u201cWhat do you like to do?\u201d question is the worst.",

                  "text": "Yeah I feel like I always actively decide to do something because I think it will be fun but I never end up actually enjoying it. I feel like that tendency to seek fun might be part of the reason we don't enjoy things. I can definitely second what you said about friends disappearing if you stopped helping them with work. I feel like that happens to me a lot. Not necessarily because they are bad people, but because I tend to only be close to a few people, and only discuss academics with the rest.",

          "text": "\\^\\^ What they said. These feelings are tough to deal with but leaning into your feelings of being isolated and satisfied but not fulfilled are tough at first. But going through them is necessary to find out why you feel the way you do. \n\nFind out what's missing from your life or what's in your life that's actively decreasing the quality of it. Then you can set a goal to change it. At the very least, self reflection is a good start. Hope I helped. Good luck!",

      "text": "As a recent graduate from college, I felt the exact same way. But it\u2019s up to you to change it. \n\nI was always a really hard-working student. I began in Pre-Med but quickly felt it was too much work and that there was more to life to enjoy. Little did I realize that habits of taking too many APs at once for 3 years and then a semester would lock me into this habit. I began to fill my time with business classes, extra-curriculars that I didn\u2019t enjoy but did to make my resume better, part-time work, and anything else that I felt overall improved myself. Then once the Covid pandemic hit my senior year and there was more free-time, but isolated, I fell into a huge state of depression and anxiety. The structures that kept me sane fell apart and I had no single fucking clue how to enjoy my own presence without work. And the work I was doing started to feel useless and stupid.\n\nNow as a recent graduate and moving to a new state, these feelings still sometimes remain, but there\u2019s a lot less of it. I have more time since I\u2019m merely job searching, and have to fill the time in other ways. \n\nSo start finding ways to fill those voids. Pick up an instrument and play it not be a famous guitarist, but simply because you enjoy the instrument. Hit the gym and start a workout regiment that you enjoy. Go to a gym and get in a pool just to fool around. Go for hikes. Ride a skateboard. Cook a meal. Write a short story. Anything. Do something other than being on a screen by yourself. Do them no matter how much you suck at them. \n\nIn times or Reddit, YouTube, and endless social media scrolling, it\u2019s so easy to fill the void with content you forget about 5 minutes later. It\u2019s not an easy thing to escape, especially when our computers are right in our pockets. And imho, college is anxiety-inducing. It personally made me feel like anything you do that isn\u2019t good for professional growth means you are falling behind. I would not give myself necessary breaks, but would use my phone to fill the need for a break and be stuck in scrolling paralysis without realizing it would be healthier just to take a real break and get away and do something I actually enjoy. \n\nIt takes work and effort to begin forming these kinds of habits. Plenty of people will say \u201cjust do it\u201d but it\u2019s far more challenging than just doing it. Remember everything you do requires steps. Showering is more than just showering. It\u2019s getting up, turning the faucet, stepping in, washing your hair, etc. Everything requires steps and habits seem easy but doing new things and forming new habits is hard.\n\nA good resource that helped me out was a YouTube channel called Healthy Gamer GG. Dr. K is goated.\n\nBest of luck to you, king",
