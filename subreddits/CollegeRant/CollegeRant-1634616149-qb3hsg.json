  "text": "I feel like I have always struggled to enjoy myself. I have now been in college for two months and haven't made any friends, but I don't seem to care enough to try. Every time I talk to my friends from high school I realize that I don't know how to have fun. I was just asked what fun things I did this weekend, and I said studying and going to review sessions, like I sounded excited about it. To be fair, that is more than I do on a typical weekend. I have always done well in school, but I feel like I invest too much of my time into it. At the same time, I keep doing it because I have nothing else to do that really brings me joy and want to at least be good at something. I have no hobbies, and every time I am doing something that is supposed to be fun, I either stress about it or feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. All I do is study, watch YouTube, and play the occasional game. I guess I feel satisfied most of the time, but I feel kind of empty, like I have no personality. I can never come up with a fun fact about myself, and I feel like I'm the most generic person out there. My roommate, who is a friend from high school, is the exact opposite of me. He made a friend group within a few days and seems to have so much fun all the time. I hate the fact that I am like this but I seem to be mad that he is having so much fun while I'm just doing nothing. I don't think I'm sad but I feel like I really enjoy something only once in a while just to wait for weeks or months before feeling the same happiness again.",

I tried to make friends in the Zoom chat feature only to have it disabled, so that sucked. This year, I just sit in my apartment and study. I also never learned how to have fun, not sure why.",

              "text": "Yes, I truly did feel this way then as well. Not sure if it\u2019s something that will ever change tbh. Doing well in school gives me some validation which is nice, and then I convince myself that I can make friends by being smart but they are not truly my friends. If I didn\u2019t help with study guides or I wanted to hang out outside of college, they would disappear. The \u201cWhat do you like to do?\u201d question is the worst.",

                  "text": "Yeah I feel like I always actively decide to do something because I think it will be fun but I never end up actually enjoying it. I feel like that tendency to seek fun might be part of the reason we don't enjoy things. I can definitely second what you said about friends disappearing if you stopped helping them with work. I feel like that happens to me a lot. Not necessarily because they are bad people, but because I tend to only be close to a few people, and only discuss academics with the rest.",
