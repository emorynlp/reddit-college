  "title:": "I'm so sick of my group project partners leaving everything until the last minute",
  "text": "Right now we're working on a section of a big term project and I can't start on my portion until two other group members finish their part. It's been a week, tomorrow the last day I'm available to work on it, which they know, and they haven't done anything at all. I've asked about what I should be doing and they say \"wait until we've done our part and you can start yours\" since my section is supposed to build off theirs. I literally can't do anything yet, I'm pretty much just sitting at home checking the files and the group chat waiting for *something* to be added since I allocated this evening to work on it, and nothing. All week they've been saying \"I have class today but I'll work on it tomorrow\" and they don't. If they submit their portion the day before it's due I'm literally going to have a few hours to do what I was supposed to have days to do. Whenever I say anything about it they give me attitude. I'm so frustrated and sick of it.",

      "text": "Dude same, I\u2019ve got this 65 minute presentation on Tuesday and one other group member, and he\u2019s the kind of person to sit in the front of the class and make long winded answers with big words to sound smart when he\u2019s not actually contributing anything useful. I assumed this would at least make him almost too on top of things during the project but HOOOLY Ive done every piece of planning, I split up the sections and planned how we will do it and blah blah blah, he hasn\u2019t touched the ppt yet. He like runs out at the end of class every day so I can\u2019t catch him, and the other day I answered a question in class and he butted in to add something completely unnecessary\u2014 I think he\u2019s purposely trying to get on my nerves. This isn\u2019t even the half of it but I\u2019m keeping this short lmao: Good luck to you man, we can make it through this",
