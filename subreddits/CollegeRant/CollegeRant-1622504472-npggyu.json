I\u2019m not particularly interested in that many clubs so I joined one that I felt really fit my interests. I applied for their e-board, got rejected even though I thought the interview went well. I was disappointed but applied for a different internship instead which I was genuinely so excited for and also thought the interview went well. I got rejected and now I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m frustrated and upset at myself because I just feel like it\u2019s because my personality just isn\u2019t good enough and being an introvert, I\u2019m already insecure about how I come off to others. I just feel so behind compared to my peers who all have internships, research opportunities, and are all in officer positions in orgs.", "author": "bubawubacheese", "created": 1622504472, "retrieved": 1632842298, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h04vwkn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/npggyu/i_keep_getting_rejected_from_everything_and_its/h04vwkn/", "text": "Thank you u/bubawubacheese for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I still hate it, gosh I really hate it, and it happens very frequently for me. However, I have gone from that instinct telling me everything is over and I'm worthless for being rejected when it used to happen to now being upset but moving on to the next thing fairly quickly.\n\nIt's going to suck, I can't sugar coat it, but the best way to handle rejection is to get rejected a lot to the point where it just doesn't hit quite the same, and no matter what, if you keep putting yourself out there, no matter what it is, you will get something good.\n\nAs for feeling behind, I really get that, too. But a lot of my recent grad friends who were tops of their classes, had internships, research, etc. are no further in their careers than the people who glided through college without putting in effort. A lot of my fellow overachievers have quit jobs or given up on the career paths they worked so hard to get into with all their accomplishments because they found out it just wasn't for them once they got out into the real world. \n\nAnd I don't say this to pretend it's easy, but you don't deserve to keep feeling sucky for doing the strong thing and putting yourself out there.", "author": "TobiasOswald", "created": 1622560735, "upvotes": 5}}}
