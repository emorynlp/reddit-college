I don\u2019t even know where to begin lol. I\u2019m a senior trying to study a complex and competitive field. In between that I am trying to make friends. I think it\u2019s overrated sometimes but then I look at everyone with their friends. I wish I can have that. The biggest challenge is that I don\u2019t have a car which will make it harder to connect with people I meet. It\u2019s also embarrassing lol\n\nI am trying to be hopeful and not hopeless. I believe it\u2019s my social anxiety that\u2019s effect me sm. Just wanted to put that out there because I\u2019m really shy lol\n\n\nMaybe I should accept that lol that I\u2019m not very social and that\u2019s okay.", "author": "Inner_Cantaloupe375", "created": 1630439582, "retrieved": 1632841251, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hb3iv0n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfdfm8/bitter_sweet/hb3iv0n/", "text": "Thank you u/Inner_Cantaloupe375 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
