I don\u2019t even know where to begin lol. I\u2019m a senior trying to study a complex and competitive field. In between that I am trying to make friends. I think it\u2019s overrated sometimes but then I look at everyone with their friends. I wish I can have that. The biggest challenge is that I don\u2019t have a car which will make it harder to connect with people I meet. It\u2019s also embarrassing lol\n\nI am trying to be hopeful and not hopeless. I believe it\u2019s my social anxiety that\u2019s effect me sm. Just wanted to put that out there because I\u2019m really shy lol\n\n\nMaybe I should accept that lol that I\u2019m not very social and that\u2019s okay.", "author": "Inner_Cantaloupe375", "created": 1630439582, "retrieved": 1632948980, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
