  "title:": "random classmate on zoom told me he\u2019s been watching me??",
  "text": "all my classes are on zoom and as most of you know, zoom has breakout rooms where the teacher separates you into private. these are SO awkward, especially since i never met these people irl and there aren\u2019t any social cues to read. so i got put into a breakout room with 3 other classmates, and one of them had their camera off every class so i didn\u2019t even know what he looked like. we\u2019re all having normal conversation when this guy says to me something along the lines of \u201ci see you going on your phone and doing stuff, don\u2019t think i don\u2019t see you, i\u2019ve been watching\u201d in the creepiest tone ever. what the fuck??? that\u2019s creepy as fuck and also made me so uncomfortable. i was so uncomfortable that i didn\u2019t respond and the group went silent then moved on. i turned my camera off for the rest of the class even though my teacher prefers them to stay on. now i don\u2019t want to put it on next class because i feel like i\u2019m being watched. should i bother telling my teacher? i don\u2019t want to create a problem out of \u201cnothing\u201d. idk if i\u2019m overreacting but the thought of someone with their camera off seeing my every move when i can\u2019t see theirs is very weird and unsettling \n\ntl;dr: classmate told me in zoom breakout room that he\u2019s been watching me over zoom. i don\u2019t know if i should keep camera on for rest of classes even though teacher wants them on?",

If he isn't even going on video like he's supposed to idk how he has any room to talk about maybe seeing you on your phone, I literally spend all my zoom class meetings tabbed out doing something else and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
