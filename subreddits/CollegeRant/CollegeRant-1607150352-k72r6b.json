  "title:": "I have never felt so apathetic and hateful in my life.",
  "text": "I'm now finishing up my first semester as a Sophomore and can say that, without a doubt, pursuing a computer science degree is the most loathsome thing I've ever done. After having received poor grades on two previous CS classes, I'm basically redoing Freshman year rn, so I basically blew 30k on school last year because I couldn't be motivated to do any work. There were times I tried to keep up, but more often than not, apathy won out. This year, starting over, I realize that there is literally not a single thing I like about CS, I hate every fucking thing about it. I don't like my professors, I don't like that the courses are never offered in summer, I don't like the classes or coding or anything to do with CS but what the fuck else am I gonna do? I spent all of high school leaning towards CS because of the job opportunities but now I see have no talent, passion, drive, or motivation for the subject and studying it has put me in the deepest spiral of depression and self-loathing I've ever been in. Some days I will sleep 16-20 hours just so I can avoid feeling the stress that CS gives me during my waking moments. Every one of my friends in college that started as CS majors with me have all jumped ship. I don't want to switch majors because I don't know what to do! I have no skills, no interests or hobbies, no side-projects, and no talent to do anything else. I am an amalgamation of stupidity and self-hatred that fuels itself on sleep and work. I don't know what to do at this point, if I'm not thinking about how CS is gonna fuck me over, I'm thinking about the most convenient and painless ways to kill myself because just the thought of no longer existing is such a comfort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't do this shit anymore.",

      "text": "I really sympathize with you dawg. I started out as a CS major and got absolutely shredded by my peers and professors. I left the major and spent well over a year trying to find a new one that I liked. I wish I had more advice for you on how to deal with your depression and anxiety, I still occasionally struggle with the same things you described. What did help me though, was getting out of CS. There is absolutely nothing wrong with not knowing what to do.",

      "text": "I was majoring in CS last year too and realized after my first Java class that I\u2019m actually a lot stupider than I thought I was. My self esteem fell so low as I saw pretty much all my classmates seemed to have stuff figured out and I felt like the only one struggling to understand the most basic things. I always thought I would enjoy CS but it was one of my worst classes and I absolutely loathed it because of how much I sucked at it. I was so behind and I had no time to catch up without repeating freshman year or taking on like 23 hours a semester. One thing led to another, I quit ROTC, decided I wanted to go to community college instead of the private university I was going to because of how preppy it was, and ended up actually taking the fall semester off because I didn\u2019t enroll in time (oops.) After I got over the stupid embarrassment of being the only one of my friends not in college that semester, I realized this break was what I really needed. I had time to study the coding language I wanted to study and plenty time to learn it without worrying about tests or anything. I got a couple part time jobs, got my own apartment away from my family, and was able to just work and chill and think without any pressure. I know it may not be a viable option for you, but if it is, I would maybe recommend taking a semester off. It\u2019s hard at first to accept doing it, especially if you\u2019re very ambitious and don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re falling behind your peers. But I think it would do wonders for your mental health.",

You don\u2019t want to waste your whole life doing a job that you loathe. I think the extra work you put in to find a job you actually enjoy is worth it. If you already have the credits, maybe try minoring in CS.",

I will say, don't stay in CS if it makes you that miserable-you have other options and honestly, it sounds like, to at least some capacity, it's worsening your depression. Take a semester or do part-time, to get some distance (if that's possible)  You'll probably hate this, but I would strongly urge you to reach out. Even if it's to a counsellor at school to consider other programs. Our brains like to convince us there are no other options because no matter how much we're suffering, they resist change of any kind.",
