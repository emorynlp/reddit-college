If your studying in between classes, or don\u2019t leave until you finish you homework, you have the rest of the evening for yourself. This has helped me a lot because as soon as I leave campus, I know that I am done with school for the day. Also, if it\u2019s doable try have a portion of Saturday or Sunday to yourself so you don\u2019t feel like school is all you do.", "author": "denver_rose", "created": 1631573053, "upvotes": 2}}}
