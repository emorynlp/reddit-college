{"sid": "po1je5", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/po1je5/guess_ill_drop_my_only_class/", "title:": "Guess I\u2019ll drop my only class :(", "text": "I applied for two morning classes, which I knew would be okay because I\u2019m a morning person. But after registration, I got a job where I work the night shift. The one in person class was literally right in the middle of when I\u2019d be sleeping. So on days I have class, I go to sleep two hours early, sleep for four hours, go to class, and then sleep for four more hours. I tried to switch my class to a different time but I go to a really small community college and all the other classes were already full. I REALLY don\u2019t want to have to change my sleep schedule to where I go to sleep in the afternoon and wake up right before I go to work. \n\nAnd the part that I really keep getting stuck on is that I don\u2019t actually need these two classes. This past spring I applied for a different university but I\u2019m having a LOT of trouble with my application so I won\u2019t be able to start until this upcoming spring. I didn\u2019t take any classes in the summer either. I like school. I feel stagnant and anxious and restless when I\u2019m not taking classes. I knew to get into the program I wanted I was going to eventually take these two classes anyways so I went to my local community college to take them. BUT I changed my major to a slightly different program and I don\u2019t even need them anymore. \n\nI already dropped the online class because it was an absolute mess, I have never seen a class structured so terribly, and it was stressful and horrible. I don\u2019t mind my in-person class, I enjoy the class well enough and having homework to do. But I\u2019ve already skipped a class and I\u2019m skipping today because I forgot I had to go to sleep earlier and I\u2019m so exhausted, I don\u2019t want to go to class on an hour of sleep\u2026 but I kind of need to go to lecture to do well. \n\nI could suck it up and change my sleep schedule. But as I was writing this out I realized how stupid it is to take a class I don\u2019t need \u201cjust for fun.\u201d It\u2019s not fun anymore. And if I withdraw this week I get my money back and it won\u2019t effect my GPA. More like I need to suck it up and drop it. \n\nI hate not being in school and just working. I like my job and I have hobbies and friends that keep me busy but idk I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough. I\u2019m not working towards my goals, I\u2019m just kind of passing the time. But I guess I should appreciate and enjoy these forced breaks because once I do go back to school I\u2019ll be crazy busy. I hope anyways, if all goes according to plan. Which it rarely does. I was going to ask for advice but I think I\u2019m going to drop it. Guess I\u2019ll sleep on it. \n\nGoodnight", "author": "laniebug235", "created": 1631621556, "retrieved": 1632948553, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
