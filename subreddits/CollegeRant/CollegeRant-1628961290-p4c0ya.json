I attempted to take it spring of 2020 but ended up withdrawing and delaying it until summer. (This was a bad move). I decided to take it from a college near my parents house since I\u2019m staying with them for the summer. Unfortunately, to transfer credit to my actual school you need a C- or better in the course. I am terrible at chemistry and barely passed gen chem 1 my freshman year. I am almost done with the course and it does not look good for keeping a C in the class after the final exam. I am so upset with myself because not only did I need this course to transfer, but I had to pay for it separately as well. So it will be a waste of a couple thousand bucks in addition to a huge problem with some courses I need down the line. I will do my best on the final exam, but I have no idea what to do should I end up getting below a C. (I even briefly considered cheating but that will never sit right with me- can\u2019t bring myself to do it). I don\u2019t know how lenient my professors will be in terms of waiving a prereq if I don\u2019t have it, and I REALLY don\u2019t want to take this course again. It would be trying for a third time and I don\u2019t know if I can handle it. Has anyone been in this situation who could maybe offer some words of advice? I have no idea what to do.
