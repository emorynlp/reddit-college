  "title:": "Why are professors allowed to assign any work during a break?",
  "text": "It's not every professor, but it's at least one every semester. Fall/Spring break comes around, and I can't get just ONE WEEK without a professor assigning something during it. It's happened in most of my semesters starting from high school. There's always that one teacher, and it keeps happening in college. Most of the time, there aren't any assignments due *during* the break, but they're due *the day immediately following the break*, so if I can't get it done in 1 day, I'd have to work on it during the break. The few teachers that have commented on this have said \"work on it now, so you won't have to work on it during your break\".\n\n**JUST MAKE IT DUE BEFORE THE BREAK! WHY CAN'T YOU RESPECT MY BREAK?!**\n\nThankfully, it's usually not an assignment that we didn't know about ahead of time, but why are they even allowed to assign work during the break? In my last two semesters, I've had a professor assign work that was actually DUE during the break, which I didn't even know was allowed.\n\nIt's a break off from coming to class, but if all of my classes are online and I'm not going to an in-person class anyway, then I'm not even getting that benefit.",

      "text": "Were you able to start the assignment well before the break began? If so, then you have time before the break to finish it so that you don\u2019t have to work on it during the break.\n\nThere are some students who would rather things be this way so that they have the break time to do it. They\u2019d complain if they didn\u2019t.\n\nAlso, they aren\u2019t disrespecting your break. That\u2019s why they\u2019re giving it to you in advance of the break starting so that you can choose when to work on it. If you choose to wait until your break, then you have that option; if you choose to do it before the break, then you have that option, too.",

          "text": "That's a reply that fundamentally ignores the nuances of human behavior. I'm 37, and I've literally *never* started an assignment more than 24 hours before it was due. I have the option of doing it earlier, just as I have the option of deliberately driving into oncoming traffic on the highway; they're both technically possible , but they're also both so far outside of my behavioral paradigm that realistically, neither one is *ever* going to happen.",

              "text": "Choosing to drive into oncoming traffic is extremely dangerous. Choosing to be proactive is a smart way of managing your time. If all you ever do is procrastinate, you can change your behavior without threatening your safety. If you choose to drive into oncoming traffic, you\u2019re risking severe injury or death.\n\nSure, it\u2019s really difficult to break out of the habit of procrastination, and it might be a real challenge, but it\u2019s also a responsible way to manage your time. There are lots of human behaviors that are common and easy but also detrimental to health and safety. That doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t work to make ourselves better.",

My program is Marine Engineering--our curriculum is dictated by the US Coast Guard, the overwhelming majority of our work consists of practical demonstrations. When I finish my ethics class this semester, I'll be completely done with Gen Ed. requirements, and will have no more classes with long-term assignments.)\n\nThat sort of procrastination is a deeply rooted part of my personality. I *might* be able to change it, with tremendous effort, but I decided a long time ago that it was a better use of time and effort to arrange my life so that particular trait wasn't a major downside (which has worked out quite well so far.)",
