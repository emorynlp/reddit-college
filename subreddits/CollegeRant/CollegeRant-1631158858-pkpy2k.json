My boss and coworkers were nice and such, but I realized that the corporate, office, 9-5 job really sucks for me. I also realized that imo the business industry seems very schemy, greedy, and a bit evil tbh lol.\n\n\nI kind of don\u2019t like the business world that much before this internship. Everyone was advocating it a lot, even my advisor, and I felt pressured to do it to get \u201cexperience\u201d. I have worked summer and part-time jobs before, and I liked them. However, I personally don\u2019t like the idea of an internship (even with pay) because of how demeaning it sounds. You\u2019re basically an \u201cemployee of an employee\u201d. \n\nIt was worse because marketing is only an alternative for me (I originally wanted to do the arts) and my family\u2019s money-making expectations (in other words, I kinda hate the major already). So, I decided to do the internship not only for college credits but also to give it a shot and see if it\u2019s that was really the case, and unfortunately it is.\n\nHas anyone gone through this before? If so, what did you do about it?", "author": "Unfair-Connection543", "created": 1631158858, "retrieved": 1632841115, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hc55r1z": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkpy2k/internship_made_me_hate_my_major/hc55r1z/", "text": "Thank you u/Unfair-Connection543 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I came from vocational school before college and did internship program. For first two weeks its fun but the rest, meh. First experience i was an intern in radio station, helping the announcer stuff etc, etc. I was signed to do paper work but i talked to my instructor i can't take paper work, honestly its boring and the office just spooky af.\n\nSecondly my college internship experience, me and my friend signed up in a production house movie. Handled the website, make some articles  about their last and upcoming movie any information and detail which i can squeeze so i can make an  article about it, but the annoying thing is i dont get a payment in cash only \"thank you for help\" and experience, right. At least i got the pizza. \n\nI have to make a report about my activity while doing my internship there too so basically a little-thesis for practice and now I'm working on my thesis for graduation. \n\nInternship can be annoying as it can but you still need it anyway.", "author": "croweatyoureyes", "created": 1631242288, "upvotes": 1}, "hc70fol": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkpy2k/internship_made_me_hate_my_major/hc70fol/", "text": "There are definitely ways to marry art and marketing like digital design in advertisement and social media management.
