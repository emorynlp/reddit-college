  "text": "granted it Is 10 pages, but I know all the material already, have a shit ton a notes, AND already have an outline of what I'm going to say in my head. Yet I'm taking so god dam long! I was at the library from 1 to 6 pm and only got 3 pages done. my mind just keeps going to LaLa land every couple of minutes and I'm struggling to focus. I know what I want to write and then 5 minutes later I'm acting like I'm anakin Skywalker. \n\n\nhow. To. FOCUS",

      "text": "Have that outline in your head solidified on paper. Trust. You have all the tools to ace this thing so put it into practice and make it easier for yourself.\n\nHave headers for different sections of the paper. Do bullet points in incomplete sentences. Have sub bullet points on where you\u2019ll put evidence. Tie is back to your thesis.\n\nAlso, Pomodoro Technique. Study With Me community on YouTube. Mario Kart 8 Coconut Mall for 10 hours.\n\nYou got this!",
