  "text": "In online class now. Trying not to fall asleep. I\u2019m so tired, I work round the clock and have two jobs on top of a full class schedule. School is so expensive and so is life, I can\u2019t be expected to just do school. \n\nMy professor in this class talks at us. I don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m going to be able to receive class participation if he just keeps talking. \n\nJust tired. Wish I had a spring break, wish I didn\u2019t have to work. I wish... I wish...",

It\u2019s so hard to function in so many roles at once and focus on so many things all at once...trying to be a good employee and good student and stay sane. Remember to take time for yourself, and I know that is easier said than done. I didn\u2019t take care of myself because I  was so focused on being a perfect student and perfect employee...it caught up with me. Now I focus on doing the best I can. Don\u2019t beat yourself up . All you can do is try your best and take care of yourself.  I\u2019m proud of you and I hear you. Life can be way too much sometimes.",
