  "text": "I need help ASAP. My current environment at my college is so bad that it\u2019s affecting me mentally and physically. I\u2019m unhappy, anxious, and have now fallen sick with an actual cold/allergy combination thing that my family thinks is a result of my sleep deprivation, me not eating well, and having to live in a space w a cat (im allergic to cats and dogs :(( ). My roommate snores and im a light sleeper so the only time I get rest is when I come home on the weekends. I hate my major and my classes and have already planned to switch to something else next semester but my family really doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to continue to go through what I am rn.\n\nI\u2019m frustrated because I don\u2019t want to drop out and be perceived as weak etc etc but I\u2019ve toughed it out for a month now and it\u2019s affecting everything in my life. I\u2019m thinking of trying again at a different college in the spring, but does anyone know if I have to apply as a transfer and explain the Ws on my transcript or am I able to reapply as a freshman??? \n\nI just need emotional support and legit advice, if y\u2019all can spare some :(\n\nTL;DR \u2014> my first semester is kicking my ass mentally and physically. If I take a gap semester, would I apply as a transfer in the spring with Ws on my transcript or would I apply as a freshman? Do I even take a gap semester ?? :(",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know about the transferring stuff. I can give emotional support though. I\u2019m decided myself that I\u2019m not coming back after Christmas because the school is not my type of environment. My roommate sucks. I caught Covid because of her. I chose some random major because I don\u2019t even know what I want to major in. \n\nYour mental health is more important. A gap semester or year will most likely be best. You\u2019re not weak for doing what\u2019s best for you. It\u2019s a big adjustment going from HS to College and being away from home. Plus it\u2019s not for everyone. Do what\u2019s best for you!",
