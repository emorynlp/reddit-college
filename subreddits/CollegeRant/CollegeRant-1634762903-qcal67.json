  "text": "This semester has been extremely hard for me. School itself has been extremely stressful and not only that, but I\u2019m dealing with\u2026quite a few family issues. Right before the semester started, both of my parents almost died from COVID. I mean **right** before the semester too, they were finally released from the hospital just days before I left for school. Not only this, but my father is disabled and my mother and I are his main caretakers, I often go back and forth from school to help with him and between that and his long terms symptoms of COVID, shit has been rough.\n\nI never told any of my professors about this because I was scared. My thought process was basically something along the lines of \u201cwhy would they care? It\u2019s not really their business, they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to help, etc etc\u201d.\nBecause of these issues, I have left classes early on several occasions. I am an art education student taking several hour long art classes this semester, they\u2019re mostly \u201cwork on your own project and clean up after you\u2019re done\u201d classes. I always try to do my work before I leave, but sometimes I fall a bit behind but catch back up. \n\nToday, a professor finally called me out for leaving early. During the class I missed a phone call from somebody relevant to the situation and left to go take care of things from my dorm. I felt absolutely awful and humiliated- I never wanted my professors to think I was trying to disrespect them.\n\nAfter reaching my dorm, I finally reached out to him. I explained everything but I still can\u2019t help but feel horrible. What if he doesn\u2019t believe me now? What if he doesn\u2019t care? What if I\u2019ve already dug myself a grave I can\u2019t get out of?\nNow I\u2019m just nervously staring at my screen waiting for an email back. I really hope things go well and he doesn\u2019t think if I\u2019m just trying to pull a last minute excuse out of no where. \n\nHas anybody else ever been in a similar situation? I\u2019m going to reach out to my other professors today too to let them know what\u2019s going on, as I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ve noticed too and get frustrated with me as well.\n\nWish me luck..\n\nTLDR: Family stuff makes me leave class early a lot and teacher finally called me out for it. I felt super bad and emailed him about whats going on, and now I nervously wait for a response.",
