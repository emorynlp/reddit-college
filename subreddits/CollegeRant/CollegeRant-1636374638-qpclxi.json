  "title:": "My University took away my Proposal.",
  "text": "My University is 3 years old. It's a new branch of an old famous College Institution in India. \n\nI (19M) initiated a proposal for having a student council in my university because there wasn't already and I wanted to lead.  I approached the University Management and they had me work on it for 6 FREAKING months and told me that they'd give me the President position for a start to see how things would work out. They had me make a dozen changes and ignored all the useful points which would benefit students.\n\nNow I'm not a random kid in college, I had started a club of 100 active students and was already doing internships in International companies and my Score was good. 9.4 CGPA out of 10.\n\nMy University has a bit weird structure, so I had to design roles and regulations of each individual and write like 10, 10-page rules, guidebooks, roles, and stuff...   After doing all that they told me to hand over the research and they would contact me when they would start the process.\n\nTHOSE FUCKERS DID NOT!\n\nThey went and took their own ass licking students, conducted their interviews, and gave them positions.  And using the same documents and the organizational structure. They didn't even bother to change a spelling error I had made!\n\nThey tell me now to work harder and try next time. and they answer to me like once in 2 months. I just want to tear apart everything I did and not let those fuckers use it.\n\nThey didn't even give me a mention for helping with the council.\n\nI was so pissed off I went ahead and made my own Data Science Club in the University with my girlfriend( 20F, same degree and Year ), also mention they also tried to stop me from starting it.\n\nThey wanted to merge it with a Software Development Club.\n\nMy University straight-up lies about the placements, opportunities, and stuff.\n\nI am so pissed Idk what to do now...",
