The problem is I have a car that I still need to pay off alongside some credit cards and bills. My parents are supportive of me going back but they can\u2019t help me financially so I need to maintain a full time job to be caught up with bills. Another rant I need to get out is the director of transfer students don\u2019t respond to my emails of getting me set-up with an advisor so that just makes me more content of not going to college this fall. Maybe I should just wait next year and get my car fully paid off and find another college that can actually respond.
