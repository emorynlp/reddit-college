To go back and try again? Do any universities allow second (or as you\u2019ll see soon in my case) even third or fourth chances? I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I haven\u2019t completed my first undergrad degree by now because it\u2019s always been a life goal of mine but I honestly don\u2019t know if my circumstances are keeping me doomed.\u00a0\n\nI was a great student in high school- good grades, top 10% of my over 1,000 class, very active in clubs, etc - and looked pretty great on paper by all accounts. I went straight into a big 10 university after graduating and immediately everything went downhill.\u00a0\n\nI was dealing with undiagnosed depression/PTSD and also in an extremely abusive relationship physically, sexually and mentally. My own issues were bad in the way it affected my performance but he made it impossible to pass or even attend classes at times. He would follow me or literally physically restrain me so that I could not leave my room. I never got sleep and he wouldn\u2019t let me work on my assignments or study. I lost a couple of competitive scholarships due to my performance starting to severely decline.\u00a0\n\nDuring this time I also cut off a lot of family due to childhood abuse as well so I didn\u2019t have any support systems or close friends. Anyways, things kept snowballing and since I couldn\u2019t afford therapy/help it just got worse until I was placed in academic probation and then ultimately dismissed from the school altogether. Eventually I got back in and enrolled a couple years later (I did it twice) but hadn\u2019t left the relationship yet or had I really received any help or created any changes in my life. Again I was kicked out, this time I\u2019m pretty sure permanently due to the school\u2019s code.\u00a0\n\nNow\u2026 I actually feel ready. Things aren\u2019t perfect of course, but so many things have changed. I\u2019m almost a 30 year old woman now. I\u2019m married and have stepkids in my life now that I\u2019m raising. I own a house and a car. I\u2019m not in an abusive relationship romantically or within my family anymore. I have a job. I\u2019ve ran my own business. I\u2019ve volunteered. I\u2019ve been in therapy and other self-help groups for quite a while now. Now I actually have academic dreams and goals that I feel are actually within my capabilities to achieve now. I could never say any of this before!\n\nBut now I feel stuck. I have an awful transcript that wouldn\u2019t get me in anywhere. I have a terrible track record of probation and dismissal. I was a terrible student then. But I\u2019m a different person now. I just don\u2019t have that much money. Are there any programs or opportunities for people in my position? And if so, what about grants or scholarships? I\u2019ve looked around but haven\u2019t had much luck at all. Any information or tips or even stories of success would help so much.\u00a0", "author": "toextheline", "created": 1631234489, "retrieved": 1632948587, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"hcdnl38": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/plafp2/second_chances_at_collegea_degree/hcdnl38/", "text": "I don\u2019t know where you are, but check your state regional 4-year schools.
