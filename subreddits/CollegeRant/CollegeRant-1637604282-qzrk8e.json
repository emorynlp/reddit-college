  "text": "So I\u2019m currently in my third year of getting my associates which already makes me feel pretty crappy for being behind everyone else around me. I go to community college right now to save some money and it also hurts sometimes seeing the cool college life all my past friends are living compared to my very mundane one. I\u2019m in a deep deep burnout and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIt started with bad medical problems that disallowed me to walk for a little bit. From there on out I\u2019ve practically avoided my classes and avoided any homework. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to do it but I don\u2019t have the motivation to. And now that I\u2019ve put it all off for the past couple weeks I\u2019m so anxious about going back because I feel like the professor will either think I\u2019m a loser or a bad student and I\u2019m just embarrassed. \n\nI\u2019m really stuck, my GPA is atrociously a 1.8, I don\u2019t even like my major anymore but can\u2019t afford to change it right now. Im lost. I don\u2019t have anyone else around me who\u2019s familiar with how college works or the technicalities so I don\u2019t know what to do. Ive tried reaching out to disability support services for some help but I have yet to hear back. \n\nTo summarize: I\u2019m behind, avoiding my work, and embarrassed to go back cause I feel like I look like a horrible student. I don\u2019t know how to pull through with a decent GPA to graduate and Im highly considering taking a break from college for a semester to get myself back on track with my life. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or has been through something similar? Has a break ever worked for anyone else?",

      "text": "Questioning your degree concentration is a VERY common problem to have. So is money. It's also possible your health problems may get you a little extra slack.\n\nYour college should have student representatives/advocates/counselors who you can talk to about your problems. If you're not sure how to proceed, you can just ask them \"hey I have this problem and I'm not sure what to do\" and they'll give you advice. Being unsure is very common, and helping students is their job. It's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nJust look in your student handbook directory or on your college's website directory for something that sounds like \"student representative/advocate/counselor.\" The names may vary.\n\nMy college experience was also very boring; I lived off campus and had zero dollars for entertainment. It's probably more common than you think. Fun stories may be exaggerated..",
