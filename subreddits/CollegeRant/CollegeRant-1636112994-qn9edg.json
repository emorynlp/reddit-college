  "text": "A freshman I know has plans to change their major to Bio, but just dropped the Bio class they were in this semester because they couldn\u2019t keep up with all of the work. They were taking 12 credit hours, now after dropping bio they are taking 8. For next semester, they have registered for 16 credit hours, and Bio is one of them. Should I be concerned? I\u2019m worried that next semester might be this persons breaking point.",

There are things you can do to help yourself succeed like using quizlet, saving PDFs and reviewing every night and going to tutoring/office hours if you need it.\n\nIt really depends on the class load and the prof when it comes to credits. I\u2019ve had 3 credit classes that were a walk in the park, and 3 credit classes that were hell on earth. Just make sure to drop before the W date if it\u2019s too much.",
