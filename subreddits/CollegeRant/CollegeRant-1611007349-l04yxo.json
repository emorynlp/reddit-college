When I log in today I see the professor sent another email explaining how to register. Like how fffff difficult it is for a person to read the syllabus. I don\u2019t get how this people are even passing their classes. The amount of laziness I seen when I was going to live classes at my community classes was unreal. I seen so many red screen student begging the professor for more time people asking for better grade. Like Bxxxx Teachers are not your parents if you don\u2019t want a bad grade do your work. This shot is plain and simple college is hard, professors are not your parents and lastly if you don\u2019t do no work you fail plain and simple.

A lot of HS students did get by with everything, like look at what grade you need to pass HS, I think a D counted. So doing the minimum work conditioned some students to believe that was enough. In college student learn that the schools not going to hold your hand. Also, the other stigma about a CC is that it's easier than a university when in reality it's not. If you only take freshman lvl classes I see why they think it's easier than the university, but in reality, those classes are most of the time taught with the same material. \n\nI'm glad I had mostly teachers that enforced the rules. I was pissed when one teacher allowed 5 students who didn't notify him that they would miss the exam to do the same makeup exam in his office without supervision. My other classes would just give you a zero.", "author": "elocinkrob", "created": 1611011265, "upvotes": 9}, "gjrld05": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l04yxo/lazy_students/gjrld05/", "text": "A lot of colleges are basically you just paying for your degree. If students aren\u2019t forced to think then they aren\u2019t forced to get better. They will continue to stay lazy and they will continue to do the bare minimum. The professor you mention is an enabler. Something like that should be mentioned once and that\u2019s it. \n\nHell, just wait for the group projects. Fuck I hate those.
