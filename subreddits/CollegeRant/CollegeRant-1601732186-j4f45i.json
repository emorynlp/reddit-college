My terms are in 8 weeks instead of the usual 16 weeks, meaning I take 2 classes every 8 weeks. I thought this would be better than the usual 5 I pile on each semester, but it really hasn't helped my study/learning skills any. Last year I did pretty decent in school, with a 3.9 gpa. This year I still have A's in both my classes, but I don't feel like I'm learning??? My classes are online by choice, not because of Covid. I work full time and my schedule isn't flexible for work, so I needed my school schedule to be. I get off at 6pm every day, leaving me with 3-4 hours a night of homework or study time. But I dread coming home to do homework every single day. And my two days off a week consist of doing chores/running errands and homework. Leaving me almost no time for myself or others. I mean, I just cut my toenails for the first time yesterday in a month or two because I literally feel like I can't even find the time to care for myself due to my packed schedule.\n\nI often find myself procrastinating until the day before, or even the day of, any assignments or tests because I hate doing school work after regular work. I feel like the world around me is one huge clusterf*ck and it's making it really hard for me to focus in school when I feel like I'm in constant anxiety mode because of what's going on around me.\n\nAnyone else feel like this? Like school's not enjoyable to learn this year because of the mess around us? Or maybe it's just my poor time management skills or packed schedule. Tell me I'm not crazy please.", "author": "WTF-is-even-going-on", "created": 1601732186, "retrieved": 1632843343, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g7keeqw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j4f45i/any_one_else_skating_by/g7keeqw/", "text": "Oh, my goodness, yes!\n\nI can seriously relate to the toenail thing.  Trying to do the basic self-care has somehow dropped to the absolute bottom of my priority list below school and work and maintaining a LDR.

I always try to get assignments done the day before the due dates (especially big assignments) but I'm leaving it to the last second. Not all of them. But I'm doing all the short easy stuff then not touching my books the rest of the week til it's all due. It feels like a huge burden to even pull out my school stuff. But the fact that I have work constantly hangs over my head. I know it's not the same as having a job, however I did work and do comm classes as well last year.
