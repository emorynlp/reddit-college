  "text": "Some people just choose a random major. Some people just know what they want to do (i envy those). I just picked being an art major cuz I hated my art classes the least in high school. \n\nI took photoshop and illustrator classes throughout high school and middle school, and I got pretty good with using those. WHen I was picking my major, I chose it because a lot of the courses I would have to take in it involve using those two programs. \n\nYet when I actually got here, using those two programs got put onto the back burner, cuz my profs wanted us to learn how to use paint, how to draw, etc. I haven't failed any projects, but they are definitely lackluster.\n\nidk im just ranting about the irony of me being an art major, yet when it comes to major skills needed to be an artist, im sorely lacking. \n\nive also just mentally checked out of school, i graduated high school in 2020, and so far college has been absolute ass.\n\nim getting straight A's, but im just so burned out and tired all the time. in my non art classes im putting literally no effort in, still have A's, but still feel like im not using them to their fullest potential, but i just dont care anymore. \n\nok thanks for reading bye yall good luck",

      "text": "I'm in the final year of my art degree and I can tell you straight up, you don't need to be fantastic at drawing to get anywhere. So long as you can vaguely illustrate any ideas you have, you'll be ok. There are people on my course who are seriously not very good with drawing but it doesn't really matter, as long as they convey whatever they're trying to through their work. Maybe it's different with your course, but I've found that my lecturers love it when  you waffle about other artists who inspire you, what movements you're interested in, etc, etc. They like some research behind the work. \"I made this series of drawings because I came across work by (insert artist) and was really interested in their style/subject matter/etc.\"\n\nIs there an option to pick something like photography within your art major? If so, I'd go for that (that's what I'm doing lol) If not, just show them you're trying you're best and that there's research/substance behind the work; i.e. you didn't just make a random picture.",

      "text": "Industrial Designer here \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb\nAt my college I work closely with some CD majors like yourself. I totally get what your going through, this year has been extremely difficult and it\u2019s hard to care about a class outside of art let alone a major you just \u201cpicked\u201d. (Also yeah those foundation classes suck ass)\nI\u2019m in ID but I\u2019m a figure sculptor at heart and just kinda just picked the major because I thought it would be a good fit. From the course I can draw products alright but I\u2019ve always been sculpting shit on the side and it felt awful not to care as much as others did about the major we all picked. But i still went through it and found a branch of design that does sculpting which I fell in love with. Maybe touch base with your professors about this and ask if there is a different branch of CD you can enjoy. \nAlso don\u2019t feel bad about drawing, most of my classmates can draw power tools but if you asked them to draw literally anything else they have to trace it.",
