And honestly.... I can't feel sorry for professors because if you're charging hundreds of dollars to recycle questions you didn't write a student will recycle answers they didn't make. \n\nSome professors try to combat this by making the time limits more tight but all that does is incentivize cheating which they don't seem to realize.\n\nFurthermore a lot of professors are assigning more work than usual or making tests harder than usual which AGAIN DOES NOT DISUADE CHEATING, it encourages it! \n\nAnd finally so so many professors are just reading powerpoint slides. The \"I don't care\" attitude makes students not care either. And the worst is when the slides don't even cover the topic fully. So what do you do? You look elsewhere for help and in doing so you might consider looking for the solution while you're at it.\n\nI'd argue the way to disuade cheating is to write your own questions, teach what's needed, and include all the relevant information in the class material (don't just say \"read the textbook\").", "author": "Zarfa", "created": 1612821578, "upvotes": 3}, "gmm25cn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lf0a2w/do_you_think_theres_been_an_increase_in_cheating/gmm25cn/", "text": "Yea, I dont mind tho lol.\n\nLets be honest, college is a scam.
