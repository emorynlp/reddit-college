The references are all over the place, the layout is fucked and it was like 1000 words under the word count... I figured it's better to submit something rather than nothing but I feel genuinely ashamed of it. I don't know whether to email my professor to apologise or try and delete it from turnitin or what. I submitted it at 16:29, the term ends (hence the absolute cutoff) was 16:30. I feel like an absolute knob. What's worse is I didn't even manage to submit one of my final pieces- I almost wish I'd done that one instead because at least I could have done a better job (as it was a smaller project)\n\nI'm going to try and access summer resits but I don't know how likely they'll be to accept as this is (meant to be) my final year. I was so fucking close.
