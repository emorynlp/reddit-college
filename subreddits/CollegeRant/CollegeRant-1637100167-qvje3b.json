  "text": " Ok I need a place to vent. I'm nearly 5 1/2 years into my undergrad degree as a Marine Bio major and this has been the worst continuous decision of my life. 1 credit away from graduating but I'm not going to pass the class and am going to have to spend another semester doing the same thing again. I was genuinely excited to pursue a career in science until college where it was useless class after useless class even when factoring in a future in the field. The longer I stay here, the more it becomes clear that lecture courses are almost completely unnecessary and teach you no skills that you will retain in the future. The fact that a 1 credit physics lab is holding me back is infuriating. The emphasis they have on manually doing error propagation is ridiculous, coupled with the fact that they don't teach you how to do it. Not only has my time in college killed my want to enter my field of choice, I am now trapped by opportunity cost to finish my degree out. I completely understand the importance of physics when it comes to grasping the underlying reality of the universe. However, the antiquated content and methods of teaching nearly every subject is honestly a joke. Lectures teach no valuable skills in most classes and cram an ungodly amount of content into a time frame that will leave you retaining almost nothing anyway. This is all my personal experience and opinion but I am unbelievably frustrated with the system and the negative impacts it has had on my life.",
