  "text": "Hi guys. I just want to hear some opinions or advice on my situation. I'll try to keep it brief. Thanks in advance for any tips you can give me :)\n\nAll of my classes this year are in-person, and I spent all last year immunocompromised and doing hybrid classes. Switching back to f2f has kicked my ass and I am left tired, sad, and guilty for not wanting to go. I miss at least two classes a week (out of total 13 meetings) and I keep telling myself stupid reasons for why I shouldn't go. \"I am so tired, because I just got diagnosed with anemia. I need to rest.\" or \"I am just feeling so sad today. I don't want to go.\" to even more pathetic excuses like \"I don't want to have to deal with the heavy wind and cold on my way there.\"\n\nI feel like a dickhole and totally pathetic. I scream at myself in my head \"Go to class! Just go to class! It's not that bad!\" and sometimes I am able to convince myself. Sometimes I can't.\n\nI have As in all my classes right now, so I'm not concerned about my grades. I just feel bad because I don't want to hurt my professors' feelings, or hurt my participation grade.\n\nThis is my penultimate semester and I have one more after this. Any advice on how to pull up my bootstraps and convince myself once and for all to just go to class? I find it so hard to peel myself from my bed and just get stuff done. All I want to do is be at home all day and sleep or read. And it's gotta stop. I just need a pep talk or fire in the ass or something like that. \n\nThanks again. Hope you all are surviving.\n\nTl;dr: my emotional brain is a bitch ass motherfucker and my logical brain can't make the dumb bitch listen",
