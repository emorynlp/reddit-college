I just want to ask or get some advice regarding the question above about my professor. \n\nI am kinda bothered by the fact that my professor wants us to answer an activity and take a quiz without them discussing the current lesson. They want us to like \u201cself-study\u201d the subject.\nAnd after we answer those, that would be the time that they will discuss or just give the summary of the lesson. \n\nFor example, today is July 28th. My professor will give the module on Friday which is the 30th. After that, we have an activity and quiz, their due date is on August 3rd which is a Tuesday. Then on August 4th, that\u2019s the day that they will discuss. \n\nEspecially now that we are in an online set-up, they would only give us modules and videos from youtube that I could search by myself. I want to email them about this but I am afraid that they will straight up say to me that I am questioning their way of teaching. But I am really fed up with their methods, what I do right now is self study, read the module, find a book that is about the subject, and search stuff that I think would help widen my horizons, and I am thinking that I am wasting money paying for my tuition because I could do these by myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you guys also have this kind of set-up like activities and quizzes first-before the discussion typa thing, but how would I learn and understand the subject \u201cdeeply\u201d. \n\nLikeeee the reason why I enrolled is to learn the subject/course with the help of the professors because I don\u2019t have a background knowledge about it, what happeneddddd?\n\nI just want to e-mail them to suggest if they should discuss first before giving us tasks and quizzes. Please help me decide \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude4f Thank you very much!!!!\n\nUpdate:\n\nHey guys, I\u2019ve read your comments already and I thank ya\u2019ll for changing my views regarding this matter. I somewhat realized that everything was spoon-fed to us which is why we are currently having a hard time with this method. Also, the flipped classroom approach that you guys mentioned wasn\u2019t really practiced in our college, we got accustomed to the traditional one. It\u2019s just saddening because we answer an activity even though we\u2019re not sure about certain things and sometimes end up get the wrong answers. We also make sure that we do advanced readings prior to the discussion because we wouldn\u2019t want to come for it without being prepared. Nonetheless, I appreciate your responses and I\u2019ll try my very best to adjust with this kind of set-up and figure out what\u2019s the best learning style for me.\n\nHave a great day and keep safe!", "author": "meadowixchel", "created": 1627456221, "retrieved": 1632841703, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"h6syshy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ot4ulk/should_i_email_my_professor_regarding_their_way/h6syshy/", "text": "Thank you u/meadowixchel for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
