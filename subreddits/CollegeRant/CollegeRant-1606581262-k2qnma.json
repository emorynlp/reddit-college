So I sent her an email with my paper attached and told her \u2018I\u2019m emailing you my paper instead of using turnitin because you can\u2019t seem to help your students when they email you about needing a class ID and class key. I already paid 11$ to check for plagiarism, there is none (attached photo of 0 plagiarism being detected).\u201d\n\nEdit: she gave me a 0 for my paper because I didn\u2019t use TURNITIN, which I need a class ID and class key to access. Currently on the phone with my advisor about the situation.\n\nEdit: thank you for the reward, I will look at it as my 100% on my paper instead of the 0 in the grade book \u2764\ufe0f because I worked too damn hard on that paper and did not deserve the 0. Again thank you. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nTriple edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/k2f57o/fed_up_with_my_psychology_teacher/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nHere is the link to my first post from last night. I am not in the wrong. And do not call me the wanker when you did not take the time to find my other post from last night. Thank you.\n\nI have now posted the syllabus on my account. No where in it does it give you the key and she only talks about the damn paper once.\n\nLast edit: she changed the grade to a 98 and apologized for not getting back sooner, she said she thought she put this information on the syllabus and ignored my email because she believed I did not read the syllabus, which again did not have any information besides the fact the paper needed to be 6 pages excluding cover and citation pages with scientific research. My grade is back up to a 89 and I can actually say I passed this course and I do not need to repeat it ever again. Thank you to those who were just as pissed as I was, and I hope the people who disagreed with this have this issue happen to them :)) lmao \ud83d\ude02", "author": "opaldopal12", "created": 1606581262, "retrieved": 1632842801, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 244, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gdzjp2n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k2qnma/basically_told_my_teacher_she_sucked/gdzjp2n/", "text": "It\u2019s funny because whenever I have to put up with BS from my professor and I rant to my parents they say \u201cwelcome to college\u201d.

I'm not saying you're wrong either, but we definitely don't have the full picture (and I did see your other post too.) \n\nIf you genuinely feel like she's a bad professor then reach out to the rest of your class.
