  "text": "My goal was to go to medical school and become a psychiatrist, but my mental health became so bad (depression, anxiety, ADHD, drama). My grades were all A\u2019s and B\u2019s but now I have multiple C\u2019s, and I feel like I won\u2019t get into med school. I\u2019m also struggling with math courses and I feel so stupid compared to everyone else. I don\u2019t know what else to do career wise, and my undergrad is in psychology. \n\nTL;DR: I have C\u2019s now due to bad mental health, discouraged from med school.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar boat that my mental health is taking a hit since transferring to an in person university. This school just isn\u2019t supportive of my neuro-diverse learning style. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to get a few c\u2019s this semester if I don\u2019t do something about it (meds or counseling, idk).\n\nFor you, you can get your gpa up after graduation with a post bac program. There\u2019s a bunch of university extension programs geared especially for pre-meds.",
