So I\u2019ve made the decision to drop out of four year university after this spring semester ends. I have a full time retail job back home and I\u2019m gonna save up for an apartment with my friend. I realized that although I am interested in my major (criminal justice), I really have no idea what I want to do with my life career-wise, and I don\u2019t want to get locked into a path I don\u2019t want. I have plenty of time to decide and I can go back to school at any point when I figure it out. I might reenroll in community college next spring to finish out my associates degree. I realized that college right out of hs really isn\u2019t for everybody and there\u2019s no reason to stay here and push myself into something I don\u2019t really want and waste my time and money doing it.", "author": "wannabeemolita", "created": 1611354665, "retrieved": 1632843599, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 30, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gk93bz3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l2ys8w/dropping_out/gk93bz3/", "text": "Thank you u/wannabeemolita for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
