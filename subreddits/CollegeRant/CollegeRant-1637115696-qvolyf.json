  "text": "As we all have come to the remaining of the semester, some of us get the joy of continuing and overs moving on. Yeah real fucking great right? I have now realized that my self taught learning which I have been doing for the last three semesters has becoming such a damn burden on my life as a whole. During my associates It was a gay old time to sit in class and learn, stare off at what ever is happening out the window, yet somehow still feel better with learning and grades, could have been the face to face which gave me that \u201ccollege dream\u201d. Now half of my classes are online and it becomes this damn struggle on what I feel like learning compared to the rest of the class. As an English major i sit around all day and read books and write my critical thoughts, now I feel like I have become bored of it. It happens often in all my semesters, but this one has hit the hardest for me overall.",

I feel like the world has gone to shit. \n\nSociety built factions and social paradigms. \n\nBro. Real shit. I want to go back to swinging on vines running from predators. I\u2019m tired of this meaningless shit. \n\nI do x amount of work. In reality, it means absolutely nothing because all my contributions to GDP is negated by political idiots. So when I die, life will be meaningless. \n\nSuch bullshit.",
