Ever since the professor incharge of the club has been back bitching about me so I confronted her. I told her that it was the entire team\u2019s decision to move ahead with the session as we already waited for 5 mins during the webinar for the dean to figure her tech out. I told this professor that I respected both of them etc etc. After that long ass write up she replies to me with a \u201cthat\u2019s so nice of you\u201d. I replied with \u201cthank you for understanding and responding simultaneously.\u201d\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand what issues these professors have. When they fuck up they blame it on technical difficulties but when it\u2019s from our end or if it can be blamed upon us they leave no chance to do so. The fact that this professor still did not understand the situation is immature and wrong on so many levels. Lol she could\u2019ve straight up spoken to me after the webinar but nope had to go back bitching to my senior about it who obviously got into trouble cause I confronted this professor. So now that senior and I also don\u2019t talk. :)", "author": "Apotropaicbean", "created": 1622602766, "retrieved": 1632949768, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"h0kf8xm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nqbpzb/egoistic_professors/h0kf8xm/", "text": "How do you know she\u2019s been \u201cback bitching\u201d you?", "author": "xohwhyx", "created": 1622814528, "upvotes": 1}}}
