I\u2019ve been to three different colleges within a year and half span, then went to cosmetology school. I withdrew from all of them because I hated it. So I took a year off to work and figure myself out more and now I\u2019m starting this fall. Again. Basically as a freshman. I got in to the program that I was very passionate about but now I\u2019m already starting to reconsider...and that was my issue the previous time. My family is very excited about the program I\u2019m in, but the more I think about it, the more nervous I get about getting a job after school. I don\u2019t know what to do about picking my major and I\u2019m very scared that I\u2019m going to end up working my same dead end job for the rest of my life. I want to go to school and get a degree. I\u2019m very passionate about having the freedom to learn and get an education, but I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just stick to one thing and finish it. I have ADHD/ADD and I feel like my hyper-fixation plays a large role in all of this. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can just stick to my major or how to actually decide on what I want to do. I\u2019m desperate to avoid failure again.\n\nTL;DR: 21 y/o can\u2019t decide on what to do with her life and is afraid of failing...again.", "author": "lexlacking", "created": 1597569269, "retrieved": 1632951454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"g1tcs14": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iapcuc/feeling_like_a_failureagain/g1tcs14/", "text": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re experiencing a lot of pressure and anxiety, I can\u2019t aid you in deciding what path is right for you. But this is one piece of advice I have found to ring true throughout my own life and in the lives of my loved ones;\n\nIf you are working towards a goal, you are on the track for happiness. Being a content/happy person isn\u2019t always about reaching that end-zone of your dream career and it isn\u2019t always about achieving a wild ambition. \n\nSome people have strong solid ideas of what they want in life, and they chase it. I wish those people the best of luck. Some people don\u2019t know what they want, and they chase nothing, and it is a recipe for misery. \n\nEveryone lives differently, and everyone\u2019s happiness is different, but don\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t stop pushing. Keep following this path and interact with other people on this path. You\u2019ll likely find some folks who have a lot of valuable information to offer you. Perhaps they once were where you are now, and can shed some light on the options in front of you.\n\nHaving a path, even if it isn\u2019t perfect, is better than being aimless. You will find much more joy in pursuing self-development than you will in working until you can *definitively* decide what you want out of life. \n\nJust always keep pushing forward, always keep building connections. And above all, always keep loving and respecting yourself, and seeking out the best for yourself.

Dropping out of what you started before may mean this new track will lead you down something really cool. You never have to stick with one thing, you could do this new course and finish it and then never use it! But it is always good to try and get some qualifications and get going with life. It will give you focus for a while and give you time to think about waht you want to do. Just try to have a good time whilst doing it - go out, have some hobbies, otherwise you will get bored of the course.
