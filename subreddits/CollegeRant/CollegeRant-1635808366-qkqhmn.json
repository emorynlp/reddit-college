  "text": "Don't wanna make this post too long, but I've been having trouble getting used to studying for exams and general homework assignments. I stay in my room for hours just making notes to use, and even then I get nervous. It's to the point that my family thinks I should drop out. I got a huge financial aid deal so I really don't wanna waste it. This is my *freshman year.*\n\nHonestly, any advice is appreciated. I just wish things would slow down.\n\nTL:DR, I'm losing my mind over assignments and exams. Send help.",

      "text": "Make time in your schedule for officer hours, prioritizing the ones for classes you\u2019re struggling the most in. Like literally go to all the office hours/study halls and just work on getting hw done, it\u2019ll be easier since ppl are there to help and since its 1on1 you\u2019ll probably understand the work more. \n\nAs for studying for exams it\u2019s something everyone struggles with their first year, maybe try making a study sheet at the end of each week for the material you learned and studying those up until the exam instead of making notes to study so soon before the exam. \n\nAnd maybe don\u2019t spend so much time in your room, for me personally nothing good ever happens in my room, try out different libraries and lounges for studying, being around ppl who are also studying might help you focus more. \n\nAs for dropping out idk, if you feel like you won\u2019t survive then it might be best to take a year off and come back so you don\u2019t waste money but since it\u2019s your first semester I\u2019d say it\u2019s just you still adjusting.",
