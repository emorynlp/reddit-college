I thought I was paying for a monthly membership, turns out the total equaled out to $9 a month for a year\u2026I feel so dumb, I did it in a dazed state in attempt to help with my burnout but now it\u2019s made my stress worse. I charged it onto my credit card so I\u2019m going to attempt to dispute it for misleading information and services not rendered but we\u2019ll see. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Tip: I haven\u2019t done this in a few months so not sure if rules are stricter now, but you can get free unlocks by uploading documents. They don\u2019t have to be real! Just use a \u201crandom essay generator\u201d or type something random into 1+ page(s) and upload it to CH. I think every 10 successful uploads gets you 5 free unlocks. You should upload them to a course that isn\u2019t popular though so you don\u2019t annoy other students (they might report your docs or something), discontinued courses work best",
