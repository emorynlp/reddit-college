Now I\u2019m stuck in a lease paying full rent when all of my classes are online. On top of all of that I shouldn\u2019t move back to school anyway because I have asthma and am at a high risk. So what do I do? Pay rent for an apartment I\u2019m not using or risk getting sick? Either way these greedy companies are making out with money from college kids who don\u2019t have any to begin with.", "author": null, "created": 1596752987, "retrieved": 1632843245, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g0pajcf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i51rxn/apartment_companies_that_dont_let_us_out_of_our/g0pajcf/", "text": "I get the frustration but the whole reason that you sign a lease is because plans can go sideways and they need you to commit to paying for the rent so they can pay their bills and employees. If you could just drop out because something happened to your plans (i.e. your classes moving to online) then there wouldn't be a lease. Its frustrating but you made a legal agreement to be responsible for the rent.

Try to see if you can sublet / relet it to someone else. That saved my ass from overpaying / paying for something that I don't even need.
