  "text": "TL;DR: loved studying pol in high school. Disliking it in college most probably cause of the people. How to get back to loving it?\n\nMost of my high school life I\u2019ve been obsessed with studying political science and international affairs. Not like with the intention of joining politics but more like academically. But now once I\u2019ve entered college, idk anymore. I have this one course that is supposed to be directly linked to what I love learning but I\u2019m really disliking the course. Part of the reason is that this course has SEVERAL people I find highly annoying - loud, spams chat, constantly cuts off professors, there to ONLY impose their opinion and not to mutually learn. I feel like this is one of the causes but I\u2019m really finding it hard to love the subject. I haven\u2019t opened the newspaper in 2 months. I haven\u2019t done extra readings I used to love. All in all haven\u2019t done anything pol related I used to love to do. Idk what to do anymore. This feeling really scares me. Because idk if I like anything else. Is this an academic slump?  Idk. Cause what scares me most is that it\u2019s highly probable most pol related courses will have people like this because pol can be a very opinionated field. So what do I do? If it\u2019s a slump how do I get out of it? If it\u2019s not what do I do?Any advice? Suggestions? Please :::::::(",

      "text": "I\u2019m no pol-sci major, but what I can say is to talk to professors in your classes, maybe they can find more things for you to read or do something outside of class. There\u2019s a good chance that they probably feel the same way as you do, especially when their students keep interrupting them. This is also a good way to find out if your professors share the same passion you have/had. And don\u2019t be afraid to express your concerns to them, good chance they\u2019ll understand. Also talk to your academic counselors/advisors about how you feel as well. Also don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends around too, they could help you find connections with professors as well! \n\nSorry if I sound redundant, am still waking up. Hope this will help!",
