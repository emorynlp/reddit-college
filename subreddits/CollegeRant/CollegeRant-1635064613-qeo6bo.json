  "text": "I\u2019ve had to write 2 essays so far for this class. And for both of the grades, it is the exact same grade as the grade on grammarly. I don\u2019t know if this was a coincidence but I doubt it was. Then my professor just makes up stuff about why I got the grade I did. For example, on my most recent essay he said that my paper was over the page limit. But it wasn\u2019t and took off points. He also said I didn\u2019t follow the reference formatting but he literally said we could cite with the citation style of our choice. Sooo is this like a normal thing for professors to do, to just upload essays to grammarly and give the grade that\u2019s on grammarly?",
