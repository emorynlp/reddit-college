The man is insane. I found out the way another professor weighs his grades and it was the icing on the cake. Between the insane amount of homework with the unrealistic due dates (less than 2 days to complete), the fact that the grading break down is 80% exams and 20% home assignments and his general mind fu*k style of behind-the-screen berating and verbal abuse; I just can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing, and I feel sad to make this choice, but when you can\u2019t see any path to success, what else can ya do? I can\u2019t suffer this way and STILL fail. It\u2019ll be my first W, and I think it will be well spent. \n\nThanks for letting me share.", "author": "Stellablu12", "created": 1632723775, "retrieved": 1632948393, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "comments": {"hejcioh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwbavq/taking_the_w/hejcioh/", "text": "Dude I\u2019m in the same boat!
