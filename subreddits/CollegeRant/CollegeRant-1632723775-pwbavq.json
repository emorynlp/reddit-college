  "text": "Well, I was here complaining about my pre calculus teacher the other day; and I think I need to trust my gut on this one. \n\nI\u2019m going to drop with a W tomorrow. The man is insane. I found out the way another professor weighs his grades and it was the icing on the cake. Between the insane amount of homework with the unrealistic due dates (less than 2 days to complete), the fact that the grading break down is 80% exams and 20% home assignments and his general mind fu*k style of behind-the-screen berating and verbal abuse; I just can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing, and I feel sad to make this choice, but when you can\u2019t see any path to success, what else can ya do? I can\u2019t suffer this way and STILL fail. It\u2019ll be my first W, and I think it will be well spent. \n\nThanks for letting me share.",

She\u2019s the only one that teaches the fucking course. \n\nAt least I\u2019ll save all the hws and use them\nAhead of time so when I take her again at least I\u2019ll be 4 hws ahead and always try to stay ahead.",

They say this is a weeder course- it just sucks because I feel like they hardly even \u201cteach.\u201d Def don\u2019t lose the hw you\u2019ve already done. I plan on taking some of this time to go over the book and also review trig so that I can feel better next semester. Sigh",

It\u2019s just so awkward being that I\u2019ll have to be back again. But I\u2019ll just tell her I\u2019m just too overwhelmed this semester. \nDo you also have to your prof sign the withdrawal form ?\n\nAlso I\u2019m kinda prolonging taking the W because I wanna get all the assignments she wants so I\u2019ll do them ahead of time for next time",

His deadlines and the 80% of the grade being exams just made it super difficult. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for sticking it out a bit. It was just crushing my sanity, so I needed to drop when I did. I have so much more time now. That class was taking up 30 hours of my week. \n\nLuckily the book we used was a free one, and I can still access it. I need to go back a review trig also (they do two different courses trig then pre calc Where I am). \n\nGives me the scaries for next semester, but I do believe I can do it. Hoping for a better grade spread, professor and less classes.\n\nGood luck!",
