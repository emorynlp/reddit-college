Learn from failures but also engage your class and teacher, it never hurts to be proactive because YOU are paying for it. Think of it like school is a product that you really wanted and you paid for, if that doesn't spark a want to do your courses then switch your major to something that interests you. Also another huge piece of advice, get past your first two years and it gets waaaaay better. These are the years that are known as proving grounds to get to the juicy stuff and weed out knuckledraggers. \n\nSome people are just more technical minded and need to build on that first in their life, so if this is you don't sweat it. You actually have a good chance to make more money early in life than a college grad likely will in their first 5 years out of college. Get a good job that maybe pays for education and you will be in the juxtaposition to come out on top.
