  "text": "I had two bitch ass exams this week and the work just keeps piling up. I was so tired I decided to catch up on sleep instead of going to a modeling class.\n\nThe professor is pretty lenient and chill, and he understands that this material is very unfamiliar to a majority in this class. The homework is unbelievably hard though UGH.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure he won\u2019t let any of us fail, but this last assignment is due tonight and I just can\u2019t turn it in. I\u2019m about halfway through and I don\u2019t know how to answer the rest of the homework, I\u2019ve scanned through this old goddamn textbook too many times, I haven\u2019t found the EXACT formulas I need.\n\nI\u2019m in a rut with this homework, so I sent him an email regarding his late hw policy, that is, if he has one. This is just as a formality though. He lets us turn in homework after the due date to correct any mistakes we\u2019ve made on any previous submissions, which is really neat.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m not genuinely worried just yet, but I guess this is a consequence of skipping class :/. Damn, it\u2019s the only day I was absent too. Oh well, I have to go over my other homework\u2019s with him personally anyway, might as well add this to the list.\n\n\nMaaaaaaaan screw college, I hate this shit.",
