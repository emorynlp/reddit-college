  "text": "Since I live in a dorm, and we do have a community fridge, it was appalling to see people stealing my food. And by food, I mean uncooked, raw food with my name written on it which I try to cook but unfortunately they steal it.  I usually see the remains of it in the trash, and it seems they eat it uncooked. Just this morning saw one of my Jimmy Dean breakfast bowls left on the kitchen counter unopened while the other one was opened mostly eaten uncooked. Food is going to be stolen right? But wait there's more! They also steal my underwear, socks, or shirts from the dryer, someone stole my bike recently, and just about anything you could think of can get stolen because people FUCKING suck! I am so damn tired of these spoiled rich, trust fund kids stealing my goddamn stuff that I work to earn the money for! Fuck these pieces of shit! People be acting like toddlers over here and don't act like they have common sense. Even the RAs are stressed out because of how shitty they act! Sometimes I feel like I am around a bunch of Neanderthals and do not feel like I am around college students. Can't wait to leave this hellhole!",
