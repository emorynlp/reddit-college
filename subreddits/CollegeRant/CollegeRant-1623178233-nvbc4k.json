It\u2019s a math class so we have 30+ questions due everyday (weekends and everything) plus quizzes and tests on top of them. My problem is she assigns the due date at 5:00pm everyday. As someone who also has a job 5pm is super inconsiderate. I\u2019m literally not going to be able to do my assignment for today because I work 8-4:30. I\u2019m probably overreacting but I was expecting assignments due at midnight like always so I\u2019d at least have a shot to complete them.", "author": "tate3223", "created": 1623178233, "retrieved": 1632842255, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h127dbn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvbc4k/is_my_professor_inconsiderate_or_am_i_overreacting/h127dbn/", "text": "Thank you u/tate3223 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If an assignment is due at midnight, most professors aren't going to be available to help for the last 7+ hours.  Is it possible for you to get a day ahead, so you're doing the next day's questions when you get home from work?\n\nMy approach is to have all the assignments due at the end of the module, so students can decide when to do the work.  But I don't teach math, so it's possible that the material builds off earlier content, which requires more structured deadlines.", "author": "ksuprof", "created": 1623179508, "upvotes": 9}, "h12a66e": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvbc4k/is_my_professor_inconsiderate_or_am_i_overreacting/h12a66e/", "text": "At my university, our summer courses are 5 weeks long. That means we have to cover 15 weeks of material in 5 weeks.\n\nIn a normal 15 week academic semester a 3 credit course means we have 3 contact hours in the classroom with the students. In a semester, that is 45 contact hours in the classroom. I also expect each students to spend at least 2 hours outside of class studying for every hour in class. So in a normal 15 week academic semester, I expect students to put in 135+ hours of work over a 15 week period.\n\nThe expectation is the same for a shortened summer course. Students are expected to put in 135+ hour of work, but in a 5 week period. That's why students rarely take more than 1 or 2 courses in a summer.\n\nYour professor is not being inconsiderate. She's working to cover 15 weeks of material in 5 weeks.", "author": "metal_bulb", "created": 1623179394, "upvotes": 10}}}
