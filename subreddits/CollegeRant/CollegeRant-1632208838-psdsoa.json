We have school website and emails, but noooo. Everything about class is informed at the last min. If we had a class at 9 am today and it got cancelled/postponed? We\u2019d only know at 8.30 am that day. Every new semester, we\u2019d always wait until the last day before break ends to have our new timetable and to register for our subjects. Even the timetable they give out is not even fully dependable. They\u2019ll give a timetable for all the students in diploma, degree or masters. It doesn\u2019t follow your classes or anything. Some subjects in the timetable aren\u2019t even offered during the time. (We\u2019d register online and the subjects shown aren\u2019t even in the list) It honestly feels like I\u2019m wasting my time in this college because I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything. I regret entering this college and even entering the field I\u2019m in. I want to cry and scream so much but every time I tell this to my parents. They\u2019ll just shrug it off. They\u2019ll say \u201cthat\u2019s normal\u201d. I feel invalidated all the time and I can\u2019t even see a future with this college. 2 years feels like the amount of time I have left to live. It\u2019s so draining and tiring, like I\u2019d drop dead any minute. But I can\u2019t change courses, I can\u2019t change college. My parents say it\u2019s already been paid. \n\nTl:dr\nMy college makes me have existential crisis because they never give any information within time, can\u2019t even do a freaking timetable right and my parents just tell me to bear with it.", "author": "TenshiHope", "created": 1632208838, "retrieved": 1632840991, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdoy4i8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psdsoa/my_college_is_so_incompetent/hdoy4i8/", "text": "Thank you u/TenshiHope for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
