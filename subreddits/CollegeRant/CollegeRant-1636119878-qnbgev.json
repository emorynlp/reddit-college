  "title:": "Rejected form MITACS Research Internship",
  "text": "You know how you spend months polishing up you CV and then even more time making the SoP for your application and doing everything right and having the right research experience and all the right things. And then after submitting your application and having gotten the best LoRs you could have and knowing you did everything right. All that's left for you to do is wait. Waiting by waking up everyday morning to check your email to check if they chose you. In the end one evening while you enjoy your coffee on the roof of your home casually scrolling through your phone and suddenly a notification sound. You have one new email . Opening email knowing its from mitacs, All your effort that you did all the time you spent correcting the slightest of mistakes and test out different words and tones for your application and in the end what did it boil down to? \"We will not be moving forward with your application\". You think to yourself this has to be a mistake how ? Why? But I did everything right. You wonder but the mail reads \" cannot offer direct feedback on your application\" for that brief moment you contemplate if you should jump off the roof. But still decide to be alive only to soak in those shitty parts of rejection. Yes, it is common but having spent days and hours on it and then end with horseshit in you face and no means to improve yourself cuz u don't know what you did wrong. That sucks on a whole new level.",
