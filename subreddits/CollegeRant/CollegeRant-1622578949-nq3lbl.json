  "text": "If I fail my oral exam tomorrow I will drop out and go into our family business. I'm tired of givin it my all for courses I don't care about and still ending up with a finger up my ass. All of my classmates were left to cheat on the exams for this course, I didn't cheat. Tommorow i will be the only student to have the oral. Everyone else cheated and passed. If this guy fails me I will drop out. Fuck this. I never liked AG policies. I fucking don't care about the administrative part, the only fucking thing i care about is the STEM part.",
