I have no friends too and I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t make any more friends going into the future.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m slowly losing interest in my major and failing in my classes.\n\nIf both my social life and academic life are failing in college, then what\u2019s keeping me in here?", "author": "Ericklovesfuitgummy", "created": 1623217276, "retrieved": 1632951113, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h15n5li": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvocbr/another_rant/h15n5li/", "text": "I was in this similar thought after my Spring semester ended. I\u2019m a sophomore. It\u2019s been 2 and half years now and I did my pre reqs but no progress in my major. I wasn\u2019t interested in the major intro classes I took. \n\nI was constantly working since being a college freshman, and really had no social life on campus. Lost my state financial aid because of parents income, and took out federal loans. After the semester I felt i wasn\u2019t feelings it at college and haven\u2019t reached for help I\u2019ll need but also i also felt the same way wasting time and money and not progressing into something i\u2019m interested in. I lost motivation and peace to keep redoing mistakes i\u2019ve done previous semesters. \n\nI emailed one of my professors and had her advise me and precepting. I told her I am deciding to withdrawal from university and she wanted to meet in person with my program mentor and talk about things. \n\nWent to meet them and I\u2019ll be researching occupations and possibly shadow with some of her colleagues who have offices for Dental Assistant, Vet Technician, Doctor Assistance, Dental Hygienist, Real Estate. I\u2019m gonna research those and possibly pursue one of them soon. \n\nI decided to take a Leave of Absence instead of withdrawing  completely. I\u2019ll take most likely a year break / or research alternatives for now  and possibly go to community school or admit to a school/ program for one of the careers I wanna pursue. And just go that route. \n\nHope you talk out your next steps with a peer and possibly taking a mental break and see if your professors can help out as well. Many want to help their students even if they don\u2019t pursue school and want to go another route, you just gotta let them know what\u2019s up and if they have advice or guidance. \ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 Hang in there!", "author": "Mya19", "created": 1623248805, "upvotes": 5}, "h15a25w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvocbr/another_rant/h15a25w/", "text": "For what you\u2019re saying, Taking a semester off seems like a good idea. My recommendation is to get a part time job or two where people you\u2019re age tend to work (movie theater, restaurants, etc.). That will not only help you make some money for when you go back, but is also the best way to meet new people.", "author": "Boney_African_Feet", "created": 1623242682, "upvotes": 5}, "h1573a4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvocbr/another_rant/h1573a4/", "text": "I dunno how serious this is or whether you\u2019re exaggerating for effect, but if you\u2019re basically telling it like it is, dude, drop out. Go take care of yourself for a semester or a year or whatever. Keep tabs on your money so you don\u2019t screw up your options, but otherwise whatever. You\u2019ve got time. \n\nIf you have no friends and you\u2019re depressed and checked out, you\u2019re highly likely to fail your classes anyways. College isn\u2019t supposed to suck and It doesn\u2019t have to suck. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re a US student and this is summer break for you. If so, you should at least go somewhere, do something to de-isolate yourself over the summer. Take it seriously.

But here is my take. \n\nFrom a graduate student (changing program in September), I fully get it. Pandemic was hard and online classes are hard. I could name a single student from my class this past year to save my life. Same was happening for my brother. My anxiety spiraled out of control and I got very depress. I dropped out of my PhD in April and not saying pandemic was involved in my decision would be the biggest lie ever. And I cannot talk about the effect on mental health for my brother.\n\nFor both of us, the solution was to take a step back : we both went to guidance counselor. We both when to therapy (I still am). \n\nDo you have any indication of classes next semester are going to be offline (in uni)? Or online again? There is nothing wrong in taking a gap semester / a gap year if the mode of teaching makes you unwell. Social interaction matters sometimes and can be hard. \n\nBest wishes", "author": "the-morphology-queen", "created": 1623234869, "upvotes": 16}}}
