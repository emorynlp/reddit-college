GPA is really important for transfer students. This summer I decided to take a Linear Algebra class which is needed for my major but it's not needed to transfer plus I wanted to get this last math class out of the way. I'm at a 79% in the class, and I thought I was able to push for a 'B'. I took exam 2 today, and well..... idk, I can only pray for the best now. If I get a C in the class that drops my gpa from a 3.5 to a 3.48.\n\nBasically I could've taken the class next summer or during spring semester after I have gotten accepted to the UC in April. It would have boosted my application. I'm so dumb, should've just dropped the class.\n\nEdit: drop deadline passed a few days ago, that's why im pissed at myself", "author": "tha_oz", "created": 1626415020, "retrieved": 1632841767, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "comments": {"h5d82ol": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/olaro3/i_shouldve_dropped_the_class_while_i_had_the/h5d82ol/", "text": "Thank you u/tha_oz for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
