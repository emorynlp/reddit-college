In a much better place!!", "text": "Okay maybe a rave more than a rant. I GOT MY FIRST A!! It\u2019s my second semester, first year, 1st class out of 7 that I\u2019ve been enrolled in, all four of my grades from last semester were Cs. After a long semester of crying, caffeine, pizza, and quarantine, I still managed to put in the work and it paid off :,). I really want this to be the first of many, it feels so good. It was weird because the first grade report had my grade as a C and I cried for an hour until it was announced that there was an error! The correct grade report had my mark up to an A!!
