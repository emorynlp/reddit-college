I intended on going to community college because I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money and still get a good education (I did have plans on transferring 2 years after to somewhere that fit my needs) but in a last second commit, I ended up choosing Drexel, which my girlfriend helped me with.\n\nI knew at the time it was really expensive, but my girlfriend told me that I was gonna get a really good job out of it and it would all work out. But I\u2019m starting to doubt myself. I\u2019m gonna be paying a little over $50,000 annually, and that number scares me so much. I am really starting to worry and I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel myself regretting my decision immensely, but I wish I wasn\u2019t.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m an idiot, I certainly feel like one. If anyone can give me some advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you as always!\n\nTLDR; I chose Drexel which is very expensive and I\u2019m starting to worry.

For most of my early/mid 20s I felt bad that I didn\u2019t really go to college but I was always appalled by so many of my friends who simply can not get ahead of their student loans. Like it literally takes almost their whole paycheck and it is so many thousands of dollars there is no end in sight. I felt bad about myself for being a drop out working in retail, but my closest friend was always telling me to stfu because I was so lucky to not have debt. \n\nPersonally I have taken their regret to heart which is why I am at community college right now, and planning to transfer on a full scholarship possibly, things are out of sorts now with COVID so I am not rigidly attached to any outcome right now, just playing it loose and going with the flow and I am actually really enjoying my time in CC. So many of the students are really motivated and I have been really surprised that so many of my professors seem overqualified to me but at least one of them told me she prefers working at CC because there\u2019s less BS for her I guess. \n\nI feel like if you regret it now, you totally might not end up regretting it in the end because who knows how things will work out, but if you do, it would only intensify your regret later because you didn\u2019t go with your gut, you know?", "author": "Facenumber2", "created": 1596459965, "upvotes": 1}, "fzvlbfa": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i0wyu6/i_feel_like_i_really_fucked_up_choosing_drexel/fzvlbfa/", "text": "Drexel is a good school. I was considering a transfer after finding out that I could get free tuition, but only had three semesters left at the time and a lot of my credits would not transfer. I decided not to transfer because I felt the prestige was not worth adding on another semester and moving. The university I am still at is also cheap enough where the free tuition was not a game changer.\n\nYou would have otherwise done CC first, right? Sounds like the cost difference is around $75k, certainly not a lot in the long run but it will be a pain until you get it taken care of. It's a lot easier to make $75k than it is to pay $75k off (though you are probably talking about $100-200k over four years depending on what you can contribute now) when you have other expenses and are younger without investments or other income. My advice would be to hit the debt very hard when you graduate.\n\nWhat's the average starting pay for your major? It's typically advised that taking more than the starting pay out in loans is a bad idea, but you can get some more leeway if you are willing to live frugally after graduation. High pay isn't necessarily of huge importance; at least average pay and a high chance of employment is more important. It's typical for students to put like 10-15% of their income towards debt, but you would probably want to aim for something closer to 50% if the goal is to get rid of it in 4-6 years. We really need to know your major to tell you if this is realistic, a lot of starting salaries are close to living wage and you won't necessarily be able to save anywhere near 50% with those.\n\nHave you taken out loans already? What do you think the average interest rate will be between them upon graduation?\n\nI would recommend a transfer in most cases. For a low starting salary it's questionable if you would be able to repay much over the interest each year. If you have a major that will pay well after graduation and is in demand, you should be able to handle the debt but it will require living very modestly for several years after college. In both cases the transfer has major benefits.", "author": "br1039", "created": 1596210946, "upvotes": 2}, "fztrh1v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i0wyu6/i_feel_like_i_really_fucked_up_choosing_drexel/fztrh1v/", "text": "I recommend going to community college then transferring after 2 years.

Those matter more than prestige. Not only that, but some jobs will require a Masters, so it's recommended by some advisors to go to a cheaper uni for undergraduate, community college, and then try to get into a top tier Masters Program. Previously working with an Employment Assistance Office Non-Profit, I have seen people from well-known institutions having difficulty getting job offers due to either having a low GPA, lack of internships, and/or no Masters Degree. \n\nThe reason why statistics suggests prestige matters is mainly due to the fact that higher tier institutions provide more work/internship opportunities and people graduating are more likely to have higher GPA's. \n\nIt's not the end of the world. I would recommend taking a semester break or try to figure out a way to get into a community college for the Fall/Spring Semester. We all make mistakes\n\nFYI: Currently a Masters Student.
