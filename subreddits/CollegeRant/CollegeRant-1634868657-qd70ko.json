  "text": "I started out the day wondering what to do with the weird free time have have right now. Because everything that is due is done and everything I need to do can\u2019t get done yet.\n\nBut I still worry, I have a progress meeting about a project tomorrow and I feel like we don\u2019t have enough done. But I have taken this class before and this is how it was then too, uncertain, unfinished. This progress meeting is really about the professor figuring out how far behind we are. Everyone is far behind. No one knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected. We didn\u2019t know then and we don\u2019t know now. That\u2019s normal. I hate that it\u2019s normal.\n\nIt\u2019s like I have to ice skate, but I don\u2019t know how. And I\u2019m trying and I\u2019m tripping and occasionally keeping my balance while an experienced ice skater watches me and tries to coach me. I feel fucking stupid.\n\nI don\u2019t like feeling this way. But I need to feel this way. This is how everyone starts right?",
