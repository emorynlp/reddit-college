  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m sure a lot of other people here are in the same boat as me but I just need a place to let this out cause my girlfriend is at work and so are my parents. \n\nSo today is my school career fair and it\u2019s a really big deal. Because of covid restrictions they are only letting 500 people in at a time and I got in early to avoid a long wait and a rush (still waited over an hour to get in) \n\nIt just sucks so bad going up to recruiters and knowing that the next 2000 people are gonna come and talk to them and even though I\u2019ve worked with a lot of these companies in other internships I just don\u2019t see how I\u2019m gonna stand out by just talking to them. There\u2019s really nothing incredibly special about me or most people. I have good credentials and what not but so do most people. \n\nI applied for a few and honestly just kinda drained the soul outa me. I could do really good things for a lot of companies. I\u2019m driven and a really hard worker. I don\u2019t give up and I\u2019ve literally never called in sick (most cause I\u2019m lucky and don\u2019t usually get sick). Of course I can\u2019t tell me that though because there\u2019s 15 other people in line and they arnt even gonna remember. I\u2019m 1 out 500 kids they talk to just today. Not to mention tomorrow and next week and the week after. And that\u2019s all before I get a call back just to see if I get an interview. \n\nAnyway, I know it\u2019s really common and I don\u2019t expect anyone to feel bad for me specifically but I just wanted to vent and put out there that this sucks. Also to see if anyone else feels the same way or to let others know that I feel the same as they do. \n\nJust gonna keep going and get my homework done and be more prepared for tomorrow I guess. I mean what else can I do. Thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR: job search sucks and sucks the soul outa me",

      "text": "I felt the same way when I was applying. Especially when I applied to some prestigious firms where I KNEW I wasn\u2019t going to get a call. I actually ended up landing a position at one of these firms in Chicago and I\u2019m honestly shocked I did. I think what helped me getting my foot in the door was the fact I did a ton of research on them beforehand. \n\nHaving the right education and credentials for the position is essentially assumed, so you have to set yourself apart somehow. For me, I just expressed my desire to work at such an accomplished firm and went into detail about why some of their projects were really interesting to me. After I got the job, I went out for lunch with the owner and some co workers a couple months later and the owner flat out said it was the attitude I brought that convinced them to bring me on. The fact I knew a lot about them and expressed interest in specific projects helped seal the deal. \n\nI know this can\u2019t really be applied everywhere, and it doesn\u2019t guarantee an interview. But putting in the effort to research a company and letting them know what specifically about them makes you want to work there can go a long way and it shows them you care enough (besides also just wanting a job because we\u2019re broke ass college students and we need a job lolol). Not sure if this helps but keep your head up. It\u2019s a grind but you\u2019ll be rewarded for not giving up.",
