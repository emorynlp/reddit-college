Now add having to work a job to partially pay for college and keep up with student loans, unsupportive parents who don't pay for anything, not getting a lot of aid because you just didn't hit the right factors or went to school at time when everyone was requesting aid and...well...you get the picture. \n\nBut what you said is important to take into consideration too because going to a party school can defiantly change a lot of the external environmental factors.",

This kept me from spending time that I could/should have put to use being around friends, going to a favorite place off-campus, or doing something for myself.\n\nBasically the best suggestion is set an alarm and have a designated 2-3 hours you set aside to work on all the projects you need to, which may be difficult if you lose concentration easily. But having work to do combined with unstructured time certainly shouldn't keep you from figuring out a way to structure that time based on your schedule and make room to go to a friend's party, go out dancing at a club, participate in various hobbies, or whatever it is you want to do outside of schoolwork.",

I did some after school stuff that kept me out until later in the evening where I then had to do homework. Whereas in college I generally have 2-3 classes in a day and not the same course every single day. I have plenty of time either after all my classes are done or if I have a gap in between classes to do some work and have the rest of the day to do whatever. Sometimes my schedule would let me be free after 3pm! That\u2019s a lot of time to get done some work and socialize with friends afterwards.",

For me, \"fun\" in college wasn't going to parties every night. Though sure we did that. But it was experiencing a million new things. I went to most of the free events, joined some dorky and fun student orgs, attended sporting events, played stupid games in the dorm, had all-night study sessions with people who I'd end up becoming good friends with. My new friends challenged me academically and were a huge help to me in my classes. They helped me to both study hard, have high expectations of myself, and have fun. \n\nThe funnest part about college is doing things you wouldn't normally do, trying on a bunch of different hats you'd never considered before, being friends with people you would have never hung out with in high school  ... these are all things that are still possible but more difficult to do after undergrad, just because you're meeting fewer new people and your community doesn't usually have so many free clubs or events tailored to your specific age group. That's why people say your time in college is special. \n\nTo be clear, I truly did work my ass off. I finished my degree in 4 years even though I took off summers to work full-time, worked 2 jobs every semester, took honors science classes, and wrote an honors thesis my senior year. I maybe have slightly above average intelligence, so none of that came easy to me... and maybe I didn't have as much 'fun time' as some of my classmates, but I still had a damn good time.",

(I was not aware of this and I apologize for my stupidity in this situation)\n\nHowever excluding OP's case, to answer your question there are lots of factors that can determine how much time one has. I don't really understand what you mean by \"I'm talking about college\" because a lot of people including myself , are in majors or pre-programs where cocurricular (research-heavy electives, research projects, shadowing, honors programs, etc.) and also extracurricular activities (clubs, volunteering not related to pre-prgram, enough hours into a \"what do you do for fun?\" question) A lot of people also have to work in college. For instance, I currently have to work three jobs in order to stay in college. (I am at one right now as I am typing this. Graveyard shift) I also was homeless for a short period of time. That really affects how one can focus and the time one has. \n\n**Finances also influence mental health services.** \n\nFor example, there was a student on another subreddit (r/college I believe or perhaps it was this one) where they discussed the fact that during the COVID pandemic they had lost their job due to the shutdowns and were unable to refill their ADHD medication. They had to study a lot longer and less effective because of their lack of adequate medical treatment. I sympathized because my university doesn't provide adequate care for the disorder I suffer from that effects my schoolwork and amount of time studying to get a concept. I am not able to get therapy that helps me on a mental level because the closest place that does provide treatment...would be a minimum of $200 per session and does not take insurance. \n\n**Finances influence one's prior educational knowledge and where one grew up.**\n\nI have a friend who is a much harder worker than me and has struggled a lot in life. She grew up in an abusive, drug-ridden household and was constantly moving place to place where she was abused, often did not have an adequate place to study and went to mostly C, D and even an F school for her freshman year.  She did really well in school though because she worked extremely hard. Volunteered a lot, worked jobs throughout high school, studied...but our state has this scholarship program where you have to have a certain GPA, number of volunteer hours and of course...a damn high enough SAT/ACT score. Well she never had good math teachers and didn't know certain basic math topics. So of course every time she could afford to take the SAT and took it she bombed the math portion. She went to college and was homeless for most of the time here but she flunked intro to chemistry because of this. School charges extra for repeat courses. \n\nThere are more but there are many, many stories and studies online that explain better than I can.",
