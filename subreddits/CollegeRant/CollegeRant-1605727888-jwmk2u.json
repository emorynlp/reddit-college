I miss them so much! \n\nToo bad I have to spend this recess typing up two term papers, a business plan, and a formal report. My chromebook is going to get more attention than my family ever will next week.  \n\nA big \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the professors assigning unnecessary amounts of work before break. I have only one professor that understands that this might be considered a dick move, and gave us considerably less to do so we could enjoy our break. I am so thankful for this man.
