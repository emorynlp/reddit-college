During that time, Covid-19 hit and put me in lockdown at work for 14 days. It was everything I could do to keep the homework submitted on time. I ended the class with a \"B\", but did not feel like I retained anything.\n\nDue to scheduling, I had to wait until Spring 2021 to take Calculus II. I felt like I was barely treading water. I had two engineering courses that semester, but took 2-weeks of vacation during finals only because of Calculus II. Somehow I ended the course with a \"B\", but the concepts from Calculus I that I should know well, I still struggle with. I was extremely frustrated that I was using my limited vacation on one course. I was ready to throw my hands up with the whole degree.\n\nNow I'm in Calculus III, and I'm working through the homework and preparing for a second exam. I am so miserable. I want to drop the class, but I don't want to extend this nightmare that is the Calculus trilogy another semester. I feel overworked, and I'm lost on some simple things that I should know how to do. \n\nJust needed to vent. Thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Calculus III is making me sad.", "author": "TheGreigh", "created": 1625450675, "retrieved": 1632949607, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h4c572l": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/odxppn/calculus_iii_is_making_me_depressed/h4c572l/", "text": "PM me if you want some help.
