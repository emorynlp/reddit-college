  "title:": "Calculus III is Making Me Depressed",
  "text": "I took Calculus I Spring 2020 as an 8-week course. During that time, Covid-19 hit and put me in lockdown at work for 14 days. It was everything I could do to keep the homework submitted on time. I ended the class with a \"B\", but did not feel like I retained anything.\n\nDue to scheduling, I had to wait until Spring 2021 to take Calculus II. I felt like I was barely treading water. I had two engineering courses that semester, but took 2-weeks of vacation during finals only because of Calculus II. Somehow I ended the course with a \"B\", but the concepts from Calculus I that I should know well, I still struggle with. I was extremely frustrated that I was using my limited vacation on one course. I was ready to throw my hands up with the whole degree.\n\nNow I'm in Calculus III, and I'm working through the homework and preparing for a second exam. I am so miserable. I want to drop the class, but I don't want to extend this nightmare that is the Calculus trilogy another semester. I feel overworked, and I'm lost on some simple things that I should know how to do. \n\nJust needed to vent. Thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Calculus III is making me sad.",

I have two kids under 5 and both my wife and myself work full time. It is difficult to do extra studying, outside of the heavy course load.",

              "text": "Ah that sounds tough :(( You\u2019re juggling a lot. \n\nI sometimes find that tutoring (if it\u2019s good tutoring and you\u2019re on the same page and you\u2019re getting a lot out of it) can be an efficient way to do it. Then you don\u2019t get stuck for too long and don\u2019t go in circles (at least this is how it helps me). Or working on a problem set with a peer in the class. $50 is expensive for tutoring in my opinion; if you can afford $20 or something you could try looking for that if you think it would help.",
