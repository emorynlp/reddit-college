I know that people might mean well but I HATE this question so much... It\u2019s like they think that College is just a walk in the park when in reality, this STEM degree that I\u2019m working on is a treacherous path\u2026 I am no genius.",

I just wanna thump those old heads upside their head when they ask that question cuz it\u2019s pretty obvious they don\u2019t really understand the rigor of college.\nCollege, and especially STEM, is tough. There are people that don\u2019t graduate in fucking 4 years deal with it. \nSorry for the vent, but I too, ask this a lot to the point I make excuses lol.",
