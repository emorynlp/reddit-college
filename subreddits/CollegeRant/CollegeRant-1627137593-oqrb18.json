Im the leader of a group of 5, im recording the video. Another guy is sharing the screen and controlling the PPT. A merely 20 minutes video, we had to use 3 hours of fucking time to finish it. The reason is because there are many disturbance in the middle of recording and we had to restart so many times.\n\n* 3 of them are constantly looking/using their phone in the middle of the fucking presentation. I told them not to but well, doesnt work.\n* the guy controlling the PPT is literally daydreaming, the PPT slides are always lagging behind. I had to scream \"NEXT SLIDE\" loud in order for him to hear it even when thats not my turn in speaking, because some people are stupid or scared to fucking tell him to change the fucking slide. Maybe his speaker got problem and cant hear soft voice, idk but i doubt it.\n* The presenter had to stop in the middle of the talk and go pick up her phone. LIKE COME ON, CANT YOU JUST WAIT?\n* Constantly phone vibrating sounds can be heard, which makes them check at their fucking phone.\n* Constantly blank out because they did not prepared for it.\n\nI doubt we will get good grades for the presentation but fuck that, its just 5% and im not gonna spent another 5 hours trying to perfect it, because its impossible doing it with them. Oh and some even recommend me \"just edit video and cut out the bad part\". Yea, guess they prefer choppy video rather than a smooth video. NOPE FUCK YOU.\n\nOn the side note, I did 90% of the group report which is 15% of the total mark, and im confident with it. So yea, just a rant i had to speak it up, because im so pissed.", "author": "Catanddogg", "created": 1627137593, "retrieved": 1632950981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h8wjun7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oqrb18/stupid_and_unconsidered_groupmates/h8wjun7/", "text": "r/insanegroupmates", "author": "S4njay", "created": 1628944457, "upvotes": 1}, "h6egmi4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oqrb18/stupid_and_unconsidered_groupmates/h6egmi4/", "text": "Just individually record your sections and piece them together ffs.

It wasnt good for my health so I found a way to let go some of the things that were really irritating me. If a student is really problematic then i will let the professor know what to expect before the presentation and how the group is addressing this problem. They usually appreciate the update because there may be something personal going on with that student that the profeasor knows more about. \n\nOur presentations look terrible to me, but we usually get a decent grade because professors know that its difficult during a pandemic. Some students are on different timezones or have to work to keep a roof over their parent's head.\n\nIts super easy to let your emotions take over and get frustrated. It can backfire though and come off as passive aggressive or attitude. Group members may pick up on that vibe and not feel confident, or feel they cant approach you. I am not saying this is your case, but it happens a lot.", "author": "AreasofInterest", "created": 1627142510, "upvotes": 9}}}
