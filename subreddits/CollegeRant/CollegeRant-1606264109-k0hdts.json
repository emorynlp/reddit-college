  "text": "So working two jobs, paying all my bills and tuition, and going to school full time isn\u2019t adulthood? Wtf. Why am I looked down upon just because I\u2019m in school when I literally do everything adults do but more? They act like my stress isn\u2019t real stress and laugh it off. I\u2019d kill to be out of school with one full time job. Anyone else deal with this?",

I enjoyed working a full-time job where I didn't have to bring my work home with me, unlike school where you have to study, do homework, and watch/participate in outside events/media. I enjoyed having real time off in the afternoon and on the weekends. I enjoyed getting paid for my labor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese same people wouldn't go back to school if they were paid, so...",

Pretty great. School has added another level of stress.\n\nThe only thing I would argue is harder is having a couple kids and two working parents. Now that is a level of stress school and/or work do not quite compare to.",

They are working and paying the bills, on top of going to school. Technically adulthood *should* be easier, since the schoolwork will be over then.",
