Months of preparations,gone. thanks to hormone imbalance. Imagine that.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because it sounds like such first world problems but I can't control this shit and people around me always preceive me as childish or dramatic as if im enjoying being like this. \n\nim THRIVING right now.", "author": "CompsiPlantGirl", "created": 1629372121, "retrieved": 1632949082, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"h9wvra1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p7cw8f/me_having_a_panic_attack_about_having_a_panic/h9wvra1/", "text": "I would recommend wearing a mask more often to desensitize yourself to it. Since you have an ADHD diagnosis (it sounds) get in contact with your schools disability support services. You may be able to get a testing accommodation in a separate room where perhaps you don\u2019t need to wear a mask. I recommend wearing a surgical mask over a cloth mask as the surgical masks are more breathable and comfortable.", "author": "Concerned-23", "created": 1629642805, "upvotes": 1}, "h9irh36": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p7cw8f/me_having_a_panic_attack_about_having_a_panic/h9irh36/", "text": "The following comment contains advice. If you just wanted to rant please ignore the following. I wrote this thinking it was on the other college subreddit and didn\u2019t realize it was the rant page. \nEither way, it does suck and i wish you the best of luck friend! \n\n\n\n\nMaybe you could practice working while wearing your mask to try and get yourself at least a little adjusted to it. \n\nCould you go to the library and study for increasing periods of time while wearing your mask? That will get you a more academic environment and it will let you get used to wearing the mask while reading/writing/thinking. If you can\u2019t go to a library to do this, then you can practice at home. It will probably feel silly to sit in your room with your mask on, but if it helps you to adjust to it even a little it might be worth it. And in the freedom of your own space, you can take it off if it ever gets too annoying or overwhelming. \n\nIn addition to that, are you registered with your schools disability office? Do you have your diagnosis in writing on file with the school? If so, you could seek special accommodation for the exam. I think more time to complete it or taking it in a separate room are two common options precovid. Perhaps there would be an option for you to take it in a monitored room alone so you can remove your mask while taking the exam. \n\nGood luck on your exam! You can do it!", "author": "usuallyConflicted", "created": 1629372894, "upvotes": 7}}}
