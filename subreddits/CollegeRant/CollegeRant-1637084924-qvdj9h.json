  "text": "My friend is 21 and at a very large university. She is absolutely fuming because her friend wants to take a class taught by a friend of her boyfriends. She feels it\u2019s a conflict of interest, super weird, and unethical. I\u2019m baffled. Is that to say that one day she also can\u2019t work for someone whom has a friend of a friend? So nobody can ever be loosely connected to anyone? Am I way off base here? She\u2019s hopping mad and I\u2019m bewildered.",

      "text": "The only way this would become a conflict of interest is if they make it one. If the friend of a friend's boyfriend (?) does his job and teaches/assess impartially, and your friend does their job by being a good student (i.e., not expecting to coast on tangentially knowing the professor in a social context), then there's no issue. \n\nThe friend who's all worked up this needs to take a step back and try to understand where her anger is coming from and why she's so concerned about a very minor social connection.",
