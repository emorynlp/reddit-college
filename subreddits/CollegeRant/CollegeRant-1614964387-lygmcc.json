The paper has to be at least 5 pages and I still have nothing written. I used to be so good at creative writing (although I'm an engineering student), but it's been so long since my last humanities course and I just can't gather my ideas well. And having school from home and dealing with ADD doesn't help, either. \n\nHopefully, we can both get back on track.
