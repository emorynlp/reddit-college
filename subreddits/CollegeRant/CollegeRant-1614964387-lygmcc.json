Still haven\u2019t done a thing except have a panic attack and cry.\n\nThe weird part is I was doing so well up until a week ago and now it\u2019s like I can\u2019t get myself to do anything. Idk what\u2019s wrong with me.",

      "text": "I've had something similar happen to me recently, maybe not to the same extent, but I certainly wasn't doing well. \n\nFor one of my history classes, I had my midterm paper due this past Monday, but my professor gave me an extension for March 8th. The paper has to be at least 5 pages and I still have nothing written. I used to be so good at creative writing (although I'm an engineering student), but it's been so long since my last humanities course and I just can't gather my ideas well. And having school from home and dealing with ADD doesn't help, either. \n\nHopefully, we can both get back on track. Good luck to you!",
