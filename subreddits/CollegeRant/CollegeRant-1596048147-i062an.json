For example, if someone got 85 on his final they will multiply it by 1.2 and that person would get 100 which is the full score. As a result, almost everyone graduated with a high as fuck GPA. I'm just wondering if this common among colleges? Because this doesn't seem normal to me. I think it is unfair for some students who has actually put their time and efforts into studying to get a full grade. \n\nPlease excuse my bad grammar as English is not my native language.

Definitely has something to do with $$$. In the end, a degree is a degree, and just having one sets you apart for a job search. But the lack of enforced learning/work ethic could be an impact later in life for students at your school.", "author": "RetroSwagSauce", "created": 1596073142, "upvotes": 3}, "fznqcgp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i062an/school_exaggerates_students_grades/fznqcgp/", "text": "Called grade inflation", "author": "urlbluntstomyirlface", "created": 1596055433, "upvotes": 19}, "fznjuqs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i062an/school_exaggerates_students_grades/fznjuqs/", "text": "Most professors have curves, especially in the more difficult classes. It depends on the prof how/if they choose to curve exams. I've had a 59 go up to a 77 but also a 63 go to a 66. One of my finals is sorta designed for you to make a low score so they double what number of questions you get correct out of 70 and that's your percentage score. For some it's normal, but others it's not, I'd say it all depends on the school, prof and the nature of the class itself.", "author": "kenz0018", "created": 1596052331, "upvotes": 13}, "fznjkaz": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i062an/school_exaggerates_students_grades/fznjkaz/", "text": "So is it their institutional GPA or their State/HOPE/whatever your state does GPA.
