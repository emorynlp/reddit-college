It\u2019s really stressing me", "text": "I don\u2019t feel well. I wish I could know why but I\u2019m really struggling to pinpoint some reasons. I have had a really busy rough summer. For context, I\u2019m a college student going to my junior year this fall. I worked full time as a janitor in May in my college and in June I started my 2 summer internship and a summer course. June was crazy since I relocated states and was living in with my boyfriend. We had lots of arguments but it eventually settled. July was a shit show since the internships and the summer course were all online and happening at the same time. I would be up at 7:30am to 6:30pm on Zoom, Slack and Teams everyday trying to manage work and do homework. \n\nI finished everything this last Friday and I feel so empty and emotionally exhausted. I don\u2019t know how to rest and I\u2019m always restless. I cannot sit still and always feel like I need to be doing something for my future otherwise I\u2019m \u00ab\u00a0wasting time\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nThank you for reading this rant. College is starting next week and I want to make a use out of this short time to rest and rejuvenate. I just need to know how.", "author": "Ayyyaa", "created": 1629319615, "retrieved": 1632949087, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h9ihfd6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6zv6z/dont_know_how_to_rest_its_really_stressing_me/h9ihfd6/", "text": "Ive had this issue as well. We get so caught up in the \"what do i have to do next?\" Cycle that when the answer to that question is \"nothing\" we feel lost. What really helps me, at least in the short term is finding some way to stay slightly productive. Clean something, learn how to change your oil, reorganize things etc. Also deep diving into fun reading and video games gives me that sense of achievement even if im not going to put it on my resume. Eventually it gets easier but in the mean time you just gotta make due.", "author": "flippersum", "created": 1629365096, "upvotes": 2}}}
