I take college class at my home because of the COVID pandemic. Anyways, the professors send a TON of work through zoom/online and I feel this has made it much more difficult to actually pay attention/care about class since everything is online. I have like 3 group projects from different classes and nobody in the groups wants to do work (so I am doing all of them by myself). Also, a ton of online exams and no breaks. I'm basically at my home like many of you for hours at a day looking at the computer screen and watching professors give a super monotone class thanks to COVID.\n\nAnyways, because of all the stress I have, I told my parents about all of my assignments and stuff and how it sucked to not be at the college campus, etc. My parents legit started scolding me and telling me I'm lazy for not being grateful that I have online classes instead of traditional in-class courses. They think with today's tech and especially zoom that college is 10x easier and that my stress is dumb/exaggerated. I was so angry with them that I went back to my room to cry because I definitely am NOT lazy at all. I have been in dean's list before and everything yet they swear that since college is now online that I shouldn't complain about the difficulty. I also have tutors but even then college is still very difficult for me especially mathematical-type courses.\n\nThey'll start saying things like \"When I was in college, we had to use typewriters and stayed until 3AM! No fancy internet!\", etc. I understand there was no internet back then but they should consider that college will always be difficult no matter the timeline.\n\nWhat do I do? I have way too many assignments, never given anything late, always go to class, and my parents think I am lazy and that college is \"easy\". I just want to explode.\n\nTL;DR : parents think modern online class is easier than inperson class from their time because of technology, even though I am drowning in work/stress.
