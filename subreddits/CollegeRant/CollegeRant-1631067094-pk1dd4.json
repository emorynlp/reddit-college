  "text": "Hello friends. It\u2019s the second week of classes. I just want to complain about how I\u2019ve made friends up to this point. To this point it\u2019s because I\u2019m helpful. I don\u2019t think people are interested in making new friends. I\u2019m trying to stay positive about this. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a pattern in how I make friends. I always try to help. I\u2019m actually very good at helping which is why people want to be friends with me. I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s the only reason people become friends with me lol? \n\nI keep seeing 10:10 what does that mean lol",

      "text": "Depends on the type of help you\u2019re giving. If you\u2019re helping someone unwarranted, it\u2019s a trait that will make you stand out (ie. helping someone with directions or asking someone if they\u2019re okay) but if it seems like they\u2019re kinda expecting the help to an extent, I\u2019d be careful. There\u2019s a chance that the small minority of people are taking advantage of your kindness and willingness to help others in order to manipulate you into doing things for them or to support them at all times. This isn\u2019t everyone but it\u2019s a good amount of people. Just watch and see if people return the favor, then you will know.",
