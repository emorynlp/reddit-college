He doesn\u2019t have slides, takes forums down, doesn\u2019t record lectures, and talks in circles. Our class put an email together asking whether he could do any of these things and he refused. Naturally, a lot of us took to the group me to vent our frustrations. Then in come two of the class suck ups like \u201cwell guys, this is an upper level class! It\u2019s going to be hard! Stop BASHING the prof!\u201d And another came in like \u201cit was easy for ME to get help on my own time, don\u2019t be meeeean\u201d\n\nThey completely missed the point...We took the class at that time because it was at THAT time. None of us have time to chase him down. Also, I think we are justified in being a bit concerned that the class we are paying for is not really delivering on anything. Just like, WHY be a suck up? He\u2019s never going to see it, where will it get you? Do you just have to feel like you have some moral high ground?

IF you and your peers truly think that the professor isn\u2019t doing something right then you all should consider going straight to the department chair or the dean. It\u2019s one thing when a dept chair/dean deals with one student\u2019s worries, but it\u2019s a completely different thing when a whole group voices their concerns.

For me it comes with living with *very* negative people who think they're better than anyone and talk so much shit about other people it gets difficult to listen to, no matter who they bash. sometimes it gets so uncomfortable and makes me feel so bad for the other side I'm just like \"OMG SHUT UP ALEARDY\" and start defending the other side even if I don't know them at all. I believe it's a Devil's Advocate mindset? at this point, not defending that person will feel like I'm betraying my own morals and to be honest, negative people who talk shit about others all the time piss me off. I'm guessing a whole class bashing one guy triggered guilt or something in these two suck ups. \n\nI'm not arguing, I'm just offering my input on why I might ever defend a professor in whatever circumstances.\n\nThat being said, i'm not beyond bashing professors. There's a couple in my collage I'll be the first to bash, mainly because they offended me on a *personal* level... and yeah my entire class hates them. you won't find ONE student in the entire college who had them that would defend them. It's that bad. And they're Tenure. These two students of yours are completely wrong though: Just cause one of them understood the stuff doesn't mean everyone else did. and, NO, high level class doesn't mean it can't have fucking slides (?!) Your professor is either lazy or doesn't understand tech. and what the hell is \"takes forums down\"?? does he *want* to being bombarded with individual emails? because that's what it sound like.
