I've been checking your recent posts. Have you ever thought about studying in Lithuania, Poland or Hungary? I've heard from international students that they make things pretty easy and affordable for international students, and they offer English taught programs\n\nIt's normal to be completely burned in this situation. I'm a soon-to-be international student in your country (in a double international degree) and a few months ago I made a list of the things that I was supposed to do and the papers I'll need, and so far it has helped me a lot to not get lost in the process and have all my papers in time.\n\nIf you happen to live near S\u00e3o Paulo (or you can afford to travel there for your exams) you could also consider applying to study in the UNED (an online public spanish university) and moving to study in Spain the following year (or that same year... Whatever fits you).\n\nThe choice is yours, the world is huge and there are plenty of opportunities everywhere (and easier and cheaper than getting into the US).
