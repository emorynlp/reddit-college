We\u2019re in a group of four and three of us are repeating the class, that\u2019s how hard this bitch is.\n\nSo I never have a problem with group mates but even the last time that I took this class I noticed the quirks of this individual, who I will call \u201cJack\u201d. \n\nBecause the class is so full of assignments and projects we have to stick to a very detailed and strict schedule as a group. \n\nJack keeps insisting that we are behind schedule, and that we\u2019re falling behind and that things are only going to get more intense so we really have to blah blah blah.\n\nHe talks too much. He makes me anxious. He once (in our first attempt in the class) had a conversation with another group-mate of just discussing how we would transport our project to the presentation.\n\nThe project was made to be disassembled and reassemble with ease, so a group-mate decided they\u2019d take it in their truck. Jack was worried that the project wouldn\u2019t fit. Or rather, it was obvious that the machine would fit fine in a truck bed, he was just\u2026. Needlessly double checking?? So he kept asking detailed questions about the dimensions and VERY DETAILED QUESTIONS UGH HE LITERALLY TOOK LIKE AN HOUR it was already night and we we just wanted to go to sleep. He was asking how EXACTLY should it be reassembled and organized and blah blah\n\nI honestly cannot exaggerate how much he talks about\u2026 just\u2026 everything.\n\nRight now my issue is that he asked if we could study together for our next exam. I\u2019ve studied with him once before and I noted that he was a very\u2026 stubborn learner. I\u2019ve dealt with repetitive learners before, and I\u2019m not patient with them if I\u2019m not getting paid.\n\nI asked him which day in the weekend he would like to study and he responds with\u2026both days.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what? Aren\u2019t we both full time students?? This won\u2019t even be my only exam this week.\n\nI do hate saying no, but all I\u2019m willing to study with jack is 3, MAYBE 4 hours. We can do that on Saturday, I am damn well not having another study session on Sunday.\n\nI\u2019m aware I sound like a dick, but I know it won\u2019t really be US studying but ME answering all his GODDAMN QUESTIONS. I\u2019m a good tutor btw, I used to actually work as one, I understand the material pretty well tbh. So I honestly think I\u2019ll help him immensely in this one study session.\n\nI\u2019ll write him some detailed notes and everything. And if his ass still doesn\u2019t understand then fine, but my ass isn\u2019t coming back on Sunday.", "author": "Scarcity-Any", "created": 1631944159, "retrieved": 1632841015, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdau9zq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqgs2c/needy_groupmate/hdau9zq/", "text": "Thank you u/Scarcity-Any for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
