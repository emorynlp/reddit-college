  "text": "So one of my classes that I\u2019m taking is an advanced language class which mostly has seniors and juniors and I\u2019m like one of the only freshman and idk I placed into the class and I\u2019m doing decent but sometimes when we do work I just feel like everyone around me is doing so much better and I feel that I don\u2019t belong in that class :( the prof moves pretty fast too and like I said I\u2019m doing decent but it\u2019s kind of a discouraging feeling when all the people around me know more stuff and are more confident in their work. Any way I can overcome this and feel better about myself in class?",
