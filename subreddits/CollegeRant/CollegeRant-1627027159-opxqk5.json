They wanted to buy from the Internet to complete the assignment. They wanted to buy because they have no clue how to do the assignment.\n2. Said they will study the code I wrote (they lied) to prepare for the presentation.\n3. Didn't know the test was today.\n4. Didn't know there was an individual lab presentation (not group assignment presentation)\n5. One group member, who provided 0% contribution, said nothing except providing her name and student ID for the report.\n6. I told them there is a presentation, but all of them didn't attend the presentation. The lecturer asked me why my group members didn't attend the presentation, I said \"I don't know\", because they didn't provide a reason after I asked them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow its just silence. I told them to ask the lecturer if they can still do their presentation, but didn't said a word.\n\nI told the lecturer during my presentation about their lack of contribution, and the lecturer told me their marks will be lower.", "author": "ElectroJunior27", "created": 1627027159, "retrieved": 1632841725, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 293, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h68510j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/opxqk5/my_group_members_are_mad_at_me_because_i_told_the/h68510j/", "text": "Thank you u/ElectroJunior27 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
