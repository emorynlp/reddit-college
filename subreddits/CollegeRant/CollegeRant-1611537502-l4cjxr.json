I\u2019m tired of feeling like a failure and I\u2019m just stressed with the upcoming semester.\n\nI hate having such a defeatist attitude because it really isn\u2019t my spirit. but tonight is one of those days where I\u2019m going to heavily pray. \nI\u2019ve been feeling like complete shit for the past week. with working nearly full time all of winter break, I realized I never took time for myself. \n\nI\u2019m a fashion design major so I sew in my spare time. I finally completed a project. I had done this cherry blossom corset/bodice. Super proud of how it looked. My close friends and even acquaintances on Instagram loved it. Of course me wanting validation from Reddit people posted it in r/sewing and people torn it down to sherds. People commenting that it wasn\u2019t a corset because it didn\u2019t have boning in it.\n\nThen my phone. So I got an 11 pro two weeks ago. I got it at Walmart through there cell service ( yeah I know don\u2019t judge). Anyway the guy sold me and verzion phone with a AT&T service. I said I just want to return the phone all together. \n\n I am stressed with knowing that the new semester starts on Monday. I am mentally un prepared. I am taking 18 credits. Full time student. My major isn\u2019t the most flexible (I mean what major is but-). The Professors and the classes are fast paced and TONS of work. Also not mention I\u2019m part of sorority and dating & keeping with my friends. \n\nPLUS MY LAPTOP ISNT WORKING! like my wifi connected to my laptop would like not secured and no connection. When I clearly do bc my other devices are working. I desperately need one for school. \n\nWith everything going on recently. I\u2019m not in a good mindset. it\u2019s mentally tasking and I\u2019m just worried I won\u2019t be able to handle it all.

Manage your tasks day by day or week by week. School tends to make my anxiety worse and it causes me to over plan the future, which causes me to feel stressed and overwhelmed. I combat this by writing down tasks that I need to get done every week as supposed to stressing about the months ahead. Write down the problems you're trying to overcome and tackle them one by one. For example, your laptop isn't working so I would email your professors on another device explaining this and say that you may have difficulty with parts of the class because of it. Then look into either replacing it or getting it fixed and in the mean time you can use one at your schools computer lab, go to the library, or buy a refurbished laptop (they are usually cheaper). Tackle a couple of tasks a day outside of school/ work and remember to take time for yourself.", "author": "icyhot09", "created": 1611593603, "upvotes": 1}, "gkpxbtq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l4cjxr/new_semester_begins_tomorrow_im_stressed_already/gkpxbtq/", "text": "Take it from someone who used to take 18 credits....TAKE LESS CREDITS.

I just finished a VERY stressful winter semester yesterday, so the fact that I took two classes over winter break (one in nervous about even passing), jumping into the next one feels like emotional parkour.

I think you could benefit from taking a lighter load this year, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \nTalk to your professors, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.
