I just want it to be over but the semester still have 3 fucking months left.\n\nAny tips on how to change my mind?? like i know everything is on my head, i drink coffe and somedays takes showers before getting online, i just wish i could have my brain washed to wake up earlier.", "author": "roseekilljoy", "created": 1631189887, "retrieved": 1632841113, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hc68lq9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkwnv9/i_despise_having_online_classes_at_7_am_and_its_a/hc68lq9/", "text": "Thank you u/roseekilljoy for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
