  "title:": "I despise having online classes at 7 am and its a crime.",
  "text": "Im in mexico, we are still online, literally no one in my uni is having classes at 7 am. our semester is the only one, oh and we have been doing this two semesters in a row, why?? because my optics teacher has kids and it suits her better to have classes at 7 am. bc thanks to her kids shes already awake. so we have to suffer too.   \nI dont know if yall in the us, are used to classes at 7 am, and you may see this as a joke but its so fucking insane to be in your own home at fucking 7 am, like ive tried anything coffee, having a shower at 6 fucking am, sleeping 8 hours, but nothing helps, i just feel so bad when i wake up and have to sit in my fucking computer. \n\nI dont have a problem on waking up early to actually go to the campus, that's good because you get to see your pals and shit, but being alone at home, listening to class that no ones wants to take because they're fucking sleeping, oh and that's another thing, everyone is asleep, expect a few of us, so it feels so unfair. I just want it to be over but the semester still have 3 fucking months left.\n\nAny tips on how to change my mind?? like i know everything is on my head, i drink coffe and somedays takes showers before getting online, i just wish i could have my brain washed to wake up earlier.",
