You know I haven't stepped foot in a physical classroom since kindergarten? I was in an online charter school for my entire elementary, middle, and high school education. It was because the school district I live in really isn't that great, and I probably thrived academically because of my online school. That being said, I feel like I am socially stunted because there were wasn't that much student/student interaction outside of heavily moderated ones in class\n\nI was hoping I could use college to come out of my shell and make friends who I could actually talk to and hang out with irl, maybe even finally get to date (dating is nonexistent in online school if you haven't noticed) and figure out who I am as a person (parents are super overbearing and have a whole issue with me stepping outside of the boundaries of what they have already decided I am) \n\nBut the fates basically said \"lol, pandemic go brr\" and sentenced me to year another academic school year of remote learning. Only it's even worse because I think college people are even less sociable in remote classes than high school kids (understandably so because they're busy with work and adult things, but still!) \n\nI've tried going the LGBTQ+ school club, which I have always wanted to do, and they're doing their best under the circumstances (meetings twice a month where we sit and talk for an hour) but and they're definitely taking the edge off but my mental health is still shit \n\nEspecially since all the stress and isolation of the pandemic has made my home situation (did I mention I'm still living at home?!)  even worse because it's just constant arguing about money and all I'm told is to just chill out because I'm 18 and have nothing to worry about and I should just appreciate that I have a place to live because I'm lucky enough to have parents that don't just throw me out on the street as soon as I'm legally an adult.\n\nSo yeah, I hate online school with a burning passion and my mental health has just been a slow downward spiral since March but at least I'm getting a super long winter break (not even coursework to distract me from my shitty household) so I can \"refresh\" and do it all over again starting in January.\n\nwoooooo", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1606680966, "upvotes": 9}}}
