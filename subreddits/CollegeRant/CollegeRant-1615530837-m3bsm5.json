Learning to get your point across in less pages can require for you to go and make the writing better rather than just endless monotoning. Try to look at your paper and ask if what your thesis is then look if each part of your paper supports your thesis and explains how it supports your thesis. And anything that doesn't directly support your thesis cut, doesn't matter if you think it's relevant if you can't or don't explain how it is relevant to your thesis then it doesn't belong (hardest thing I've had to learn about my own writing but doing that does make your paper so much better)", "author": "Pacman042", "created": 1615599358, "upvotes": 8}, "gqq5p4t": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m3bsm5/that_amazing_feeling_when_you_finally_finish_your/gqq5p4t/", "text": "You guys are going more in depth than they are looking for.", "author": "maybehun", "created": 1615579271, "upvotes": 2}, "gqpulyv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m3bsm5/that_amazing_feeling_when_you_finally_finish_your/gqpulyv/", "text": "....aaaand forget to save.
