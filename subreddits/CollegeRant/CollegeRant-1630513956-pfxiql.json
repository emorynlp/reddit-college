Finally one without the strawman professor. \n\nThe shit getting dumped on us by the administration is so disheartening. We are not allowed to ask students if they have been vaccinated. We are not allowed to tell other students if someone in the class has contracted COVID. We and the students are notified only if we personally meet the standard for an exposure, which is less than 6 feet for 15 minutes within a single hour within a 24 hour period, and only then if the student reports this exposure to their doctor. With a class of 200 students who don't know each other, how the fuck are students supposed to tell their doctor who sat next to them for 50, or 75 minutes? \n\nMy institution is reporting 30 active cases out of 20,000 students and a meager 50% vaccination rate. They promised to do weekly tests of all unvaccinated students, but at week 3 they have done only 1,000 test of unvaccinated students with a 11% positive rate. Somehow 11% of 1,000 is 30? In reality there are more likely 1,100 positive cases on campus right now. The missing 80 active cases... they sent home!!! Home to their families, to get everyone else in their antivax circle sick. \n\nAmerica is ungovernable, we are all screwed.", "author": "titosphone", "created": 1630539946, "upvotes": 3}, "hb8iexo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfxiql/im_going_to_end_up_getting_exposed_to_covid/hb8iexo/", "text": "Same at my school here in Canada :(", "author": "nerdfighteriaisland", "created": 1630530410, "upvotes": 2}, "hb866th": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfxiql/im_going_to_end_up_getting_exposed_to_covid/hb866th/", "text": "This is so wrong...on so many levels.
