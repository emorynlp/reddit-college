  "text": "My university was doing really well handling covid cases until they suddenly decided that they didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the pandemic anymore. Social distancing went away, cases are no longer tracked, and there are plenty of super-spreader \u201cwelcome back\u201d events going on.\n\nI\u2019ve had classes cancelled several times this week because the professors are getting sick. There\u2019s no telling how many students have covid because nobody is keeping track anymore. We\u2019re just occasionally told \u201cdon\u2019t sit in that seat\u201d because somebody tested positive for covid in an earlier class.\n\nI get it. I\u2019m sick of covid. I just want a normal semester. Ignoring covid entirely and pretending that it doesn\u2019t exist on campus isn\u2019t the solution though. We still need to be cautious.",

Time to get used to that fact, your vaccination should keep it a mild cold at the absolute worst and many times it should prevent an infection from even happening.",

Over the past two years, she has been treating covid-19 patients every day; even those who had the Delta variant. The viral load she is exposed to is many times more than you and I are exposed to.\n\nOf course, she received two doses of the vaccine, but she attributes her safety to double-masking through it all. *One single-use mask underneath and one cloth mask over it, both fit properly over the nose bridge and under the chin.* \n\nSo if you are fully vaccinated and you are double masking, you will be safe.",

      "text": "Thank you for this rant! Finally one without the strawman professor. \n\nThe shit getting dumped on us by the administration is so disheartening. We are not allowed to ask students if they have been vaccinated. We are not allowed to tell other students if someone in the class has contracted COVID. We and the students are notified only if we personally meet the standard for an exposure, which is less than 6 feet for 15 minutes within a single hour within a 24 hour period, and only then if the student reports this exposure to their doctor. With a class of 200 students who don't know each other, how the fuck are students supposed to tell their doctor who sat next to them for 50, or 75 minutes? \n\nMy institution is reporting 30 active cases out of 20,000 students and a meager 50% vaccination rate. They promised to do weekly tests of all unvaccinated students, but at week 3 they have done only 1,000 test of unvaccinated students with a 11% positive rate. Somehow 11% of 1,000 is 30? In reality there are more likely 1,100 positive cases on campus right now. The missing 80 active cases... they sent home!!! Home to their families, to get everyone else in their antivax circle sick. \n\nAmerica is ungovernable, we are all screwed.",
