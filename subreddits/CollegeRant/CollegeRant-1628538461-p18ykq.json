However, the way my school\u2019s degree works is set up for my major is confusing. There\u2019s a section that doesn\u2019t tell you what classes to take to fulfill that section\u2019s requirement, so basically your advisor has to tell you what to take for it. My original advisor had the plan all worked out for me, but then left my college for a new job so I was transferred to a new advisor who has done absolutely nothing to help me except make the situation more confusing. Whenever I\u2019ve emailed him about a question, I get an automated message that he\u2019s out of the office for either a vacation or an emergency. This has happened since he became my advisor in the spring. So I was working with the student services manager since he is never available and she had a new plan for me to fulfill this requirement, which involved dropping a class I was registered for for the fall semester because I apparently didn\u2019t need it. Now she\u2019s left my college to start a PhD program, and my assigned advisor still is on vacation or whatever so I\u2019m working with another advising manager. Now she is telling me that I need to register for the class that I was told I needed to drop. I\u2019m so annoyed because I\u2019ve been told different things by all four people and I wish they would\u2019ve set up degree works to where it told you exactly what to take to fulfill this section so it wouldn\u2019t be so confusing. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of advisors screwing up students\u2019 graduations last minute because of class registrations and I\u2019m trying to prevent that from happening to me, but it seems like I can\u2019t ever get the correct answer to my issue.", "author": "Mkgrigsby29", "created": 1628538461, "retrieved": 1632949128, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h8c87ab": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p18ykq/confusing_advisors/h8c87ab/", "text": "Go to admissions and request a degree audit.
