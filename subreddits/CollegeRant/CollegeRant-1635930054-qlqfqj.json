  "text": "Why is this? I already dropped 2 classes and currently failing one. But I just don\u2019t really care about it. I use to be driven to actually do well in school. I use to freak out when I received a bad grade. But now that I\u2019m in college it just doesn\u2019t matter to me. I know it\u2019s important to do well but I just have no drive and I\u2019m kind of ok with that? It\u2019s like I\u2019m just letting life take the wheel while Im staring out the backseat window and accepting wherever it takes me. It\u2019s a bit freeing actually. Like nothing really matters when I\u2019ll just be dead in the end anyway. So I might as well enjoy the ride instead of worrying about all these small things. Idk maybe I\u2019m crazy but this where my head is at right now",

(This isn't true for all majors, im an engineer so I need at least a 3). Once I started taking classes that are specific to my major it became a lot easier to want to do good. Maybe it will be the same for you.",
