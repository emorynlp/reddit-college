      "text": "Wasn't my partner per se, but it was the person directly opposite to my lab station ... had a safety issue.\n\nFirst year chemistry 4 years ago:\n\n* We were doing the copper cycle experiment. Knowing the reaction produces nitrogen dioxide, which is a poisonous brown fume, she brilliantly decided to do it ***outside*** the fumehood.\n* Let's just say the lab instructor gave the person a 0 for lab safety (worth 15% of the total lab grade) as **they repeatedly said** to do it under the fume hood. It was written on the board in big red letters. It was **bolded and underlined** in the lab manual.\n* Luckily, no one was hurt during the experiment.",

We had to dissect an owl pellet and this guy didn\u2019t wear gloves he just pick it up. He then grab the rat bones and skulls and was dividing them up and planned on taking them home. I was like you don\u2019t have do that you can take them all. He was like really cool! Then he put them in his backpack loose not even in a sandwich bag and didn\u2019t wash his hands.",
