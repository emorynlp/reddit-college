  "text": "I'm inW undergrad and am TA'ing for one of my classes this semester. It's the first time I've ever gotten to see other students' work in bulk, and their essays are just...so bad sometimes. It's not an English class and typically we mainly grade them on content, but it's an upper division psych class and sometimes I read these submissions and I can't understand how they got this far? I'm not the world's best writer by long shot, but so many of these students don't use paragraph breaks, use run-sentences, can't spell, etc. Sometimes I read stuff that's so far gone I have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nI don't know if this is a question or a rant or if I'm just confused but...how? Am I expecting too much of other students?",

      "text": "College isn\u2019t for everyone but, unfortunately, we\u2019ve come to think it is. English comes really easily to some and quite poorly to others. I thought the same when I came to college. I figured everyone would be so good at writing papers and, yet, I actually find that the majority of people are uniquely bad at writing compared to people in my high school.\n\nI read a paper from a classmate where this person literally said \u201cyeah i found it really interesting that Goldwater said _____.\u201d like, bro\u2026you can\u2019t just say \u201cyeah i found it interesting\u201d in an ESSAY????",
