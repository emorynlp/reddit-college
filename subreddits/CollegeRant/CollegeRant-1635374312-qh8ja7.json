  "text": "I'm inW undergrad and am TA'ing for one of my classes this semester. It's the first time I've ever gotten to see other students' work in bulk, and their essays are just...so bad sometimes. It's not an English class and typically we mainly grade them on content, but it's an upper division psych class and sometimes I read these submissions and I can't understand how they got this far? I'm not the world's best writer by long shot, but so many of these students don't use paragraph breaks, use run-sentences, can't spell, etc. Sometimes I read stuff that's so far gone I have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nI don't know if this is a question or a rant or if I'm just confused but...how? Am I expecting too much of other students?",
