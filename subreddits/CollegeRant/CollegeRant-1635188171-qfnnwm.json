  "text": "I have yet again failed another exam. At this point I\u2019m not going to amount to anything in life and it\u2019s just so stressful, I feel like a failure. Im failing my algebra tests and the tests are so easy! I can\u2019t remember any of the formulas to save my life. Failing something so simple as adding and multiplying, that\u2019s it. Adding rationals, factorizing, simplifying. It\u2019s something so simple and yet I just\u2026can\u2019t seem to pass any of my tests! Midterms came and I have a D, the test I took today probably dropped my grade to an F. I got a 36% because I ran out of time. I\u2019m so stressed and I feel like dropping out but I don\u2019t want to give up. I need to pass so I can take precalc next semester so I can transfer to the aviation field in another university. I wish I never went to college this year, I don\u2019t have a car, I don\u2019t have a license, I can\u2019t go in person, I\u2019m stuck in online classes and I\u2019m learning jack shit. I hate my life and I\u2019m just going to be miserable and remain a failure.. \n\nTL;DR: Failed my algebra test(s) and I feel like a failure.",

      "text": "Does your school have a tutoring center for students? That was literally the only reason I survived pre-calc when I went to college. I recommend flashcards if it's a formula issue. That way you can quickly go over them just about anywhere. Also, youtube when it comes to math IS A LIFE SAVIOR. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, a LOT of us struggle with math. It's such an abstract thing to a lot of us and that's why you're basically asking us to remember \"apple plus grapefruit equals truck\" which makes little to no logical sense, hah.",
