  "text": "I do not care for economics\nI\u2019m making a 67 in this stupid class I was making a 75 until I took the test. I need a C.\nThey even make us show our entire rooms to them when we take a test, make us get our id\u2019s, and record everything while we\u2019re taking the tests.\nI fucking hate this class. I just want to transfer out already.\n\nWhy the fuck is economics required for a damn computer degree?",
