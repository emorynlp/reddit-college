  "text": "Hey there Im 19M from the Middle East and I have been going to college for a month and a half and past experiences are on other posts. This week Ive seen two girls which I felt they are not feeling good. One in my ENG class, she never had a smile on her face, well Im the only guy she approached and she asked me how I did in a small quiz, the next time she asked me about my major, the day after she gave a thumbs up about another quiz (this past week), and idk the point of all these but Im the only guy she approached in that class, and they were all small talks nothing more ever happened and she is attractive. So I started noticing that she doesnt feel good, but sometimes I see her with her friends talking and spending time normally. Are the assumptions I made wrong? Do you think I should approach her? There is another one who is lonely and doesnt interact with people, who doesnt have a common class with me, but the problem I have is the reaction that they'll have when I approach them, either they turned down a convo or react negatively. So should I approach either of them or forget about it? Thank You :)",
