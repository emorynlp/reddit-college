  "text": "First off, I'm new to this subreddit, so hi. I just started my junior year of college, and I've finally gotten through most of my general education courses. For this fall semester, I'm taking all major/degree focused courses, which for me means art/graphic design. My first mistake was deciding to take two courses with the same professor, Intro to Digital Design and Typography Studio 1, both being asynchronous online courses. I always read [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com) reviews, because they have been extremely helpful in the past deciding on who I should take and who I should avoid. This professor looked okay based on the ratings, half and half with good and bad, but boy was I fooled. It turns out this guy is every bad trait a professor can have combined into one person. He has to be the worst professor I've ever had. He assigns these weekly projects that could yield simple final solutions, but you discover he overcomplicated them by adding on extra steps that are completely unnecessary. He does not clarify crucial information, he contradicts and repeats instructions in the same assignments, and he often makes these assignment requirements pages so lengthy and confusing that it is hard to tell what he even wants. He has been nothing but rude when responding to my simple polite questions through canvas, and overall seems grumpy or angry. I don't know what his deal is, but he's a terrible professor. I've tried giving him a chance, but now I'm starting to worry. I've been panicking each week for the last three weeks since the semester began because of his crazy assignments that take way too much time to complete what should be a simple composition through adobe illustrator. What makes things worse is that, again, I chose to take two courses from him in the same semester. So that's double the workload that was already too much for just one of his classes. It's too late to drop one course or both courses now without paying those awful drop fees, but I'm not sure I can deal with him for the next three months. This is not good. I'm forfeiting my mental health to someone who doesn't even care about his students, other than the fact that they are paying him to do nothing. We will see if I can pull off a C in both by December, but I've already suffered with grades since everything is 50, 75, or 100 points. This guy is ruthless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My professor that I have for both Digital Design and Typography Studio 1 is rude, careless, and has WAY too high expectations with a work load that gives me constant anxiety! He is downright awful, and the worst professor I've had in my over two years in college.",
