I didn\u2019t know who to talk to or where to post this.\n\nI\u2019m an extreme introvert and only feel comfortable talking to my friends. I get so tired talking to professors, TAs, and new people. I\u2019m about to finish my first year of college and looking back I feel as though I could\u2019ve done better if I had reach out to talk to those more well verse in the subjects. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a STEM major taking multiple 300 level classes.\n\nWhen I did manage to gather up the courage to talk to the professor or the TA sometimes it feels like I can\u2019t communicate well with them or ask the right question to get myself to understand the material and it just makes talking to them feel that much longer. Once we\u2019re done talking and I leave being more confuse than ever, I would just collapse on my bed after the long social interaction. And I have to do this constantly for 3 different classes everyday. I\u2019ve had a couple of situation where my anxieties sky rockets to the point of anxiety attacks.\n\nI\u2019m afraid of how my mental state will be for when we have in person classes. My college goes by the quarter system, so we have 3 quarters total in a year. After Autumn quarter we have about a month break (which is a joy) before Winter quarter. And after Winter quarter we have only a week break before Spring quarter, and this is where my mental exhaustion hits me like a truck.\n\nI don\u2019t particularly have a choice since I\u2019m not a genius student. I constantly have low self esteem, imposter syndrome, anxiety, and need help understanding the material. Which forces me to ask others for help but the more I interact with people, friend or not, I just collapse on my bed in exhaustion after just a short 30 minutes talk. \n\nI never had this issue in high school since the material in high school wasn\u2019t as difficult and rarely had to talk to people since I already knew what to do. I wasn\u2019t a mute in high school just didn\u2019t talked as much as I did in college. \n\nI considered getting some mental help but the thought of more social situation spikes my anxiety. I don\u2019t want people to worry about me either and constantly making sure I\u2019m alright since that also spikes my anxiety and external self awareness.\n\nThat about sums up my rant. I\u2019m so tired and I don\u2019t want to go through this for 3 more years. I\u2019m also concern about the amount of social interaction I\u2019ll have to do to finding a internship or a job after college. Growing up to be apart of society standards is driving me insane and I wish I could just isolate myself from the world forever.\n\nThank you for reading <3. I\u2019m a total mess lol.\n\n\nTL;DR: Exhausted introvert college freshman with lots of anxiety is tired of talking to people and just wants to sleep her days away.\n\nEdit: Am I going through a social burnout and academic burnout?\n\nEdit2: I'm back after finals, thank you for all the thoughtful comments and replies. It's reassuring to hear everyone's point of view and concerns. I'll try to get my social anxiety in check and build myself a comfortable environment <3.", "author": "Red_Radish0202", "created": 1623067898, "retrieved": 1632842260, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h1y1fjw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/h1y1fjw/", "text": "Thank you u/Red_Radish0202 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I figured out that my anxiety around talking to \u2018strangers with authority\u2019 had nothing to do with being an introvert, and more to do with the fact I had little experience doing it and had anxiety approaching authority figures that weren\u2019t my parents. The more I was forced to interact with bosses, coworkers, professors, TAs, and classmates, the more confident I became and the less anxiety I felt about approaching professors for help. Though now even as a grad student, I still feel I could work on that more.\n\nYour anxiety is separate from your introverted personality. It\u2019s normal to have some level of social anxiety. It\u2019s normal for extended interactions to wear you out. Since you\u2019re an introvert, they probably always will, to some extent. But I promise these types of interactions will get easier and feel more natural, and you\u2019ll be more a more effective communicator, as you have them more often with more people. Have faith in that. Think of it as another part of college preparing you for your internship and beyond.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s time to address your anxiety with a mental health professional if it\u2019s progressed to panic attacks. You don\u2019t have to tell your friends or *anyone* you\u2019re seeing a therapist.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have social or academic burnout. I think this is one of the first times in your life that your comfortable boundaries are being stretched and challenged. Your university set the bar higher than your HS. Just because you\u2019re struggling to adjust to that bar (we all do), doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t one day meet it or surpass it. Be patient and kind to yourself. One day you\u2019ll be grateful that people set that bar higher than you were comfortable with, because it helped you to be better than you ever thought you could be.", "author": "FakinItAndMakinIt", "created": 1623097812, "upvotes": 2}, "h0y34b5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/h0y34b5/", "text": "You may want to reach out to mental health professionals on campus. Yes, it may spike your anxiety, BUT they can share tips for emotionally managing these situations. There are meds for social anxiety that really helped me\u2026you may likewise benefit. There\u2019s meds for panic attacks and generalized anxiety, too. You can always quit the meds (slowly and with a doctor\u2019s guidance) after you graduate. \n\nAlso, on your Uni\u2019s webpage you should find resources for struggling students. There may be tutoring options or tools to find a study group\u2014-all these would require social interaction, yes, but you may get better assistance this way than via the TA. Is there anyone in any of your classes you can ask even a simple question of? Perhaps send an email to the TA, too, and say you\u2019re struggling and ask for guidance on what resources are available (tutoring, etc). \n\nLearning all-online is hard for everyone. Things may become (much!) easier once you have in person lectures. \n\nThese various actions may cause a spike in your anxiety in the short term, but I think you gain benefit in the long run.", "author": "goopy-goo", "created": 1623094964, "upvotes": 2}, "h0xq73e": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/h0xq73e/", "text": "Even those of us who aren\u2019t extremely introverted are feeling a bit of this right now... I always find myself wanting to avoid people at all costs, unless I\u2019m currently conversing with them. Everyone has gotten so used to being on their own at this point.\n\nAs for making more friends in your major, the two magic tricks for me are study groups and tabletop games. Arranging a study group creates an environment where everybody serves to gain from being a part of it, and conversation is easy because there is always a topic to start on: the classwork. Once you\u2019re hanging out with people just for fun and want to cement that friendship, tabletop games are always a great way to do so, because you can usually find one that they\u2019ll enjoy and they\u2019re a blessing if you\u2019re like me and struggle to come up with conversation topics.\n\nAs for professors, I too struggle to form connections with them. I guess it\u2019s probably good that you ask a lot of questions to them; their answers may not be the most helpful but at least they get to know your name and get the impression that you\u2019re interested in their class.", "author": "Quantum-Bot", "created": 1623089486, "upvotes": 5}, "h0wroj2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/h0wroj2/", "text": "Im going through this - introverted junior CS major and I just got off a meeting with my boss that I\u2019m interning with.

Since you're in STEM, everyone is a huge goddamn nerd: show enthusiasm for the subject and the rapport will establish itself. Also, they're there to respond to student questions as a huge part of their job, so they're used to it and will respond in kindness.", "author": "StarvinPig", "created": 1623068668, "upvotes": 10}, "h0wfdnh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/h0wfdnh/", "text": "Thank you u/Red_Radish0202 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
