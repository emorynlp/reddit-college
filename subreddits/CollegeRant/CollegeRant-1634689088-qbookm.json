  "title:": "Dumbass lab partner makes everything more complicated than it has to be",
  "text": "For starters, the last lab we had to do together, i had everything set up for us to start (he was late btw) and when he got there, he proceeded to waste ten minutes recalibrating all the equipment that I already calibrated. The lab report for the same lab in due in 3 hours, I had my part and all the calculations done this morning and then I set up a google docs so he can just pop in and add his part in. The bastard proceeds to download it as a word document and decides to edit it there. When i explained to him how that was a complete waste of time and it\u2019ll make harder for us to actually collaborate considering we\u2019re not doing it in person, he completely brushed it off. He just sent me the document for last minute edits AND HE HASNT EVEN DONE HIS PART YET!! Time to cram in this lab report all on my own :)\n\nTL;DR: My lab partner over complicates everything and doesn\u2019t do what he\u2019s supposed to do and it\u2019s pissing me off.",

          "text": "No. We have an assigned lab schedule that\u2019s a three hour class, after i set everything he up he took it all down and started from scratch himself. And on top of that, for the report i finished my part with plenty of time to spare he started his stuff last minute. Also, there\u2019w absolutely no point converting the google docs to a word document BEFORE it\u2019s done. The whole point is to work together before it\u2019s done but he completely voided that.",
