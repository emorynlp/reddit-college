  "text": "Hello all, I am a final year student in Ireland. Recently I was informed by some coursemates that for one of my classes we had to submit 9 response papers per term in order to get our essays graded. The thing is, the course syllabus says that only 5 papers need to be submitted per term in order to make the 10% attendance grade, with no mention of the 9. The professor mentioned this once in class, which I had forgotten, and mentioned it to a couple of other students while emailing them one on one. Not once did she make this clear in any class wide emails either. I understand that this is course policy and perhaps I should have kept my ears wide open in the class where she mentioned this but nonetheless I do think its an unfair asymmetry of information for such a stringent requirement. At the very least it should be made abundantly clear in writing. Apologies for going on a rant but I am worried about the implications that this may have for my final grade.\n\nEdit: didn't originally mention how I discovered that 9 response papers were necessary\n\n&#x200B;",
