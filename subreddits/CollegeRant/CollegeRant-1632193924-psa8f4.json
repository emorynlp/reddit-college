I took the test to be able to skip and according to my academic advisor, the dumbass testing center still hasn't updated my test status or uploaded my results after a month of taking the test when it took others literally a day for their results to be uploaded and they could register for calc immediately. What the actual FUCK? I literally waited a month for no fucking reason and wasted more time than I should have.\n\nThen I go to the testing center still trying to keep my cool and go in there and try to explain the situation. This big fatass ugly gorilla, wart nosed, four eyed, karen bitch literally didn't even let me say a word and on God said exactly this while giving an ugly ass smile: \"I don't want to hear your story,\" and proceeds to keep looking at me and not at the computer screen which is her fucking job. I was about to punch her dumbass face in after she said that wasting more of my time so that I can't get good professors. Doesn't even try to look and then I have to go back to the institution I took the test at to see what the fuck happened. I get a call from that same bitch saying that \"oh it looks like your results were uploaded after all haha.\"\n\nI wish her the worst fortune for the rest of her life because I got stuck with the worst calc professor this semester and I really wanted to take calc and do well. I burst into tears every night now because of this bitch.\n\nWhat kind of ooga boogas do these professional and recognized institutions hire to help provide for their students? What a fucking joke. I'm thinking about going back to that testing center and spitting on her face that's how fucking mad I am.", "author": "WardenTitan", "created": 1632193924, "retrieved": 1632840992, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hdoc3bl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psa8f4/why_the_fuck_is_class_registration_so_fucking/hdoc3bl/", "text": "Thank you u/WardenTitan for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
