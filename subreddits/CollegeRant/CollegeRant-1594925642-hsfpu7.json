Fair enough, makes sense especially in times like these, and with my campus opening in the fall (for a mix of hybrid, in person, and online classes). But everytime I apply for a waiver, I get denied, because I dont have primary care within thirty miles of campus. Fuck off with that shit. I am an out of state student with no chronic health conditions and you have a goddamn health clinic on campus if I need something right away. \"But covid!\" If I get covid, Im going to fucking emergency and urgent care, which I am covered for under my insurance (that my parents pay out the fucking nose for, since its through the state). \"Maybe you can do an online semester.\" Fuck that noise, as a performing arts/school of sciences double major, I'm not paying your tution prices (which they arent lowering for online classes) and taking extra time (which my scholarship wouldn't cover) to graduate, especially since a lot of my classes require an in person presence. \"The insurance is only an extra two hundred a month!\" Which my family can't fucking pay because of fucking covid! \"File fafsa, maybe you'll qualify for more aide.\" My family made less money in 2019, but fafsa required us to use 2018 information, so that will be a fucking no-go. What the hell?? Despite some other issues, I usually love my school, but what the fuck is with this bullshit??!", "author": "sarcasticallysatan", "created": 1594925642, "retrieved": 1632951433, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"fybbo5o": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hsfpu7/i_have_health_insurance_i_dont_need_to_pay_for/fybbo5o/", "text": "Why not just get a prinary care doc near campus?
