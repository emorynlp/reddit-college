  "text": "My fall semester is remote and my advisor told me to expect spring semester to be remote as well, meaning I am likely to finish my senior year remote. I\u2019m back home with my parents, which has always been a toxic and abusive household. I went through a bit of a rough patch financially a couple years ago and ended up living in my car for a bit, seeing it as a preferred option than coming back home, just to put things into perspective. \n\nI am debt free right now and would rather work towards being able to pay for my masters degree than take out loans for a place to live right now, but it\u2019s so emotionally taxing to be home. I started on antidepressants in June and am on a waitlist to begin insurance covered therapy, but the dysfunction coupled with losing my coping strategy (gyms are closed where I live) I am at a loss. I know i\u2019m not the only one going through this, just wanted to rant and send out my emotions into the universe.",
