The last few weeks have been absolute hell and filled with mental breakdowns due to my job and family, and I\u2019m going to go take a midterm during office hours but I\u2019d rather just take the 0 since this professor drops the lowest midterm score anyway. I really haven\u2019t been able to study because of everything going on, but I feel like if I tell my professor this that he\u2019ll just think Im making excuses. Is it appropriate to tell the professor what\u2019s been going on the last few weeks and tell him I know I\u2019m going to fail so I\u2019d rather just take the 0, or should I just go through with the exam and take the low score? If it was multiple choice I would just take it and hope for the best, however I need to know everything since it\u2019s an essay format and I really couldn\u2019t absorb any material.", "author": "milkktteea", "created": 1632932307, "retrieved": 1632948360, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"heqm29x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxytnj/i_want_to_tell_my_professor_id_rather_just_take/heqm29x/", "text": "It really all depends on the professor. Some would view this as disrespectful. Others, like me, would think that you\u2019re just weighing your options and making a decision for yourself. No matter what, I much prefer that a student tells me what\u2019s going on and simply take a zero rather than trying to slog through and performing poorly as a result. It\u2019s ultimately your decision as to how you do in a course, and if you are comfortable taking a zero for this midterm, then that would be your choice. The only potential negative here could be that you may end up in a worse situation come finals time, so you may have wished you\u2019d at least taken the midterm. That\u2019s your decision, and you know your circumstances better than anyone else.\n\nDo you have any idea how he might respond?", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1632932494, "upvotes": 7}}}
