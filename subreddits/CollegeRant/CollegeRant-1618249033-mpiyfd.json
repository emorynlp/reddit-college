      "text": "Everyone does. If most human beings were wired to do well in online classes, the world wouldn\u2019t be covered in universities with classrooms. Humanity would long ago have gone to self directed study and they would just teach themselves out of books and correspondence. If hearing people talk was the problem, classrooms would have gone away after the widespread adoption of radio. If video was the problem, after television. If timing was the problem, after cheap records and video cassettes. If speedier correspondence was the problem, after the development of rudimentary email systems in the 1980s.\n\nOnline classes aren\u2019t a revolutionary technology, they\u2019re just an assemblage of tech that takes some of the edge off. The people who *actually* function well in online classes would, given access to a large library and a reasonably fast postal system, probably function perfectly well learning via books and written correspondence in the 19th century.",
