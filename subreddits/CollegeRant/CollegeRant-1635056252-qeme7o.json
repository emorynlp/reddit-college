  "text": "The class does not want to see you kissing your husband during class!! It's so ugh! A student's bored wife needed attention last week apparently and kept kissing all over him during our psychology Zoom class!! First off, kind of rude to insert yourself into our class. We couldn't be free to talk casually with a non-student in our class \ud83d\ude11 and secondly sexy time can wait! Get a life outside your man!! Ugh! That was so irritating!\n\nTL:DR tell your spouse they can wait for affection/kisses off camera for zoom class",

If they weren't on mute, I suggest muting everyone (as a private message to your teacher during the zoom call, or to tell your teacher that it's distracting so they would mute them).",
