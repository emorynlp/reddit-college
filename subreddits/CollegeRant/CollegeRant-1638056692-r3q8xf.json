  "title:": "Internship During Last Semester of College",
  "text": "\nI transferred to a university in Fall 2020 and all of my classes have been online. When I picked a school I wanted to go to, we were 1 month into the pandemic and I wasn\u2019t expecting to have online classes for this long. My university is 7 hours away from me and I never had the opportunity to take any in-person classes. Next semester will be the last opportunity of me having a chance to have in-person classes there and I won\u2019t get to go to my university until graduation in May.\n\n I got accepted into an competitive internship program that takes place during that semester and it\u2019s in my hometown. The internship will help me get a jumpstart on my career and I could possibly get a job as soon as I graduate. I will be able to receive units from the internship, so it won\u2019t delay my graduation date. The internship also requires me to take two seminars at the university in my hometown. Am I doing the right thing by staying in my hometown for an internship or should I take in person classes at the university 7 hours away and worry about getting a job later?",

      "text": "It sounds like a great opportunity but also consider what would be most beneficial overall to you. Will you regret not going in-person at all? Is there a way to do something similar to this internship while attending an in-person class? Does the likelihood of getting a job from this outweigh the pros of taking in-person classes for you?  \n\nMake a pros and cons list for each, if you haven\u2019t already. Sometimes skipping an internship is better for one\u2019s mental health, and that outweighs the pros of possibly getting a job quicker. For others, they\u2019ll happily sacrifice their social life for school and work. It all depends on the person.",

          "text": "S/he said it won\u2019t impact her/his graduation date, just being able to take courses in person instead of online. I think the question is whether it\u2019s more worthwhile to have the work experience, or the experience of classes on campus. \n\n/u/iloveharrypotter_, I understand the frustration. You\u2019ve had this idea of college built up in your head for a while, I\u2019m guessing including spending time on campus, which you haven\u2019t been able to do. It\u2019s disappointing when reality doesn\u2019t live up to your imagination. \n\nAn internship that will give you a jump start in your field is most definitely worthwhile. Being on campus is a fun experience, but, aside from physically meeting your classmates and coworkers and being able to go to advisors\u2019 offices and such instead of calling or emailing them, it\u2019s not a huge difference from online coursework. \n\nThe internship will help you more than being on campus will. However, if your heart isn\u2019t in it and you find yourself immensely disappointed or depressed over not getting that on campus experience, well, only you know you. \n\nI also recommend talking with an advisor at school.",

              "text": "Thank you for the advice. I spoke to my advisor over a month ago and I\u2019m able to do the internship without it delaying my graduation. The units I\u2019ll get for the internship will go towards my degree. Another part of the internship requires me to take two seminars at the university at my hometown so I\u2019ll be able to get a small amount of the college experience. This internship is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I feel like I\u2019ll regret it if I turn it down.",

Also, the next semester will definitely fly by so fast you probably won't have a lot of time to have your in person college dreams come true because that takes a bit longer than one semester. covid fucked up people's college expectations. reality of the pandemic has come and we have to live with having a different college experience.",
