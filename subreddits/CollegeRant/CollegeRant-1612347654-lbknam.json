We've been doing this for about a year and a half, and with my help she has been getting better grades in her essays, so, even if I was doing an assignment for another class, I put everything on pause and begin editing her essay.\n\nIt doesn't take much, maybe half an hour, before I announce that I'm done. I'm about to pick back up the assignment I had left on pause with the intention of finishing it and going to bed, when my friend sends me another text asking me if I had already finished the assignment for X class.\n\n*Panic*.\n\nI look *everywhere* and this assignment doesn't even seem to exist. Not on the Canvas calendar, not on the syllabus, not in the announcement the professor has posted during the weekend to remind us that we're still going to do classes remotely during this week because of the snowstorm. I went through the syllabus about twenty times, going through the essays and tests section to make sure that I wasn't maybe skipping a line of instructions or two, but there was absolutely nothing there! Only the descriptions of the mid-term and the final.\n\nYou know where it was? In the files section, which was hidden into the modules one!\n\nWhat the fuck???? And apparently the only reason my friend knew about it was because she had printed the syllabus before the professor could pull it off of Canvas and upload a *second*, *different* version.\n\nJUST WHY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: professor put assignment in a hidden spot on Canvas, didn't do it, so now I'm panicking.", "author": "screamingracoon", "created": 1612347654, "retrieved": 1632842576, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 434, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gluhr6x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lbknam/can_professors_just_begin_putting_all_the/gluhr6x/", "text": "Thank you u/screamingracoon for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
