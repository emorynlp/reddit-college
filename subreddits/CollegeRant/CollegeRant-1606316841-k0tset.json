No Free Food :(", "text": "I keep thinking about how we're missing out on so much free food at campus events and such.\n\nEspecially during the holidays, according to upperclassmen and professors there's usually a lot of free food on campus, especially pastries. My student mentor for Math says that she usually brings in donuts in for morning study sessions, and they'll be special decorated ones when it's near holidays  \n\nAnd during Halloween, people just like giving away candy for no reason.\n\nAlso pizza, apparently there are usually lots of events where they have pizza\n\nAnyway, that's just reason #5731589932 on why remote learning sucks (it's necessary of course, but still shitty!) \n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk :D", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1606316841, "retrieved": 1632842773, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 278, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gdmm2ya": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k0tset/you_know_what_really_sucks_about_remote_learning/gdmm2ya/", "text": "Now this is a rant I can get behind.

Am broke ass grad student, have been hearing stories from the more senior grad students about all of the opportunities there normally were to grab free food.   The smart ones were carrying storage containers in their backpacks because sometimes they'd have so much food at these events that they let the grad students take some home with them.\n\nIt also makes me sad because I really enjoy baking for people (I tend to stress bake) and I would have loved to be able to bring my teaching team and my lab fresh-baked goodies to our meetings.  (Especially since my teaching team has been wonderful while I had a family loss earlier this month, telling them that they have an IOU for their favorite cookies isn't quite the \"thank you\" that they deserve).  I'd also be the one keeping a bag of candy in my backpack for my students who didn't dip out of lab before we were actually done for the day.\n\nDefinitely another one on the mountain of reasons remote learning sucks horribly.", "author": "LadyWolfshadow", "created": 1606335176, "upvotes": 6}, "gdkuj86": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k0tset/you_know_what_really_sucks_about_remote_learning/gdkuj86/", "text": "Aw don't remind me :(", "author": "zarnonymous", "created": 1606329580, "upvotes": 2}, "gdkmgw1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k0tset/you_know_what_really_sucks_about_remote_learning/gdkmgw1/", "text": "Wait, *you guys are getting free food?*", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1606325686, "upvotes": 15}, "gdkl7ow": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k0tset/you_know_what_really_sucks_about_remote_learning/gdkl7ow/", "text": "I agree.

There are families can\u2019t afford to drop 30 plus dollars a month on JUST healthy groceries when there\u2019s a mortgage to pay, gas, taxes, bills etc. that\u2019s why most poorer families can be found eating fact food or the bulky frozen food they can just dump in the oven.
