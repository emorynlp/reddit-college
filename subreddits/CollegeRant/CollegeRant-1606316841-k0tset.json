  "title:": "You know what really sucks about remote learning? No Free Food :(",
  "text": "I keep thinking about how we're missing out on so much free food at campus events and such.\n\nEspecially during the holidays, according to upperclassmen and professors there's usually a lot of free food on campus, especially pastries. My student mentor for Math says that she usually brings in donuts in for morning study sessions, and they'll be special decorated ones when it's near holidays  \n\nAnd during Halloween, people just like giving away candy for no reason.\n\nAlso pizza, apparently there are usually lots of events where they have pizza\n\nAnyway, that's just reason #5731589932 on why remote learning sucks (it's necessary of course, but still shitty!) \n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk :D",

I joined Catholic student union because they had free pizza and I didn\u2019t have breakfast or dinner that day.\n\nA zoom meeting for a student org I actually have semi regular attendance in had a \u201ccoffee and donuts\u201d day over zoom where you provided your own snacks lol.",

      "text": "My college would do a welcome week every year with free food and snacks and merch and it would always be so fun, pre-pandemic of course! It feels completely out of place to be taking finals this semester online instead and not have therapy dogs available (we usually have a finals week where we have access to a room full of puppies to play with). All these campus events really added to the element of self care and just genuinely enjoying the college experience instead of just working to get the next assignment turned in online.",

      "text": "Very true.  Am broke ass grad student, have been hearing stories from the more senior grad students about all of the opportunities there normally were to grab free food.   The smart ones were carrying storage containers in their backpacks because sometimes they'd have so much food at these events that they let the grad students take some home with them.\n\nIt also makes me sad because I really enjoy baking for people (I tend to stress bake) and I would have loved to be able to bring my teaching team and my lab fresh-baked goodies to our meetings.  (Especially since my teaching team has been wonderful while I had a family loss earlier this month, telling them that they have an IOU for their favorite cookies isn't quite the \"thank you\" that they deserve).  I'd also be the one keeping a bag of candy in my backpack for my students who didn't dip out of lab before we were actually done for the day.\n\nDefinitely another one on the mountain of reasons remote learning sucks horribly.",

Then go home to a house where they live with either a single parent or blue collar income. There are families can\u2019t afford to drop 30 plus dollars a month on JUST healthy groceries when there\u2019s a mortgage to pay, gas, taxes, bills etc. that\u2019s why most poorer families can be found eating fact food or the bulky frozen food they can just dump in the oven. Forget trying to eat healthy if you can barely afford to eat at all",

I\u2019ve read that some students don\u2019t want their camera on because they don\u2019t want people seeing their homes and the people there.  \n\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what these poor babies are going though.",

Everyone is struggling but everyone was already struggling before is just barely hanging on, if that.\n\nYou have so many kids who are hungry and abused and failing classes because of their crappy WiFi at home and their crazy parents.
