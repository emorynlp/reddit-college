I started my mid-term and started my history homework. \n\nWhat are some positive things about your day or your week? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTL;DR: Trying to stay positive through a bad experience with college assignments and looking to hear other positive outlooks",

My dad is now on a ventilator and my family is praying for a good outcome. \n\nThrough this whole ordeal, I refused to drop the term, wrote 3 essays, and was open with my professors who were very supportive. \n\nAlthough I still have underlying unresolved issues, I am choosing to accept whatever happens, work my hardest to make a better future for myself and the rest of my family, focusing on what is true and rational, and not letting my emotions consume me. \n\nI have decided to focus on living my own life more, and remembering that I deserve to be happy. \n\nI still have 6 more essays due by the beginning of December, but I have peace in my heart and motivation to get those done as soon as possible. \n\nHope this has brought you some comfort and strength. You are not alone.",
