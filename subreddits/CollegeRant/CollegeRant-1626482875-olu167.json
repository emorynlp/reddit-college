Once you start a quiz, (of which there are four, and these are the only graded assignments in the entire class) you have 105 minutes to finish. WIFI goes out, power goes out, server goes offline, anything, and the best possible grade you can get is a 75%.\n\nWell, I clicked on the wrong quiz. I meant to open quiz 2, and opened quiz 3. I had never even heard of the topic it was on, so I closed it immediately and emailed my professor with \\~48 hours to the deadline. He didn't even get back to me. I emailed him again with \\~24 hours left, and it took him 20 to respond. He gave me an unhelpful response pretty much saying, \"well, it's not my fault.\"\n\nI plead my case and 48 hours later, he hasn't gotten back. I was barely maintaining a B average (with an 80.95% in this class), and this dropped my grade to a 53. The term ends July 30.\n\nThis class no longer counts for my degree, I'm now ineligible for most of my scholarships, and I get out-of-state tuition next semester on top of that. My cost is now 5 or 6 times what it was last semester, and if I can't get back above a B average by the end of fall, (which I could barely hold) I might have to put my education on pause.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting this here. I'm not expecting anybody to be able to help. I don't think this is a matter for any kind of board, so I've pretty much used up my only option in emailing the professor. I guess I just need to vent somewhere.\n\nTL;DR: The title", "author": "QLZX", "created": 1626482875, "retrieved": 1632841761, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h5gqaf9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/olu167/professor_effectively_failed_me_for_clicking_the/h5gqaf9/", "text": "Thank you u/QLZX for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
