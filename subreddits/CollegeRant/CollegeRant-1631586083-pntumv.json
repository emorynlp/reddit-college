The calculus concepts themselves are so abstract and weird, I struggle to understand how the fuck anyone could learn it. Even if I do pass the class, it is going to be because of dumb luck and rote memorization. There is no fucking way I will ever be able to truly understand calculus.",

I would suggest you use some online resources or other resources to help supplement your knowledge gaps.",

Do your best to get through Calculus 1 and 2, after that most of my engineering classes have been very heavy amounts of algebra and trip but very rarely calc. Some of the physics courses use it but even those aren't engineering-specific. \n\nI've also never needed Calculus at work, I've done internships in HVAC design for two summers and six months at an aerospace company.\n\nTLDR: Get the basics and pass. After that, whatever you use it for is base level and easy.",

Passing calc was definitely a hurdle so I get it.\n\nBut If you can't get passed this then choose something else, some people don't have what it takes and that's why engineering is paid so much.

Will you have to find the second derivative of anything again? Probably not (or at least not without a computer), but the deflection in a beam uses the same concepts. My now-boss says that college isn\u2019t always about finding the right answer, it\u2019s about knowing when an answer looks wrong and how to fix it.\n\n\nJust keep at it and just keep practicing, it gets better!",

I just wanted to let you know, it's not that you're too dumb for the major, it's just that certain things don't click in your brain to be good for it. That's ok! I took, and failed calculus 3 times before giving up on it, and I was in advanced math and sciences from grade school. It did mean that I had to change a couple majors before I found something that enriched me and would be the guiding path to a career. \n\nI still regularly find myself interested in and consuming biochemistry information, but allowing myself to not get stressed about a class I needed for it was super freeing. I hope that you can either have your click moment or you find another major that makes you happy.",
