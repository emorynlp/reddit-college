  "title:": "Why are some professors so heartless about deadlines if you have extreme circumstances?",
  "text": " \n\nI'm taking a philosophy 100 course, and I generally really like my professor, but he is currently being a tight-ass about the syllabus. The other night, a really close friend of mine relapsed into heroin use and went missing for a few days. I drove back home to talk with their parents. Thankfully he popped back up and had me help check him into a detox rehab facility for the next 2 weeks. This whole ordeal was about 72 hours of being so stressed that I maybe slept for 12 hours in all, and barely ate.\n\nDuring this time, I had a paper due, that accounts for 15% of my total grade, and I obviously had more important things to deal with. The problem is that when I told my prof what happened, he said that it wasn't covered by the syllabus, and was thus unfair to the other students in my class. I had been so stressed and sleep deprived that I couldn't help but ask \"what makes you think that your class is this fucking important?\" to which he essentially replied with \"you have no right to treat your professor in such a way, as it was my own personal choice.\"\n\nI'm genuinely fucking infuriated, because it is so heartless to think that your syllabus and classwork. I'm trying to emotionally recover from what happened and I can't sleep at night thinking about what will happen after they get out of detox. I just needed a place vent, cause I'm genuinely infuriated at my professor.",

      "text": "First of all - I acknowledge that this in an incredibly difficult situation to deal with, and I hope that you receive the support that you need. Sending strength and good vibes your way and to your friend!\n\nSecondly - I acknowledge that ***you acknowledge*** that going to the professor was the correct first step.\n\nNext - (This may be a tad different depending on where you go to school, but I am in the US and can speak to that) Contact your Dean of Students office, which is different than the Dean of the department. If you are confused about who to contact, call your university's general information line and they will know who the dean of students is. \n\nYour situation absolutely is considered an \"extenuating circumstance\" by any definition. Your Dean of Students office will have the authority in this situation that your professor does not see that you possess. \n\nPlease do reach out to them. This situation is emotionally and physically exhausting for you and it can be tempting to just let it blow over in all of your frustration, but it is so important for you and for students that follow you to get this documented and addressed.\n\nAgain, sending strength to you - keep taking care of yourself <3",

          "text": "^This.  I am a faculty member who was a student not so long ago and also dealt with a close friend that struggled with severe drug and mental health issues in college.  Faculty are not your therapists and it is incredibly emotionally draining and time consuming for us to handle every \u201cextenuating circumstance\u201d case.  Those deadline policies are there for a reason. I had students complain to my chair because I they felt I was unfair to them because I wasn\u2019t holding other students to account for regularly missing deadlines and the students who were working their ass off were getting the same grades as the students who turned stuff in weeks late (this was fall 2020 so between covid and elections, I was having enough trouble keeping myself going let alone vetting all the excuses).  \n\nYour uni or college almost certainly has a dean, advisor, or councilor\u2019s office that can take your report and report to your professor with recommended accommodations.  If I or most of the faculty I know receive such reports, we act on it dutifully now that it is no longer our responsibility to adjudicate the merits or terms.  It\u2019s more fair to the other students since the office covers all students independent of any individual faculty or class and doesn\u2019t put all the pressure on us to determine what is right or fair. \n\nWe really do want to help, but for every case like yours, there are literally 3 cases of \u201cyeah, so I wasn\u2019t feeling it today so could I turn it in another day? Things are just really stressful\u201d (very nearly the exact wording I received in an email last week). We can only handle so much of that before we are fed up with excuses and I\u2019m willing to bet that\u2019s exactly where your prof got his syllabus. \n\nNow, if you dissed his class to his face with stuff like \u201cwhat makes you think your class is so fucking important?\u201d I think anyone would be a lot less likely to be accommodating\u2026. Thats not just offensive, it\u2019s immature, and even I would probably lose a lot of sympathy real fast. I\u2019m hoping whatever dialogue you had, it was a lot more cordial. (Of course, I won\u2019t lie, there are real assholes in academia, so maybe he did deserve it.)",

              "text": "I did actually say that to him. I'm not too sorry about it either, because I had told him in detail that I was driving around to the benches, parks, and the abandoned houses my friend used to squat at. I had to call his old dealers to see if they'd sold to him. I told my professor all of this, and before he even said sorry or gave me sympathies, he told me that it was unfair to other students to give me an extension for this. I couldn't hold it in, and if I did the same to someone else, I'd admit that I deserved it. I contacted my dean telling the whole story and I haven't gotten a response yet.",

                  "text": "It sounds like he wasn\u2019t being very considerate.  If nothing else he should have told you to speak to your advisor or dean or whomever. I at the very least would have told you that you don\u2019t need to tell me all this but you should work out an appropriate accommodation through the proper authority that I could act upon. From there at the very least I would say do the assignment as soon as possible and we will work out grading at another point. I\u2019m sorry you got a bad egg.  Is he older and tenured or primarily a researcher? This sounds like the kind of response someone who is just phoning in their classes and more concerned about research or retirement than their students would give.  If even after talking with your dean of students (its mid-semester, the clusterf*ck period of both student grading/panicking and admin deadlines so give them time) your prof is still unmoving you might just want to suck it up for the time being. Once the semester is over ask to speak to the department chair and VERY POLITELY AND PROFESSIONALLY relate your experience to him/her.  Don\u2019t launch ad hominin attacks at the faculty member, don\u2019t grub for grades, but politely relate your experience as an \u201cFYI, this was a negative experience I had with this faculty member this semester and I just want someone to hear me.\u201d  Unfortunately they might not be able to do anything for you, but you are much more likely to receive a positive response and the chair have a word with the faculty than if you storm in kicking up a shit storm. The latter is a surefire way to get the chair to side with the faculty and affect no change.  You could approach them sooner if you feel you need more immediate remediation (like your final grade is seriously on the line from this event), but again, the more polite and professional you are and the more you make this about you feel you should get an accommodation rather than ranting about that professor, the more likely you are to see positive results. The r/professors reddit is full of stories of students going to chairs or deans and raging about some professor\u2019s supposed slight and it nearly always results in the chair or dean siding with the faculty.  For better or worse, you need to demonstrate you are taking this like the professional adult your faculty believe you to be even if that means accepting an unjust consequence like a reduced grade.",
