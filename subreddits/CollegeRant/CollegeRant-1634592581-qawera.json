  "text": "Yes I am complaining, venting, ranting, its in the title of the subreddit. \n\n\nI am so extremely pissed off and frustrated with my freshman experience. I was so excited to branch away from my high school friends and I picked an out of state school to attend. Since I was undecided as a major I didn\u2019t get any nice housing basically and I was an idiot and didn\u2019t pick a major. \n\nMy room is suite style, 2 doubles that share a bathroom. My roommate is the most antisocial kid I\u2019ve ever met and plays like zelda and does homework on his PC in the dorm all day. \nThe floor is empty, the lounge that has 2 couches and a table is almost always empty, the window is broken. \n\nWorst of all, I have no friends. There were no orientation activities or anything to get the floor to meet eachother and since I\u2019m inherently not outgoing/extroverted, nobody talked to me and I have no friends. \n\nIts been 2 months and I spend every weekend alone and just wonder how tf everyone else made friends and me and my roommate just silently sit in our room together. \n\nAnd literally every single one of my friends who are in uni have at least people or a person to hangout with. Idk what the hell I did incorrect besides just being introverted, now because of this 0 social life I feel like I need to restart and try a different school next year but it just makes everything so difficult. \n\nSince I might make 0 friends this year, is it even worth it to continue the next 3 years? Or should I just transfer. People say the first few weeks are awkward but I feel like everyone is already passed that   \n\nWhatever i hate myself and fuck college.",

      "text": "I am in mostly the same boat with my roommate situation. Except he's like 4 years older than me and also plays only Nintendo but he doesn't even have a desktop (I use mine for heavy CGI and stuff hope that's redeeming.) Like literal manchild and hella awkward. I really cannot stand him even though he hasn't done much to directly piss me off, his presence is enough. As for you though, I propose a solution but being that your college is different it may not work. I complained about my situation a day ago to an RA and she told me that its enough of a reason to potentially get moved into another suite by myself or with someone else of my choosing. Not sure how its going to work this far in but they seem to at least care (the RA's) about my enjoyment. So maybe reach out to them? \n\nYou definitely need to get away from the super antisocials, especially in this state you could get seriously depressed with that kid also being so low, it would also probably prevent potential friends from being driven away if you have your own dorm.",
