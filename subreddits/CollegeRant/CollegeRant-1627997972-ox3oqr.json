What are you planning on grading us for specifically?? Also if we need to do research before class to add to the class syllabus, you could at LEAST give us the class syllabus in advance and not like barely a week before for us to organize in a group remotely. like!!! Some people can\u2019t even have text message, how are we gonna do a whole presentation in a week or less?? We have other classes as well, ur just making shit worse. I hate this fucking school so much and i don\u2019t even care about the subjects. I don\u2019t care about anything anyways because nothing fucking matters we are all gonna die anywyaas and this fucjinf classes are all either \u201clet\u2019s be critical\u201d without even giving us the knowledge of the basics, or just blindly reading shit with no question and no debate over how did researchers ever got to that conclusion and how newer research may have gotten to different conclusions. Im literally learning jack shit bc all i have to do is vague and superficial work\n\nTldr: college is unorganized.

It sounds like the faculty in your school are not informed in standard practices and universal design for learning. However, don\u2019t write yourself off and say how you are not cut out for school. It sounds more like this school out of touch and not a good fit. Perhaps if you can forgo the social aspect of in-person learning, it would be worthwhile to look into established online programs.

That\u2019s it. A rubric. I understand the pathos-based assignment descriptions, but I want concrete examples of what is being graded. One teacher said I didn\u2019t use enough color on an assignment in which color, design, etc were ever mentioned. She basically acted like I needed architecture software to build a classroom design if I even wanted to get a B- on the assignment. This is an teacher education program. How the hell are you teaching children effectively if you can\u2019t figure out a rubric or grade With some sense of consistency?!
