  "text": "Hi! It\u2019s my first year and first exam in college. I am so drained from studying. During one of my exam I can\u2019t remember a thing (mental block I guess?) and my score was low. Is that okay? Will that affect my final average? I don\u2019t know what to do. I studied. When it was there I can\u2019t remember shit. My college has a cut off grade. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "It depends on the weight of the exam and what your score was before it. It probably will be okay if the prof doesn\u2019t have it as like 60% of your grade or something. Do better next time is all you can do. I bombed my first exam too, but I pulled it back around by the end and got an A in the class.",

      "text": "It sounds like you need to find a way to destress. That might help with remembering things. Also, it\u2019s impossible to say w/o more information what impact this will have, but failing an exam is a very common experience so don\u2019t worry too much about it. At worst you will fail the class, which sucks but it happens. You\u2019ll be okay.",
