I\u2019m not just talking about moving to online, either. Ever since my very first semester at college, my professors have been pilling on the reading homework and quizzes and assignments back to back to back. I\u2019m now a sophomore starting the Fall semester, and I still spend 2-5 hours on homework PER CLASS for a week. Half the time it\u2019s just writing notes from the reading, and other times it\u2019s just the stupidest things like a worksheet that I can\u2019t find the answers to.\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on Connect. Why do the readings have these concept questions with them? They\u2019re like 90-130 questions each, then I have to do HW questions, and then a quiz on top of that (plus discussion questions as well on the class website). And that\u2019s just for my film class, so I have to also watch an hour or more of a movie. It\u2019s just waaaaaaay too much.", "author": "beanfox101", "created": 1599139561, "retrieved": 1632843347, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"g42grmo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iltcgq/i_do_so_much_homework_in_a_single_day_for_only/g42grmo/", "text": "For me, it seems that professors at my school are actually using lockdown and this Zoom format to give us way more work.

Subtract time to cooking, cleaning, eating, work, exercise, the the time for classes. If you come up with a positive number you are good. Many adults are running in the negative.\n\nI work two jobs, 40 hours + 20 hours, take 5 classes, babysit for my 5 nieces and nephews (which involves helping them with classes, and 3 special needs kids), handle all the cooking and cleaning, and still work with my husband (contracting work). You can do it too.\n\nNo bs. It sucks. I get it. Your tired, your brain is fried, honestly some days I just want it to be over. I even cry myself to sleep some nights. But I push through. I know it won't be like this forever. And after years (including currently) working in a factory, school is better. Find positive outlets for stress, work on time management skills (wearing headphones shows hubby and the kids that I am busy), and understand that you need breaks in studying. Don't be afraid to take a 10 minute break. Emphasizing exercise has helped me immensely. It is something I crave and it helps myself as well as the kids.", "author": "erivanla", "created": 1599190459, "upvotes": 1}, "g3xvnxa": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iltcgq/i_do_so_much_homework_in_a_single_day_for_only/g3xvnxa/", "text": "I've been asking this question for the past three years lol. Let's just say I've had my fair share of mental breakdowns because of all the stress that comes with college. I recommend taking fewer classes if you can.
