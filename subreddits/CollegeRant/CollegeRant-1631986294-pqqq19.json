      "text": "You can get a lot of jobs with a psych degree. I almost have my BA, I\u2019ve had no internships, and I start my next job as a Behavior Technician in like a week. \n\nI\u2019ve never had any issues applying for jobs. I have had many people, including friends, tell me that I\u2019ll never get a decent job or I\u2019ll never get one in my field. I always say the same thing: \u201cYou can\u2019t just apply for a well paid high position doing exactly what you want right off the bat. You take what you can get and you get experience. You learn and you move up. There are steps you need to take.\u201d \n\nMy friends, and many others I\u2019ve talked to, assume that people with Psych degrees can only be Therapists and you need a Doctorates degree to get a job period. So meanwhile, you\u2019re not practicing in your field. This is false. \n\nAn internship would\u2019ve definitely helped me, but I had a lot of other qualifications that made me perfect for this job. I was surprised I was offered this position too because I was worried with my lack of professional experience. \n\nAlso for anyone with a set plan, don\u2019t listen to anyone who tries to bring you down. You can do it and you will find a good job in your field. Good luck!",
