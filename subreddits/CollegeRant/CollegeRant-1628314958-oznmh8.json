Everybody has always told me I'm smart and if I put more effort into school, I'd do great. However, this has proved to me that that isn't true. I've studied far too hard for this D than any smart person would have had to. My dad is a chemistry professor and frankly, I feel so bad for him that he has to see his son be such a disappointment.\n\nUpdate: For some reason, I got a C as my final grade. I don't know if it was a miscalculation on my part or a final act of mercy on my professor's but I am simultaneously so happy I passed and so disappointed in myself for getting so close to failing. And in hindsight, I didn't study as hard as I should have. Hell, I didn't even watch the lectures after I got an A on my first exam. I just did practice problems, but procrastinated a ton on them too. However, you all did help and I sincerely thank you for forcing me to actually reflect rather than just saying \"that sucks bro, go gettem next time\".

On one hand the professor was atrocious and ended up being fired, on the other hand I had no idea how to truly study and didnt devote nearly as much time to it as I should have. I was academically dismissed, and then went to community college where I passed chem (and every other class) with an A. Failing out of the school of my dreams was awful, and doing nothing but working a minimum wage job for a while was awful. So when I got another shot I gave it my all and it paid off. \n\n>Everybody has always told me I'm smart and if I put more effort into school, I'd do great. However, this has proved to me that that isn't true.\n\nNot passing one subject doesnt mean you arent smart. It means that subject is difficult for you and that you need to change the way you approach it. Did you take it with the same professor both times? If so is there another professor you could take it with? How many hours per week do you devote to studying? How do you study?", "author": "taybay462", "created": 1628387644, "upvotes": 1}, "h843ndf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oznmh8/just_failed_introduction_to_chemistry_ii_a_second/h843ndf/", "text": "Nobody is a naturally smart everything, even geniuses fail sometimes too. Trust me, as someone who has been told growing up that I'm so smart (*barf*), failure seems like the end of the world to me too. It's important that you don't see every failure as 100% a set back, if you think about it, now you know the material better since you've taken the class twice. You know your strengths and weaknesses now and can act appropriately the next time around.\n\nAsk yourself a few questions: \n\nWhat are your study habits for the class? Do you think they're working out for you? What do you think you need to change? Sometimes the way I study for one class is different than another because the class required a different type of study regimen. If you think what you're doing now isn't good for you, then change it up a bit! Ask around to see how other students who passed the class did it. Think about what the exams focus on and how you can tweak your study habits to better get what you need out of it. When I took general chemistry at my uni, I studied by reading the chapters myself and taking my own notes, and doing the practice questions that our professor gave us. Personally I find that chemistry is easier understood when I read it for myself, rather than just listening during lecture.\n\nWhat are your weaknesses in the class? Are there some topics you find easy while others you find difficult? Are there topics you just don't get at all? Try to find out whats constantly tripping you up and use extra resources to explain it better to you. YouTube videos, websites, etc. Go to office hours and let your professor/TA know just what you're not getting. If they're good at their job, then they'll find a way to explain it to you differently, or break it down more to get to the root of what you're not getting. Your uni probably also has tutoring programs for this class. Perhaps even ask your father for help if that's something you're comfortable with. \n\nDo you *enjoy* chemistry? Are you motivated to learn the subject? I think this is important because while you don't necessarily need to love a subject to take it and pass the class, I find that just finding the topic interesting is good motivation. For example, I *hate* physics with a burning passion. If it wasn't for the curve, I probably would have bombed that class hard because the moment I try to put pen to paper and do practice problems my brain just shuts off. Is it the same for you with chemistry? Or do you like the subject but you are just not getting it?\n\nMost importantly, how is your mental wellbeing? Do you find that your mental health is getting in the way of doing well? We are in turbulent times and many students are in the same boat, so you're not alone in that aspect. Has online classes (assuming that you are in online classes) been working out for you? Put your mental wellbeing first and success will come after.\n\nGood luck! No matter how long the road is to getting there, if you keep on working at it, you have a degree just like anyone else. And it won't say \"failed chemistry twice\" it will just be the same as anyone else's.
