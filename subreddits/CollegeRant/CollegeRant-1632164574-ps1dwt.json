  "title:": "$130+ for a high school textbook",
  "text": "Basically the title, but GOD I'm irked by one particular class- U.S. History II. Normally would be one of my favs for the semester, since I'm a history major and have never taken a history class that I didn't love, but I guess it's true that all it takes is a bad teacher to ruin a great subject..\n\nDay 1, we were told no textbook, because the university store wasn't able to get them in stock. Okay, cool, we're mostly using lectures and documentaries with some online reading supplements. Affordable and efficient!\n\nWeek 3, the store has suddenly got some copies of the book! Not enough for even half of the class, but oh well- teacher now reverses his previous statement and requires us to ALL have the book within the next 2 weeks. We were all a little bitter about it, especially because it's apparent by this point that our \"professor\" has no idea how to teach and no real interest in teaching, this being his first time teaching. Also his main job is in the legal field, so his version of a \"short essay\" (aka, assigned with the due date being 2 days later) is 7 pages, with the length of our \"long essays\" yet to be announced..\n\nAnyway! I went and bought the textbook immediately after class because of the short supply. Tried to rent it first, but lo and behold, it's purchase only. A little over $130. Sucks, but hey, not the MOST expensive textbook I've ever had to buy. \n\nThe worst part was sitting at the library to study the first 4 chapters (which had sort of been covered in class through the previous means, but were now expected to be read and discussed) and realizing immediately that it's a high school level history textbook. Like.. there are \"vocabulary\" words every few pages, that aren't the key terms/figures, but are just definitions of random words in the paragraphs that MIGHT be unknown by high school students, but are definitely daily vocab usage in college, especially when the pre-reqs include U.S. History I and World History I (both were fantastic btw!). \n\nIdk, it just feels like the teacher didn't do any research, just picked the first textbook google threw at him, and now is suddenly and lazily changing the syllabus without any regard to how confusing and disappointing his class is.\n\n(Side note?/end note?) - all of his previous \"lectures\" were just read straight from the teachers' edition of the book, so he hasn't even put in the minimal effort to engage with the class or provide any original content)\n\nTL;DR my history professor said no book, changed his mind 3 weeks in, and made us all purchase an overpriced high school textbook that simplifies the topics and doesn't provide any new info that we haven't already learned.",
