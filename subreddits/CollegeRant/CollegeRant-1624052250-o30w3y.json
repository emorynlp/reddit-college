  "text": "It\u2019s my last semester in the fall and I just want to hurry up and graduate already. I\u2019m seeing all these opportunities for places I want to work for, but I can\u2019t because they\u2019re only open when I have class. The only ones I have left are electives and I only care about half of them, but it just feels like a waste of time and money when I could just be working at this point. This just seems like the best time to be applying and I know there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll still be fine in December/January but I\u2019d rather do it now when it\u2019s more guaranteed",
