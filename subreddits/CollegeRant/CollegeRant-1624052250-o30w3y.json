I\u2019m seeing all these opportunities for places I want to work for, but I can\u2019t because they\u2019re only open when I have class. The only ones I have left are electives and I only care about half of them, but it just feels like a waste of time and money when I could just be working at this point. This just seems like the best time to be applying and I know there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll still be fine in December/January but I\u2019d rather do it now when it\u2019s more guaranteed", "author": "snomflake", "created": 1624052250, "retrieved": 1632842201, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h299r5j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o30w3y/i_dont_really_care_about_my_gpa_anymore/h299r5j/", "text": "Thank you u/snomflake for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
