My dad\u2019s always been emotionally detached from us, he hardly listens when we speak, he\u2019s quick to anger (especially with my mom, making her stressed through normal conversation) and when it\u2019s all said and done he wonders why no one talks to him, neither our neighbors or extended family. He\u2019s also the absolute authority. It\u2019s absolutely infuriating and yes, there are days when I want to leave/fight him/have a meltdown. But not only do I still love him, I also need his support to finish my last year of college. It\u2019s been that way since the beginning, and I figure if he truly doesn\u2019t care what I think or how I feel enough to ask, then fine. Both my parents have expressed the want to divorce strongly, each to me, several times. Even my younger brother has attempted to go out on his own, but failed. I just try to preserve what I can and let my family sort things out while I finish college. It\u2019s a blessing that somehow, we\u2019re all sticking together until we each find that opening of freedom.\n\nOh, and you\u2019re not alone.
