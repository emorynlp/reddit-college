(https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgocv2/am_i_allowed_to_drop_a_class_if_i_hate_my/) \n Great news, he's also a 9/11 denier! This guy is physically killing me. He talks in code and nothing he says makes sense. Today he randomly started talking about 9/11 (pretty much nothing to do with the class) and how the building collapsed from the inside and there wasn't any planes and this big long rant about how we're all sheep and we only believe what we're told. I'm going to lose my GD mind. He also said that once someone told him not to talk about that in class and he said he could talk about whatever he wants. Then when a girl in my class asked if he thought it wasn't a terrorist attack, he said, and I quote, 'I don't believe anything. I'm just thinking.' \n\nI haven't gotten around to reporting him for the hate speech but I'm seriously considering it now. I don't think I can deal with this much longer", "author": "idioticathiest", "created": 1631205679, "retrieved": 1632841114, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc76xru": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pl1gdx/update_on_my_professor/hc76xru/", "text": "Thank you u/idioticathiest for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
