I\u2019m trying my best and am constantly studying to stay on top of the material but what my professors like to do is lecture for 25 minutes and then send us to breakout rooms with different people to figure the problems out on our own. We also get graded on those problems and also on our participation in the groups (we are forced to rank each other). This is so stupid because firstly, I haven\u2019t taken the prerequisites so it\u2019s obviously going to take me longer to figure things out and secondly, why the heck are we responsible to teach each other such complicated topics when we\u2019re paying 60K to you to teach us the same. It works when it\u2019s done occasionally but I cannot do this every single class period. I\u2019ve been in groups with such misogynistic jerks that I preferred to fail the class in peace than to ask them for help. I am so annoyed and tired of this and will consider transferring to some other university if the professors at mine continue to be lazy like this.", "author": "anxiousstudent7", "created": 1604892014, "retrieved": 1632950947, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gbpfpp2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jqpwg3/can_professors_stop_sending_us_to_breakout_rooms/gbpfpp2/", "text": "My professors stopped doing them because they\u2019re so ineffective.", "author": "nonconformistnugget", "created": 1604916473, "upvotes": 3}, "gbpf1sg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jqpwg3/can_professors_stop_sending_us_to_breakout_rooms/gbpf1sg/", "text": "I also hate them with a passion and to be fair, the rooms are either deathly silent or it's one or two people talking in a room of 5-10.
