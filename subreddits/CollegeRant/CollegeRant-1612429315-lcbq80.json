This is honestly making me feel so worthless and I\u2019m only suffering the longer this goes on. I pay tuition for you to teach me, if I wanted to watch pre-recorded lectures I\u2019d dig on other websites/youtube for free; Also when I go to your office hours you make me feel dumb as hell. If I wanted someone yell at me when I ask for help I\u2019d ask my parents. Online school isn\u2019t even learning anymore it\u2019s submitting. I\u2019m more stressed about turning in assignments than I am about learning.", "author": "HardcoretotheGrave", "created": 1612429315, "retrieved": 1632843477, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"glywnnt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lcbq80/waste_of_my_time/glywnnt/", "text": "Thank you u/HardcoretotheGrave for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
