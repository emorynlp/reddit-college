This is honestly making me feel so worthless and I\u2019m only suffering the longer this goes on. I pay tuition for you to teach me, if I wanted to watch pre-recorded lectures I\u2019d dig on other websites/youtube for free; Also when I go to your office hours you make me feel dumb as hell. If I wanted someone yell at me when I ask for help I\u2019d ask my parents. Online school isn\u2019t even learning anymore it\u2019s submitting. I\u2019m more stressed about turning in assignments than I am about learning.", "author": "HardcoretotheGrave", "created": 1612429315, "retrieved": 1632951453, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"glzxnuu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lcbq80/waste_of_my_time/glzxnuu/", "text": "Broo exactly, spending the entire day sitting on the chair facing the computer and it is not even learning anymore.
