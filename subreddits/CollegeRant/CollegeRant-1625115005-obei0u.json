The past few semesters have felt like a waste because almost all of my friends chose to do remote or stay off campus as much as possible. Now they\u2019ve graduated so I won\u2019t see them next semester.\n\nI really miss the two friends I took classes with in the summer. We spent most of our time in the computer lab watching Twitch streams and programming. I didn\u2019t get to hang out with them last summer because of covid, and it looks like this summer they\u2019re gone. Neither of them had social media so I don\u2019t really have a way to contact them either.\n\nI just feel a bit lonely right now. The labs are pretty much empty all the time and I didn\u2019t really get a chance to meet new people in the chemistry lab I took this month.", "author": "tlacct", "created": 1625115005, "retrieved": 1632951517, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3qnh6m": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/obei0u/i_miss_my_friends/h3qnh6m/", "text": "I heavily relate to this.
