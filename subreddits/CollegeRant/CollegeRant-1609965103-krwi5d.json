{"sid": "krwi5d", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/krwi5d/rude_about_free_college/", "title:": "Rude About Free College", "text": "I  am very fortunate in that I will graduate college almost completely  debt free. My dad works at a private university that offers free tuition  to it's employees' children (and by making the dean's list scholarship  consistently, the tuition remission fee is paid for). I commute, and my  parents are gracious enough to not charge rent or make me pay for my own  food. The only things that aren't free are books, lab fees and other  supplies, but I already get a discount on those being an employee's  daughter. My dad is keeping tabs on these, and asking for me to pay him  back when I graduate, but I don't expect that to exceed $3500. I am very  grateful about this, and make a point not to mention it to my peers,  because I don't want to be obnoxious.\n\nThe  problem is, some people became suspicious whenever I almost never  talked about my finances or bitched about dealing with banks or applying  to obscure scholarships and excused myself from those conversations.  After some prodding, one of my friends told some people I don't care for  that I was getting a free ride through college. From then on, these  people have been completely nasty to me, talking about how I'm not  earning my college or grades (I'm a good student, as shown above), I'm  rich and buying my way (my dad is a maintenance worker, we are a  working-class family), and how I don't deserve to graduate if I'm not  going to be swamped in debt like they are. If I ever complained about  something at college, I am always shut down, because I don't have debt,  so my struggles aren't real. One guy tried to embarrass me in front of  my professor about this by going on about how privileged I am (luckily,  the professor is my friend's dad, and wasn't hearing any of it). This  resentment of people who have something you don't is completely toxic -  I'm sorry if you have debts, but that doesn't mean you should bother  people who took advantage of their opportunities, ESPECIALLY IF THEY  DON'T BRAG ABOUT IT. Please, if you know someone like this, just never  bring it up! Thank you for reading my rant, sorry it's so long.", "author": "Paesana", "created": 1609965103, "retrieved": 1632951722, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"gis73hw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/krwi5d/rude_about_free_college/gis73hw/", "text": "my sister has the same problem as you or just being self-conscious. my state will pay for some training for jobs in high demand, so my sister took a CNA class but had the state pay for it, so she gets to take the class for free.

I am in the same exact position as you, my parents are both working class and my mom got a job at the school I attend the year I was born. I\u2019m blessed to receive help from my parents, and they want it to be that way because they grew up with little to nothing. I have not received as much backlash from my peers regarding the situation, however I can guarantee that your personal finances is 100% your business and nobody else\u2019s. Anyone making you feel bad wants to make themselves feel better about their lack of help.

Anyone could get a job at a school before/after they had kids in the 2000\u2019s and take advantage of this. Don\u2019t be ashamed your parents made good decisions, but remain humble about it.
