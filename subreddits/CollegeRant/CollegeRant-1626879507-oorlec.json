  "text": "The summer semester ended July 9th and all my other professors had my final grades posted by the following Monday except one. Over a week later and still nothing, no email updates or anything. And I don't think they're overwhelmed grading last-minute assignments that flooded in because every assignment in that course was an online multiple-choice quiz that graded automatically. I sent them a polite email about it last Friday but they haven't replied. Not sure what to do.",
