  "text": "If you're going to test us on the parts of the body, how are you showing us muscles...in model or illustration, that aren't even attached to the body? How am I supposed to look at a half a leg, the center of a leg, the center of an arm, and know that it's a leg or not an arm? I know I failed that damn test today and I am pretty certain I'll\n have to repeat this damn class. The pictures were unclear and it was hard to tell what part they were asking, and it was 50 questions in 30 minutes and they wanted all those long a** names spelled correctly (these long Latin names!!)  or you got it wrong\n even if you technically got it right...add to that my dumb a** computer decided to act up during the test! I am just going to reside to the fact that I'll have to repeat this class next semester. I'm not even going to stay angry/mad. Thankfully my class spoke up when she asked about how the test was. I just think it's unfair totally but if I want my dream career I can't give up. I am just a bit discouraged today. I will retake the class in person next semester. Maybe this will make the difference\n\n(Edited) according to the questions my classmates are asking, we all failed. It doesn't make me feel better but I hope I do better next time.",

              "text": "That's what we did in my A&P classes for the practicals. My class was geared towards those who were interested in medicine though and it was just how she ran her classes. The coloring book and tons of flash cards got me through it. I also spent a lot of time going through the models in the anatomy lab before rona sent us online too. It's definitely hard, but doable in my experience.",

It wasn't easy but I did what you said with the flash cards and I printed out pictures online AND downloaded anatomy apps on my phone which was a breath of fresh air after staring at papers of muscles and bones all day. OP has to do whatever it takes to pass and look through as many of resources as possible. YouTube videos also help",
