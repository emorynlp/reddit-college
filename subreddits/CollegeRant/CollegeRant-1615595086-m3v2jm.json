Don\u2019t worry about putting it into their minds that they should be ashamed, because sadly they probably already are. Everything from my high school counselors to my family to even dumb TV shows like Community (as much as I love that show!) made me feel ashamed of being there. Transferring to a 4 year where I was surrounded by similarly motivated former CC students, getting support from my advisors there, and hearing stories like this one is what helped me overcome it. I\u2019ll never forget the day when I bumped into the chancellor of the college in my first week and she told me that she started at CC too. That meant a lot to me, and I\u2019m sure this story would mean a lot to your students.", "author": "quintessentialquince", "created": 1615649084, "upvotes": 2}, "gqsshn3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m3v2jm/should_i_show_this_to_my_students_or_not/gqsshn3/", "text": "Share it.

My 8th grade year, I found out about early college. I was enamored by the thought, \"High school where you can get a degree?\" And, I went ahead and applied. I ended up getting accepted and really didn't know what to expect. The thought of getting a degree was all I thought about; however, the community college offered so much more. I found welding programs, autobody programs, nursing, etc. Honestly, looking back at it now I definitely should have headed in the technical path if it wasn't for the overbearance of being a First Gen. Eventually, I had to switch schools and ended up in a regular high school. But cc didn't stop there. I found out about dual enrollment and continue going to my local cc. It seems to be a universal thing that every community college I went to has some of the best faculty I've ever had the pleasure being around. Never have I met people so passionate and knowledge about what they're teaching. Looking back again from my second semester of uni, I really should have stayed and transferred in to where I am now to save a bunch of money (but a scholarship is a scholarship). Anyway, Community colleges are probably some of the best educational institutions to exist way beyond college/uni. I strongly believe in making kids aware of the possibilities that are there as your interest are fully recognized because of how universal it is.\n\nEdit: sorry for the wall of text\ud83d\ude43", "author": "KungP0wchicken", "created": 1615600439, "upvotes": 60}, "gqr6q9p": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m3v2jm/should_i_show_this_to_my_students_or_not/gqr6q9p/", "text": "This is an amazing story, you should definitely share it with the students", "author": "Sweaty-Opposite6162", "created": 1615598549, "upvotes": 23}, "gqr4tpr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m3v2jm/should_i_show_this_to_my_students_or_not/gqr4tpr/", "text": "I\u2019m inspired so you should definitely share this with your students.
