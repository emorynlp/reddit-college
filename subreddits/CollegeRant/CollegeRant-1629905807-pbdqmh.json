My name is always being picked randomly by my instructors to answer in 2 consecutive subjects. I sometimes feel that my name has a curse or what :(. Imagine out of 40 people to be chosen, why am I always the one being picked? Now I feel like not attending their classes but I love my parents and I want to make sure that the $$$ they paid for my education is going to a direction :( It really sucks and seems like I am a stupid person for not knowing the answer. This is just a rant of me having a bad day :( Thank you for reading :( and I hope you all have a good day :)", "author": "Psychological_Sign42", "created": 1629905807, "retrieved": 1632841562, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"haaydnx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbdqmh/it_sucks_being_called_in_recitation_and_you_dont/haaydnx/", "text": "Thank you u/Psychological_Sign42 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
