I\u2019ve never felt so much disconnection in college, gotten my associates 3 years ago and was highly motivated and loved my major but now absolutely not. Also my life have changed in the last 3 months, I\u2019ve lost my mother and that just threw my off the wagon with life such as my health, school and managing how I\u2019m get through it when my biggest supporter isn\u2019t here anymore. She used to motivate me so much and was so understanding of life. I didn\u2019t even finish out the fall semester cause my mother got ill shortly after midterms and spent months in the hospital and never came home. These professors have been somewhat understanding but not 100% of my situation and now I\u2019m at the point idc anymore if I even pass or fail cause my life will never be the same anymore.", "author": "twalton18", "created": 1618036369, "upvotes": 1}, "gtrcegj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mm45iz/i_feel_like_i_havent_learned_anything/gtrcegj/", "text": "I bet you didn't lmao I mean come on journalism?/s\n\nIn all seriousness you're being to hard on yourself.
