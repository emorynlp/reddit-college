  "title:": "I'm lonely, depressed, and somewhat regretting my college decision",
  "text": "It's currently 6:30 AM rn and I am so tired of this.\n\nI'm a current freshman. The school I'm going to is a T30 and great for my major. The person over our 'honors program' (of some sorts) is super nice and lets me ask her questions about the degree I want. It's a nice campus and is great on paper...but maybe that's the issue.\n\nWhen I applied to college, I mainly applied to state schools and some small liberal arts colleges (plus ivies/ivy equivalents). I wanted to get out of my city, meet new people from other places and around the world, have intellectual conversations, and have awesome opportunities. The high school I went to was like this, and I hung out with a lot of other nerdy kids. I got rejected from all the ivies I applied to (waitlisted from Harvard), but got into one of the Honors programs at the college I'm attending. I was super excited at first. Now I haven't been this depressed since middle school.\n\nThe Honors program I'm in lets me ditch the prereqs for my courses. Because I didn't get any money from scholarships (one full ride one I could've gotten I was never nominated for), I'm double majoring in the hopes of getting this one DoD scholarship. I'm taking a heavy course load of STEM classes and it's hell. No one has study groups for these things. The classes are insanely hard and the reading is dense. On top of that, I didn't get into the 'ultra' science scholar program. I get I shouldn't be feeling sad about it, but I've done a program at a T20 university with a lab internship, as well as getting really good grades in my science courses in high school. I literally don't know what more I could have done.\n\nThis has caused me to have little to no social life. I'm a fairly introverted and quiet person. I tend to feel and think deeply about things. I can do parties, but I'm more of a hangout person. It seems that, besides hanging out with friends, it's just partying. I can't go anywhere else because I don't have a car and the bus system won't go that far. Plus, friends' schedules and mine barely align. Our college is also in the middle of nowhere. Nearest major city is two hours away. I totally can feel the bubble on campus, and I hate it.\n\nLastly, there isn't a lot of diversity here. I'm mixed and from the South. In school, it was common to see people self-segregate a lot, mainly by both class and race. I knew going into a state school I wasn't likely to get the international student population that I was hoping for, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. Almost everyone here is white, and those who aren't tend to stick to their own groups. I'm the black friend in my friend group (though honestly it's more like my roommate's friend group). I've joined a mixed race club and BSA, but I don't want to just connect with people there. I'm so used to having friends of different cultures, and it's off-putting to not have that now.\n\nI see all of my friends having the time of their lives in college so far. Most of them got into their dream schools. I know there's probably more that they're not showing, but I feel so alone right now. I like this school, but I don't know what else I can do. Everyone's been telling me that it gets better, but I'm coming up on month two feeling like this. It's affecting my work too. I'm too chicken to go to therapy on campus because I know it's a me problem, but I'm tired of crying in my room and having a terrible sleep schedule for trying to make up work. Any suggestions would be great.\n\nTL;DR I got into a really good school but it's not what I thought it would be socially and I'm depressed.",

If not, maybe do a minor instead.\n\nWith the extra time you could join a student org -- maybe there's a professional fraternity or something you'd be interested in?",

Double majoring is some hardcore stuff, and the people I know with double majors dont use both of them in their current job, but I understand the appeal to having 2 majors.  If you want the second major (as not as a minor), then you can get your primary major, get a job with it, and then go back to school for the secondary",
