  "text": "Just wow. College is really gross. Like really. The communal bathrooms are so disgusting; there\u2019s always hair or something equally as gross stuck to the sides of the sink or toilet. Not to mention that I\u2019m paying $1200 a month for this dorm and it\u2019s cheap as heck. When I \u201capplied\u201d for housing, I picked a better looking residence hall, but I ended up in this cheapskate room instead. Also, I found someone\u2019s USED bandaid in a dryer AFTER I dried my clothes in it. Bleh.",
