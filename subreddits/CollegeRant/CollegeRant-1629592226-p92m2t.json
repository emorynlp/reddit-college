  "text": "\nRant.\n\n\nWhy after spending easily over 1k per class, and paying the stupid fees such as athletics or health (that most will never use or care about) must you also pay $1-4 an hour/ day to park? \n\nLike i can deal with all of the other areas to be fucked over. But why must they even insult students with such small insignificant needed fees on top. I would rather I pay a $100 semester parking fee instead up front instead of that BS. \n\n\nOffensive ^probably :\n\nHonestly surprised colleges aren\u2019t the ones getting shot up (US obviously) with there being more reasons to hate the establishment over highschools. Not to even start with the personal politics involved. \n\n\n\n\nBack to regularly scheduled rant: \n\nWhy hasn\u2019t anyone created a college actually for students. Where grading is based on material instead of tests and fees and payments are actually for things the student needs and uses..or are at least communal. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s different in other places, but from what I have heard and seen it\u2019s not too common if it is.",

      "text": "It sucks, but since most colleges don't have enough spaces for all of their faculty, staff, students, and visitory, they will charge for parking in part to encourage people to find other ways to get to campus. That sort of makes sense, but what really gets me are the ridiculously expensive fines/punishments (withholding your degree??), and how parking offices/rules seem to be so impossibly complicated and exploitative. Make parking cheaper, yes, but also make it easier, more convenient, and less like a quick money grab.",
