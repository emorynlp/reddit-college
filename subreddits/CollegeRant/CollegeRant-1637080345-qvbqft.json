  "text": "Like we all know the jump from in-person to remote was horrendous, especially if you were unlucky enough to be in college during the brunt of it in Spring 2020\n\nBut idk, somehow going back to in-person seems worse.\n\nI was a freshman in Fall 2020 and I finished my first two semesters with a 3.9\n\nI'm now a sophomore in Fall 2021 after already having to drop one class, I'm fighting to just barely pass my remaining three classes\n\nThere are other factors of course, but somehow online classes seemed a bit nicer if that's a good word? Better taught, more materials provided to review, better modules for going for coursework and reviewing, etc.",

Having the recorded lectures you can replay it many times till you understand it. \n\nAlso, students maybe have their homes far away from college. It is such a waste of time and energy to wake up early take the train or bus to college. Once you arrive there you'll probably feel tired to listen to your professor.",

And I eventually switched to asynchronous classes where I could work at my own pace and save more money.\n\nAt the start of this year I was super excited to be back in person for my final year. Only to find that I wasn't quite ready for it... actually having to get up and walk to class instead of rolling over in bed to grab my laptop was brutal. And then came the exams. I got so used to using my notes when I couldn't figure an answer out. I basically forgot how to study when it came time for exams.\n\nAnd then there is the lack of motivation, coupled with depression, I just didn't want to do anything. No school work, skip classes, sleep. There's been plenty of times this semester where I just want to say fuck it and leave school. But I am so close to graduating and to just throw it all away with only a few months remaining? No thanks, I'd rather keep my head down, be miserable, and push through these last few months. No matter how difficult it can be.",
