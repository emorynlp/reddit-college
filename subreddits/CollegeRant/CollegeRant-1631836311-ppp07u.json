  "text": "6/20 on my calc 2 quiz. I can only think of one mistake I could have made on that quiz and I don't get the physical quiz back until tommorow. I'm stressed about it to see if it's my teachers grading or if it's really me. Because if I'm correct and I only made one mistake, that spiraled into a few other ones as a sort of butterfly effect. I still think that type of grading is ridiculous, as all the proper steps and my thought process is shown correctly.",

I took Calc 2 in college and unfortunately it\u2019s just one of those classes you just have to accept that you won\u2019t know everything and have to learn when to ask for help. Unfortunately, since there are so many steps to Calc problems it is so easy to mess up the entire thing if you don\u2019t have a full grasp on basic algebra. If you haven\u2019t already check out professor Leonard or Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube, these people saved my life. \n\nAlso - fuck series and sequences.",

One time, i try to avoid using jargon, that i thought the answer must be as simple and general as possible, so that i not confuse it from other. I thought that if i explain it right, maybe i still got point, even if my jargon is off. Only to bashed next week, when the lecturer explain the lecturer want the opposite.",

If you\u2019re going to college to get a certain career which I\u2019d argue most people are, you would need to have the knowledge to be competent in your profession, whatever that is. Grading is also a way for schools to identify potential learning issues, keep track of teachers success rates , and to make sure that they\u2019re not sending someone out into a career who has no clue of the foundational knowledge needed for that.",

If you have a learning disability (test anxiety included), you deserve accommodations made by your schools disability office.
