  "text": "So one of my classes meets on Tuesdays at like 9am-12pm. \n\nNext Tuesday is Election Day and the professor gave us a poll of 2 options:\n\nTo either cancel class next Tuesday OR come in and do the lectures and hear the guest speaker \n\n\nGuess what the winner was? TO COME TO CLASS! \n\nIt\u2019s a 4 hour class, my only class on Tuesdays and 75% of them voted to come in. I just want one day to sleep until noon damn it! \n\n\nA lot of people wanted to hear the guest speaker for next week, even though the professor said the guest speaker is 100% fine talking the following week.",
