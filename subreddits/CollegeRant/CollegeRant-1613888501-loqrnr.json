Their goal is to introduce you to the theory in a basic sense and hope that you drill problems on the homework and attend office hours outside of class.",

Your prof probably expects you to be fine with it because the trivial examples provided are just meant to prove the theorems, so no need to do them in class.  \n\nIn tests, professor expect you to have solid understanding of theorem plus whatever algebraic terms they put to create a strategically difficult problem.",

I would say I def started experiencing this in classes after those initial classes after calc 1/2: multi variable, LinAlg, diffeq, and and more proof writing discrete class. \n\nLike my first real statistic course was a bunch of multi variable statistics, or my biostatistics course being a ton of linear algebra. If that makes sense?",

I changed my major after pre calculus when I got a C: my professor said if we couldn\u2019t get an A or B we probably wouldn\u2019t make it. \n\nLike I said before, I understand that those courses are built on previous concepts, it\u2019s just that many of the professors I\u2019ve had never connected how some of those simple concepts combine together. Like how one math concept can be combined with others to solve a complex problem. We mainly focused on individual parts so I could not tell which ones should be used together for different situations. The other thing that killed was how unclear some math problems are worded, math really is a different language. \n\nAnother issue I\u2019ve found is that sometimes we don\u2019t even know the meaning of certain math symbols or tools (for example, I don\u2019t know what SIN or CO-SIGN is, just that it\u2019s something used in math). I could solve one of those problems but I did not know what the answer means. I did not understand what I was doing, just that I got an answer from following the steps of an equation. Maybe I just had a horrible math foundation from day one, I have no idea.",
