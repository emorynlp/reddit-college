I finished my degree not too long ago and wanted to share what I learned with new students who are just starting college or university.\n\nSome of the most important things I would say are making sure you go to classes and do your readings ahead of time if you can (so you know what's going on in the course and don't fall behind).\n\nI also didn't take very good care of my physical health (eating poorly or skipping meals) and mental health (taking on too many tasks/activities/classes and always getting overwhelmed halfway through the semester), but if I were to do it over, I would make that a priority.\n\nAlso don't be afraid to ask other students for help and make study groups (even online groups/chats can be helpful). Sometimes it can be helpful to check in with the teaching assistant or professor though because a lot of the times when I talked to other students they all had different ideas about what the expectations were and that was confusing. When in doubt, ask the people who will be grading your assignments or giving you the course material to make sure you understand what's going on.\n\nI also made a video sharing some more college advice for new students if you're interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIMzPHxrb5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIMzPHxrb5s)\n\nTL;DR here's my advice for new college students: go to class, take care of yourself, ask for help.
