(I have another prof with 12 different topics, but it only shows up once as something due, so the coding is possible.)   \n   \nI then have two professors with vague syllabi showing what will be taught during the week but not what's due. Then they don't put anything into D2L or Pulse until the beginning of the week, so there's no way to plan for anything until that week.   \n  \nI agree with this rant.
