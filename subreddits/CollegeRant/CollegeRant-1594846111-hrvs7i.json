  "title:": "Prerequisites are a scam and a scandalous excuse to rip of students. Rage ahead",
  "text": " \n\nFirst off, let me name a few bullshit classes that I had to take to take to fulfill prerequisites:\n\nBusiness communication (essentially, how to talk like a human person but with unnecessary terminology to remember), writing for business ( exactly the same as the last) Anthropology ( some people eat cows, and some people don't..) and last but not least.... FOOD AND CULTURE. ( In Ireland they eat potatoes, Asian countries they eat noodles and in Germany, they eat fucking sausage.) I'm roughly 1000+ more in debt for each of these fucking wastes of time.\n\nRight now I'm in my last semester for my associates and I'm fulfilling my science prerequisite. So I'm taking Earth Science, the recommended class for non-science majors. This is the most demanding Bullshit I've ever had to fucking do. At the same time, I'm taking a statistics class which I quite enjoy. But I have to devote 30 hours or so a week to this fucking earth science class, reading 300 pages scattered around a glitchy online textbook just so I can remember for long enough that Volcanoes are formed from FUCKING WHO GIVES A SHIT TO PASS A TEST. I'M LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS FOR 1000+ DOLLARS OF DEBT!!!! FUCKING ROCKS AND it's NOT DELIVERED IN AN ELEMENTARY LEVEL. I HAVE TO ABSORB EVERY WORD OF ALL 300 PAGES LIKE A FREAK WITH PERFECT RECALL OR ILL GET A SHIT GRADE.\n\nand I cant do anything in this class without going into a fit of rage and sorrow because of how fucking pointless it is. I'm a pawn...not a student. My education is not the bottom line.\n\nrocks....rocks...rocks....rocks....rocks...rocks....rocks....rocks....rocks....\n\nI don't think I can keep it together. This shit makes me wanna become a mutant vampire whos flesh has overgrown and imprisoned him in a puss-filled cacoon on a wall in a dark underground dwelling of putridness and if anyone should ever come across me, my gaze alone is enough to make them go into a coma and their unconscious body would make them magically forced to walk up to me so I can suck their life force out of them.\n\nI'd be happier in a life like that than to do this FUCKING BULLSHIT ANYMORE",
