My mother has always expected a lot out of me and throughout high school I did everything I could to make her happy. I was on the board of multiple clubs, team captain of XC and track, and had a 4.48 GPA and graduated salutatorian. I was not the happiest child in high school and told myself that I would get better once I was in college because I could get far from my parents.\n\nSince, I'm Chinese I have a lot of Chinese family friends and all of their children are at an ivy league and are extremely successful. I am the only one out of the family friend group that didn't attend a top 10 school and my mother claims she doesn't care but puts out really passive aggressive comments all the time. My mother has made me ashamed of the college I go to even though it's a great school with lots of opportunities. I have two research positions, a 3.8 GPA, and a premed biochem major but it's still not enough for her.\n\nEver since I've come home for quarantine, I have been able to tolerate everything she subtly says but today really struck a nerve. She said I should try to transfer to an even better school because the school I'm at isn't good enough and my opportunities aren't good enough. It just really sucks, because I am finally in a place where I am so happy and my mother overlooks my happiness and thinks about how I could do better.\n\nTL;DR: I just needed a safe place to rant and would like to ask for advice. It just sucks never feeling praise from your parents. I go to school and work for me, but it just still really sucks when your own mother doesn't support you.", "author": "gracestar8", "created": 1586993369, "retrieved": 1632951370, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fqba6x7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/g23eg1/disappointment_of_a_child/fqba6x7/", "text": "You're clearly very accomplished and have a lot to be proud of.
