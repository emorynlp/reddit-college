  "text": "Does anyone else feel this way or am I just losing it? \n\nI feel too stressed and anxious to study. I have been avoiding studying for organic chemistry (a big no no) since the beginning of the semester pretty much. I managed to somehow score a C on the first exam, didn\u2019t take the second because I was too anxious, and now my third exam is coming up and I don\u2019t even know where to begin???\n\nI also have a molecular biology class that I pretty much have no idea what I\u2019m doing in, and a math class that I have been barely surviving. \n\nWhat is going on? Why am I feeling so anxious and overwhelmed to the point where I can\u2019t even study? I know I\u2019m afraid to fail and ironically that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me from studying at all :( \n\nIdk if I have anxiety and seeing a specialist is not an option. \n\nAnyone else feel this way? Any helpful tips?",

It was such a bad time because I had so many papers and tests and I had to work on top of that but I couldn\u2019t get anything done bc my brain just didn\u2019t work. \n\nI started to do some guided meditation and took a lot of walks while listening to music which helped me calm down. And I also zoomed with friends and had a little fun which may sound counterproductive but I think it helped me focus overall.\n\nHopefully you find some sort of a break from all this stress it has been a hard semester.",

Whatever desire I had to even get a degree is practically gone. I\u2019m just trying to care while I waste time reading here and there hating myself for not finishing the tasks quicker but knowing the stress is killing my mood deep down.",
