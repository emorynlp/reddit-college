I have been avoiding studying for organic chemistry (a big no no) since the beginning of the semester pretty much. I managed to somehow score a C on the first exam, didn\u2019t take the second because I was too anxious, and now my third exam is coming up and I don\u2019t even know where to begin???\n\nI also have a molecular biology class that I pretty much have no idea what I\u2019m doing in, and a math class that I have been barely surviving. \n\nWhat is going on? Why am I feeling so anxious and overwhelmed to the point where I can\u2019t even study? I know I\u2019m afraid to fail and ironically that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me from studying at all :( \n\nIdk if I have anxiety and seeing a specialist is not an option. \n\nAnyone else feel this way?
