Other times they straight up copy the textbook readings, put it on a slide, and read it off to class during lecture without adding much else to spice it up. Math is a beautiful subject and deserves to be treated that way by those who teach it, especially if I\u2019m paying  them hundreds of dollars to take a required math course! Don\u2019t just feed me boring textbook passages, show me why I should care about math! Even if it\u2019s lightly sprinkled throughout the course, learning about the history and philosophy of mathematical thought should be a required part of all math classes, ESPECIALLY entry-level ones.\n\nTL;DR college math is soulless", "author": "vernacorinne", "created": 1598465344, "retrieved": 1632950799, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g8mn1vx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ih40by/the_way_that_entrylevel_math_courses_are_taught/g8mn1vx/", "text": "ALEKS is fine and all, I\u2019ve learned a lot off it in these last few weeks.

Unfortunately I botched the first test and ended up getting just low enough that I withdrew a week before finals so my grade was a W instead of an F and I couldn't take her again because she hasn't been giving classes for Calc 1 the next semester so I took it with a teacher who had a similar teaching style but she was more mellow and didn't point out the good stuff that really helped and to be honest just the lack of energy/positivity she had for it made a huge change but I knew all the stuff so I passed the class (she's a good teacher and lots of people prefer her because of her being more mellow and let's you use a cheat sheet and doesn't expect as much from you, which only hurts you in later classes) but now I can't find classes taught by the first teacher anymore and I'll be switching to metro after this semester so idk if I'll be able to take classes with her anymore which sucks because she made it easier to stay engaged and study and all that stuff.
