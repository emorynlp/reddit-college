  "text": "I have been dealing with more bullshit after more bullshit for 2 and a half years now. Im coming to the end of my first semester of my final year and i think i have finally reached my limit. I dont think i can solve this one.\n\nThe entire department of one of my majors is in shambles. Lecturers have basically stopped responding to students begging for help. I have 3 group projects. Two of them people dont communicate for and meetings keep getting rescheduled (but never enough for me to write a complaint and request a new group plus theyll just reject my complaint anyway). Both of them are due next week, despite still waiting on feedback for one of them. Then i have another shitty group with 10 times the workload but for some reason i just cant seem to stretch myself that far.\n\nFor my main project, i have dickheads cancelling on me despite me ensuring weeks in advance that theyll be there and i cant do anything other than accept it and reschedule as im reliant on them. Then i have like 10 individual assignment that i cant give the light of day to because i have to focus on group assignments. I have a million different specific issues i could rant about to no end.\n\nI always thought i was good at keeping things together but ive reached my limits. Its like trying to keep a glass bottle together with a glue stick and tape. I dont have time to babysit all of these group members, i dont have time to deal with bad lecturers, i dont have time to do mt part of a project and also help them with theirs, i dont have time to do quizzes, i dont have time to listen to my lecturer complain about students, i dont have time to do required readings, i dont have time to catch up on lectures, i dont have time to do my own assignments, i dont have time to get help, i dont have time for a mental breakdown. Im just tired. They told me college would be fun. This feels like its an experiment to see how much bullshit ill put up with before i break.",
