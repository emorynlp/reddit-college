I think for people to truly master the language they would have to make it a 6 semester thing and dilute it rather than an intense 3 semesters but not many people are willing to do that so they stuff everything into a shorter course load while still expecting more. In my experience there was also a very heavy emphasis on grammar and in the US we don\u2019t really teach grammar well enough, we don\u2019t understand why our language is the way it is we just implicitly know what is correct without knowing why so when you learn another language you are also compensating for your lack of understanding of english", "author": "Visible_Negotiation4", "created": 1625770522, "upvotes": 1}, "h4i1soo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/og76nl/is_it_just_my_bad_luck_or_are_colleges_extremely/h4i1soo/", "text": "YES. it\u2019s absolutely insane.

My girlfriend who isn\u2019t (she\u2019s Irish) took intro to Spanish and they conducted the class the same way. I think maybe schools consider most students who are taking languages are those that are familiar with it or are continuing on from what they took in high school.

If the issue is with the same department\u2019s lower-level courses, then they need to evaluate how those courses are taught and adjust them. If the issue is with other universities or area high schools, then they may want to consider some kind of entrance testing if they have expectations for a base level before entering a course.\n\nThis kind of thing happens all the time in areas like math, and even in marketing (my field), we see students who should have already learned certain things who appear to have never even heard of them.
