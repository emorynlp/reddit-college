  "text": "I\u2019ve had 3 horrible semesters and a terrible freshman year. Before I could understand stuff and tried really hard to do basic stuff even. Now no matter what I do ,it doesn\u2019t add up, my record is in the trash and I\u2019m drained of emotion. I\u2019m gonna be booted of two semesters for poor performance , have lost hard earned money and just want to quit now. I feel nothing , my souls gone numb",
