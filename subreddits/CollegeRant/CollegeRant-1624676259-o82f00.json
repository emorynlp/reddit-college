I'm taking two courses this Summer - one accounting course and a Technical Writing course. The Accounting course is asynchronous and the Professor just sends the lessons via YouTube videos (not her own) & slides along with assignments. Most of the assignment went fine then I got stuck on one part that wasn't really covered or explained well in the videos or slides. I've sent her an email and posted on the discussion board for clarification but received zero reply. I attempted to search for the concepts but the question just isn't straightforward at all. I ended up ~~spending~~ wasting multiple hours searching this. Why do I have to spend multiple hours searching for a concept when it should literally be the Professor's job to clarify this??? As if I don't have another course or other side projects that I want to work on???\n\nNot to mention in my Technical Writing course, the Professor has given us so many requirements for our assignments that it seems almost impossible to even start the assignment. I don't have a million hours to be researching a million different sources for literally every fucking sentence.\n\nIt's just so frustrating... why can't these assignments ever be straightforward? I'm so sick of having to spend hours outside of class having to research shit and wasting so much time I could be doing on other things. I'm fucking over it, I feel like dropping the classes. Does anyone else feel this way?", "author": "danielr088", "created": 1624676259, "retrieved": 1632949648, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
