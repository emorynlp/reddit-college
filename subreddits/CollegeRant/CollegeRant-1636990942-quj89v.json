  "text": "I am currently a junior about to wrap up my fall semester in the next 2-3 weeks. It's not a bad semester, but not the best, I mean it's pretty average. Anyways, I have been bothered by the idea of internships. I am really tired of this stigma of \"having to get\" internships. I just find the idea to be really dumb due to all the garbage postings from startups or I feel like unrealistic requirements. I find LinkedIn and those other \"recruitment websites\" to be a toxic cesspool. I just see myself being a number on those websites despite actually making my profile look more alive than the many blank ones from my colleagues. The entire process seems way more than it needs to be and intimidating for many. I am currently stuck in a situation where I am trying to figure out if an internship would help or not. My current situation, assuming all goes to plan, would be that I would graduate with a Computer Science Major, and minors in Computer Forensics and Computer Information Systems. I have also been working via Work-Study for my school's IT department as a technician for the past 2 and a half years, and I plan to continue that so I should be leaving college with my major, minors, and 3-4 years of work experience in IT. I am debating whether an internship would be useful or even worth my efforts. I am open to ideas and feedback or different perspectives. Again, I have just been really stuck and I am currently under pressure from friends, parents, and others to pursue them, but I want to weigh my options. I am not necessarily against getting an internship, although my current outlook on them is negative. Any advice or feedback would be highly appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Trying to weigh my options about internships while having a distaste for them. I need advice based on my current situation which is getting a major, 2 minors, and 3-4 years of IT experience via work-study.",

      "text": "I learned so much from one of the internships I had that I don\u2019t even mind how much work it was. The benefit of internships (from my perspective) is that you not only get to learn the ropes of a workplace, but you get to make connections with people. The organization I was with had values that matched mine, and it ended up being SO much fun. \n\nSo I do suggest getting an internship, and I also suggest you start by just making a list of organizations/companies you\u2019d like to work with after you graduate. Then go to each of their websites and look to see if they offer internships.",

          "text": "First part, yes. Second part, no. \n\nIf you want an internship, find a recruiter on LinkedIn and cold call. Because now, you\u2019re no longer a statistic. You\u2019re a connection. Use that to get yourself an interview. Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of too many applications and yours not being seen. \n\nInternships are important to get but, you can learn just as much by doing a personal project or related in your field. Both is optimal but, an internship will always weigh more.\n\nThe whole process is luck. All luck. Some summers be really good. Some be really dry. Even for those with solid companies on their resumes.",

I actually got an offer my junior year to go to France and work as a research assistant for a professor; I decided to work as a carpenter instead, I didn't even really agonize over the decision (lol).\n\n\nWhen I graduated I couldn't get a job in my field and went back to grad school. There was a really big recession at the time, but an internship may have helped get my foot in the door somewhere, who knows? In grad school I did internships and externships all the time, but they were paid. When I graduated I got a job in my field within six months, but not with any of the organizations I interned/externed with, despite another bad economy.\n\n\nThat job sucked though. The moral of the story is I should have just stayed in construction. Good luck.",

If it's IT somewhere, then look up some companies, call, make an appt, and physically ask. \n\nI find that the internet is just a bunch of social politics. For IT depending on what you're doing at your school, you may not even need an internship. Unless it's basic password customer support, or actually security stuff/.  setting things up. \n\nAsk a professor or program advisor?\nHonestly, I'd ask an advisor over reddit or whatever your peers or parents have to say.
