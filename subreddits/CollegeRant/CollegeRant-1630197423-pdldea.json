  "text": "I\u2019m suddenly getting really bummed out seeing everyone moving in to college and having all these orientation events and such. I\u2019m starting on monday, I still go to a good school, but it\u2019s a branch campus and I\u2019m commuting. I know I shouldn\u2019t be too upset because I did choose it and I\u2019m saving a ton money, but I haven\u2019t had an orientation or anything, there\u2019s nothing really exciting to look forward to on the first day. I\u2019m just going to class and leaving at the end of the day. I kind of wanted that cliche college experience, especially as a freshman, and it\u2019s hitting me now that I\u2019m not going to have those fun or exciting experiences or memories. I might not care that much a few years from now but i\u2019m still kind of upset that I set myself up for having a sort of lame start to college :/\n\ntldr: I\u2019m a commuter and it feels like i\u2019m going to have a boring start to my college experience",

      "text": "A lot of the people you see spamming their Instagram with stuff about their college life are going to be paying 2-5x the cost of your college expenses and will be unable to afford a car at age 29 because they wanted to have fun for a measly four years.\n\nYes, it sucks being 18-20 walking into college and not having a dorm room and parties and all of these college experiences. I commute to a college like you do. In the end though, a lot of residential students massively regret their four years in their dorm room. Once the party is over, people do begin waking up to just how massive their debt hole is. You won't be one of them. I'd rather have less of a \"college experience\" and owe 20k then go live on campus and owe anything between 50-130k depending on financial aid. And then consider the interest tacked on. You're taking a W my friend.",
