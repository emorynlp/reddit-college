I\u2019m starting on monday, I still go to a good school, but it\u2019s a branch campus and I\u2019m commuting. I know I shouldn\u2019t be too upset because I did choose it and I\u2019m saving a ton money, but I haven\u2019t had an orientation or anything, there\u2019s nothing really exciting to look forward to on the first day. I\u2019m just going to class and leaving at the end of the day. I kind of wanted that cliche college experience, especially as a freshman, and it\u2019s hitting me now that I\u2019m not going to have those fun or exciting experiences or memories. I might not care that much a few years from now but i\u2019m still kind of upset that I set myself up for having a sort of lame start to college :/\n\ntldr: I\u2019m a commuter and it feels like i\u2019m going to have a boring start to my college experience", "author": "hugeswag69", "created": 1630197423, "retrieved": 1632841474, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"haqxhed": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdldea/freshman_year/haqxhed/", "text": "Thank you u/hugeswag69 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I commute to a college like you do. In the end though, a lot of residential students massively regret their four years in their dorm room. Once the party is over, people do begin waking up to just how massive their debt hole is. You won't be one of them. I'd rather have less of a \"college experience\" and owe 20k then go live on campus and owe anything between 50-130k depending on financial aid. And then consider the interest tacked on.
