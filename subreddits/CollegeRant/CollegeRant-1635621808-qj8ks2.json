If in studying any math, you figure out how to do something, you will fail - you need to know how AND WHY - and that is what determines a good professor vs a bad professor.\n\nFor simplistic example, if a professor is teaching how to use the unit circle, without also teaching why, then students will be forced to research it for themselves or fail the exam (or have a glib, rote grasp of the concepts, which can pass exams but can't apply memorized fundamentals in the real world).\n\nBut, yeah, your professor sucks, but it is deeper than that, the entire math department probably also sucks.",

They weren\u2019t easy, but it was material we expected ya know? Since she made the questions and based them around what we learned in lecture. That\u2019s why I liked her so much and I miss her so much lol. All the other ones were trash and are trash at my school.

Used to. I took her second subsequent unit, got to the midsem exam, did it, went home immediately after that class, cried, dropped the unit and changed that major. 2 other students I spoke to did literally the same thing (don\u2019t know about the crying, but dropped that unit and changed majors literally that day too).\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, because I was really interested in the units and tried my absolute hardest to do well, and the effort required *just* to keep your head above water just wasn\u2019t worth it.",
