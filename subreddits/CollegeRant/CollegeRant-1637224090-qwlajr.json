  "text": "A bit of a rant I guess.\n\nI'm a 45 year old guy (46 tomorrow), and I thought it was a good plan to embark on the Computer Sciences course. After all, I've worked in IT for about 20 years now, so it does make sense to have a degree on it.\n\nThing is, the course is hard and, quite frankly, unpleasant. All teachers seem to do is to tell that \"we're behind schedule\" and dump everything on an unrealistic pace. There is barely any experiment and practical classes are always way too rushed to actually have any \"non scripted\" experimentation done.\n\nNow, I can see it done if college is the only thing you do, as you could have the 4,5 hours of class and then spend the rest of the day studying what was lectured. But I don't see how to do it after a full work day, even if I did have the stamina to spend all weekend long studying.\n\nThat's it. I've dropped 2 (out of 5) classes already after being in college for only 2 months, but quite frankly all I think about all the time is to ditch the course. I completely regret having embarked in it, worst idea ever.\n\nRant done, sorry about that but had to take if off my chest.",
