  "text": "(A post cursing online school, but that\u2019s part of what the subreddit\u2019s here for I guess so bear with me)\n\nI\u2019m working towards an A.S. at a community college with two semesters to go before transferring to university, and I\u2019ve been enrolled here since 2020. Literally have never stepped foot on campus, and I even live in a completely different state because I was attending college here previously but that school closed down (unrelated to covid, it was gonna happen anyway). Home state tuition is cheaper, but I\u2019m still on a lease til 2022. \n\nI\u2018ve honestly had amazing professors here who seem to truly care about their students and teaching their classes, but it annoys me that there\u2019s so little I can do to really connect with them aside from sending friendly emails from time to time. I\u2019ve always been a \u201cfriends with the teacher\u201d type, lol. My Intro to Anatomy professor is delightful - we do Kahoot to start class and it\u2019s consistently a highlight of my week (if that tells you how sad my life is lol) - and I sent her some of my sketch studies from Netter with a little \u201chey I want you to know I am having fun in your class\u201d note. Sharing them that way made me feel like a try hard, but I wouldn\u2019t think twice if I\u2019d done it in person. It\u2019s different to email, you know how it is. I\u2019m a frequent lurker on r/professors and it would seem that they have it very rough right now across the board, and again, mine are lovely, so when I can I try to express that I\u2019m appreciative of the time they spend preparing and teaching their classes.\n\nNot gonna spend too much time ruminating on losing out on meeting peers and really talking to them because it seems like that\u2019s pretty universally known as a common misery but we did breakout rooms once in that class, and it felt strange to be so happy about hearing people\u2019s voices and getting to joke around a little with classmates like I haven\u2019t been able to since late 2019. It\u2018s miserable how apart we all are, and I\u2019m sort of a loner but I didn\u2019t realize how much classes that feel this empty would drain me.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how well I\u2019m actually retaining information when the most I can do in any class is occasionally type answers into the chat. My laptop is ten years old. Last time I tried to turn on my mic and camera it broke Blackboard so badly that I missed 15 minutes of class trying to fix it (audio just... stopped working??) and I had to restart my laptop completely, so I can\u2019t even show up in that way, even though I\u2019d like to. With quizzes and homework assignments for my science courses, it sometimes feels like I\u2019m cramming everything from the chapter into a sieve that it all promptly dribbles out of as soon as the grade goes in. I want to learn, but sometimes I just have to get by. \n\nI\u2019m starting to lose the motivation I was lucky to have found in the first place, but I\u2019m doing all I can to keep it. Covid news never stops being depressing and it seems like we\u2019re in for a hard winter. I got my second shot way back in May and from what I understand I\u2019m due for a booster, but I\u2019m distance learning indefinitely anyway to limit the spread, I guess. \n\nTL;DR [we live like this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HK0BMaUMmGw) but it\u2019s even more depressing somehow.\n\n*edited to add a few words and a bit more complaining. I didn\u2019t think this post would be so long when I started writing it.",
