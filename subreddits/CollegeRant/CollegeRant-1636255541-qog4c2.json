  "text": "This is kind of stupid but I can\u2019t get over this. I completely blanked when called on to do BASIC ALGEBRA in my math class. I was asked to do 1^3 and 2^3 and I said 3 and 6. I don\u2019t know why I fucking said that. Honestly I wanna puke I KNOW how to do cubed roots but all of a sudden my brain went scrambled and I had no idea how to do math anymore. + my friends made fun of me after for it. I just feel so stupid and that everyone thinks I\u2019m stupid.",

      "text": "If you think that's bad, I was taking a high level calc class and made a big deal about how 7+3 is 11 and since we needed the answer to be even to use that method, the whole solution was invalid.\n\nI swear, as you get further along in math, \"dumb\" mistakes like these get even more common. Just this year, most of my classmates have googled prealgebra topics, like how to multiply exponents and how to find a common denominator. We took an entire 20 min detour in a class because multiple people were baffled by what boiled down to 1+1=2.",

      "text": "Think about it- if some random classmate in your class had done the same thing instead of you, how long would you really remember the incident? What would you think about that person?\n\nWe tend to beat ourselves up over minor public embarrassments more than the average stranger who witnessed it would beat us over it. Your friends remember it bc they know you, but if their jokes really upset you that much then it wouldn't hurt to ask them \"hey look can we not joke about this anymore?\" (Unless they're assholes). Probably in a few days/weeks it really won't bother you, and barely anyone in your friend group (much less the people you don't know in your class) will remember it.\n\nSigned- someone with social anxiety who also freezes up and does plenty of embarrassing things in public",
