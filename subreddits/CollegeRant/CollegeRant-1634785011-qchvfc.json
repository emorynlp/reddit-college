  "text": "For context, I am an online student and take zoom classes. Today minutes before class a cup of water accidentally knocked over on the floor on my extension cord, laptop cord, and phone charger. This is a huge danger and risk, I can't just keep using wet cords and plug-ins so I immediately unplugged them. Because of this I could not be on my zoom class with mandatory attendance. I have a MacBook Pro with a battery life of 3 hours and it was on 1% at the time this happened! So I could not attend my zoom or my laptop would die. My phone was not an option either because it was on 10% and dies within minutes. My whole family is out of town so there are no extra phone chargers to use! So, after this I immediately emailed and texted I can't join and explained everything. My teacher despite reading these changed my attendance grade from 100% to 88%. My overall grade went from 99% to 90% I am livid. Would it be wrong for me to be mad or discuss changing this grade? My laptop charger is ruined. I have to buy a new one. I just feel beat down. This is physically something I have no control over, in fact, my dog knocked over the table as well because it is a flimsy one my parents gave me. I'm lost on what to do. Even if I get 1 point taken off for the rest of the semester I will get a B. I know Bs aren't bad, but I have done the work for an A and had a goal to get a 4.0 for the first time. What should I do?",
