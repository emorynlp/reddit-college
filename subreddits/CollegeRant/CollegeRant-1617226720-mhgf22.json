I feel like COVID ruined my college experience. \n\nMy first year of college, I was pretty lonely as all my high school friends went off to different universities. My second year, I started stepping out of my shell and making new friends. My third year, I really found my stride, made some really good friends, started going to social activities, enjoyed my classes, and boom COVID hit. Now I\u2019ve spent the last year of my life in Zoom university. \n\nIt feels like my brain can\u2019t retain any information anymore. I\u2019ve lost all motivation, because why study when everything is open book and open internet? Why be proactive in class when the professor is just reading off of slides that will be posted online later on? I\u2019m kind of just cruising to the finish line at this point. \n\nGraduating college used to be my biggest dream, and I couldn\u2019t wait to walk across the stage and receive my diploma with all my friends and family enjoying the day with me but they\u2019ve even cancelled the commencement ceremony. I feel no sense of fulfillment at this point. It\u2019s all kinda just ehhh. \n\nI really miss being around people my age. I know post graduation depression is real, but I\u2019m feeling it now. To make matters even worse, the job market is so scarce right now as the economy recovers. \n\nIt feels like I\u2019m in purgatory. Just wanted to vent to any peeps that might be feeling the same as me.", "author": "DreamChaserDoedie", "created": 1617226720, "retrieved": 1632951380, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gtgad0w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mhgf22/i_graduate_in_may_and_it_feels_so_unfulfilling/gtgad0w/", "text": "Even my friends who didn't graduate during covid feel the same.

I was at the best place I\u2019ve ever been in life right before COVID. Ever since then it\u2019s been up and down and I\u2019ve never seen that peak since.
