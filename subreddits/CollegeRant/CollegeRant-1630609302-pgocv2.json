I'll tell you right now I wasn't excited. I didn't do anything wrong, I guess he just wanted to talk. I hate his class already, he is old, never explains anything, and is constantly on tangents about absolutely nothing. He doesn't ever answer questions, etc. So I stayed after class, I thought whatever it'll be done in 5 minutes. So he asks if I had any questions. I said no. Somehow this turned into a rant about same sex marriage and how it is wrong. I asked if he was homophobic. He said no, I have plenty of gay friends. Long story short he went on a huge rant about how homosexuality is wrong but he isn't homophobic. He knows I am lesbian and he kept reiterating how wrong it was, but he doesn't care what I do. This went on for AN HOUR AFTER CLASS ENDED. \n\nTldr, can I drop a class if I hate my professor?", "author": "idioticathiest", "created": 1630609302, "retrieved": 1632950821, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hboti3r": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgocv2/am_i_allowed_to_drop_a_class_if_i_hate_my/hboti3r/", "text": "Yikes you could report him for that", "author": "mokshmoon", "created": 1630851524, "upvotes": 1}, "hbo206j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgocv2/am_i_allowed_to_drop_a_class_if_i_hate_my/hbo206j/", "text": "Please keep us updated.

You can drop the class, you just have to follow whatever rules your school has about hours per semester and what points in the semester a drop can be refunded.\n\nWhen I \\*first\\* saw this comment, I thought it was very dramatic. Comments on how you hate the professor, and how he is old (just makes you sound agist) made me disregard comments about how he goes on tangents and doesn't explain anything. When people get emotional in their rants, it makes it hard to take other comments about teaching effectiveness seriously. Just FYI for when you are talking about this kind of thing.\n\nBUT THEN... you dropped the bomb. Wanting to talk to you after class, and then that turning into conversation about his personal stance on same sex marriage is not appropriate. Telling you that being a lesbian is wrong is NOT okay. This is such a HUGE red flag. Of course, drop the class if you want, for whatever reason. But I also strongly encourage you to report this. I don't know what part of your school covers this kind of thing, but please look into reporting this. That is not appropriate behavior from a professor, at all. I'm sure this is not the first time he has done something like this, and it will not be the last time.
