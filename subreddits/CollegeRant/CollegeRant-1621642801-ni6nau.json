It would take most of my time. I'd write a lot of notes, make my own flashcards. Study online exams. These are all stuff I've never done for any other subject. I loved Biochemistry and I even had plans to study Masters and maybe even PhD! \n\nMidterm comes around. I'm very confident. I understand the material, I have memorized what needs memorizing\n\nThe exam was quite harder than I've anticipated but it's fine! I was still positive about getting a 25/30 at least which is not that bad\n\nGrades come out and well.. I got 14/30 \nThat hurt me so goddamn hard.\nIt sucked \n\nI feel like I've failed myself, something that I've really loved and gave my best was one of my worst grades ever.. maybe I'm just not good enough for college \n\nTL;DR : Got 14/30 on my Biochemistry midterm and I need to reconstruct my whole life plan", "author": "Wibtb", "created": 1621642801, "retrieved": 1632842338, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 44, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gz06747": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ni6nau/i_failed_myself/gz06747/", "text": "Thank you u/Wibtb for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It honestly broke me because I loved the subject as well and I had a good grade before the midterm. It unfortunately put me back a whole year due to some classes only being offered in the fall and biochem being a prerequisite. I\u2019m taking it again in the fall and I\u2019m nervous but I also took a different upper level chemistry class this past semester and got a B. Looking back I wasn\u2019t prepared for the class but I\u2019m ready to try again and make a much better grade. \n\nI also had plans for grad school but after a bad semester my gpa is a bit lower than what it should be and it made me reconsider my future. Think about whether it is something you would really enjoy. Speak with professors and throw yourself into a research lab if you can to see if it is really something you love doing. Getting one or a couple low grades is okay and shouldn\u2019t mess up everything!
