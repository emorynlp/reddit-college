  "text": "What the title says\\^\n\nI have do D's, a C and a B. This is my first accounting semester- online. I hate it. So much. \n\nI am never fully motivated and it is so hard to concentrate on tedious assignments. I am going to a Uni that is four hours south of me and because I am only 17 I cannot even live on campus. I want to take a break next semester but I feel like I might have a better chance of doing better. All I know is that my GPA (if I pass, which I think I will because passing is C, around 70-73%) will definitely be a 2.0, maybe a 2.3 if I get a B or two. \n\nI need advice- I am afraid to talk to my parents about it as they are paying the tuition (3,600 per semester, not bad I think) and I don't want them to know that I am essentially failing.\n\nHow can I boost my motivation and my attention span? I have tried studying in different places around the house, eating nutritious food and drinking water. I do exercise a couple times a week by playing tennis for 1.5 hours. I feel as if I'm lazy- that or burnt out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation as you. I ended up taking the second semester off and worked until the start of this school year. I\u2019m now back in school and feeling more motivated than I did last year, and I\u2019m actually doing really well in all of my classes. I think that especially in your situation where you can\u2019t live on campus, a semester off is a good idea. If you\u2019re not in an environment where you can thrive, it\u2019s difficult to get the motivation to do so. Burnout happens. I needed a semester to myself to get my motivation back",

I\u2019m assuming you just finished high school too so you really actually haven\u2019t had a break in 12 years. And it\u2019s absolutely not quitting. Sometimes you just need a break, which is completely understandable. As long as you know you want to come back, it\u2019s not quitting.",
