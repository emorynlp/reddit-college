Professor asked for footnote or endnote citations. I used end of sentence citations because I\u2019m using APA format, and he *did* give us permission to use whatever format we wanted. But still I had no idea how to cite with APA the way he asked.\n\n2. He asked for essay format\u2026intro-body-conclusion. I kind of did that, but in the APA style of sectioning things off for different topics. I still had a clear intro, obvious body parts, but I\u2019m not sure if I needed to have a conclusion to each section or if my final \u201cconclusion\u201d was acceptable enough so naturally I\u2019m stressing out.\n\n3. He asked for 10-12 pages. I know some professors out there don\u2019t care too much if you go over page count, but I\u2019m at 16 fucking pages. I got way too excited with my writing and went way over page count. I have history with some professors that deduct points for every page you go over and I\u2019m now terrified.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m just here to vent because the paper is due in 6 hours (midnight) and there\u2019s no way I can rewrite it all. All I was really able to do was fix my citations to the best of my abilities, and even with that I feel lost. I had a lot of fun with this paper too, and I don\u2019t usually enjoy writing papers, which makes this all the more heart breaking/frustrating. We have the option to ask for extra credit with the paper provided it\u2019s well written, and I originally thought I\u2019d give it a shot because I put a lot of effort into my work, but now I don\u2019t think it would be worth it to try for extra credit. Clearly I\u2019ve displayed that when I get excited about something I can\u2019t follow directions. I\u2019m so angry with myself right now.\n\nthanks for listening", "author": "WingsofRain", "created": 1625873838, "retrieved": 1632841791, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h4nbj4h": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oh7fyq/just_finished_a_paper_only_to_find_out_that_id/h4nbj4h/", "text": "Thank you u/WingsofRain for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Unless its a really long, technical paper, that would be kind of weird and I would likely consider it fluff in a 10-12 page student paper.  3) My advice: proofread and remove all the obviously unnecessary superfluous language that most every non-professional writer often uses.  When I\u2019m grading papers, if a paper is extra long, but the paper is tightly written and on topic, I might grumble about it but won\u2019t fault them grade-wise for being an overachiever.  On the other hand, if there is constant repetition, meandering writing, and just useless nonsense that causes them to exceed the max, I will usually take points off (and note so on my rubric).  My advice is use what time you have left to carefully edit your writing to be more parsimonious.  Reading your work out loud or better, give it to a peer and ask them to be merciless in their critique. Either will help you hone in on wordy writing and whittle it down.  You could also simply attach a note in an email or upload like \u201csorry, I really got into this topic and had a lot to say.\u201d If your writing is good, I would probably smile and accept that.  The only times I\u2019ve known faculty to be draconian about going over page length is when they\u2019re expressly trying to teach students to write succinctly (usually in very short essays) or they are jerks and should have made their grading policy on going over the page limit clear.", "author": "AgentIndiana", "created": 1625874782, "upvotes": 53}}}
