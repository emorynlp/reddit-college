But today I decided to attend class and the teacher started by asking everyone how their work is going in the class and what they\u2019ve been up to. Then he gets to me and goes off. He demands to know where I\u2019ve been and says I\u2019ve missed class and that my grade is going to drop drastically. I didn\u2019t want to say in front of everyone that I\u2019ve been really sad and felt put on the spot as I didn\u2019t know what to say. Then he goes on to lecture the class that if we are going to miss class we need to let him know ahead of time and that class is mandatory. Something that was news to me as it doesn\u2019t say this anywhere on his syllabus nor in any of the earlier lectures at the beginning of the quarter. I even double checked, so now I don\u2019t know what I should do about my grade. How should I handle this situation?\n\nEdit: I told one of my other professors a few weeks ago that I was taking taking this persons class and they told me that everyone hates him and that\u2019s he\u2019s kind of only there since he is famous. So even other professors don\u2019t like him. :/", "author": "rathutt", "created": 1621374162, "retrieved": 1632950135, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"gypn1jj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nfn5vf/mean_professor/gypn1jj/", "text": "Wait, you didn't go to class because you were \"sad?\" How are you planning to handle a career?", "author": "TwoScoopsBaby", "created": 1621440592, "upvotes": 2}, "gyn6h39": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nfn5vf/mean_professor/gyn6h39/", "text": "It\u2019s respectful, and expected to let people know if you\u2019ll be absent.
