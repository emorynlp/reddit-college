  "text": "\n\nI haven\u2019t attended one of my classes in a month due to mental health reasons and the fact that the professor records the lectures so I can just watch them later. But today I decided to attend class and the teacher started by asking everyone how their work is going in the class and what they\u2019ve been up to. Then he gets to me and goes off. He demands to know where I\u2019ve been and says I\u2019ve missed class and that my grade is going to drop drastically. I didn\u2019t want to say in front of everyone that I\u2019ve been really sad and felt put on the spot as I didn\u2019t know what to say. Then he goes on to lecture the class that if we are going to miss class we need to let him know ahead of time and that class is mandatory. Something that was news to me as it doesn\u2019t say this anywhere on his syllabus nor in any of the earlier lectures at the beginning of the quarter. I even double checked, so now I don\u2019t know what I should do about my grade. How should I handle this situation?\n\nEdit: I told one of my other professors a few weeks ago that I was taking taking this persons class and they told me that everyone hates him and that\u2019s he\u2019s kind of only there since he is famous. So even other professors don\u2019t like him. :/",

I agree he shouldn\u2019t have called you out like that and that he might not be liked. Still he\u2019s your professor and deserves your respect, which included emailing. If you\u2019ve got an issue with this prof, then talk about it with your advisor to make a plan. Also I\u2019d take advantage of going to an school offered counseling for dealing with mental health, also talk to your advisor and even your professor.",

Having said that, it was unprofessional to call you out like that in front of everyone. :(",

Usually if professors (or anyone for that matter) act in this way it\u2019s because they\u2019re unhappy and need to project on to others. While he shouldn\u2019t have acted in that way just remember it has nothing to do with you, but more to do with himself. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but don\u2019t let one ass hole get to you",
