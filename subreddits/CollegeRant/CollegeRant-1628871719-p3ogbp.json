I took a lot, and they really stressed me out. I was at home, so I didn\u2019t have people to talk to. I really didn\u2019t do anything besides stress over school.\n\nNow, I\u2019m finishing up my online summer courses. I took a lot, and they were very intense. They really burned me out, as if last year didn\u2019t do that already (as well as high school). It didn\u2019t help my years of loneliness.\n\nI\u2019m about to enter college as a sophomore and step my first foot on campus. I feel burned out. I don\u2019t want to do any schoolwork.\n\nI\u2019ll go out there and make friends and try to have fun. But I\u2019m just so burned out and exhausted. Last year was hell. What makes this year any different, when I still have schoolwork and stress?\n\nWill I be okay? Will I get better?", "author": "whatyainfor", "created": 1628871719, "retrieved": 1632951516, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"h8sugb7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p3ogbp/burned_out_before_i_even_start/h8sugb7/", "text": "Burnout has become increasingly common for everyone; it\u2019s totally normal. It goes away when you distance yourself from the stressors that caused the burnout. That doesn\u2019t mean not doing your work or fulfilling your responsibilities, but it means making sure you prioritize self-care among everything else. Be sure you take time to step away regularly from schoolwork. Do things you enjoy. Try to eat well, exercise regularly, and get good sleep. Vary the places you work. Try not to always work in the same place you relax or sleep.\n\nSome of that is easier than others to do. At the end of the day, though, the work you produce under burnout won\u2019t be any better than work you\u2019d produce if you carve out enough self-care time and have less work time. At least in the latter case, you won\u2019t feel as empty and miserable.\n\n- a professor who\u2019s been burnt out repeatedly the past year", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1628872811, "upvotes": 22}}}
