  "text": "My major doesn\u2019t require much, I\u2019ll be honest. It\u2019s Communications/Media Production. There\u2019s only one class in my major that we are required to take that actually needs to be in person, which I\u2019m currently taking. The majority of the courses for my major were online pre covid but as I\u2019m looking through the lists for Spring 2022, almost every single one is in person! And at very similar times too. I\u2019ve never had so many issues trying to piece a schedule together. And I only need four major electives and a minor elective (my minor elective will actually be online!) Several of these classes could easily be online. For example: History of Cinema and Social Aspects of Film. You go in, watch a movie, and go home. I took a similar course last winter and it was perfect online. I feel like they\u2019re trying to overcompensate for all the covid stuff, but in reality is just making life a lot harder for people who can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to be on campus six days a week. (My school is mostly a commuter school as well)\nThere was two classes I really wanted to take but they were at the same time, and only one section for each. Just sucks. They only offer one class at one time and then all the other classes are the exact same way. It\u2019ll be my last semester though and I got it worked out to where I\u2019ll only be on campus three days a week, so not bad. Just needed to complain because online courses made it so much easier for me personally to balance, but I only saw maybe one or two online classes for my major at all when pre covid it was more 50/50.",
