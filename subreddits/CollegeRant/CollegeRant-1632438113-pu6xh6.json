I honestly don\u2019t really feel happy with the college experience, or dorming, and would rather just have my own place (especially my own bathroom because lord knows the weird shit I\u2019ve seen here) and just being surrounded by people when I\u2019d rather just have the privacy of being by myself at at least one place just kinda sucks. I\u2019d much rather chill out and play video games or watch a show than have to hear shrieking outside of my room or someone blasting the new Kanye album (I like the album and all I\u2019d just rather not hear it at like, 2 am when I have a quiz in the morning). My concerns don\u2019t usually get addressed by the RA, and when I confronted them directly they stopped but still, that shit gets on my nerves.\n\nI\u2019d much rather transfer closer to home or something, because this shit, I don\u2019t get what\u2019s great about this\u2026", "author": "asianboyopoyo", "created": 1632438113, "retrieved": 1632951387, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"he559do": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pu6xh6/i_dont_really_get_whats_so_great_about_the/he559do/", "text": "After living in a dorm for 3 years, I'm definitely over it.", "author": "aanuma", "created": 1632519448, "upvotes": 1}, "he541nv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pu6xh6/i_dont_really_get_whats_so_great_about_the/he541nv/", "text": "For real though! I stayed on campus my freshman year and never really liked it. I need my space and alone time and did not get good roommates. I was kind of lucky to get kicked out of the dorms when Covid started. I think it just depends on who you are. Some people love campus because they get to party all of the time, others love campus because of the easy interactions with all the extroverts, and I think a lot of people like campus because it is expected of them. The only thing I liked about staying on campus was the freedom! I was starting new and was away from everything I knew. It was a great feeling and a good experience for me but I would not recommend it to everyone.", "author": "layne26", "created": 1632518927, "upvotes": 1}, "he1ewrh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pu6xh6/i_dont_really_get_whats_so_great_about_the/he1ewrh/", "text": "The college experience is dependent on what college you go to.
