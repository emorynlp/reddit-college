  "text": "Tl;dr: how to say \u201cmy classmates where lazy, petty and sabotaged my work\u201d in more professional terms for a reflection \n\nSo I do photography in college amd at one point during a very important unit (as in: \u201cyou have to re do the whole year if you don\u2019t pass this\u201d important) My 16 year old classmates where being petty and conveniently forgetting to come to shoots last minute so I couldn\u2019t reschedule and if they did show up would mess around the entire time so I couldn\u2019t get any good photos (it was so bad I had to photoshop their mouths closed).  \n\nTheir reasoning was that I didn\u2019t want to socialise with an incel they where friends with and that a Renaissance themed project wasn\u2019t as fun for them as fashion (Both of these where overheard and not said to me directly)\n\nThis really fucked up a lot of my work meaning I couldn\u2019t do everything I wanted and while I still have a Distinction my photos weren\u2019t as good as I knew they could\u2019ve been if I had the time to elaborate on my photos instead of desperately trying to schedule a single photoshoot. Now I have to do a reflection on the work and want to acknowledge where and why my work wasn\u2019t as good as it could\u2019ve been, I don\u2019t want to sound unprofessional but the only reason is because of their attitudes.",

          "text": "I mean\u2026 that\u2019s why I added in that they where cancelling on me last minute which is the only reason why I couldn\u2019t find other people. (I would\u2019ve been more then happy to work around them if there where real problems in timetables n stuff and they gave me at least a day or even an hour so I could find other people to work with). \n\nI also took responsibility over the fact they couldn\u2019t stop talking long enough for a single picture by using photoshop. I get what you\u2019re saying but unfortunately not everything can be controlled by me :/ I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s pathetic to be honest about the difficulties in the unit instead of just pretending it was entirely my fault (although I\u2019ll admit I was definitely too trusting giving the second and third chances for shoots)\n\n Honesty isn\u2019t \u201cthrowing them under the bus\u201d at all it\u2019s just being truthful. I appreciate your perspective though and thank you for your comment.",
