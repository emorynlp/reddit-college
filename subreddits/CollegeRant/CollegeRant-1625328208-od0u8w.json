Now I have to do a reflection on the work and want to acknowledge where and why my work wasn\u2019t as good as it could\u2019ve been, I don\u2019t want to sound unprofessional but the only reason is because of their attitudes.", "author": "GhostBlue1821", "created": 1625328208, "retrieved": 1632949612, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h4aqtnj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/od0u8w/how_to_write_my_classmates_put_me_behind_on_work/h4aqtnj/", "text": "im sorry, but u sound like u simply want to blame someone else for ur problems.  world does not revolve around u and throwing ur classmates under the the bus is simply pathetic.  and thats what u trying to do here, blame it all on ur classmates.", "author": "ghostmode342", "created": 1625616403, "upvotes": 1}, "h3xwie6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/od0u8w/how_to_write_my_classmates_put_me_behind_on_work/h3xwie6/", "text": "Perhaps you could frame this as a learning experience from working with difficult clients.
