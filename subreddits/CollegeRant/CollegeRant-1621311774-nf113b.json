Today I had a math exam and my computer decided to die with no warning right when I was about to submit. It\u2019s a recorded exam so I could get flagged for cheating Bc there\u2019s a gap where there is no video. So I could end up with a zero leaving me with a C in the class. I could go on an on about how much bull has happened. Basically my teachers never answer their emails so I never get the help I need or my questions answered and that literally got me a 0 on a project Bc my teacher wouldn\u2019t tell me how I was supposed to submit it. I have a biology exam in 6 days on 15 hours of lectures and I have not had time to watch a single one. This semester in general has just been really rough on my mental health and I just cannot wait for it to be over.", "author": "Cooch_2119", "created": 1621311774, "retrieved": 1632842368, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyj6aqk": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nf113b/feel_completely_defeated/gyj6aqk/", "text": "Thank you u/Cooch_2119 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
