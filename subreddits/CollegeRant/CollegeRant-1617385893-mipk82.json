You should be doing well because, you see value in it yourself.\n\nIf your GPA sucks, you should probably be looking into why because, even though I\u2019m not you, I have always been a shitty student and somehow pulled myself up to a 4.0 GPA just by focusing and managing my time.\n\nSometimes, college isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s perfectly fine.
