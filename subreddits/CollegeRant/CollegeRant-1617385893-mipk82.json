  "text": "My family told me that if I don\u2019t get at least B+ in all my classes this semester, they\u2019ll cut me off. My GPA is shit so I don\u2019t qualify for scholarships, and my parents refuse to co-sign a loan because they think I\u2019ll fuck up their credit score. My father\u2019s stock portfolio exploded overnight too so FAFSA won\u2019t give me anything-my expected family contribution is $150K. At this point I\u2019m terrified my only option to pay for college is going to be drop out and enlist in the military for a few years, which means I\u2019ll have to keep my mental health under wraps for the duration of my enlistment. I\u2019m fucking terrified.",

I\u2019d also like to point out that I\u2019m actually in the exact same spot and this is kinda how I\u2019ve dealt with it. A lot of people are going to blame you parents and any alternative points of subjectivity are probably going to be downvoted.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a luxury for your parents to be paying for your college. It\u2019s not a right. There\u2019s no law stating that they must pay for you. Actually, after 18 in the US, they can cut you off completely and that\u2019s how it be sometimes. \n\nUnfortunately, you shouldn\u2019t be doing well in school simply because your parents threatened you with whatever bs this is. You should be doing well because, you see value in it yourself.\n\nIf your GPA sucks, you should probably be looking into why because, even though I\u2019m not you, I have always been a shitty student and somehow pulled myself up to a 4.0 GPA just by focusing and managing my time.\n\nSometimes, college isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s perfectly fine. Just find something that you see value in and pursue it. There\u2019s no point in fighting with your parents. It\u2019s just an uphill battle and you\u2019re better off using that time and energy elsewhere.",
