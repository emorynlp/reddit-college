Jeez\u2026\nThis isn\u2019t a pity post, I really just feel like venting a bit and don\u2019t want people to look down on me. I just finished spending like 6 hours in the library writing an essay that I\u2019ll probably get a D on for being a page too long, or just not good enough, I have a short interview tomorrow for a club I\u2019m not prepared for at all (I don\u2019t even like it that much, but I have nothing else to do right now), I feel behind in all my classes, despite my journaling and calendar usage, I have no friends, at all, despite my efforts in clubs and just talking to people, my parents are worried all the time (I don\u2019t want to make them worried about me, I want them to be proud), I don\u2019t have a job, or an internship, or a lab role, or a TA role lined up for me, I don\u2019t even know what direction my life is going in despite having goals, I just don\u2019t know how to organize the way to get there, and I just feel so damn lonely and cold doing anything makes me feel miserable because it feels like I\u2019m not accomplishing anything. I live alone, in a dorm (I have no idea what happened to the person I was supposed to room with). I honestly\u2026just hate myself. I was close to checking myself into calling a hotline the other day. I couldn\u2019t believe myself. I just, don\u2019t think I can do this anymore. I know this sounds like desperation, but I just don\u2019t know how to pull myself up by the bootstraps anymore. I don\u2019t know how to be happy just by myself anymore. I don\u2019t want to be so damn lonely, and yet, and yet I am. I just am\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nTl:dr - FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKK", "author": "asianboyopoyo", "created": 1631318726, "retrieved": 1632841105, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"hcdlgca": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/plwqws/honestly_i_just_feel_like_crying_myself_to_sleep/hcdlgca/", "text": "Thank you u/asianboyopoyo for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Its okay to feel worried/stressed/ lonely. College can be so overwhelming.  What year are you in? I think maybe joining a club you're actually interested in might help with the socializing part... and also don't hesitate to call the hotline if you are in a bad or worse place.
