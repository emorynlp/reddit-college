  "text": "I checked into my financial aid portal today just to see what I got for winter quarter but I noticed it says I'm on aid suspension? i never got an email telling me i was on it and no reason are listed in the portal? I feel like that would be a VERY important thing to let me know. I'm not sure why I switched from Pre-nursing to medical assisting but I've already gotten my aid for this quarter.",
