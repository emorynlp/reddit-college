  "text": "Hello friends\n\nI want to rant about my current situation with college. First I am broke and I don\u2019t have many college friends. I have 1-3 that I am close with and I can trust. I have told that I\u2019m not putting enough effort to make friends and that I\u2019m a loner. It bothered me to the point where I was meeting too many people in a short time. Not know if they are even good company. I don\u2019t like the rush and pressure I\u2019ve put on myself. As I sit here in my living room (where I sleep) I think about the negativity I\u2019ve caused for myself. \n\nI have a lot of urgent stressors that are caused me a lot of chronic pain. I don\u2019t know how I will cope with them given that they require money. I\u2019ve faced a lot of barriers in my life being the middle child and coming from a dysfunctional family. I\u2019m trying to stay positive as possible. \n\nI\u2019m very socially and mentally exhausted by all the pressure. I have high functioning anxiety so yea. Don\u2019t get me wrong I am very excited to go back in person but.. I\u2019ve been dreading it lol\n\nAll of this with COVID is very draining my soul lol like I should be enjoying my youth. Because of my background after your twenties it\u2019s all kids and husband etc. I think it would be difficult to enjoy myself. \n\n\nLast words of encouragement, guys it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not getting the \u201ccollege experience\u201d because maybe it\u2019s not for us. Those of us who didn\u2019t get the chance to make new friends. It\u2019s over hyped tbh because not everyone you meet in college is your friend. People have made it a massive deal about making connections. The truth is, it\u2019s probably not the best time due to COVID, anxiety is to the roof etc. Ofc you can always make more of an effort but it\u2019s about your comfort zone don\u2019t ever feel pressured. \n\nI\u2019m giving advice I should take lol\n\nThat\u2019s all lol",
