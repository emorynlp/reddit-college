One is an associates program at a private institution where the tuition is extremely high ($50,000 for the whole thing) and the other is a bachelors program where the tuition is significantly less ($18,000 for the whole thing). I applied to the bachelors one and was accepted. Now that I\u2019ve been accepted and see the out of pocket costs for different things, I don\u2019t think I can afford it. My husband works while I do school so we barely make enough to pay for bills and food as is. Before the first day of school I\u2019d have to shell out almost $1000 out of pocket which is more than my husband makes on a paycheck most weeks. Trying to pay for all these things would literally leave us homeless and starving. The bachelors program is at a pretty prestigious school where typically the people that attend come from money already. I, however, am dirt poor. I had a back up plan for an assisting program closer to my home for if I wasn\u2019t accepted, but now I think I should just do that option anyways. I was going to take out loans to help pay for things, but I\u2019d only get so much for being an undergraduate and it\u2019d be about enough to cover tuition and some of the supplies (supplies cost $7000). The assisting program I was considering would leave me debt free, they don\u2019t allow loans to be taken out because tuition and supplies can be covered by FAFSA. With assisting I could hopefully get out into the work force and save money and maybe even find an office that would be willing to help cover some of the costs. If I got into the program once I could definitely get in it again especially having experience a second time. I\u2019m writing this here just to vent. I\u2019ve spent the last two years working on prerequisites just to apply. I was so excited to have gotten in but trying to pay for these out of pocket costs and survive just wouldn\u2019t be attainable.", "author": "risingsun113", "created": 1620841433, "retrieved": 1632842482, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gxvnc28": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nauoah/i_got_into_my_dream_school_but_its_so_expensive_i/gxvnc28/", "text": "Thank you u/risingsun113 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I was a senior in high school I got accepted to a university I really wanted to go to. Unfortunately it was 22-30K a year (tuition, housing, everything else). I applied to fafsa and only got 5500 loan so I had to go to a community college and continue to live at home.\n\nThis year I am graduating from community college. The pharmacy school I want to get into does not require a bachelors so this upcoming fall and spring will be my last two semesters of undergrad before I start pharmacy school. I am taking classes from both community college and the university I was accepted to so I can afford to pay out of pocket and avoid loans at all costs. I might have to get a second part time job as a lead tutor (tuition reimbursement babyyy). I already work as a pharmacy technician so that helps too\n\nIts scary because I will be taking biochemistry, calculus 1, cell biology, and anatomy and physiology this fall semester. Even scarier that the pharmacy school I want to get into is like 30K for tuition by itself. Im not really poor or anything because I live with my parents but by the time I get my white coat im going to be broke", "author": "TheRapidTrailblazer", "created": 1620858757, "upvotes": 2}}}
