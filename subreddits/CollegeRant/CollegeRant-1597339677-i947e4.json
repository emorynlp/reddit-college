This makes any online process so much more tedious, and being constantly surveiled doesn't help at all.  Plus, like you said, it's a huge privacy violation that we're expected to just accept.  \n\nI know people will hate me for this, but I think probably one of the best ways to combat cheating is just make the tests harder.  One of the reasons cheating is so easy is because hundreds of thousands of exam questions are in a database somewhere, and professors often don't have much part in writing their own questions.  They just choose questions from a database and then are flabbergasted when students find the answers online.  I think if institutions really want to prevent cheating, writing very difficult exams is a way to do so.  I understand that students would be upset, but it's easy to curve a grade.  I had one class last semester like this.  The exams were extremely difficult, and most of us were struggling to get barely above 60% on exams, with many of us barely scraping by with 50%.  But with the curve at the end, 50% was the minimum passing grade, so it all evened out.  To me, this makes the most sense.  Having a test that's a little \"too hard\" for most average students is still ok.  You can still use it as an indicator of progress, just with a different scale (the curve).  Also, this class was pretty hard to cheat in and the homework was hard to complete, even with full internet access.  I have seen lots of students complaining about stuff like this, and I don't think the complaints are warranted unless there is not a curve (in which case designing an incredibly difficult test is probably a bit unfair).", "author": "intoxicatedMobyDick", "created": 1597348208, "upvotes": 10}, "g1cyj8w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i947e4/my_school_is_requiring_web_cam_and_browser/g1cyj8w/", "text": "If you have an Android phone, there's an app called DroidCam that will let you use your phone as a webcam so you don't have to buy one.

Everyone will do this and it will likely be unsuccessful, but playing ignorant can help.\n\n3) Look for the worlds shittiest, blurriest webcam at like 480p or less. Alternatively smear some fucking Vaseline in the lens to blur it up but go easy so its not so obvious.\n\n4) Gather up as many angry students as you can and start a petition or social media page trying to go after the school for privacy violations.
