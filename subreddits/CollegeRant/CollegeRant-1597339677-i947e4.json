  "text": "I don\u2019t mind the anti-cheat program, but I don\u2019t like the idea of being stared at directly or listening to me while I do a test. \n\nPlus my computer is a Desk Top with no web cam, so I\u2019ll have to buy one. \n\nAlso not too keen having a camera in my room that can be activated without me knowing. Just bothers me down to my core. \n\nDoes it bother others? I\u2019d like y\u2019alls input as I\u2019m considering dropping out for a few semesters until people can return to classrooms. In the meantime I can go work and begin paying my loans.",

      "text": "Honestly the most irritating thing for me is that the majority of my professors are older and generally very technologically iliterate.  This makes any online process so much more tedious, and being constantly surveiled doesn't help at all.  Plus, like you said, it's a huge privacy violation that we're expected to just accept.  \n\nI know people will hate me for this, but I think probably one of the best ways to combat cheating is just make the tests harder.  One of the reasons cheating is so easy is because hundreds of thousands of exam questions are in a database somewhere, and professors often don't have much part in writing their own questions.  They just choose questions from a database and then are flabbergasted when students find the answers online.  I think if institutions really want to prevent cheating, writing very difficult exams is a way to do so.  I understand that students would be upset, but it's easy to curve a grade.  I had one class last semester like this.  The exams were extremely difficult, and most of us were struggling to get barely above 60% on exams, with many of us barely scraping by with 50%.  But with the curve at the end, 50% was the minimum passing grade, so it all evened out.  To me, this makes the most sense.  Having a test that's a little \"too hard\" for most average students is still ok.  You can still use it as an indicator of progress, just with a different scale (the curve).  Also, this class was pretty hard to cheat in and the homework was hard to complete, even with full internet access.  I have seen lots of students complaining about stuff like this, and I don't think the complaints are warranted unless there is not a curve (in which case designing an incredibly difficult test is probably a bit unfair).",

I think that you're probably somewhat right for classes that aren't science/math related.  \n\nI'll have to disagree on the subject of focusing on nurturing.  I think some classes have that purpose, but my focus in a class is on learning.  I don't care how it makes me feel, and to a certain degree, if you're gliding along in a class and not struggling at all, you're not learning (or at least not as much as you could be).  That, to me, is a waste of money.  If I wanted to pay to be nurtured, I'd rather go to a counselor or something of the like.  Again, this is all my perspective, and I'm very goal-oriented.  I didn't go to college for the experience, and I sure as hell didn't want to pay $20k+ a year for a \"fun time\".  I don't think that's worthwhile.  But others might, and that's certainly alright.  However, I do think math/engineering classes should be very much focused on pushing the student, and not focused (necessarily) on well-being.  At that level, the student is responsible for their own well-being.  If the student is not happy being pushed at the rate they are, then I think it's their responsibility to find a different major.",

It\u2019s examining my current abilities and figuring out ways I can use those to work through certain situations. It\u2019s engaging in humility by asking professors for help so that I can actually learn. It\u2019s doing things because they\u2019re fulfilling and not just so you can say you did them.\n\nIt\u2019s an umbrella, to me at least. And it\u2019s part of fueling yourself to face challenges, and I still think part of university should be contributing to growth as a whole person (which once again, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the professors themselves are coddling and doesn\u2019t at all mean lack of challenges...in fact, asking for help is a huge challenge for many people).

I'm also not a huge fan of the entire college/education system, and I tend to dislike education strategies that require me to rely on others to succeed (i.e. going to professors, tutors).  This is probably why I was not as successful in the system.  I stopped going at the end of my junior year, and have just been working in software development since then.  Again, this is because I do better by just pushing myself and stressing myself out a little bit.  I can certainly understand others who don't like that strategy, and that's totally fine.

I had to take classes in my shared bedroom in a tiny apartment so there was no place to be without someone else in the background, and I didnt want to violate their consent by recording them without permission (which is technically illegal in some places, its an argument you could try to make, not sure if its much of a strong argument though)\n\n2) Get a webcam privacy cover/electric tape, put it over the webcam. \"Sorry I don't know why its not working\". Everyone will do this and it will likely be unsuccessful, but playing ignorant can help.\n\n3) Look for the worlds shittiest, blurriest webcam at like 480p or less. Alternatively smear some fucking Vaseline in the lens to blur it up but go easy so its not so obvious.\n\n4) Gather up as many angry students as you can and start a petition or social media page trying to go after the school for privacy violations. Push most of the (well deserved) blame of online school cheating to be on course+test design flaws (answer banks, objectively true memorization problems, access to open book will be available in real life, etc)",
