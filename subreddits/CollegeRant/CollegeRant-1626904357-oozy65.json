Already I felt so behind compared to my peers. I\u2019ve been in community college for 2 years now and I\u2019ve been taking the basic courses because I absolutely had no idea of what I wanted to do, tbh I still don\u2019t.\n\nBut recently I\u2019ve decided that I have in interest in marketing. So that means that I\u2019ll be getting my associates degree, but I know how many people say that it\u2019s worthless compared to a bachelors degree. Honestly I haven\u2019t even thought about transferring schools and that whole process. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do after community college. What am I supposed to do in the time being since barely any company will only hire someone with an associates degree? \n\nit\u2019s just so much schooling and it seems like it never ends idk. I feel like I JUST got everything on track but now I have another thing to worry about. Always feel like I\u2019m wasting time", "author": "jonesbrooklyn773", "created": 1626904357, "retrieved": 1632841738, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h61zwmg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oozy65/community_college/h61zwmg/", "text": "Thank you u/jonesbrooklyn773 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you decide to get a BA or BS, many of those credits will likely transfer even if you decide to go another route.\n\nI don't think you need to have your life planned out, the classes your taking now will help guide you to your niche.
