And don\u2019t get me wrong, that sucks. No one is denying you that. In fact, everyone acknowledges that. Your hometown put up banners around town, your mom and dad had a yard sign outside, and the university is letting you come back to live on campus before anyone else. \n\nBut please, for the love of God, accept that this is life. And yes, it sucks, and you\u2019ll never be able to make up for lost time. But everyone in college is losing milestones and years of \u201cthe best years of your life.\u201d Don\u2019t try to \u201cout pity\u201d someone with things that happened almost a year ago, in a different city, in a different school. \n\nIf we\u2019re partners in a group project, don\u2019t tell me the reason you couldn\u2019t do your work was because you were out with friends, and then use \u201chaha high school class of 2020!\u201d to guilt me. Or get mad when a senior brings up they won\u2019t be on campus for their last semester and are graduating into one of the worst job markets in US history, saying \u201cwell at least you got three years of fun before covid...\u201d Or start petitions because even though there\u2019s a pandemic, you think your class ONLY should be given special privileges on campus. And next time someone shares how they have to take out more loans because they lost their part time job, just listen. Don\u2019t bring up how your senior trip to Disney got cancelled and you didn\u2019t get a refund.\n\nI\u2019m sorry high school and the beginning of college didn\u2019t go to the way you wanted it to. I understand these are formative years and milestones you\u2019ve looked forward to. But please be kind to the people around you, because we\u2019re missing things too. And if you would stop crying you didn\u2019t get a dance party with fluffy dresses, maybe you\u2019d feel more connected to the campus because people could then take you seriously. \n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to find your place as a freshman; it\u2019s harder when you distance yourself from everyone/make them uncomfortable with your constant complaining. I say this part frustrated, but also part lovingly, because this mindset isn\u2019t healthy: You\u2019re in college, start acting like it and move on from high school.\n\n(I recognize this is not everyone in the class of 2024. However, even my friends who are freshmen agree this is a common and toxic mentality.)\n\nTL;DR: College class of 2024 needs to realize they aren\u2019t \u201chigh school class of 2020\u201d anymore and actually try to move on if they want to feel welcome at college, not just fish for sympathy because they had an objectively bad senior year.", "author": "throwaway354420", "created": 1611006245, "retrieved": 1632842841, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"gkijabx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l04le2/hs_class_of_2020college_class_of_2024_needs_to/gkijabx/", "text": "Also, can we stop with the whole \u201cdon\u2019t get upset about missing out on college!

I am still loosing out on things to this day: \nI have had my first semester of Uni online, (which was meant to be a mix of online and in Uni). I have not been able to meet people or get to know my class mates properly. I hoped to do so over the Christmas break, and meet up with friends again but guess what? my country went into another Lockdown. So I lost out on that completely. I haven\u2019t been with people really since March. It freaking sucks. \n\nUntil the day that we stop loosing things comes we will still feel the losses. I think we have every right to feel how we feel wether that\u2019s being upset, angry or isolated and so on. Because it\u2019s still very real. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that people should wallow. What my point is that feeling sad or angry at the situation at times is understandable especially as they continue to loose out on things. \n\nEdit: I changed and added a sentence or two to better articulate my tone.\n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure that people outside of my year are even completely content with the way things are.

But once junior year hit they were just concentrating on getting their life on track so that they could graduate and have a plan post graduation. Ya it definitely sucks, especially since universities aren't handling COVID well. Like, at all. But at the end of the day you're not missing out from prom, you can make things happen with friends who you actually have a close connection to (because I KNOW that you've probably lost contact with people who were your best friend in high school), and you can actually focus on school without the distractions around. I know college is shown as being this fun experience. But honestly, even before COVID it's not lol it's stressful as fuck and the only fun happens if you split up time you could be using for studying to do clubs or if you party.
