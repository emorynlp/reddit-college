Don't lose time, go after the things you want or you risk regretting missing out for a very long time.\n\n>i know partying during a pandemic isnt smart\n\nYou're probably in your late teens or early twenties and healthy I guess? Get vaccinated and enjoy some parties like they're your last party ever. All best champ!", "author": "themo98", "created": 1630836077, "upvotes": 3}}}
