  "text": "This is about my best friend who is taking a course with me. And I\u2019m so mad that this happened.\n\nThis course is a \u201ccore\u201d course in our program and we have the Department Head as our professor/instructor. \n\nWe knew there was going to be a major test at some point in the semester. The professor only released the date today, instead at the beginning of the semester like our other instructors did. \n\nIt\u2019ll be happening 2 weeks today.\n\nMy friend has a scheduled surgical procedure with a neurosurgeon since mid-October, which will happen on the same day as the major test. \n\nShe has notified every single professor that it will be happening and if she can be given accommodation, whether it be more assignments before the surgery, or re-weighing to the final projects. All of them said yes.\n\nAll of our courses are somehow all project based and no final exams, just midterms.\n\nWhen she emailed the professor about it and what she can do (along with proof that the surgery will take place), the professor today said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I cannot change the date or make an alternate format. Please try to complete the test before or after your procedure as it will be open all day and due at 11:59 PM.\u201d \n\nNeedless to say, she immediately contacted the Dean today. \n\nEven if the Dean does something, it should haven\u2019t come to this point I feel.\n\nHer surgery is early morning (I think she said it was at 3:45 AM). THIS SHIITY ASS HUMAN ACTUALLY EXPECTS HER TO DO A TEST AFTER A 5-HOUR BRAIN SURGERY? She has a freaking tumour (not malignant, and not immediately life threatening, thank god).\n\nThe professor, which should be a smart person, seriously cannot come up with an alternate format within 2 weeks?\n\n**Update (05/11/2021)**: The dean has replied to her and with her permission, she allowed me to quote it:\n\n\u201cThis is a very special circumstance where University policy will apply, for which not one faculty can supersede. \n\nUpon conferring with your academic advisor and program coordinator, we have decided to instruct your professor to split the exam weight accordingly between all of your assigned components.\n\nShould any further issue arise, please send me an email.\n\nI hope you recover well from your neurosurgery.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m very surprised that they responded rather quickly (less than 24 hours).",
