      "text": "My rough start was because the intense anxiety of everything basically changing overnight once I moved into the dorm made me physically ill. The only thing I really learned about myself was just how much my nerves could make me feel terrible, which I guess is useful, but honestly, I would rather have felt good enough to make new friends and not freak out about classes. So fully expecting it would have been better for me.",

Folks with anxiety would definitely benefit from a play by play of what\u2019s very likely going to happen so they could have a game plan. We spend sooo much time in our heads with some interesting \ud83e\udd28 scenarios! At least I\u2019ll speak for myself. I wonder how many writers have anxiety and just know how to productively apply what\u2019s in their head...",

              "text": "First of all, to clear up any confusion: I do not have any diagnosed anxiety disorders, I haven't been prescribed any anxiety medication, etc.\n\nI had only experienced this kind of physical reaction to stress once before, in my senior year in high school, and it wasn't as intense or long lasting. I have experienced it several times since, but never as badly as it was then. Unless something very drastic happens, I doubt I'll ever feel it again.\n\nWhat caused the most stress for me was, ironically, the couple days of Freshman orientation between moving in and classes starting. We were always being shunted around, visiting different buildings, going to this or that speech by people in different positions in the college administration, talks about how to not drink alcohol (which everyone ignored), ice breaker activities, mandatory fun/social events, etc, and there was no time to just slow down and chill until late in the evening each day. As an introvert, that really disrupted my ability to settle in, and constantly having to go through the greater part of the day with big groups of people and no time for introspection was very exhausting and nerve-wracking. By the end, I didn't feel any more comfortable about going to my first day of classes than the moment I arrived. In brief, Freshman orientation needs to chill because not everyone is an extrovert.\n\nProbably not all colleges are like that, though. I remember there being a feedback survey at the end of the orientation stuff where I reported my discomfort with how orientation went, but I doubt they changed anything. Things actually got better for me a few days into classes as a routine set in and I could find more time to myself.\n\nAs for writing, I get nervous just writing in a private journal. Although weirdly enough, I usually didn't have much problems with essays for classes. I guess it's because I'm putting more of myself into a journal. I don't know how authors do it.",

                  "text": "Ohh that\u2019s great to hear that feeling didn\u2019t persist throughout the year. Yes unfortunately Orientation staff and student staff are made up of majority hyper extroverted people. It took me too long to recognize how most college programs are geared toward extroverts. I personally feel bad how I must have made introverts feel during many of the programs I did over the years. I\u2019m glad you provided feedback after orientation was over. It\u2019s definitely worth adjusting the format to accommodate different personalities and cultures too.",
