      "text": "I'm unsure if it helps, but there might be an option to do some paperwork that, if approved, would ultimately excuse you from having to complete some credits.\n\nMany schools have options to override nearly anything, including credits that are otherwise requirements for specific programs. Overriding 18 credit hours would probably be asking for a lot, especially with upper-level courses, yet maybe requesting an override for six or so can be doable. If applicable, your advisor might be familiar with the processes and success rates in that.",
