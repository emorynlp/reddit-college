  "text": "\nI\u2019m pursuing engineering degree, and this is my first year. Although My university is not that good in ranking, it is known as one of the most competitive in my country. At this moment, I\u2019m struggling and I think I\u2019m having depression and anxiety due to many reasons.\n\nI have tried to reach out for help from psychologist in my college, but there were no answers. I have just found out a psychologist per students rate is 1:10000, which mean there are only three of them in charge for 30000 students. This year, due to COVID19 and online studying, there are approximately 800 students who having an anxiety, and I didn\u2019t feel surprised why the psychologist not answered my calls.\n\nNow I\u2019m really depressed, and I think I not going to make it in this situation. Should I consider dropping out to a less-competitive university, or maybe just started again next year?",

      "text": "Seek help from people who care about you!\n\nSo what I think is, psychologists are there to manipulate your mind in a good way, that makes you feel better about yourself and comfort you of how things going to be okay, professionally of course. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean they are the only one, during this time maybe try talking to your best friends/bf/gf/ family members who understand what you are going through. They don\u2019t even need to understand, it is a good feeling to have someone on your side during the bad time.\n\nIf you feel like you can\u2019t make it through this college, importantly, even without depression then maybe you should drop, else, maybe this is just momentarily and you still can hold onto what you want and not destroy it during a moment of weakness (no offense, we all have those moments). Good luck!",

Really, it\u2019s up to you what you want to put yourself through for an education. It\u2019s not for everyone.) The semester is almost over. Reach out to friends/family, let them know how you\u2019re feeling, get support from those who love you. Get to the end of the semester and think it over again from there. Take time to find a therapist to talk to even if it\u2019s not through the school. Best of luck.",
