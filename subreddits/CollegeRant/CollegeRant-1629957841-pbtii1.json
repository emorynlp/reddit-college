I'm about to start my second year of computer engineering, and I just retook my first year exams for the 4th time. I only passed one of them, and I had an even lower score on the other exams than my previous attempts. \n\nWe've had to study from home for the past year and I have terrible focus at home so that might also be a factor. I just don't know if I should change programs to something easier cause I feel hopeless and like the dumbest person in the world since it's going great for everyone around me.\n\nI'm not sure how I'm supposed to study for all the exams I have left, considering new classes start next week. It just keeps piling up like a mountain on me. It's embarrassing to about to be on my 5th attempt as well...\n\nTL;DR: Motivation and hope gone cause I can't pass my exams", "author": "Slayzee", "created": 1629957841, "retrieved": 1632949033, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hag1tw2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbtii1/i_cant_pass_my_classes_no_matter_how_hard_i_try/hag1tw2/", "text": "Try talking to your doctor, there might be some mental issues causing this.", "author": "Foxyboi_", "created": 1629997161, "upvotes": 5}, "hafjk0z": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbtii1/i_cant_pass_my_classes_no_matter_how_hard_i_try/hafjk0z/", "text": "If you know that computer engineering is really what you want to learn about, then stick with it. If in the future you feel the need to change programs, then do so if you can. However, consider the following: \n\nCollege is hard especially if a student isn't really interested in his/her program at all. That being said, there's no shame in changing your program. But you do have to think it through. \n\nThe embarrassment is all in your head. Everyone else is going about their businesses. Sure, your friends may find out about your 5th attempt. So what? We fail, we get back up. That's being human and living life. There will always be people doing better than you. Also, there will always be people doing worse than you. Lesson? Focus on yourself. Be kind to yourself while you're at it.   Don't always beat yourself up for mistakes. \n\nYou passed one exam, that's already one less to study for. \n\nAs for your exams:\n\nRight now, I believe your focus should be knowing what exam questions you could not answer, and then learning how to answer them. I say this because you've had 3 chances at the exam to have prepared for the 4th time around. \n\nRest every now and then. If there's a hard topic you don't know, and the exam's coming up, then focus on what you do know. Study more on that to get a passing mark. \n\nIf you fail, face the failure with courage. Be sad about it if you must, but move on. Moving on and learning from failure is the key to college. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Now is your time to make mistakes, compared to making a lot of mistakes at work. \n\nOnline classes are also hard, I know. But watch this on youtube: \"Marty Lobdell- Study Less Study Smart\" it's a one hour video, but it can help you on your focus on studying. \n\nTL;DR: College is tough. Be tougher, and get educated. Watch the video!  Best of luck!", "author": "_knowrad", "created": 1629989866, "upvotes": 3}}}
