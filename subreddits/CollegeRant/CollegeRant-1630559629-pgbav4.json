  "title:": "Second week into the semester and I'm exhausted already",
  "text": "I forgot how exhausting classes can be when they're in person, but regardless I'm thankful they are not online. It feels like I have even more work than I did when things were online, which was then more work than I had my first semester and a half of in-person classes. \n\nI'll be honest, I'm ecstatic to learn in-person, see friends, drop in on professor's office hours, attend cool events, etc. I'm so happy to be back on campus; just the atmosphere is great. I'm just drowning in work right now. A lot of my classes are high level and it is a little overwhelming. I feel like online classes enabled me to be lazy and skimp on classes here and there, but in-person classes allow for none of that. Like I said, I'm so happy to be back on my campus and am so grateful (especially since many people are still online). I'm just very, very tired. In fact, I had a little breakdown about how tired I am today lol. \n\nI'd love to join a club, but right now it is unrealistic. Basically, I walk to campus which takes me about 20 minutes, get there before classes so I can look over notes and my schedule for about an hour, then have classes and my school job 10-4:30 pm most days with maybe an hour gap after a couple classes. I stay on campus late some days to do work with my friends or go study in the library. It's just a lot of stuff when I didn't do most of this the past year and a half \n\nAny advice on the adjustment? Anyone else struggling with adjusting back?",
