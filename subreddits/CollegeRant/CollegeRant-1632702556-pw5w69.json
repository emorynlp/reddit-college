We have half an hour classes everyday in the morning, except on certain days, and honestly that is v less smol time compared to the hours my friends, who are also in college, have to undergo. I know that you might be thinking that I'm lucky for not having hours and hours of lecture, but that's not really true. I haven't really learned anything about my program with these short ass classes. It's just 30 minutes of, *let's wait for your classmates,* or, *how are you*. And it's shit cause they're dumping so much activities on us. We have about 11 subjects now, multiply that by at least 5 assignments where you're required videos and essays, also include 3 quizzes every subject for that week, you get *at least* 88 activities due within or by the end of the week. I know time management and all but that's still a lot of bullshit for being us who're literally clueless on what tf we're supposed to do, how this stuff is going to work. We're paying a shit ton of money for 35-minute classes and facilities we don't even get to use this school year. I'm starting to get academic burnout and we're still a month in the first semester. I don't know if longer classes = more shit learned, but I'd really prefer that cause the professors and instructors would actually be teaching something. I'd honestly want to drop out if I had the chance to, but so much time would be wasted, and the family would be so disappointed in me. I'm the eldest child so I have all this pressure added on the burden of this shit ass school.", "author": "redfrenchleather", "created": 1632702556, "retrieved": 1632948400, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
