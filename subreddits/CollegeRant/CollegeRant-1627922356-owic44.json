I\u2019m an incoming freshman taking up Architecture here in the Philippines and as many of you know, this major really cost a lot because of the materials. I manage to get into a public university so tuition is not a problem but it\u2019s still going to be hard for me because of the school supplies. \n\nU see, I can\u2019t say were poor because we have no debts, and were not struggling to make ends meet however my mom is the only one working for us and this school coming she has 2 college students to support to.\n\n\nThat time when my mother told me how much she will give me for my school stuffs, I immediately thought of temporarily stopping my studies. It was not even half of what I will need.  The second thing that came to my mind ofc was to try to fit the things I needed to my mom\u2019s budget but no matter how I chose the cheapest stuffs or used ones, it\u2019s still not going to be enough. The next option would be to look for a part time job but it\u2019s not even possible because of the pandemic and not to mention I live in a rural area and there is limited job openings here \ud83d\ude1e\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t want to tell my mom that it\u2019s not enough, because I know she\u2019ll try to make a way to give the things that I\u2019ll need. She\u2019s working abroad for a decade now and yet she barely has savings which will be spent in her vacation this coming october. I really don\u2019t want to add up to my mother\u2019s burden.\n\nAny architecture students here who are experiencing the same problem? Why not share it here. I just want to feel that im not the only one like this.", "author": "Imsobrokekillmenow", "created": 1627922356, "retrieved": 1632949161, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"h91jwc3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/owic44/i_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_mother_architecture/h91jwc3/", "text": "Any chance you still have those savings from your senior year? If yes, use them now. If not, approach your relatives for help. I firmly believe that you don't need that much money to buy stuff for one school year. 1k to 2k is enough, in my opinion, to help you for 2 and a half year, if you know how to work things around.
