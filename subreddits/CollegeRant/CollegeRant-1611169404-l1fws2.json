The reason being is that the previous semester didn't go well for me. I had to drop a course as well as barely scraping by the rest of my courses. The classes I'm taking right now will be much more difficult than last time and retaking the class I dropped last time isn't going to make things any better. It feels very weird retaking a course, I never thought this was ever going to happen to me at all.\n\nI'm also not feeling any motivation whatsoever because I'm not enjoying my major at all, but it's too late to change my major now. The major I'm doing right now will not lead me anywhere in the future either.\n\nI'm already behind in credits and I have to take summer courses to become a senior the upcoming school year. I initially planned for 18 credits this semester but the fact that I had to drop a course last semester (from 15 to 12 credits), I decided not to overload with 18 credits this semester.\n\nI can't focus on studying very well. I've been taking notes, doing my homework, been trying to pay attention to my professors, go to offices, checked YouTube videos online, but nothing is working for me. My Internet is slow as well, there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nMy GPA doesn't keep improving either, it just literally stays the same. It's currently a 3.03, with the last two semesters being exactly 3.0. I'm having the feeling that this semester could get worse for me, which could make my GPA become lower than a 3.0, to the point where I won't be able to afford for college anymore.\n\nAt this point, I have no clue what I'm actually doing in college anymore. I'm just feeling like I've been sacrificing myself in college since day 1. I don't get how most people think it's easier than high school, it makes no sense to me. I don't think college/university was ever for me, to be honest. It was never a place I wanted to go anyways. It's literally making me miserable right now.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Third year, pessimistic about the semester, lack of care and motivation, not enjoying my major, issues with credits towards graduation, poor studying habits, concerned about college GPA and money in the future, doubting college is for me.", "author": "-Sky_Nova_20-", "created": 1611169404, "retrieved": 1632950698, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gk8yc3w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l1fws2/i_have_no_idea_why_im_still_in_college/gk8yc3w/", "text": "I am a junior but have a shit ton of credits from going to university while also in highschool.

Get mediocre or bad grades, watch it just completely plummet. \n\nAnyway, personally I wouldn't give up just yet.
