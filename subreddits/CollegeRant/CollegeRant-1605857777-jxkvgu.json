I'm a senior so that part makes sense. What DOESNT make sense is that the professor has only 4 graded assignments. 2 tests, a midterm, and a final. All of which are 30 multiple choice questions a piece. \n\nAs you can imagine, we cover a LOT between tests since there's only 3 of them aside from the cumulative final. So when we get tests, we have a month or more of information crammed into 30 multiple choice questions. And these aren't things directly from class and they don't cover the discussed material very well. They're critical thinking questions that require you to know the information inside and out.\n\nI know what you're thinking \"just study and go to office hours\" well here's the kicker: he LOVES to cancel class and office hours the week before tests and just say \"read up on such and such\". And asking him questions is painful. A student asks \"I was just wondering what X has to do with Y like I get X causes Y but how does that happen?\" and he replies \"well so we uh we- we covered X last class right? So X does such and such and then Y happens\" Which really doesn't answer the question. He skims information and expects us to know things he spent decades studying. It's a perfect case of he's too smart to teach others.\n\nThis of course isn't the only class I'm taking this semester and it isn't even the only class with so few assignments. But other classes with so few assignments at least see the flaws that come with that approach and curve every test or allow us review days before the test. His response to unanimously low test scores is \"well if you did bad, maybe it's not the field for you\" no dick, we spent the last 3 years going to school for this, your single class isn't a good indicator of our capabilities or interests.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that he's DEEP into research right now which probably means he's putting that above teaching.\n\nThis turned into quite the rant, I apologize.", "author": "moseph999", "created": 1605857777, "retrieved": 1632843482, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gdhxu95": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jxkvgu/professors_that_base_entire_class_grades_on_less/gdhxu95/", "text": "I'm from the UK and it is incredibly normal here to have - on average, 2 assignments per class. 50% each.

It's clear they just don't want to do much grading over the semester. But at least give weekly automated tests or something. At least that would give students practice. But I guess that would include having to make a test wouldn't it. I had a class that had 3 tests. 3. That's it, made up your whole grade. Two were before the drop date, the last one was at the end of the semester. I ended up dropping the class once I got a 61 on the second one then took it with a different professor during the Summer and got a B. Fuck lazy professors.
