Besides the given problems from Zoom University, I am really burnt out. But I have burnt out a while ago before this even happened last year. What if the reason students are burnt out is from the BS general education classes we have to take?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember my freshman year, I was required to take this useless gen eds I was not interested at all in. These classes were hard for no reason and professors seemed to be out to get you. In my theatre class, my midterm and final were over 150 questions. Questions included a random fact he said once during a lecture and didn't relate to the actual material. In addition, I had to take other gen eds (such as calc) where I had to teach myself it. Also, the emphasis on exams in these classes and less personalization led to me having a lot of stress freshman year and sophomore year. The teachers seemed to be out to get you and as a result, I was overstressed trying to learn the material and do well. Now I am just burnt out and really confused in my classes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else relate?", "author": "Chocolate_Chips_", "created": 1615226043, "retrieved": 1632843410, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"gq8glva": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m0lhyh/the_secret_reason_why_we_are_all_burnt_out/gq8glva/", "text": "Thank you u/Chocolate_Chips_ for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now, if you\u2019re not stupid, you can see how dumb that really is. It\u2019s really meant to milk all the money they can from you while you\u2019re forced to attended college. \n\nMost degrees can get done @ most, in two years. Medical fields take a bit longer because let\u2019s be honest here, we want to have faith in our doctors..\n\nBut, computer science, etc can really be a two-year degree. Instead, you\u2019re forced to take a shitload of classes that don\u2019t matter. For example, history. If you can tell me when the fuck I could use history as a computer science major, I\u2019d love to know because as of right now, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry but, I could give less than a fuck about how Germany sucks, how much China sucks, idc. I want to go into computer science specifically to do computing not to worry about two countries that lack relevance to my interests. \n\nI\u2019ve wasted two semesters on history classes. The tests were incredibly hard for no god damn reason. The professor made me want to wish I was dead and it made me really think about what the hell I\u2019m doing with my life. \n\nThe college system is run by a bunch of greedy bastards that made knowledge profitable. It put a price tag on something everyone should be able to access. The one thing that history taught me is that, long ago, college was hard to get into and prestigious because most people weren\u2019t educated and because, there was no access to internet. \n\nNow, most people are educated & we have access to the internet. Everything you learn in college comes from a course, program, quizlet, etc that can be found online for free. You\u2019re essentially paying a money machine for something that is already free. Think about it. Think about how long you\u2019ll be in debt for. All the money that you pay for college goes to the pockets of people who live a better lifestyle than you. For lack of better wording, they\u2019re swimming in money while you have depression, thoughts of suicide and anxiety. \n\nNotice how you\u2019re paying the same amount of tuition for less resources being provided to you. They now that a piece of paper is valuable due to the stupidity of our social structure. They know. They use this as a way to drive up costs while you or whoever is breaking their backs trying to pay to even attended. \n\nWe need to start holding these assholes accountable. The price of college should never be to the point where you\u2019ll be broke. It should be manageable. It shouldn\u2019t be a company stealing money out of people\u2019s pockets. It should be a place where you go to learn without feeling like you should die. \n\nThe system is broken. People who support it are part of the reason why. If you support it, you\u2019re an idiot. If you don\u2019t support it, contact whoever the hell can make a change (preferably a congress member) and as a collective group, try to seek change.", "author": "majoroofboys", "created": 1615269978, "upvotes": 4}, "gqa4dth": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m0lhyh/the_secret_reason_why_we_are_all_burnt_out/gqa4dth/", "text": "I think 90% of the reason I\u2019m burnt out is from non-class related bs. Filing financial aid and checking in on a regular basis to make sure it was processed & disbursed correctly. Fact-checking student advisors and constantly navigating administrative errors.

Feeling no joy in almost being finished because then I\u2019ll be looking down the barrel of student debt - not being able to purchase a home and move on with my life until that\u2019s dealt with (or let it grow vastly out of control thanks to sky-high interest rates). \n\nSome issues may be more exaggerated for me than others since I\u2019m in a nursing program which comes with it\u2019s own set of bs. But by-and-large, I\u2019ve been dealing with all of these issues to some extent since long before this program. \n\nSo frustrating that I should feel so happy & relieved to finally almost be done with college, but instead I feel dread for needing to deal with all the fallout that being in college has caused me.", "author": "EverydayQuestions-", "created": 1615254261, "upvotes": 3}, "gq9o7se": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m0lhyh/the_secret_reason_why_we_are_all_burnt_out/gq9o7se/", "text": "They need to reduce the amount of required gen eds.
