  "text": "That is like telling a kid who is failing classes that it is okay to drop out. It comes off so rude and out of touch. Many people who never been to a party really do want to drink and have fun.",

And you don't necessarily need alcohol or to go to party to have fun. \n\nAlso, you previously mentioned that you took shots before when you went to a few parties. So I don't think it's fair to keep telling people you have never been exposed to alcohol in all your alts.",

That\u2019s rich!!!\n\nGiven your well known impulsivity and anger management issues, and the fact that you are only 19, is it any wonder that you can\u2019t find anyone who wants drink with you? Plus you are super inconsiderate and demanding.\n\nNo one wants to babysit a drunk SNOOROAR.",
