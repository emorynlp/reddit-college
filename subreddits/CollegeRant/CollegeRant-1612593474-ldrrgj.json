I'm honestly glad I was dropped. I also have A.D.D. and I was really struggling. Things like a messy space frustrated me too. The racing thoughts of possibly not doing well didn't help either. I couldn't focus at all. Idk when I'm going back but I definitely feel like this break is necessary for my mental health. I realize in college you don't have much time to yourself, but maybe taking at least a 10-20 min break or longer doing something that sets your mind at ease may help.
