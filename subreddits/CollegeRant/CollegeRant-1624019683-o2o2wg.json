  "text": "so the class i\u2019m in rn requires lockdown browser for quizzes and exams. i\u2019m fine with the time limit, environment check, browser restrictions, etc. what pisses me off with lockdown browser is that you can\u2019t move between pages. it\u2019s like if you don\u2019t know the Q, you can\u2019t skip and come back to it. you have to answer first before moving on. i doubt this will deter cheating because a normal exam in person would allow people to skip and come back. the features of a time limit, webcam, browser restriction is already sufficient in and of itself to deter cheating IMO.",
