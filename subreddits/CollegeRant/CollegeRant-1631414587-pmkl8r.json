I have a 4 month old and work full-time so was trying to ease back into how many classes I can take. Since I'm just taking one, I also chose a topic I wasn't really looking forward to:  Individual Income Tax.\n\nEach week we have a MyLab chapter study module, HW, quiz, and a tax research problem essay, then discussion posts every few weeks before our exams. Am I friggin crazy or is that a shit ton of work to have due every week?!?! I'm not sure if I just already am at capacity with the rest of my life going on, but I swear my other classes normally never had this many assignments. Essays have always been a struggle for me so having one due every week is really making me **hate** this class, **hate** my professor, and **hate everything**. I have literally no time to genuinely read or study the chapter because all my school time goes into solely working through the assignments. Will not be surprised at all when I fail my first exam next week. UGHHH!\n\nTL;DR - 4 assignments (1 being a research essay) due each week. Isn't that a shit ton? I hate it and I'm drowning. Drowning actually sounds better than writing weekly essays. With so much work, there's no time to actually study and learn anything!", "author": "sexystringbean", "created": 1631414587, "retrieved": 1632948575, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hda2cie": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pmkl8r/weekly_work_overload/hda2cie/", "text": "Yeah, sometimes it feels like one class if you were to do all the reading, all the assignment, watch the lectures, and study it would amount to like 20-30 hours a week.", "author": "AintNobodyGotTime89", "created": 1631928007, "upvotes": 1}}}
