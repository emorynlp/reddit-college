  "text": "Can't tell if it's another potential ADHD marker or cause I'm graduating. Can't get a dx cause psychs have horrific waiting lists and the specialists charge out the ass. Then there's the fact that I have to start kissing ass through my resumes cause I graduate this December. I literally have no interest in the other two classes outside of creative writing that I need to pass. I'm going to bed to scroll until I knock out at 5 AM again.",
