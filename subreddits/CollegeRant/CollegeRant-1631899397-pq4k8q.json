HMU if you are able to participate.\n\nHi everyone, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but hope it\u2019s worth the try. \n\nI am looking for people who are willing to do a focus group interview on zoom for my marketing research class. We will talk about shopping malls during the pandemic, and how we can help improve them. I am hoping to get at least 4-5 individuals (the more the better \ud83d\ude09) to be able to have a meeting somewhere on either September 24 or September 25. You do not need to be an expert or have any certain traits to participate, all are welcome. Unfortunantly, I am not allowed to give any compensation since that is considered cheating for this project.\n\nIf you would like to participate, please pm me or comment when you are available and I can try and make a time that works for everyone. Once I got the specific date and time, I will send the zoom link to you before the meeting date. Thank you.", "author": "Unfair-Connection543", "created": 1631899397, "retrieved": 1632948502, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
