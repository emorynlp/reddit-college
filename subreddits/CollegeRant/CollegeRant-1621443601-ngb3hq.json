I thought that I was going to get a good grade for this class at the end of semester. However, there was this group project that I did and I thought that only one person had to turn it in the group, but I was wrong and got a zero. I feel so numb and disappointed in myself. I emailed the teacher about this and he said, \"The team member who does not submit the documents by the due date will receive a ZERO grade.\" My school this semester is doing a pass/fail this semester (thankfully). Meaning that my credit will be counted, but my GPA will not be affected. I think what got me is that the hard work I just put in and this one assignment just duked it. I just needed to rant. That's for hearing my story.", "author": "Djgogi059", "created": 1621443601, "retrieved": 1632842347, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 293, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gypu97q": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ngb3hq/i_got_a_d_in_my_class_because_of_one_assignment/gypu97q/", "text": "Thank you u/Djgogi059 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It seems like such an odd technicality to take away FULL points from your hard work. Can you explain that you completed the project (and what parts you did) and that you feel it is unfair to receive a 0 on an assignment where you worked equally as hard as other students? You could also say that other students on the project could vouch for you. I could understand a minor deduction in points for not reviewing the submission policy but this just seems mean and overly punitive.", "author": "Appropriate_Froyo", "created": 1621451504, "upvotes": 117}}}
