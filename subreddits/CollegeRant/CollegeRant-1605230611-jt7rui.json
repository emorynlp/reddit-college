I'm in PTA school, it's hard as fuck  and I feel like I've been dipped headfirst into hell.  I want to drop  out and be an author (I'm working on publishing my third book in a  series).  I can't market my book series like I should be, why?  I'm  always studying.  I am overloaded with so much homework I can barely  function.  I'm having panic attacks, can't sleep, sleep too much, or  feel like I want to die at least three to four times a week.  I can't  say this to anyone else.  My husband is counting on me to graduate to  help him out financially.  I've been a stay at home mother of three for  the past few years.  So, I'm trying to juggle raising kids, keeping  house (which I do a horrible job at), homeschooling my oldest, and  homework.  Where do I have time to do the things I want?  Nowhere,  that's where.  I know my husband works hard, and I'm trying to match his  effort and not complain because he's such an awesome man.  I just feel  like I'm drowning.
