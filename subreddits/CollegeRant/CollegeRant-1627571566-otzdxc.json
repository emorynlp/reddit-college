I was trying to clear my transcript ADT information. This situation has not been resolved since June and it is July . Mine you I am about to pay my tuition, housing and meal plan. I called yesterday and they told me that they received my transcript and I was fine and I had right information. One hour later I get an email from same person saying I am missing the ADT in the transcript.  I have also called admissions to check again if it is the right information, I have getting different answers from everybody. I resubmitted the final transcript but I am just confused. I have been having anxiety and having slight depression because this process just sucks.", "author": "Wide-Iron8830", "created": 1627571566, "retrieved": 1632949173, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h72uvlh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/otzdxc/worse_admissions_office/h72uvlh/", "text": "The only reason I am complaining about this process is both my community college and my other college is being ridiculous slow this year and it is for no good reason.", "author": "Wide-Iron8830", "created": 1627650725, "upvotes": 1}, "h72onpy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/otzdxc/worse_admissions_office/h72onpy/", "text": "?
