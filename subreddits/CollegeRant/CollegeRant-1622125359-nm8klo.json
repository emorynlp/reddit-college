I\u2019m taking a summer course and my professor literally gives me 1s for no reason even if i follow his methodology. Why do professors not understand that teaching isn\u2019t about knowing the material. It\u2019s way more about effectively delivering it in a way that somebody with minimal background can learn it. Anybody could just repeat facts and say for an explanation \u201cbecause that is how it is\u201d but it takes an actual teacher to be able to explain it at an understandable level. \n\n\nTl;DR: Summer school killing me and sometime the teacher is just not trying and it screws students.", "author": "ezmoneysnipez", "created": 1622125359, "retrieved": 1632842306, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gzn1974": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nm8klo/why_is_college_like_this_even_during_the_summer/gzn1974/", "text": "Thank you u/ezmoneysnipez for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's about effectively dlivering it in a way that somebody with a **solid understanding** of the course's prerequisites can learn it. \n\nIf someone's walking into the course having brain-dumped everything they learned in previous courses because they didn't ever actually learn it and just crammed right before the final or something, no instructor could possibly be able to make up for that. They're there to teach you their course, they can't be expected to also teach you the dozens of other courses that lead up to the course while we're at it. When I'm teaching 3rd year Solid Mechanics, I can't also be teaching people basic algebra or calculus or trig or vectors. They need to know that stuff, and if they don't know it well enough, they need to bring themselves up to speed on it.", "author": "BarackTrudeau", "created": 1622134841, "upvotes": 59}}}
