  "text": "Like you know should feel proud that you manage to finish the semester off strong, but at the same time you're confused about you how your barely proofread, mental breakdown fueled paper managed to get a perfect score?\n\nSeriously. Do I just think that poorly of myself and my writing abilities and psych myself out that badly? \n\nWas everyone else's papers so horrible that mine looked that mine looked really good by comparison? \n\nDid my professor even read the paper or did they hurry up and just skim through and say \"sounds good I guess\" before slapping an A on it? \n\nWhy can't I just be happy for myself :/",

Heck on one of my final essays I barely proofread and I did it all last minute so that surprised me. For some reason I think our professor have turned down their difficulty on grading. Maybe cause this semester has been a wreck and they just decided to pity us. I hope this isn't true cause I hate when professors or teachers go easy on us.",

I was so depressed that term because \u2018Rona and I was back home and I was recovering after almost dying in February that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to pay  attention in class or read more than 100 pages of the 500+ pages assigned to us in 3 different books. Ended up writing the paper in 3 days on the shared trauma of a country and relied heavily on my psych classes instead of this class. Professor gave me an A and asked if he could use the paper as an example because it was \u201cso unique\u201d. Felt like I was flying that day.",

We all were saying, \"I think I deserve a 80% or 90%,\" and at the end of class, he asked us why we didn't grade ourselves better. He was one of those professors that made the rubric clear, and if you followed the guidelines and expectations, you got 100%. I think especially right now, we aren't expected to have fool-proof essays. If you followed the rules and clearly tried, you deserve the A. They can't knock off points for you not being an expert yet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I once had a professor knock off points for me agreeing with a reading, because I wasn't an expert in the field until I have a PhD. Since then, I never allowed my assignments to look like I knew what I was talking about, and I've gotten As! So I say take what you got and don't ask too many questions:-)",
