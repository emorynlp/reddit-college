      "text": "The lack of communication between proctorU and some professors is very frustrating. We could use notes on a midterm and the Prof. Didn't tell proctorU. After showing them a print out of the directions they tried to make me take my notes out if my spiraled note book. No go bro, literally over a 100 pages in notes! It was a wild ride. They also tried to stop my test a dog outside started barking.",
