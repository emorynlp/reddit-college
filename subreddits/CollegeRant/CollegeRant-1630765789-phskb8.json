I really think I've found something I really want to pursue: paralegal studies. I've gone to both community colleges and typical four year public universities. The differences are ridiculous, and bottom line: adjunct professors are absolute bullshit. They don't write their own assignments, they just follow some kind of template.\n\nFor example: I'm taking a Law Office Technology class and we are assigned to do some eLearning for software related to timekeeping and billing. The assignment says to complete TimeMap 4. So you go to the portal and there is no TimeMap 4. It's been updated to TimeMap 6, obviously the \"professor\" has no idea. Oh and guess what? TimeMap has nothing to do with timekeeping and billing, it's an incident timeline graphic creator for litigation.\n\nAnother one: Another class, Legal Research, has you use a free version of an otherwise expensive citation book. The free version will have inconsistencies and say to do one thing then give an example that runs counter to what how they said to format in just the previous paragraph. Then on the quizzes, the \"correct\" answer is counter to the proper format. When I notify the professor she admits she doesn't even write the quizzes! And she's aggressive in her responses.\n\nI'm just so irritated, what the hell are students paying for? For some jackass to copy and paste crap as a source of additional income when they can't even care to review the material?\n\nCounter this with this example: Years ago I didn't realize what class numbers mean and accidentally signed up for a 300-level class. The professor says here's the syllabus, you can read it on your own time. None of this hand holding crap on how to add a header into Word. His PowerPoint slides actually served to complement the lectures, not just get read off of. He actually wrote his own lectures and his tests weren't some copy and paste crap you find on-line, they were essay questions he actually wrote himself. He could actually back up his lectures with real life personal experiences related to the material. He was a great teacher and I feel that's how a college class should be.\n\nI'm just frustrated and venting but thanks for reading. Anyone else have a similar experience? I'll have my associates in paralegal studies by the end of Spring 2022, so I'm just gonna hang in there.", "author": "the_budding_dawn", "created": 1630765789, "retrieved": 1632951559, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hbq22yt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/phskb8/so_irritated_with_community_college_bs/hbq22yt/", "text": "I just started an online paralegal certificate class. I'm old and already have a bachelor's degree, and just about enough credits for another. So I feel your pain. I already hated college students and certain community college instructors (\"OK kids, today we are going to learn about 'metaphors'.\" and \"Nobody understands this big word [hint: it wasn't] you used in your story.\") when I was in my 20s though, so there is that.\n\n\nOne of my favorite professors was like your 300-level class--no handholding. He was terrifying, and I loved him. He didn't suffer fools.\n\n\nI haven't had enough experience with my online CC class yet to judge the quality of the instruction, but I was looking for a place to complain about the quality of the work posted in the group discussion. Now I know why I got such good grades (when I wasn't flunking for non-academic reasons). It's very rare that people are reading the assignment and following the directions. And the writing. Ouch. I think sometimes I just got good grades because I can write and follow directions, regardless of whether I knew the material.\n\n\nI really do feel better about my academic prowess though. And since I work full time, I know if I need to half-ass any of my work, it will still be pretty good. In traditional college, I did the work, didn't talk in class (and got dinged for it), and had no idea about the caliber of the other students. So I am actually finding the experience enlightening.\n\n\nTake heart you are probably smarter than your professors and will go far in your new career?\n\n\ntl;dr Can't comment on my CC instructors yet, but CC in general is making me irritated at humanity and encouraged about myself.", "author": "Estie_Quidiness", "created": 1630871353, "upvotes": 2}, "hbmwtlb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/phskb8/so_irritated_with_community_college_bs/hbmwtlb/", "text": "Adjunct professors aren't really professors.
