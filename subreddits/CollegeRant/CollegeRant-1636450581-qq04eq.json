  "text": "I just got back from my monthly crisis about if I chose the \"right\" major or not. I feel like no matter what I choose, there's going to be overwhelming competition that's going to eat me alive, that no matter what I pick I'm going to end up either a, destroying my fragile mental health, or b, be unemployed for who knows how long, or c, all of the above. I will always be overworked and underpaid. I will always be fighting against people who deserve these jobs just as much as I do, maybe even more. Everything will just going to go into more extremes the more the years go on and no one gets a break and I just want to stop growing up.",
