I panicked and emailed him thinking it was an error. Turns out he didn\u2019t seem to see any of the papers I turned in (he had a beat up cardboard box in front of his office where he wanted students to drop off their assignments) and luckily I had them saved on my computer still. Because of that he marked them late and changed my grade to a C. I kept saying that I turned them into the box but he seemed to accuse me of not paying attention to his directions on where to drop off work. At the time I just relieved that I was able to pass his class so I didn\u2019t say anything else after I received the C. Although it\u2019s been 3 years, I still get ashamed of seeing that grade on my transcript.\n\nHe also had this weird rule where we don\u2019t know our grades until they\u2019re posted after finals so I thought I was doing alright but I guess not\u2026.\n\nMy college also has a grade scale where a C- and below is considered failing\n\n\nIs it too late to do anything about it?", "author": "nooraameliesaetre", "created": 1625472348, "retrieved": 1632950921, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h46wnft": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oe2jt8/prof_gave_me_a_barely_passing_grade_c_after_he/h46wnft/", "text": "Is not too late to complain. It may be too late for anyone to care enough to do anything about it. Given that it is bothering you, go ahead and complain. Start with the department chair.

The professors practice of putting a box out to collect homework is extremely problematic. Anyone can steal or view others\u2019 homework, which means he should not have docked you for late homework.
