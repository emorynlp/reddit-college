I'm a junior chemistry major with a 4.0 GPA so far (emphasis on the so far; P. Chem is killing me right now), and the people I know say I'm \"so smart\" because of my solid work in the classroom, but at risk of sounding dramatic, I constantly feel asinine. I spend hours on assignments that are supposed to take 30 minutes, leading to time management issues. I do well on tests because I work hard to study for them, but I retain almost none of the information a week or two after. Ask me practical applications of the stuff I'm learning, and I'll be useless. Despite trying to work methodically and reading up on procedures beforehand, I make incessant mistakes in lab that truly tests the patience of my peers and professors. \n\nAnyways, just feel like a fraud.

What sets me apart is I\u2019m really into learning so I take 8 hours mastering concepts for one class and then the other and another. I study so much every week that I never have to study for midterms or exams because everything is fresh in my mind. \n\nI don\u2019t feel smarter than anyone, I just take the time to take in all of the information that I\u2019m required to go over. My point is, I guess that\u2019s all we need to do right now while earning our degree.
