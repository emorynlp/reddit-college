  "text": "My father is literally always finding reasons to get mad, yell at me, and make me do work. He doesn't believe that I have stuff to do in class. He doesn't believe that I have *that* much work with 17 credits, 2 extracurricular clubs, and a research program, both clubs I hold board positions in. He doesn't believe I have meetings. He doesn't believe he should be quiet because I'm probably not studying or doing work.\n\n\nMy mom asked him to be more sympathetic because classes are starting now. He said \"bullshit, as long as he lives here he does what I say. I know he's not always on his laptop doing work, don't defend him. He needs to work on his time management skills.\"\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t listen to my Physics lecture at all today (no live lectures just videos) so I wasted 2 hours for nothing.\n\n\nI don't know how I'm going to survive this semester.",

      "text": "**edit: just saw you said you don\u2019t want advice, please disregard my comment.** I\u2019m gonna keep it here though in case someone else might find it encouraging idk. \n\nI\u2019d recommend that you email your professors to keep everyone in the loop! I dealt with something similar when campus closed in March and I got sent back to live in a toxic and abusive environment. My parents would only stop around 11 when they went to bed. That\u2019s when I could finally focus and work, so a lot of times I had to save all my work until then. I just let all my professors know that my home situation was a bit rough at the moment and that I might need turn things in at 3 am instead of 11:59 and that i would try to let them know in advance. They were all very respectful and seemed glad I kept them in the loop. I actually got a lot of good advice and messages of encouragement from a few of my professors and it felt good to know someone was rooting for me, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t end up needing to get extensions more than once, but I\u2019m still glad I reached out. It might just help your peace of mind, and you don\u2019t need to get that deep or personal into your family situation. You might also consider stepping back from certain clubs or extracurriculars IF they aren\u2019t making you happy and are just stressing you out. If they are making you happy then keep fighting for your right to privacy and peace and quiet! I wish you luck.",

I\u2019m showing you because I want you to understand that I am trying my best to succeed, but I need the time to do so. I would also print out the course descriptions, as most college have a recommended study time per week, per class. Add that up for him and show him on paper. That adds up to more than a full time job.",

Not to mention midterms and finals. Assuming each class is about 3 hours of lecture or lab a week, that's 15 hours in lecture, and then way longer on studying, and on any assignments or projects they may have. If you're actually trying to get high marks then it's easily equivalent to a full 40 hour work week + overtime. OP has enough stress and pressure, to take on the responsibility of moving out and working to pay for it would be suicide",

If I was in a hostile environment at home I would try moving away for a few months if possible.\n\nYour father should respect your privacy/time when your in college, since you're pursuing education which your accumulating debt anyway and will have to pay pack later on and stress from that high of a loan. \n\nHe should leave you be and let you do your thing, and not be all up your ass 24/7. Its your future to get a degree so don't let him make you struggle to go along that route and make it hell for you.",

And though my father should do those things, in his eyes he can do know wrong and he\u2019s a perfect father, and I\u2019m the problem. That\u2019s how a narcissist works.\n\n\nMy sister has been going to her friends house to avoid the home drama so my dad installed a chain lock on our front door (so even if you have a key, if the chain is locked from the inside, you need someone inside the house to unlock it). I have no doubt that if I start leaving home a lot he\u2019ll intentionally lock it to dissuade me from leaving. He did it to my sister already and I opened the door for her. In his words, \u201cif you want to go to your friends house don\u2019t even bother coming home for the day, stay at their house.\u201d\n\n\nSorry if this sounds rude, but I\u2019m not looking for advice. I can\u2019t do anything about my situation. I can only wait it out, try my best in school, and then move out and get a therapist and an apartment or something. I just wanted to vent to make myself feel better. But I appreciate you reading and commenting on my post :)",
