He doesn't believe that I have *that* much work with 17 credits, 2 extracurricular clubs, and a research program, both clubs I hold board positions in. He doesn't believe I have meetings. He doesn't believe he should be quiet because I'm probably not studying or doing work.\n\n\nMy mom asked him to be more sympathetic because classes are starting now. He said \"bullshit, as long as he lives here he does what I say. I know he's not always on his laptop doing work, don't defend him. He needs to work on his time management skills.\"\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t listen to my Physics lecture at all today (no live lectures just videos) so I wasted 2 hours for nothing.\n\n\nI don't know how I'm going to survive this semester.", "author": "StoicallyGay", "created": 1598742155, "retrieved": 1632843459, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g4dc2nb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ij254a/i_cant_have_a_single_hour_of_silence_at_home/g4dc2nb/", "text": "Is your father a college graduate?", "author": "no_flimflam", "created": 1599508568, "upvotes": 1}, "g3rzg4j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ij254a/i_cant_have_a_single_hour_of_silence_at_home/g3rzg4j/", "text": "Is the library in your town open ?

I dealt with something similar when campus closed in March and I got sent back to live in a toxic and abusive environment. My parents would only stop around 11 when they went to bed. That\u2019s when I could finally focus and work, so a lot of times I had to save all my work until then. I just let all my professors know that my home situation was a bit rough at the moment and that I might need turn things in at 3 am instead of 11:59 and that i would try to let them know in advance. They were all very respectful and seemed glad I kept them in the loop. I actually got a lot of good advice and messages of encouragement from a few of my professors and it felt good to know someone was rooting for me, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t end up needing to get extensions more than once, but I\u2019m still glad I reached out. It might just help your peace of mind, and you don\u2019t need to get that deep or personal into your family situation. You might also consider stepping back from certain clubs or extracurriculars IF they aren\u2019t making you happy and are just stressing you out. If they are making you happy then keep fighting for your right to privacy and peace and quiet!

I would also print out the course descriptions, as most college have a recommended study time per week, per class. Add that up for him and show him on paper.

If I was in a hostile environment at home I would try moving away for a few months if possible.\n\nYour father should respect your privacy/time when your in college, since you're pursuing education which your accumulating debt anyway and will have to pay pack later on and stress from that high of a loan. \n\nHe should leave you be and let you do your thing, and not be all up your ass 24/7.
