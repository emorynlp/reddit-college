I needed to take Calc 2 this semester, but there were two classes with two different professors. I enrolled the first course but found the professor's style of teaching to not be a good fit, so I dropped today in order to pick up the other professor. Unfortunately now the other Professor is saying it is too late to add her class, even though the College website says the deadline for add codes, paying, withdrawing, etc. is all on September 3rd (in 2 days). I emailed her today and she just said, \"it's too late to add the class\". I've fucked myself over and now I have no Calc 2 to take this semester. I want to pull my damn hair out. I emailed the counseling department, I even emailed her replying just basically pleading to be added. I really screwed myself over. Completely blew my chances of transferring this semester.

If so, you wouldn\u2019t need permission to drop or add - you would just be able to do it. From what you wrote, it sounds like you\u2019re in that limbo period where you can still add courses but only with instructor permission. If it really is regular drop/add and you can self-select into the course, I\u2019m not sure why you would need her permission (hence my assumption that it\u2019s not the regular period for drop/add).\n\nAs for the last comment about her just not wanting you in her class, I doubt it\u2019s that. It\u2019s probably more that she feels that you might be set up for failure by joining late.
