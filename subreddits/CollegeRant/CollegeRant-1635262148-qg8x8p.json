  "text": "I have no idea what to do. I am doing online college full time, I work part time, making 90 cents above minimum wage. I struggle to make my car payment. My \"major\" is General Studies. I have a paid tuition scholarship for two years (I live in TN). I make okay grades. Some classes I do great. Others I am getting F's. Between school and work, I feel like I have no life. I am living with my parents. I hate college with a passion. I find it very difficult and draining. I feel like I am asked questions all day long. The professors are snarky without offering a helping hand. I want to drop out but I feel like I have so many people helping me and rooting for me and on my side that I am so scared to disappoint them. If I drop out or go part time I lose my scholarship. I don't want to live with my parents forever. I feel like my brother and sister are going to go on and do great things and I am so scared I will be the basement dweller.",

I\u2019m sure that everyone who is cheering you on just wants you to be financially successful and mentally happy. Have you thought about trade school? Being an electrician or plumber or something is such an important (and well paying job).",

          "text": "I have thought about trade school, but nothing really interests me. There is like an office administration course at my local trade school I thought about taking up. My granddad was a master plumber and electrician. My brother is in the military. My mom is a homemaker. My dad works in the financial department for HCA. Because of this whole background, my family will be proud of whatever I choose to do. I just don't know what I want.",
