  "text": "I have no idea what to do. I am doing online college full time, I work part time, making 90 cents above minimum wage. I struggle to make my car payment. My \"major\" is General Studies. I have a paid tuition scholarship for two years (I live in TN). I make okay grades. Some classes I do great. Others I am getting F's. Between school and work, I feel like I have no life. I am living with my parents. I hate college with a passion. I find it very difficult and draining. I feel like I am asked questions all day long. The professors are snarky without offering a helping hand. I want to drop out but I feel like I have so many people helping me and rooting for me and on my side that I am so scared to disappoint them. If I drop out or go part time I lose my scholarship. I don't want to live with my parents forever. I feel like my brother and sister are going to go on and do great things and I am so scared I will be the basement dweller.",

I\u2019m sure that everyone who is cheering you on just wants you to be financially successful and mentally happy. Have you thought about trade school? Being an electrician or plumber or something is such an important (and well paying job).",

My granddad was a master plumber and electrician. My brother is in the military. My mom is a homemaker. My dad works in the financial department for HCA. Because of this whole background, my family will be proud of whatever I choose to do. I just don't know what I want.",

      "text": "General studies doesn\u2019t sound interesting at all in my opinion\u2026and I can imagine you feel the same. You would find college more fun and motivating if you pursued a degree in something you are very passionate about. It takes life experience to figure what your passion is. I\u2019m 21 and attending my first term, after having a mental breakdown in 2019 for undiagnosed bipolar 1 disorder I found my passion was in mental health and psychology. General studies is good, it\u2019s progress. I\u2019m doing a transfer degree atm and even though the classes have nothing to do with my major I know my passion is in mental health and the class will be worth it. Be proud of yourself, and keep pushing through. Talk to a school counselor and reach out to a support group of some kind for struggling students, find resources online or if you have health insurance get a good therapist. It\u2019s okay, you will be okay. We all have our moments in college where we feel like we hate it and it\u2019s pointless, granted it\u2019s what kept me out of college for awhile until I woke up one day and said fuck it let\u2019s do this. Once your scholarship is over take a year off from school. Save some money, travel, go on dates, hang out with friends, get some volunteering done to build on your resume and maybe get into an internship. Take some time to think about what you want to do before you go back. Just push through until you get that break, winter break is almost here you got this! Don\u2019t give up, you\u2019re so close. Anyone would kill to be in your position to have a free college education. We did this exercise in class a few days ago making a list of things we HAVE to do, when we wrote down that list is felt like a drag. At the end of class we looked over the list and we wrote why we were thankful for the things we have to do. For example I have to do college, but I\u2019m grateful that I have an education and can pursue my dream career. I have to work, but I\u2019m thankful that I get money because it helps me pay bills for things that I really like having. Don\u2019t give up, you got this! Keep pushing through and once your scholarship is over with take a break and live a little and then go back. College will always be there. Believe me after working a minimum wage job for 2 years it really opened my reality that I didn\u2019t want to be a waitress for 30 some years, with a college education you can pursue your dream job. The investment is worth it.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your input, I greatly appreciate it. I also have manic depression. I am currently unmedicated by choice because I was gaining SO much weight. I am scared to go to therapy again because therapy makes me feel so broken. My current job is a front of house person for a bakery. I also do a lot of gruntwork there. I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I don't know what I like to do. I have a hard time exploring hobbies and I didn't do so much growing up. I tried putting a study group together for a class I ended up dropping anyway. Nobody wanted to do it with me. I don't have a lot of friends, I am just not the girl anyone wants to hang out with. I am sorry if it sounds like I am wallowing in my own self pity or complaining, this is kind of just how my life is right now. I agree that college will always be there. I also agree in trying to finish out my scholarship. I would hate nothing more than pay money to fail.",
