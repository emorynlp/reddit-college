      "text": "I felt the same way during my weed science class (incredibly boring class)! But keep in mind that knowing how deep roots grow or how tall the shoots grow is an important factor when trying to maintain or get rid of plants. It may not seem relevant to agriculture engineering right now but if you have to develop a piece of equipment in the future, then depending on the function you'll need to know plant specific information. I do agree with you that it's rather inefficient to have to memorize all these plants if you have no intention of working in grasses in the future. I tried to look at my weed science class from a more general perspective and remembered the things I thought were most relevant to what I wanted to do in the future.",
