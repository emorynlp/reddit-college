  "text": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of being all remote, not living a normal life or not having a spring break, but college is become more of a struggle each day.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get out of bed in the mornings. I don\u2019t even want to go outside. I loathe sitting through lecture. Homework and other assignments take much longer to complete. I cry about three or four times a day. All I want to do is drink or sleep. I\u2019ve lost passion for hobbies that I once found fun, etc.\n\nI think school has a lot to do with this. School has been rough, and even thought I sleep about 8 hours a night, I still feel fatigued, tired, and dreadful. I eat healthy too, but it doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAnyone else having these problems or anything similar this semester? I know we only have about four weeks left, but it\u2019s going to be a struggle finishing this semester strong.\n\nLet me know if you agree with me on any of these things and tell me what else you\u2019ve experienced this semester too. My DM is open and everyone is welcome!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nBest,\nStruggling college student.",

I just keep telling myself that it's almost over and that's the only thing that is keeping me going right now. Good luck to us...",

It feels like they put twice the workload too. I got two more years of this shit left assuming I do summer semesters too.\n\nI have two dogs who have to go outside at least a few times a day so I make it a point to use that as an excuse to get outside even if it's my backyard, soak up a little sun, and force a break.",

I've had anywhere between 10-15 assignments total for all classes per week which also includes quizzes or tests in that number. It's been extremely hard to study imo.\n\nAnd tbh I did some of it to myself because some of the harder teachers were guaranteed to help you learn the material if you put in the work so I signed up for them on purpose. Damn if it isn't super rough some days. I'm actually stuck on my final database II assignment and so are several of my classmates apparently.",
