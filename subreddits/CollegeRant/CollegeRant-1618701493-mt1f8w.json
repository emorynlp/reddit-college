I don\u2019t even want to go outside. I loathe sitting through lecture. Homework and other assignments take much longer to complete. I cry about three or four times a day. All I want to do is drink or sleep. I\u2019ve lost passion for hobbies that I once found fun, etc.\n\nI think school has a lot to do with this. School has been rough, and even thought I sleep about 8 hours a night, I still feel fatigued, tired, and dreadful. I eat healthy too, but it doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAnyone else having these problems or anything similar this semester? I know we only have about four weeks left, but it\u2019s going to be a struggle finishing this semester strong.\n\nLet me know if you agree with me on any of these things and tell me what else you\u2019ve experienced this semester too. My DM is open and everyone is welcome!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nBest,\nStruggling college student.", "author": "Wise-Light-1743", "created": 1618701493, "retrieved": 1632842880, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"guwvjou": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mt1f8w/college_is_a_struggle/guwvjou/", "text": "Thank you u/Wise-Light-1743 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
