Education cant teach you how to think, be prepared, or fight through a struggle. Work taught me these things. Work taught me how to push beyond what was offered. Its was because i worked that i learned how to pursue what i needed. When i went back to college late in life i finally had developed the skills and determination to overcome obstacles presented by people and situations.\n\nCollege is not for everyone. It cant be packaged into a consumable. \n\nI will never be good at high functioning mathematics. I had to fight  over and over just to pass a low level algebra class and get my credits. But i needed that to do what i wanted to do, and the fight taught me about myself. \n\nI remember nothing about algbra. But i kept what it taught me about my ability to struggle, to against my own inclination to give up when i was bad at something.\n\nCollege is not a consumable. There are bad teachers. There are bad bosses. There are awful programs and platforms. Same in the workplace. There are people you will have to comminicate with for an end goal, people who deliberately sabotage you, the project, and the work environment. A degree doesnt make those things not true. I wanted it to. I wanted for my education to tell the world I had put in the work and i deserved to have a smoother path. Thats not how it works. \n\nThats not how any of this works.\n\nWhat you *deserve* is to reach in and extract what you need by an means necessary. Some people think that means cheating. A lot of them do. Theybare cheating themselves out of what an actual education means. It means learing to fight in a world that not only hands you nothing, but actively works against your efforts. \n\nYou may think Im full of shit and thats ok. Im saying what i wish someone had told me. Ever. Instead of its the teachers fault, from my peers, and its becuase you are lazy, from my parent.\n\nBoth of those things were factors. But the truth is, when you want something hard enough, nothing stops you from fighting for it. Obstacles just make you grit your teeth to get your way.
