I don't know why people think it's okay for students to shell out thousands for a class where a professor doesn't teach and they should \"take responsibility for your own education.\" Don't get me wrong, yes, students should be taking responsibility for their education. However, if a professor isn't doing his job, then he should be out of a job.",

The entire class was confused on Ch. 2 and made terrible grades on assignments, which was some high level math shit that wasn\u2019t even in the book. She gave us a *YouTube tutorial* to learn it, and I doubt she watched it first. I emailed her about perhaps doing just one zoom class or video since literally everyone didn\u2019t know how to do the high level algebra she wanted us to, and she chewed me out for not going to her office hours and basically called me lazy. Guess who\u2019s on the fence now fellas, for asking a professor to do her job.",

What I really don't understand is why so many bitter angry profs/admins choose to read a sub called COLLEGERANT then go off on every single post that dare rant about a prof/class/school without kissing their ass nonstop and validating how they have the hardest job ever and we shouldn't hold them accountable for doing a poor job like any other employment on the planet. Like, the students are paying at least part of your salary/research funding. Come the fuck on. It's not all about you, we have it hard too. I get you can't force students to learn and we have to take accountability but it is your JOB to teach and sorry bud, teaching is a 2 way street. You can't decide all on your own you taught and your lessons are perfect and your feedback/fuckups infallible if so many of your students are unhappy, not performing well, and most of all NOT LEARNING THE MATERIAL FROM THE WAY YOU THINK YOU'RE TEACHING IT.",

      "text": "While i agree that we should expect a certain quality of pedagogy, education is not a product. Education cant teach you how to think, be prepared, or fight through a struggle. Work taught me these things. Work taught me how to push beyond what was offered. Its was because i worked that i learned how to pursue what i needed. When i went back to college late in life i finally had developed the skills and determination to overcome obstacles presented by people and situations.\n\nCollege is not for everyone. It cant be packaged into a consumable. \n\nI will never be good at high functioning mathematics. I had to fight  over and over just to pass a low level algebra class and get my credits. But i needed that to do what i wanted to do, and the fight taught me about myself. \n\nI remember nothing about algbra. But i kept what it taught me about my ability to struggle, to against my own inclination to give up when i was bad at something.\n\nCollege is not a consumable. There are bad teachers. There are bad bosses. There are awful programs and platforms. Same in the workplace. There are people you will have to comminicate with for an end goal, people who deliberately sabotage you, the project, and the work environment. A degree doesnt make those things not true. I wanted it to. I wanted for my education to tell the world I had put in the work and i deserved to have a smoother path. Thats not how it works. \n\nThats not how any of this works.\n\nWhat you *deserve* is to reach in and extract what you need by an means necessary. Some people think that means cheating. A lot of them do. Theybare cheating themselves out of what an actual education means. It means learing to fight in a world that not only hands you nothing, but actively works against your efforts. \n\nYou may think Im full of shit and thats ok. Im saying what i wish someone had told me. Ever. Instead of its the teachers fault, from my peers, and its becuase you are lazy, from my parent.\n\nBoth of those things were factors. But the truth is, when you want something hard enough, nothing stops you from fighting for it. Obstacles just make you grit your teeth to get your way. And thats personal.",
