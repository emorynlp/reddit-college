Why ramble around about something i dont even understand??? it doesnt makes sense to me like i could easily just copy paste the article and i would still have space to fill, isnt it an abstract????? So should i be fucking furious about how stupid this assignment is? like im gonna try to get done but i just thing its ridiculous.", "author": "roseekilljoy", "created": 1621999509, "retrieved": 1632842316, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"gzh0jy1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nl78u9/should_i_be_mad/gzh0jy1/", "text": "Thank you u/roseekilljoy for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
