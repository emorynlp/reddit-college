One of my classes grades attendance so I log into zoom just to get my credit for it. I cannot sit through a 3 hour class listening to someone with a monotone voice talk about Finance. It does nothing for me. I've taken numerous online courses throughout my college career (I'm now a Senior) and I've done just fine studying on my own, reading from the textbook without any input from the professor.\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with the fact that teachers don't teach anymore. They simply read off a powerpoint that somebody else made. Classes are insanely boring and when I have gone to them, I leave feeling like I just wasted 3 hours of my life.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?", "author": "tropicalYJ", "created": 1599062448, "retrieved": 1632951529, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"g3t958v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/il9j1j/lectures_are_useless/g3t958v/", "text": "The lectures on zoom are basically office hours with the exception that the students are graded on attendance.", "author": "iamsojellyofu", "created": 1599109436, "upvotes": 1}, "g3swxds": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/il9j1j/lectures_are_useless/g3swxds/", "text": "My physics 1 class and cell biology techniques, both of which are fairly difficult classes have decided to both be asynchronous.", "author": "gandreeva18", "created": 1599101758, "upvotes": 2}, "g3sfxli": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/il9j1j/lectures_are_useless/g3sfxli/", "text": "And to make them \u201cuseful,\u201d lame professors decide not to post recordings.", "author": null, "created": 1599092455, "upvotes": 16}, "g3qpqrh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/il9j1j/lectures_are_useless/g3qpqrh/", "text": "I feel the same way mate, especially through zoom", "author": "Charont", "created": 1599067019, "upvotes": 3}}}
