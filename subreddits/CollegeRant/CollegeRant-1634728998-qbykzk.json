  "text": "I'm a commuter and have morning classes (and after that, afternoon classes), so usually I leave my house at 7:30 for the bus. This isn't an issue as I don't mind morning classes. My problem is that I'm gone from home on-campus for 11-15 hours a day four times a week. That means I'm at home by 6:30 PM at the earliest and 10:30 PM at the latest. \n\nIt's not because of classes either, it's because of a Practicum I'm trying to complete now. This is also a duty that extends beyond the semester as well and usually is a year-round thing (although it's not as intense when the Spring semester begins thankfully). It is something I like though, so this is something I may continue doing after this year (the perks get better overtime). \n\nIt's just frustrating having to come home so late some days, then having to shower, and then having to go straight to bed. It's also not frustrating not being able to find a paying job because what I'm doing right now is pretty much the part-time job. I like it, but it can be tiring.",
