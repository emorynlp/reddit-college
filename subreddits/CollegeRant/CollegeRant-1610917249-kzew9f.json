I just had my intro Chemistry course for my engineering requirement and had my butt kicked. Last time I did chemistry was during my junior year of HS. Relearning what entropy was, why spins of electrons affect the way elements interact, and doing redox equations was literal hell. But, as much as I struggle I had \"\\*\\*some\\*\\*\" fun learning everything over again.
