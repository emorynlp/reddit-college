  "text": "I made a big mistake of cheating on my ALEKS math placement exam. All I needed to get was a minimum score and wanted to ensure I met this requirement the first time without having to retake the exam. I am not terrible at math, but I am also not a genius. However, I am pretty sure I could have met the minimum requirement within the 4 retakes, as the required score was very low and the questions were all things I have learned at some point. To be honest I wish I would\u2019ve been able to just take the introductory courses, but now that is not an option. Nevertheless, this still worries me and makes me wonder if I am ready for college and the courses. I am now thinking about deferring admissions and just taking a gap year to figure things out.",
