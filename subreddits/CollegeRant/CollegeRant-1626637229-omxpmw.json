All I needed to get was a minimum score and wanted to ensure I met this requirement the first time without having to retake the exam. I am not terrible at math, but I am also not a genius. However, I am pretty sure I could have met the minimum requirement within the 4 retakes, as the required score was very low and the questions were all things I have learned at some point. To be honest I wish I would\u2019ve been able to just take the introductory courses, but now that is not an option. Nevertheless, this still worries me and makes me wonder if I am ready for college and the courses. I am now thinking about deferring admissions and just taking a gap year to figure things out.", "author": "l0st_in_the_world", "created": 1626637229, "retrieved": 1632841754, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"h5o1dww": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/omxpmw/cheated_on_aleks_placement_exam_and_cant_stop/h5o1dww/", "text": "Thank you u/l0st_in_the_world for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
