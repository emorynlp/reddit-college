  "text": "One of my profs requires us to submit video responses to discussion questions. This would be shit in and of itself.\n\nProblem is, the app she requires us to use for it is glitchy as hell. I cannot get it to work on my laptop and it's annoying to have to submit it on my phone. Also, I submitted the last one and it apparently did not show that it uploaded on her end. So now I have a 0 for an assignment I did. And because the assignment is locked, I have no way to prove that I uploaded the video.\n\nLuckily it counts for a small percent of my grade, but I can't wait for this semester to be over.",

      "text": "I agree. I hate how much we are expected to use technology now. It should not be like this. I have a class where everyone is expected to bring in their laptops and use them in class. Most of the semesters I just used my book and notebook and I did almost the exact same things that everyone else did.  \nEducators are starting to assume that everyone has access to technology AND that those who do, want to use it for academic education. It should not be a necessity and shouldn't be so tied to our grades. I call elitist bs and elitism.",
