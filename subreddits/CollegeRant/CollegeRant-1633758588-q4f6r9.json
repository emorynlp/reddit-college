  "text": "So I have a certain minor which is essentially a mini major and there is one course that is a requirement that is supposed to give us practical experience BUT we are required to take the course for a different (but related field). I wouldn\u2019t complain if there wasn\u2019t already practical course for our field that majors take but we are asked to take the other one instead. It\u2019s kinda like Taking stats for social science and stats for physics, they are both stats courses but one is more tailored to one field than the other. The way the different fields approach projects is different and I didn\u2019t minor in that field I minored in a different one so I feel like I should be taking the one that is actually suited for what I\u2019m minoring in",
