  "title:": "more than ANYTHING else, college severely degraded my mental health during the pandemic",
  "text": "i spent the second year of college at home, during the pandemic. we had to do 36 credits throughout the year spread through 12 courses, plus research for extra credits and internships. and each semester seemed like forever. there was a RAGING PANDEMIC outside and we were all just expected to study, and attend online lectures and do our assignments and pretend like nothing is going on outside. \n\nand while fortunately a lot of my professors were super understanding, the fact is that I've spent an entire year at home, just thinking about all of the things that could go wrong with mine and my family's life at ANY second. i don't even remember the person I was before the beginning of the pandemic. \n\nand sure, I'll blame the pandemic and the people around me and the terrible governance, but more than ALL OF THAT put together, college actually killed my mental health. and now my year's over, and I'm DREADING the next semester because I honestly don't think I have it in me to go through with it.",

      "text": "Drop out here, but this is my view.\n\n\"Pssh it's easy, just be mentally fit and healthy, have high emotional intelligence, know how to study effectively, work full time if you have bad management/supervisors/coworkers, cook, do laundry, pay the bills, be a responsible adult. If you can't do all that well sucks to be you\" \n\nSeriously K-12 doesn't even have a class, optional elective, let alone 5 minutes out of the whole 8am to 3 pm hours to address these issues. \n\nI'm assuming you being a dedicated student spends dozens of hours inside your room everyday studying and reading hundreds of pages of text. I read exercising helps relieve the stress and helps your mental health, I'm still procrastinating on that. \n\nI also read having long term goals helps you see the big picture which can get you through all the shitty days, hours and moments of feeling lost. A life long goal, decade 10 year, 5, yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly goals and schedules. \n\nr/getdisciplined is a great subreddit where they give realistic, practical advice on how to think about hardships. Sorting by top, time and googling keywords + reddit is what I do to find advice posts. \n\nLife is a never-ending journey of leveling up your emotional intelligence and mentality.",
