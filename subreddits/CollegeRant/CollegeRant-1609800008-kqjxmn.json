Big laundry room, but they still require quarters. No worries. Life is good. \n\nUntil you find out you\u2019re living in a den of petty fucking thieves. They\u2019re a friend or maybe friends of my suitemate, in the room connected to our bathroom, I\u2019m sure of it. The one(s) who play smash and probably suck at it. We keep the bathroom doors open for airflow, so that\u2019s how the rats are getting in. I kept the coins on my desk, then my dresser, then behind the damn speaker. They find it every time, And they think they\u2019re so smart. See he doesn\u2019t take too much at once. He plays the long game. He takes the coin I would be most likely to forget existed. They may alternate thieves to throw me off. One time I swear I am almost 100% sure they had the audacity to leave a nickel as a decoy. And you don\u2019t get a nickel when you break a quarter: you get shit. \n\nI\u2019ve lost between maybe six and ten fucking quarters at this point. Luckily the raids only started fairly late into the semester and the misery ended just in time for finals. Now we got a second in-person semester. And I will reclaim my dignity. I have eleven days to plan how to exact my revenge. Also considering getting my roommate on this because he lost a quarter too. Think about it, you really need at least two people to properly waterboard someone. \n\n**tl;dr** I\u2019ll throw a shit sock in with your laundry if you steal my coins again you thieving turds\n\nEdit: Trigger Warning: This is hyperbole.
