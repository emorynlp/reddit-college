Community college was stressful, but in a completely manageable way. I\u2019m used to being awesome student in community college, super organized, excellent work, one of the best in the class, and part of the few who actually cared. Now it\u2019s like no matter how much I plan, I feel like I\u2019m always a few steps behind my coursework. My work doesn\u2019t seem good enough compared to everyone in my class. On top of that, it seems like everyone else is so well spoken when contributing to classroom conversation, and in comparison to them I sound like an anxious airhead. \n\nI know comparing yourself to others is bad and I am really trying to focus on myself and my work instead. I\u2019m just having a tough week and could use some words of encouragement.", "author": "_fuckyodreams", "created": 1630639728, "retrieved": 1632841172, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hbeixh9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgx406/feeling_a_little_overwhelmed/hbeixh9/", "text": "Thank you u/_fuckyodreams for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even though it doesn't feel as good, you can get more out of being the dumbest person in the room than the smartest.\n\nI hope you stick it out, and it feels more manageable soon!", "author": "Rockleshmocks", "created": 1630664070, "upvotes": 6}}}
