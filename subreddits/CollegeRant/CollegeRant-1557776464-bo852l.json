  "text": "Well everyone I quit. Between the loss of 50 hours upon transferring to a university, the bullshit classes, overpriced textbooks, and my general lack of giving a fuck anymore I\u2019m leaving college. My associates in computer programming is good enough for me, I\u2019m worried as hell but so relieved at the same time. Such a huge thanks to this subreddit for allowing me to vent and know that I\u2019m not alone  with all the aggravations and I wish you all the best! I\u2019m rooting for ya\u2019ll.",
