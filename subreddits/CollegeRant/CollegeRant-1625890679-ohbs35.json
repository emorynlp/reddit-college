(Ask me about how much I LOVE graduate school fees...)  And even as we're leaving, if we're moving on to apply to another level of education, we get hammered by the transcript fees.\n\nAs far as hidden fees, the cap and gown cost is the one thing you might have dropped on you closer to the end since they tend to not mention that until that last semester.", "author": "LadyWolfshadow", "created": 1625899905, "upvotes": 43}, "h4o5ycn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohbs35/its_kind_of_absurd_that_i_have_to_pay_for_my/h4o5ycn/", "text": "This pissed me off when I found out I had to pay $120 just for them to print my degree and mail it to me.
