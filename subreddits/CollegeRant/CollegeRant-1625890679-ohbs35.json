  "text": "I mean, it\u2019s the not the end of the world that I have to pay over fifty dollars to get my diploma ordered\u2026 it\u2019s just the principle of it. You would think that, at the very least, a diploma would be free after years of paying tuition.\n\nAnd who knows what other hidden fees are going to pop up as I get closer to graduation\u2026",

We paid it when we applied for graduation and it allegedly covered the cost of the diploma and other \"graduation-related expenses\" (cap and gown was still extra)...for a graduation we didn't have because we were the class of May 2020. \n\nIt really is ridiculous to pay all of these fees just to graduate, although it's kind of not surprising with all of the OTHER fees they use to nickel and dime us into debt.  (Ask me about how much I LOVE graduate school fees...)  And even as we're leaving, if we're moving on to apply to another level of education, we get hammered by the transcript fees.\n\nAs far as hidden fees, the cap and gown cost is the one thing you might have dropped on you closer to the end since they tend to not mention that until that last semester.",
