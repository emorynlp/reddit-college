Has anyone else ever had a similar experience of not knowing grades throughout quarter for the most part? We don't know our grades for homework or labs and we don't know our attendance grades either. Just stresses me out a little cause all I can do is predict \"what if\" situations on what I've gotten (Though I believe I've done pretty well on homework and labs - Keyword *\"believe\"*). Therefore, I don't know how much I need to get on my last chapter test and final exam to pass the class. Of course that won't and shouldn't stop me from trying to do my absolute best on both, but it is a little annoying.
