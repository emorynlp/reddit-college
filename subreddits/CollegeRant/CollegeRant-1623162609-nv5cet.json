My S/O and I had a breakdown about it yesterday and honestly it's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about joining the military just to have some sort of direction and structure. However I'm not saying I recommend doing the same, I believe that this past year has had a mental impact on most people which in turn has led to stress, doubt and depression. If money permits it, I recommend taking a nice long trip this summer where you can avoid the shitty aspects of life and in its place try to focus on you or focus on having some sort of adventure.
