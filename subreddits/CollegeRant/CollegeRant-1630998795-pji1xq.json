      "text": "Oh no they are made broken. Most colleges use crappy third party services (the cheaper the better) my college for example is using a service from a company that provides websites and servers to rural areas and can't handle more then 400 people on them at once. So what happens when 3000 people get on one server all at once? That's right a nightmare.",
