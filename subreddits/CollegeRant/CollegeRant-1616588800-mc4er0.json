  "title:": "Dropped out of college today, best I have felt in years",
  "text": "I wasn't the best student in high school, and I've only done well in one class, my very first Japanese class back in the august of 2019. Ever since then however, college hasn't treated me well, life hasn't treated me well.... my transcript is littered with Bs and Cs and now finally a W. One day after the get 100% tuition back drop date haha... but yep. I dropped it. It all spurred from one sentence in the syllabus, \"No late work is accepted.\" Thats it.\n\nIt's a combination of many factors. The first, being my struggles in my personal life. For the first year of my college journey I lived in a 13 hour time difference between my professors and I for my online classes. That caused a great deal of stress when it came to deadlines, and became even greater stress when professors wanted to have \"check in\" zoom calls with me. This past November that time difference closed, but not without great headache. I was in the middle of one of my online classes, when I had to pack up 3.5 years of my life in one week, a decision I had no choice or voice in. I had to take a plane to a different continent on a Thursday, and begin rebuilding my life in this country again. Thankfully, my professor at this time was gracious and gave me an extension on my school work.\n\nThe second, is the current climate. Myself, my parents, and the rest of my family are at severe risk of being infected with COVID, and experiencing the worst of it. Everyday of the past year, I have worried over my family's health. Most recently, my aunt and her family contracted it. This news has devastated me in way I did not imagine. I am fearful of every phone call... Wondering if... you know. Thankfully, this is the first time it has presented a current risk to my family. We went a year with one very minor infection, though that isn't the case this time. It is incredibly stressful, has been incredibly stressful.\n\nIn this time, of quarantine and COVID19, where those who are not as lucky as I am, have lost family members to COVID, I personally had awoken to the fact of how meaningless this is. Not meaningless, as education does have meaning, but how seriously professors take their classes. My time in college, beyond my language courses, I was taking my gen eds. And in this time, I had a professor that took Humanities 100 incredibly seriously. In a pandemic. Where day after day, as people we are confronted with our own morbidity. Yet as students to these professors, as our entire lives have changed from how we live daily life to the fact we have lost family members forever, they still treat their classes as if they are of paramount importance. As if isolation has not taken a very harmful toll on students minds.\n\nI cannot stand it. Frankly, this thought process disgusts me. Professors present such a blatant disregard for the wellbeing of students. A disregard for the humanity of those who take their courses. This is a product of a broken academic system, a system that after 1 year of a global pandemic, has seen no reform.\n\nThe third factor is similar as stated above. I don't feel valued as a person to my professors. I know in college, with the amount of students they teach and all.. yet. I have present mental health issues even before COVID that worsened. These professors are products of spending their adult lives in a competitive academic bubble. The way professors have left feedback on my work did not leave any encouragement to improve. It was never in a way that made me rethink how I phrased my ideas, no, it left me doubting the purpose and value of my ideas and contributions. It made me not want to contribute, since the person meant to help me build up these ideas into something purposeful makes me feel like it is worthless. I know professors are not cheerleaders, however professors speak to students, the people that pay and rely on these courses for professional and personal advancement, as if we are less than dirt. They speak to students with nothing but clear and evident disdain for our very existence. When I read my paper feedback, I did not feel encouragement on rethinking how I write in order to make my ideas clearer. I felt like my ideas were worthless, they did not deserve to be written out, and there was no hope for salvaging them. As so often we are taught on the internet and in real life to treat others with respect.. professors somehow except themselves from that. I've had multiple professors say things in a blatantly cruel way, offering no further explanation to their reasonings for say the things they do, even though the assignment theyre leaving feedback on has the sole purpose of being there so we can improve. I sought answers on the internet as to why my professors treat me the way they do. And that answer? \"Thats just how academia is, get over it.\"\n\nI enjoy learning. I am passionate about many subjects, subjects I was excited to take courses on, to further my learning, to hear from peers with similar passions. My major, when I had one, was related to a major passion of mine that had many topics within it that made it the only foreign language with a masters program at my university. The course descriptions were exciting and I could not wait to take them.\n\nAnd yet, in my gen ed classes... the only thing I learned that academia isn't for me. I learned that I won't put up with professors disrespect for students, their obvious disdain for students. I learned that I deserve better treatment, that I won't get when I take classes at this particular uni, hell, probably at all institutions. What I learned outside of classes, when I was researching things related to my passions and interests, educating myself on that, I learned what I truly liked. I connected with peers of similar interests. I could pursue the information I wanted, the information I needed. When I was just searching up more information about a given topic related to my interests, I learned how to find resources for myself. I taught myself a second language, on my own out of nothing but pure passion.\n\nWithdrawing from this class, this is not the end of my educational endeavours. Instead, I am pursuing it all while job hunting and continuing to educate myself. Continuing to pursue my passions. And now, free from the environment of college, I can still facilitate discussions with and learn from those around me and those I connect with. Now, I am free from the hateful eyes of my professors. I am with my peers, where one is not valued higher because one has a tenure and one is devalued because they are a pupil of the other. Our ideas are not callously shot down, disregarded and devalued. My peers, where we recognize, acknowledge, and value each others humanity. My peers, where we understand the struggles of the pandemic on our mental health. My peers, where there is a mutual respect.\n\nThis is is something I was denied by many of my professors. Maybe it is my particular institution, who knows. But now, I am off to job hunt, continue my self education, continue connecting with my peers of similar interests, and regain my humanity. Remove a stressor from my life. Focus on valuing my family and the moments we spend together. Maybe one day I will return to academia. Maybe one day I will finish my degree and be able to pursue the dreams of mine that require it to accomplish. Maybe I will be satisfied with my life freed from this. Who knows. All I know, in this moment, despite my extreme hurt, I am free.\n\nThis is a decision that is made with many tears. This is a decision that has brought me the most peace I have felt in years.",

      "text": "I agree with so many points you made!! I learned so much from my community college and trade school, even in gen ed classes. I think gen ed classes are a waste of time, but having good professors made it fine. In the single year Ive been at university (engineering school) I havent been taught a single thing from my professors. I had to resort to free Youtube videos because the professors who are getting paid dont care about teaching.\n\nAlso, professors at my university still treated students awful, even with a small class size. My community college professors wanted to see me succeed while my university engineering professors just want research money. No encouragement at all from them.\n\n>\"Thats just how academia is, get over it.\"\n\nI see this so much, even in subs like r/engineeringstudents. I dont get how this is tolerated. It blows my mind really. Even in jobs you can complain to HR and get troubles sorted out. University professors just treat you like shit because they know they cant lose their jobs no matter what.\n\nIm so happy to hear that you feel better. I just dropped out recently and I feel so much better. Being an engineer was a dream of mine, but engineering school is just such a scam. College isnt the only road to success. I'll keep you in prayers.",

It is a vital part of learning and growing, but sadly, many teachers and professors forget the most important part- that their students are humans too, with lives and struggles or their own. I've dealt with many similar professors who could care less about other's well-being, except their own. One this semester even, but occasionally I get a golden nugget of a professor who truly cares. They're too far and too few in between. \n\nI dropped out twice before going back and now I'm only a few semesters away from graduating. Yet, I still have the nagging doubts that you speak about. I always worry and wonder if I'm truly doing what is right for me, or what those around me want. It's a hard battle. \n\nRegardless, I know that wasn't an easy decision, but good on you for making it. In my opinion, you should always do what makes you feel the best, mentally and physically. Enjoy everyday, don't worry so much and laugh all the time. I wish you all the best luck in your future endeavors!",

I would feel *good* occasionally, particularly when I got a good grade on an assignment or I had a week gap between one class and the next (because of my circumstances, I only took 1 class 8 wk at one time).. but I was never happy. I thought that would come when I after graduation. But now, even a day into this new chapter of my life... I can definitely call myself happy. This is sort of a tangent but... It just feels so weird to call myself happy now, and actually mean it, but it feels amazing after so long.",
