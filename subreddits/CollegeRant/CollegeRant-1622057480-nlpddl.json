The best way to do that would be to apply to a course in the UK and study British politics right there, where it's happening. The problem is my academic record is awful. I got average scores in high school with a 2.7 GPA, failed the only AP test I took, didn't bother taking the test for the other two AP classes I was taking because I was doing so poorly, am on academic probation at my community college, got a 1210 on the SAT, and I'm 21.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just a guy. I'm not wickedly charismatic and I'm not a great leader. I don't have some sob story excuse for my poor performance. I don't have any exotic identity that might let me squeeze into a course by virtue of quotas. The thing is, I know I could do it. I know that being there and studying what I'm actually passionate about would help me and my mental health so much. I know I could do it. The problem is my record doesn't support that argument, and I feel doomed for it.", "author": "throwRA1987239127", "created": 1622057480, "retrieved": 1632842312, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzjuzrs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nlpddl/my_21m_us_only_academic_passion_is_uk_politics/gzjuzrs/", "text": "Thank you u/throwRA1987239127 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you find a course you like, check the university's website for mature student entry and they'll have information there about what courses are on offer and how they feed into entry to the full degree. For example, the course I attended was called Access and if you got four Bs you were guaranteed a place on the course. You do normally have to be out of formal education for three years in order to apply, though.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying you still have options, so look into them as much as you can.
