On the one hand, I understand that reduced aid means the school can help other students' cost of college to go down, but on the other hand, scholarships are ways to lower the cost of college, and reducing someone's aid because they got a scholarship doesn't reduce the cost of college depending on the scholarship amount. College is really expensive :(! Just a tiny rant.\n\nTL:DR: college is expensive and reduced aid because of scholarships confuses me", "author": "shoobfloof", "created": 1605720971, "retrieved": 1632951428, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 44, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gcss9or": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jwk7uc/giving_less_financial_aid_when_students_receive_a/gcss9or/", "text": "Shilling out your entire life savings for half a year of college and unpayable loans is unfair homie.

Unless you come from a financially comfortable family that's willing to pay for your college, it's hard to even afford just tuition at most schools (and if you're also going to be living on-campus, well good luck)\n\nFor example, I'm living at home to save on expenses and I was even got a nice little merit scholarship along with some grants, and I still have to take out loans just to cover everything. So by the time I graduate, I'm going to start out well in the hole. \n\nBack in the 1950s, all you needed to do to cover your tuition for the year was work a minimum wage job over the summer and you were golden.", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1605723304, "upvotes": 20}}}
