Somehow society expects us to have it all figured out when we're done high school but a lot of us have no idea what we want to do as a career.\n\n\\-Take courses to explore your options and interests early on (like in first or second year). At my school, non-degree courses count as electives and you needed a certain number of those to graduate and finish your degree (but definitely check how your school works!) You can also get work or volunteer experience to see what you like and don't like in a job.\n\n\\-Many, if not, most people end up changing their major at some point. It's completely NORMAL. Of course, you don't want to feel like you wasted your time and money, but if you realize that your major or field of work is just not right for you, you may want to switch. Keep in mind you may also be able to finish the degree you're working on now, then get a different type of education or get work experience to work in a specific field, depending on the career you want. Talk to an advisor if you are farther along in your degree and want to switch majors because this is a big decision!\n\n\\-Finally, don't let you major define you or put you in a box. Your degree is only one thing that employers are looking for, but they also want to see what skills and experience you have. You can always learn more or get experience to get into a different field than what you originally studied. \n\nI also created a video for anyone who is trying to decide what college major to choose: [https://youtu.be/\\_6cchu7HHLo](https://youtu.be/_6cchu7HHLo) \n\nGood luck!", "author": "lindaedith", "created": 1631668625, "retrieved": 1632841072, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hcw8uaa": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pog0r2/anyone_struggling_to_choose_a_major/hcw8uaa/", "text": "Thank you u/lindaedith for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
