I\u2019m a senior who\u2019s simply trying to graduate and I just found out I could\u2019ve graduated early if I would\u2019ve had proper guidance/advising. I had to drop my minor as there\u2019s no space for any of the classes I need. Now, I\u2019m stressed as I only have two classes to finish up for both of my majors to be complete. However, I can\u2019t really be a part time student as my financial aid will be completely screwed up. Not only that, but the required credits/class I need for one major won\u2019t be given till next semester. At that point, I\u2019d only need to finish up that one class. I\u2019ve already completely my general Ed and don\u2019t want to pay for unnecessary classes. This is so stressful, and it\u2019s only the first week.", "author": "flowergirl299", "created": 1629862335, "retrieved": 1632841563, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"ha90dai": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pb335d/i_am_beyond_frustrated_at_my_schools_lack_of/ha90dai/", "text": "Thank you u/flowergirl299 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
