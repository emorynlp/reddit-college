Currently, I feel so alone. I am all online and which means I have no in person classes. My college canceled our spring break which is fucking annoying. The point of a break is a fucking break. Nope not for my college they said, \u201cScrew your mental health, work for 18 weeks straight\u201d. Everyday is an exact replica of the day before. I sit at my desk all day do work teach myself everything then collapse into my bed. This cycle feels never ending. I have no friends. This is my only college experience I have had. I guess the point of this rant is is this what college is actually like? I am ruining my mental health over online college. \n\n\nTL:DR Everyday is the same. My only experiences are through online classes.

I have some friends from other colleges who have spring break I don't see the point of taking that away from us........This whole first year of college I've been doing online.
