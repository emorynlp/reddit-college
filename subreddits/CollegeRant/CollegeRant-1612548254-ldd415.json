I work 15 to 17 hours every single day. This finals is going to kill me holy shit. I thought an output based finals would be easier than written exams, but this is just hell.\n\nThis one prof has given more than 10 assignments due two weeks and a massive project to boot. She gives assignments even during exam days, and fucking sets unnecessary sync classes when we need to rush with the deadlines the most. Whats even worse is she ovetimes more than an hour every time, having to extend it bc oops she talked too much about random tangents that no one gives a shit about.
