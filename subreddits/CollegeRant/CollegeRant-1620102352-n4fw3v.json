This is my first time posting on Reddit, but I just wanna get this off my chest and also wanna know if I\u2019m the only one who does this. Ever since the pandemic happened and online classes started, my motivation to study is just non-existent. I\u2019d feel lazy to focus in class, so I\u2019ll just attend the online class sessions and wander off doing other stuff like watching tiktoks or something unproductive haha. So let\u2019s say during the 12 weeks of studies, I wouldn\u2019t focus at all. So I had no idea what the hell everyone\u2019s learning in class. I wouldn\u2019t participate in the tutorials or even self study. But I\u2019d work my ass off for my assignments/coursework and would score high marks for them. Two or three weeks before finals, I\u2019d stay up all night and wake up super early to watch recordings and study the whole syllabus myself. Basically cramming everything last minute for my exams. Then, I\u2019d end up getting high distinctions which is like 80% and above. So to all of the college students here, I just wanna know if I\u2019m the only one who does this? Like it bothers me so much that this cycle repeats over and over again.", "author": "LovelyHoney98", "created": 1620102352, "retrieved": 1632843495, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gwvcp93": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n4fw3v/wanna_get_this_off_my_chest_and_see_if_others_are/gwvcp93/", "text": "Thank you u/LovelyHoney98 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I used to be proud of my ability to bs my way through school back in high school but now in the pandemic it\u2019s just getting out of hand. The only class style I\u2019ve been able to learn from is those classes with weekly recorded lectures and a single quiz at the end of each week to make sure you watch the lectures; so much simpler than having to keep track of projects and go to office hours and stuff.\n\nI think this kind of behavior is pretty normal for people who were understimulated in high school and so never developed those proper study habits or work ethics that are needed for actually challenging coursework. The pandemic has definitely worsened it for everyone though, since the lack of motivation just compounds with your already bad habits.", "author": "Quantum-Bot", "created": 1620142153, "upvotes": 2}, "gwwvgub": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n4fw3v/wanna_get_this_off_my_chest_and_see_if_others_are/gwwvgub/", "text": "My class happens while I'm at work.
