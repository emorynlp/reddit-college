My school sent out an email with \"tips\" for getting through this semester without a break, which included: Go for a walk! Look at the stars! Eat lunch! Practice mindfulness! (Whatever that even means???)\n\nI was literally baffled. I was so tempted to email back and say go fuck yourselves. Really?? Look at the stars?? I'm not even joking, it was included as a \"tip\" for dealing with no spring break. I get that not having a spring break is COVID related but my school clearly has no idea what their students are going through when they go over three months with no break. Looking at the fucking stars won't help with my burnout and depression.
