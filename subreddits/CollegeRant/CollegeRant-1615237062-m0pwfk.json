  "title:": "I got THE MOST out of touch email from my school",
  "text": "As a lot of schools are, my school cancelled spring break which I have not been looking forward to because not getting a fall break was pretty difficult for me to handle mentally. My school sent out an email with \"tips\" for getting through this semester without a break, which included: Go for a walk! Look at the stars! Eat lunch! Practice mindfulness! (Whatever that even means???)\n\nI was literally baffled. I was so tempted to email back and say go fuck yourselves. Really?? Look at the stars?? I'm not even joking, it was included as a \"tip\" for dealing with no spring break. I get that not having a spring break is COVID related but my school clearly has no idea what their students are going through when they go over three months with no break. Looking at the fucking stars won't help with my burnout and depression. Jesus christ I literally cannot right now.",

Hell of a lot of places shut those down entirely. \n\nI'm just not sure what you expect the school to do here. Like, I get that cancelling spring break sucks, but it's still a better option than the alternative of letting it go as per normal, which has a pretty high chance of getting in-person learning shitcanned a few weeks later as infections spike. It's a pandemic, yes it sucks; dealing with it is unpleasant in all regards, but you still need to deal with it.\n\nI mean, would you have preferred them not to even try providing any advice on how individuals can deal with stress? That seems like an unreasonable stance to me.",
