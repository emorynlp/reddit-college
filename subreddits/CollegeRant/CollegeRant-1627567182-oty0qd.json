Good questions helped me learn. I took a biotechnology trade program and I have NEVER been a STEM person. I got frustrated a lot because I didn\u2019t understand a lot of things, but the more I asked good questions and got good answers, the more i resonated. Going to office hours with the professor and just making a list of questions and discussing can really help. From what I have read in your responses, it sounds like the exams and studying for them can be very difficult. Go to office hours and ask what they are looking  for, if they are willing to tell you.
