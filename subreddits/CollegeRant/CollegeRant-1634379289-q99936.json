  "text": "I admit it, I\u2019m a procrastinator. I like to risk it for the biscuit, to play it down to the wire. And I\u2019ll admit that is in part buoyed by the fact I\u2019m able to write up whole 8-15 page research papers in a day. But goddamnit Turnitin, if I see a deadline for 11:55, I should be able to submit my paper if the clock is still 11:55, rather than staring at my screen dumbfounded that you boot my from my upload screen after I have to fumble around with your clumsy file upload system. And now I\u2019ll have to finish the semester knowing I just tanked my grade having a fat zero for the midterm. \n\nRant is over; that is all.",

And then I couldn\u2019t find the damn word doc that I had spent the last 12 hours writing. And the best part is when I entered in my assignment title on the search bar on my WIN10 laptop, I couldn\u2019t find the doc. And it was right in my desktop. Sucks to suck I guess, looks like it\u2019s the first class I take a hit and roll with the punches.",

The way our LMS is set up, the deadline is fixed to a specific time zone, and even if you change something locally, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But, who knows?",
