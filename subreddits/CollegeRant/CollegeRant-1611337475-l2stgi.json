But seriously other people have mentioned it already don\u2019t be afraid to take a semester off to figure things out, or wait until classes might go back to in person. Classes start in three days sure but if you find your gut saying take a break, take a break. Your grades are not completely ruined and having a shit first semester is way more normal than society wants you to believe. It\u2019s going to be ok",

Maybe reach out to them and see what your school is doing to help with online learning. It is very different from in person, and we're all adjusting. Also, education departments are a secret gem for resources. Check to see if any advisors from that department have suggestions on your next steps. But you're far from through with your journey. My boss always talks about finishing her first semester with a 0.72 GPA and graduating top of her class. You can do it!!",

I know it can seem like everyone around you has it figured out, but stories like yours are more common than you think. \n\nIf you feel like you need some time off, take it and return in the fall (or whenever you guys end up going back in person). At least in my experience, it was the best thing I ever did. Otherwise, ask your advisor about any resources the school has that may help you and take advantage of it. You can get through this.",

If you don't, you won't be eligible for any federal grants or student loans. Your school should have an appeal process if you are put on probation.\n\nAdditionally, your college/program may put you on academic probation, giving you usually 1 term to bring up your GPA. If you fail to do that, they will dismiss you.\n\nIf on-line learning just isn't for you, maybe a term off will help. However, if you have federal student loans, you won't be in an in-school deferment and you will start the clock on your 6 month grace period.",

You can take the semester off and hopefully you will return to in-person classes in the fall, however this will make you graduate late unless you take summer or interim courses.

Ask them if they offer help outside of class, if they know of any tutors, or if there are extra credit assignments you can do. If you really want to stay in school, you\u2019ll have to put in the extra steps. Your professors are there to help you!
