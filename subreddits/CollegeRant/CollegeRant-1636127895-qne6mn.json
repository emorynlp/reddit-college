  "text": "I won\u2019t even begin to explain what I\u2019ve experienced overall, but I will tell you a little bit. Like 3 months ago, I had to work closely with my advisor because I was getting an internship. For this semester she told me that finishing my minor wasn\u2019t necessary because I had one class left. She had me take a class that was required for my major. \n\nThen I came for advisement for next semester, as I could possibly be graduating. She said \u201chow come you didn\u2019t take x class?\u201d I told her it\u2019s because she TOLD me to. She said sunglassesraven. THINK! What is then best thing you can do right now! I was like uhhhhhhh? She told me to hit up my advisor for my minor and ask for a substitution, since they don\u2019t even offer this basic ass class I need. She said if my other advisor says no, then I won\u2019t finish the minor if I am graduating. \n\nSo I hit up my advisor with an email because it\u2019s literally a yes or no question. No response. Then I made an appointment for today, going back and forth to make a time with the secretary. Then I received a zoom link from my advisor for 2 days before the appointment. I emailed her like \u201chey the time isn\u2019t right\u201d and no response. I went to the zoom meeting today and of course she wasn\u2019t there. I get she\u2019s a busy woman but oh my god!! Just acknowledge that I sent you something. I wonder if she just deletes my emails\u2026",
