I just want to know if someone has experienced/is experiencing this now. Recently I had a sudden euphoric phase of mania where I felt so prepared and inspired to go to college and do something with my life and further my degree to give myself a better opportunity.  A couple weeks have passed and now I'm back down to feeling sad and hopeless and almost wanting to back out of it and drop out before I even begin my first semester. I'm feeling so anxious and overwhelmed before even starting my first class. I'm afraid I won't be able to do it, and keep up, even if I'll only be at 2 classes a term to start. I have no support system in my life to talk about this, so I'm kinda ranting here. I just don't know what to do. I can't work because of the pandemic so I thought I'd use this time to go back to school. I don't want a dead end retail job anyway, I want this degree so I can do what I love doing. But I just don't have the motivation to be studious or creative. What do I do?  \n\nTldr; I thought I felt strong enough to make a commitment to school, now I'm feeling depressed and unmotivated. I'm anxious that I made the wrong decision, and I haven't even started yet.", "author": "milkandjoohoney", "created": 1595534185, "retrieved": 1632951082, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fzfaai8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hwmsy1/too_depressed_and_unmotivated_for_school_to_start/fzfaai8/", "text": "I understand your pain. Really, I do. It feels like a weight that you can't get rid of. It's made worse because my school decided to send in my access codes late, and because of that I was severely behind. I'm almost caught up, but after pulling near 25 all-nighters I gotta say I. DON'T. THINK. I. GIVE. ANY. MORE. SHITS about the stuff I'm late on. I mean who thinks it's a good idea in the first place to assign students a supposed 12 month equivalent course and condense it down to an EIGHT WEEK SESSION. 52 weeks to 8 weeks. FFS.\n\nSo I've started primarily focusing on things that make me happy. Which is music and writing. Strange to prioritize something that shouldn't come into comparison with my future career, but I don't think you'll be blamed in the future if you do the same. As everyone has to have their ways of dealing with the stress of this thing. Just prioritize your hobby and secondly, your homework.

Depression is a symptom with many potential causes, one of which is brain injury. If you are doubting you made the wrong decision, trust me: don't switch off your first answer. Never doubt your first answer on a test with a reason, and the same goes for college.\n\nMania to go to college and then sudden depression might be an indicator of Bipolar, but I'm not a doctor.\n\nPeople who graduated college aren't just good because they got 5.0 GPA with honors and participated in 3 clubs with leadership. They got it done because they stuck it through and don't want to be working a job that can't pay rent.\n\nIf you can't use passion to motivate you, maybe you can use intense fear that will push you forward. You can even sign a contract that someone can harm you in some way as \"motivation.\" Have you ever been near gang violence before? It is VERY motivating to get the hell out of there.\n\nLife these days has no external motvation. Such a thing has been engineered out of the modern world. You can always try farming, if that will grant you some perspective. However, even farming is had been touched by thr power of automation.\n\nIf you need to practice motivation, you use a classic pen and paper. You put shit on a list to get done. It gets done by the day. If it doesn't, you might get upset. You put it on the next list. Again and again. Because you don't have any reference for organizing tasks in your life by yourself. Now you do.\n\nCollege is literally as easy as putting shit on a list and getting it done. Life is the same. Business is the same. You don't get motivated naturally, you need to put shit on a list, and say \"AH SHIT\" when you didn't do it. Then, you do it.\n\nStop looking outside for motivation. Stop waiting for school to start to learn how to start getting started. Doing is easy, beginning is hard. Go to Drawabox and learn how to draw. Put it on your daily list. If you didn't do it, you say \"SHIT,\" then do it. \n\nYou will experience a lot of situations where there is no external motivation in life. Pen and paper. No computers, no phones, no distractions. Unless you are disabled so as to prevent writing of course.\n\nWe engineered motivation out, we can engineer it back in.", "author": "cudgeon_kurosaki", "created": 1595674377, "upvotes": 2}, "fz5oq1s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hwmsy1/too_depressed_and_unmotivated_for_school_to_start/fz5oq1s/", "text": "I understand where you're coming from. School can get super overwhelming when you overthink it and the pandemic only worsens the situation. It sounds like your underlying feeling is that you are committed to school but have a lot going on that could deter you from reaching your goal. Here are a few tips that might help you. First, try to decrease your anxiety before making any final decisions. Maybe practice yoga, meditation or do an activity that you enjoy. Second, try to do an action, in two minutes or less, that would ultimately lead you to completing your school work. For example, if you know you have homework due tonight, open the assignment and read through it. That would put you in the direction to begin the assignment and eventually finish it. Third, I have heard that we all have the answers to our questions within us but they are hidden away by our insecurities, fears and generally other stuff in our mind that are not letting us focus on the answer. What you end up deciding will come naturally to you. This ties with the first tip of actively working on decreasing your anxiety so that you can look within and find an answer. I hope this helps!\n\nAlso, try reaching out to to the wellness center or whatever mental health counseling available at your college. I am sure they would be more than happy to help.", "author": "indiegirl20", "created": 1595643377, "upvotes": 1}, "fz2iwvd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hwmsy1/too_depressed_and_unmotivated_for_school_to_start/fz2iwvd/", "text": "I've decided to go back to school too and am starting a class in Fall.

Not being able to do something that makes me feel like I'm progressing towards the goal can be hard.\n\nGoing back to school is a big decision; it's totally normal to feel apprehensive about an impending big life change.
