I\u2019ve dropped out from college several times because of self sabotage. I did work on this in therapy but what really helped me was letting go of perfectionism. When I realize that sometimes I check out and fall behind I communicate with my professor and turn it in anyway, I\u2019ve done this MANY times and still passed each semester with As. I am also getting evaluated this week for ADHD and if I have it I will definitely be asking for accommodations as you should for your anxiety. (I have anxiety and depression as well but the medications And therapy im taking have been helping me manage). A lot of times the self sabotage comes from fear of failure, you\u2019ll tell yourself you\u2019ll fail because you always do so you withdraw instead to avoid failing. It sucks to fail, and that\u2019s definitely not the goal but try seeing things through anyway, you need atleast a C or D to actually pass and at this point you only have a few more courses. The next time you get these feelings, sit with them a few days, try to do a little bit of work each day, communicate with your professor for an extension and maybe shorten your course load to part time to reduce your anxiety and pressure! You\u2019ve got this, I\u2019ll probably be 29 or 30 when I finish my bachelors but I don\u2019t care lol Even if I have to take breaks and go part time. Go at your own pace!

You may try seeing another professional, maybe a psychiatrist? Regardless, you are not a failure for not completing school. I don\u2019t know what to say to help except that school is not the be all end all. If school is causing you too much distress, you can find entry level jobs and try to work up from there and maybe they\u2019ll even pay for your degree in the future. Or you might find a job you genuinely love and don\u2019t even need a degree for. There\u2019s technical degrees, which may or may not be up your alley. Also, it\u2019s never to late to go back to school. So, don\u2019t feel ashamed to stop now and go back in 10, 20, 30 years. I know many successful people with no degrees. My dad has a masters and works a job that only requires an associates. My mom has a phD and is a teacher. They\u2019re over educated.

They can give you assignment extensions and other resources to hopefully make it easier to succeed with anxiety. For example I have anxiety (and other mental health issues), so I get time and a half for exams, homework extensions, testing in small environments, and reduced course load. At my CC, they even offered me scheduled tutoring sessions twice a week. These extensions do require a large amount of personal accountability though.\n\nLike you, medication did nothing for me. In fact, every medication I was on triggered rapid cycling or GI symptoms so I choose no more medication after 3+ years of suffering and hospitalizations. Obviously, see a psychiatrist since this may not work for everyone, but my psychiatrist recommended exercise as a treatment plan and regular appointments to make sure I\u2019m doing okay and remaining stable.\n\nI know you can do this.
