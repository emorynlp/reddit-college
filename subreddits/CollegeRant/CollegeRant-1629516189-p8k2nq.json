I started at community college in fall 2019 right after high school. (Might i say i picked the best 2 years to go to community college ever lol) i thought it was a great financial decision and now im transferring to a college i really like but even these last 2 years are gonna be expensive as FUCK and its still in state. I pretty much worked 20-30 hours a week (sometimes more)  the whole time i was at cc and I will probably get a job in my new location but not right away. I got to save up alot of my own money but i also had to take out a ton of loans as did my parents. Im really grateful to get to go at all because some people don\u2019t even have a chance to go to cc and transfer or get a 2 year degree because in america it is SO damn expensive. \n\nwhat REALLY pisses me off is to see new freshman headed off to whatever college in whatever state they so desire with a bank account full of their parents money. Now the problem does not lie with students who are actually going to college because they want to for job opportunities\u2026 etc. but the ones who party every fucking night and go to football games and never fucking study or show up to class. I know a bunch of these types of people and am seeing it right now. So fucking ungrateful to be able to attend college and not see what a privilege it is. Going to get drunk, get high, and fuck bitches isnt what its all about. I mean of course you can go all that and study as well as long as you\u2019re not a dumbass. You can get drunk and high all you want without going to college. So if thats what all you plan to do maybe you shouldn\u2019t fucking go. And they dont even think one but of how much its costing their parents because they dont give a fuck and mommy and daddy are probably pround anyway.

They should be thankful for the opportunity, especially if their parents are paying for it. That said, I want to give a little bit of context about how those people got where they are.\n\nThere's a ton of pressure in the US to go to college, regardless of whether you wanted it or needed it, no matter what your career track is. It's just a given. Want to succeed in business or politics? Go to college. Want to become a professional athlete? Go to college. Want to become a Youtuber? You might still want a degree as a fallback.\n\nMy high school asked us what college we were going to during our senior year. Parents are expected to have kids that are in college if they're old enough to be in college, so they push their kids to go to college. All of your friends are going to college, so you stand out if you're not going to college. Your siblings may have gone or are going to college. Your parents probably have college degrees (if they don't, any faults they have are probably blamed on the fact that they didn't succeed in college).\n\nIf you're not going to college, and you have the money or resources to go to college, then you better have had a dang good reason, because everyone is going to ask. \"If you're not going to college, what are you going to do?\" No one wants to say \"well, I guess I'm going to go work at McDonald's\". Entrepreneurship isn't taught in schools. Many people don't have great ideas for other college-less careers they could get into. Most jobs you can get without a college degree are generally seen as jobs you work at *while* you're working on a college degree.\n\nSo, you declare a major, and go to college. Keep in mind, high school is terrible at teaching proper study methods and many students simply aren't ready for the irrelevant bullcrap that is the 1st year of a college curriculum. Combine this with the freedom of being away from home, and the path of least resistance is what you see.\n\nYeah, if you're not succeeding in your classes, the right thing to do would to just tell everyone to go screw themselves, and then go home. It's just not that easy in practice. Dropping out of college feels like failure, and is often seen as failure. Even if the school will force you out at the end of the semester, it turns into something you want to push off and not think about, so you just keep partying or doing whatever until the hammer drops.\n\nNot to say there aren't students who just don't care at all, but based on what I've seen, I'm not sure it's right to just call them all lazy assholes. They likely wouldn't have been there to begin with if we weren't so obsessed with college degrees. It's hard to be appreciative of college if no other choice was ever even presented to you.", "author": "Net56", "created": 1629533934, "upvotes": 16}, "h9rfs98": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p8k2nq/i_cant_stand_people_who_cant_appreciate_the_fact/h9rfs98/", "text": "Some days I'm unappreciative as fuck. I ask myself why didn't I take the easy way out like chosing an easy major or just not going to college.\n Some days I'm like \"why don't i just quit?\"( Me crying in car after comuting an hour back and forth and working 30 hours) But it's so hard to go to college and i agree that people take it for granted esp at a private school like mine. That's what I have noticed. But the work is so hard and unnecessary. Also I've seen kids skip classss and stuff, but i usually don't let it bother me too often.\n\nGood luck on your college life. Make sure you have some fun also! What is your major?", "author": "OpenedPandoraBox", "created": 1629527728, "upvotes": 39}}}
