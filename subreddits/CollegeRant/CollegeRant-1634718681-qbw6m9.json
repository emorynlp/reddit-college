I entered college when I was 17 and am now 20 and still can't drink (although thanks to Texas law, I've had some drinks on occasion under guardian consent.) As you can probably guess, I hail from the United States where the legal drinking age is 21.",

Do try look into some clubs and societies potentially because I hear they're supposed to be good for that sort of thing, and I know not all will be 18+ events. \n\nCan also guarantee you're not the only person under 18 there too, chances are there's probably shite loads of minors after sneaking into an event or pub and just pretending they're of age.",
