I have so much debt racking up, my parents have never been able to afford to pay for my school. I find myself drifting away from school after all the work I put into it. I feel embarrassed like I gave up, but I just can\u2019t pay for it. I tried talking to financial aid but now they won\u2019t respond to my emails. I filed as independent the last two years, and don\u2019t even live with my parents. I want to finish school and I had good grades but god I can\u2019t seem to pay for the classes. I just want it to be okay, I just want my school to be done, i don\u2019t know how to even go about it anymore.", "author": "Kc_1234566", "created": 1621031058, "retrieved": 1632842389, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"gy5iygo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ncknml/financial_aid/gy5iygo/", "text": "Thank you u/Kc_1234566 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think it's too late to apply for next year, but it opens in October if you'll still be there 2022-2023. If you are an independent, I'm assuming you probably don't make enough money to not qualify, unless there's another reason you don't qualify. I'm lucky because my school, though it is private and suuuuper expensive, provided a ton of financial aid and the government provides the rest. All in all I had as much debt in 2.5 years as my sister had her first year in school (no financial aid from her school, and its an expensive, private art school). I'm not thrilled about the amount of debt, but all things considered I think it is worth the outcome.\n\nBut I understand how easy it is to mentally give up. I don't know your exact position, but my mom is a widow with 3 kids, struggling to just pay the bills as it is, and she's clearly exhausted and depressed over our situation. I got excellent grades in high school and freshman year of college, but ever since we've faced even more financial challenges, I just haven't been able to bounce back with my grades. The people in the office don't understand that though. I do worry a lot about my family's financial state, as well as their mental health, but everyone's \"solution\" is \"maybe you should see a counselor,\" or \"maybe you should take a semester off.\" None of that will put us in a stable financial state or ease my worries. My point is, worrying about money is (at least to me) normal and very discouraging. I wish you luck, and try not to give up. School is getting harder for me to pay for too, with my sister in school, a decreased income on my mom's part, and summer courses because I've failed more classes than my AP credits cover. Most of that from cornavirus and having to be home where the wifi is trash in my area and I wasn't sure what was happening with our financial situation. But nope, that doesn't matter, none of what I did that semester before going home matters, I still failed 3 of my 4 classes. Sorry for my own ranting, but trust me, I understand how college, and the school system in general, really, seems to favor people with money muuuuch more than people who aren't as fortunate. Stay strong the best you can, and know you're not alone. I've also thought about dropping out over financial problems, but you're in college for a reason. Debt can be a lot, but you will eventually be able to pay it off. If not, I'm pretty sure people can help you and work with you. Good luck, I hope you're able to find some way to make it \u2661", "author": "LilDebbiesPimp", "created": 1621063650, "upvotes": 1}}}
