  "text": "I finally have time this weekend to relax a little bit and watch a movie and all of a sudden I can\u2019t find my stupid roku remote anywhere. I would use the app, but I didn\u2019t have it already, and my tv won\u2019t automatically connect to the dorm wifi, so I can\u2019t connect the app to my device. I keep the remote in one place and it\u2019s not there. I thought, maybe I left it on my bed. Nowhere on the bed, not caught up in the sheets, not under the bed. Maybe it\u2019a in a pocket. I checked every piece of clothing I have here, not there. Not under my desk, not in any drawer, it\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve turned my bag inside out. I\u2019ve done everything. I\u2019ve been looking for close to an hour now. The only place I haven\u2019t checked is my roommates area. She\u2019s never taken anything from me, so I have no reason to believe she has it, but I\u2019ve never looked for anything more thoroughly in my life. I don\u2019t drink, so it\u2019s not like a drunk me did something with it, and it has never left my room. I\u2019m just so upset bc I was really excited to finally have some downtime and this shit happens.",
