I don't have the best gpa so I don't even want to consider transferring to a different college.\n\nI took a class last year but realized I wasn't ready for it because I overloaded my schedule. So I withdrew from it. This semester has been a rough one for me with personal life and now I am mortally crushed that I will end up with an F in the class. Extremely embarrassing. I assume the F will overwrite the W? I guess I am posting this for some inkling of hope that this won't tank my gpa and all my worries will dissapear.", "author": "throwaway_33424", "created": 1620980088, "retrieved": 1632842399, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "comments": {"gy2s8wi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nc3gdt/i_had_an_absolutely_awful_semester_full_of/gy2s8wi/", "text": "Thank you u/throwaway_33424 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
