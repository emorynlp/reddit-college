  "text": "So long story short I fall I ended  up taking a english class having  no idea how badly  they grade. And by the way I have a disability. So now I'm in my 5 week  of class and I got one of my essays back and I got a 19/50 to make it worse.  The deadline to drop from the is in October. Should I  stay or go? Drop it as a w or try to stick around?",

      "text": "Did you get feedback as to why you scored 19 out of 50? One low score is not going to necessarily tank your chances of passing, but you would obviously need to do well on other assignments to even things out.\n\nAlso, does your disability qualify you for accommodations? Those could not be retroactively applied, but they can help with any subsequent assignments if they apply to your situation.",

I know I'm doing everything right. It's quizzes and assignments  as well.  Also asked my teacher  for one in class assignment for a extension  because it's bad enough keeping  up so she said I can email to her  and I still got a 1 of 20.. So idk I'm confused.",
