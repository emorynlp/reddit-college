But since I really wanted to learn the subject, I tried using resources available online. I heard of Gilbert Strang back in High school so I thought this might be the perfect time to use his book, lectures and notes. \nJust to be sure whether it will be the right move or not, and get some additional advices on how I can improve, I asked my professor (during discussion)\n\n\"Sir, is it fine if I use Strang? I find Hecker [reference book he asked us to follow when the course began] a little less interesting.\"\n\nAs soon as he read \"Strang\", he was all raged.\nHe asked me to not attend his classes because, apparantly, he knows he sucks at teaching. He thought, that I think, that he might not know who Strang is, which is weird because if so, why would I have asked him whether Strang would suffice or not?\n\nI guess, he interpreted my question as a comment on his bad teaching, which wasn't my intention at that moment. Other than that, I have no f*cking idea of what got him off. \n\nBut at the end, he still sorted it out for me by saying that I should not attend his classes, I can now focus on Strang.", "author": "topQuark24", "created": 1622971147, "retrieved": 1632842268, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h0s0yai": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nthswe/what_pissed_my_linalg_prof/h0s0yai/", "text": "Thank you u/topQuark24 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
