I always wanted to go to college but didn't get to right after high school, so I feel like I should be happier right now, but I'm just not. I'm miserable. All my classes are on ZOOM or online programs, I haven't had any actual human interaction in forever. I'm broke all the time. On lockdown because of Covid and haven't seen my friends or boyfriend in forever. I don't even have a roommate. I'm far away from home and don't know the area or know anyone here, and it's impossible to meet people when almost everything's closed and there are no ongoing clubs or activities other than the occasional ZOOM event. I'm just so burned out on ZOOM. It doesn't feel real, the people don't feel like real people, nobody talks to each other in any capacity after the calls are over.\n\nAll I do anymore is cry alone in my dorm and mope around the campus. And I know there's no universal \"college experience\" and it's petty to complain about something so trivial with all that's going on in the world, but I just really miss human interaction and wish I could have a hug or something to remind me why I even bother.", "author": "sad-wendall", "created": 1611955777, "retrieved": 1632842936, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"glal4yu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l84t6s/im_just_really_sad_and_alone/glal4yu/", "text": "Thank you u/sad-wendall for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wonder if this might make a difference. There are so many people who really need human contact right now, so I have a feeling your peers might be up for it. You could even email students in your class (even a group email) and say something like \"Things have been so isolated! Is anyone up for taking a walk, outside, 6 feet, with masks? If a lot of people are interested, we can make groups of 2 or 3 for safety reasons.\" It's hard to be a leader, but sometimes taking those steps can make a difference to you and also to other students who are feeling similarly.", "author": "NashiPearl", "created": 1612040424, "upvotes": 2}, "glenj2i": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l84t6s/im_just_really_sad_and_alone/glenj2i/", "text": "Hi sad-wendall,\n\nIf you're crying most of the time, please seek professional psychological help. I don't say this out of judgment, I say this because depression is a safety issue and a health issue, just as much as if you had something going on with your heart or muscles. Your campus should have psychological support, and if it doesn't, you can also make a telehealth appointment in your community.\n\nLack of human interaction is so hard, and it's completely okay to grieve the college experience you could have had this year if there was no covid. In fact, honoring your feelings is part of feeling better. But the symptoms you are describing sounds exactly like depression, and while depression is completely valid in your situation, you don't need to continue suffering alone. If you have an unhealthy family situation, this can be contributing to your mood. Options include a psychologist, psychiatrist, LCSW, talking to your primary care about medication, or things like EMDR if you have a trauma history. Some people also choose TMS or ECT, but that's usually reserved for people who did not respond to medication or have a major contraindication.\n\nIn addition to that, you have a few options. One is to reach out to people you were friends with in high school. During covid, I decided to invest in my existing friendships (including people I liked but didn't know that well) and found that I was able to strengthen my friendships and feel closer to people who live far away.\n\nMy school also has a postdoctoral buddy program where people check in on each other, call each other for support, etc., and it might be good to make an undergrad version. You might consider approaching the office of student affairs (or student life) at your school and ask them to start a program for undergrads.\n\nGood luck. I know it's really hard. I don't know how bad things have gotten, but if you ever feel suicidal, call 911 or the national suicide support hotline ( 800-273-8255 ). That's the USA number and it's available in English and Spanish.
