It takes a while for me to understand instructions and it\u2019s hard when I feel like they aren\u2019t clear enough. I\u2019ve emailed my professor and he\u2019s explained but there\u2019s just one part of the assignment I\u2019m just not getting. And when I go to start the other parts I freeze up. The whole thing is worth 210 points, it\u2019s the biggest assignment for this class. I feel like an idiot, I\u2019ve been crying and panicking. I have a 96 in the class but I keep thinking how I\u2019ll fail. Im also just upset because this is my last semester before graduation and I want o be done so badly but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll fuck yo and have to take this class again. I always have this catastrophe mind during semester and then I do fine but still. Im scared of messing up my last semester.
