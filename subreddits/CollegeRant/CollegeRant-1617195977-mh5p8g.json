  "text": "So as a underclassmen student in college during a pandemic, I thought there was no hope in even thinking about internships. One day I was inspired so I applied to like 50 places. After months of reject emails, I lost hope. But one day a major company decided to take a chance on me and GUESS WHAT, I got it. MAY SOUND CLICHE BUT DON\u2019T GIVE UP, Someone will take a chance on you if you meet the criteria. \n-~~~A short tale of a lost boy who is now found",
