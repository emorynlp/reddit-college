I've just discovered that it is going to be tougher to graduate in 2 years than I thought. The biggest problem is that I have too many courses to complete; I have 25 to complete and the max I can take without doing an overload (which I can try to apply for) is 6 per semester. It's going to be a stretch to handle 6 courses, even more of one for 7.\n\nThe easiest solution would be to just take another semester. Well, my parents say that isn't going to be possible. It's about 50/50 between my government loans and the remaining portion and they've decided they're going to try and pay the other portion. They're saying that they can't afford to pay the remaining portion for another semester all of the sudden, so I basically have to graduate in four semesters.\n\nMy solution would be to get private loans for the remaining balance and take an easier 5 course load across 5 semesters; that would take my parents out of the equation and I feel like I would be more capable of handling school and a part time job. However, I can't find a lender that will lend to me. Keep in mind that I have been in community college for the last two years and can't prove continuous employment, because I've only been working at the school and I only did that for 1 and a half years.\n\nI'm hoping I qualify for more scholarships this year, because that's going to be my only saving grace right now. Can anyone offer any words of advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Transfer student with too many courses for 4 semesters, but taking all those courses anyway.", "author": "Dr_Awesome867", "created": 1627065599, "retrieved": 1632841731, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h6a26kh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oq8nhf/how_am_i_going_to_graduate/h6a26kh/", "text": "Thank you u/Dr_Awesome867 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should be able to get a lower rate for private or be able to use fafsa if you're in the US for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

Also, if money is tight, you could always try and do as many classes at CC while doing part-time at your university. Part time at uni will say you a lot of $$$. \n\nIdk what state or country you are in, but my uni was very flexible with students taking CC classes that articulated. Academic counselors at your uni can help you with your situation if you explain this situation to them, but make sure to double check the school's catalog before making any decisions. Seriously know that catalog from cover-to-cover because referring to it saved me a lot of time with incorrect counselor advice. \n\nCounselors can often misunderstand the school's policies because they get updated every year. Sometimes a counselor will be referring to the wrong catalog year when giving you advice, so make sure its the year that you transferred, or you can use the catalog year that you started taking classes full-time at CC.", "author": "AreasofInterest", "created": 1627069410, "upvotes": 1}}}
