  "text": "ugh sorry in advance for the rant I\u2019m just so fucking sick and tired of not being allowed to struggle just because I go to a community. I thought it was bad when I made the decision to rescind from a UC but bro\u2026\n\na few examples: \n\n\n>had a huge midterm two weeks ago in calculus and I had no idea what was going on (so obviously very stressed) & this fucker goes \u201cit\u2019s okay you\u2019re in community, you can just drop the class if anything \u2014 besides just bribe the professor it\u2019s community hahahahah\u201d \u2026Ya, no comment \n\n\n>convo with a friend that was in town: \u201dugh you\u2019re so lucky you\u2019re in community bro\u2026ya no, you\u2019re definitely so smart for that you have no idea how hard real college is\u201d \u2026it\u2019s literally called community COLLEGE, like I know my struggles are going to be different than yours but it\u2019s still allowed to be hard for me too\n\n\n>this one drove my insane, convo with old teacher with another friend attending a four year present \u201coh that\u2019s smart, you save a lot of money, I wish I did that. Besides [insert a bunch of backhanded compliments like, \u201cadjusting is too difficult\u201d]\u201d \u2026that one isn\u2019t as bad diction wise but the tone shift felt so degrading. It just sucks because everyone automatically defaults to justifying my decision for me, why can\u2019t you just go with it and ask me how I like it? \n\n\n\n>\u201doh community discipline is a joke, you\u2019ll need real discipline in college\u201d bro WHAT\u2026you guys have each other & live in a town full of people that understand your struggle, I have Cartoon Network. If anything it takes me more discipline because I do it without the environment \n\n\n\n>\u201dwhat do you mean you don\u2019t have time to work out, don\u2019t you go to community\u201d & the fan favorite \u201cwhy are you tired it\u2019s not that deep, just take a gap semester tbh\u201d right, I forgot, my education isn\u2019t serious & I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019m bored \n\n\n\n>\u201doh no, I think it\u2019s so cool that you\u2019re doing that. Like I totally envy you, I personally could never because\u2026\u201d at what point did I ask you to do it with me? \n\n\n\nI know I\u2019m being bitchy, there\u2019s just all these tiny little micro aggressions on the daily & after a while it adds up. And I can\u2019t say anything or complain because then they say that it\u2019s my fault and my decision\u2026dude I\u2019m BROKE I obviously want to participate but the pros and cons don\u2019t balance the same for me. Also, why is is so hard to grasp that any struggles that I face aren\u2019t necessarily my fault, I can still be sad and stressed. When my friends first moved away it was so sad to see them go, but also just hard to be the only one that felt stagnant ya know? The second i voiced that tho\u2026everyone and their moms was like \u201clol told you so\u2026it\u2019s your decision live with it.\u201d Ya and I don\u2019t regret it, I\u2019m just lonely. \n\nI don\u2019t know it just sucks that I can\u2019t be taken seriously and people automatically assume it\u2019s something that I\u2019m ashamed of or that they have to comfort me \u2014 you literally don\u2019t I\u2019m just sharing my life with you, why can\u2019t you treat me with the same respect you\u2019d give me if my education had a different brand tagged onto it?? I constantly feel like the second people hear community they start explaining the reasoning behind my decision to me, and yes I appreciate that they\u2019re trying to make me comfortable, but can we please normalize the possibility that it makes me uncomfortable?? I definitely could have worded this better, but alas I go to community & my education isn\u2019t real so\u2026sigh ig \n\n\nTo clarify: I know the struggles are different and you can\u2019t compare the two dynamics. I\u2019m ranting about people invalidate me unprovoked and don\u2019t seem to notice, but would flip if I pointed it out :/",

It\u2019s especially annoying when people will be like, \u201coh, you\u2019re only president of the physics club because you go to community. The physics classes at my UC are impossible and you\u2019d never pass.\u201d Or \u201cyea, you\u2019re working on a research project but that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t any competition at community.\u201d I feel you way too well! It\u2019s especially annoying for those of us that were accepted into the same exact UC and top tier college that they were accepted to, but we can\u2019t afford it. It sucks and I just don\u2019t mention that I attend a community college to most people. If it makes you feel any better, I attended one of the high schools that the main college cheating scandal involving all of those celebrities took place out of, so you can just imagine how most people in my area feel about community college.",

I\u2019m not from there but the people from around here feel the exact same way & the convos are so hard because of how toxic the superiority complexes are. It\u2019s so hard when people who never worried about money attempt to be empathetic about not being able to afford it, more often than not it\u2019s cute gesture in theory but an absurdly demeaning execution. And ya bro don\u2019t even get me started on the people attending the universities I got into as well\u2026literally what more can I even do to prove I\u2019m just as competent you :/",

It definitely sucks but at least we can use this as motivation to get us through and transfer. I don\u2019t know about your area, but even if you transfer and graduate from a top school, people still look down upon the fact that you went to a community college in the first place and didn\u2019t complete four straight years at that top school. It also sucks because I\u2019m very involved in my community college and do want to list everything on my resume. But I know it\u2019s smarter to just never list my future AS degrees on my resume once I transfer and never really speak of community college ever again because of the stigma associated with community college.",

At least for me it\u2019s a little easier cause my parents went to the same community college so at they don\u2019t minimize it, but then I feel bad because the comments they hear directed at me are then directed at them as well without the person knowing. \n\nWhat helped me personally is learning about facts my school that I can throw in whenever someone gives me a backhanded compliment. \n\n*\u201cWe\u2019ll community college is just as good\u201d*\n\n\u201cYeah Hofstra (a big, well know university in NY) is down the next block so all my professors split their time between the two colleges.\u201d \nOr\n\u201cYeah hospitals pick nurses with associates from here over one with bachelors because we have such a good reputation. Drs say they can tell a ncc nurse from another nurse without being told.\u201d \nOr\n\u201cIt\u2019s made transferring so much easier. The advisors at the schools I\u2019m looking at say they take students from here against students transferring from other four years with higher gpas because our classes are harder.\u201d\n\nNo matter where you go you can always find *something* to brag about. This isn\u2019t just my school. Community colleges in general have good reputations in the academic world because we don\u2019t get anything handed to us. That\u2019s why all my professors put so much effort into splitting their time when it\u2019s easier to just work at one school, they enjoy working with the students here. \n\nHold your head up friend, I know how hard your working. People will find anyway to make themselves feel better than you cause they\u2019re jealous. They try to put you down because you are a threat to them, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t care. I can\u2019t say it gets easier, but it is worth it.
