People will think that I am stupid if I take a stab at it and answer them all wrong.\n2. People will think I'm a brown-noser if I take a stab at it and answer them all right.\n\nI genuinely learn from and enjoy her lectures and I'd like to let her to know that, I almost feel as if I should reach out to her.

You're just a face in a crowd. (Heck, I probably had hundreds of classmates in my college career - yet I can count how many names I remember with just two hands.) Trust me -- if you ask a stupid question, they'll probably forget all about it by the time they graduate.\n\nNow, **the professor's reaction isn't your problem.** Don't get me wrong, discussion is great, but the professor needs to understand that people may be reluctant to share anything. For example, some of us just don't like talking to/in front of others. If the professor wants a productive discussion, she's going to have to make some adjustments to how she does discussions.",

I\u2019m a much better student now than I was in HS for that reason: I wanted to look cool and fit in, so I didn\u2019t try so hard, slacked off, didn\u2019t answer my teachers, etc. But because of that some friends always tried to one up me. I remember an ass of a friend ranking our intelligences and I remember another bragging that they had higher SAT scores than me. Now THAT feels worse than \u201cbrown nosing\u201d by participating, or trying. \n\nAlso professors, as exhibited by OP, are human too. They will see you trying in their class and if you need the help (e.g. raising your B+ to an A-, retake tests, extensions on papers), they might be more willing to help you if they know who you are and see you participate in class. \n\nAnother anecdote: one (precalc) professor let me retake an exam I had failed, and then split the difference to boost my score. She didn\u2019t do that for anyone else in the class, and that was entirely because I would not only answer her questions, but she saw me at tutoring often and I would always volunteer to do the whiteboard examples. She told me not to tell anyone in class. It helped me so much and I still appreciate it.",
