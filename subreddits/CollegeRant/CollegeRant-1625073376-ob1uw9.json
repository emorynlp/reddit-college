I did retake it, and did better the second time. I made sure I got a different professor, someone who taught in a manner that clicked with me. I had a friend who was SO smart at math, could do all of these super fancy calc equations, but he to was retaking that same algebra class for the sixth time. Even my biology classes can kick my ass. There was a chem class that I had to do three times. I'm somewhat of a perfectionist as well so failure was the absolute worst, but I did learn a lot from the experience.
