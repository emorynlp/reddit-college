So that's what I aimed for. I put just enough effort that I could guarantee a passing grade. And I stopped.\n\nAs someone who takes great pride in their work, is a perfectionist, and HATES handing in stuff I'm not proud of, this was tough to do. But I did it, and I'm happy with my choice. It was nice to not have the headache of trying to perfect something when I'm already so stressed.\n\nTo everyone struggling right now, it's okay to do the bare minimum. It's okay to just skirt by. Times are hard. Do what you need to do to stay afloat.
