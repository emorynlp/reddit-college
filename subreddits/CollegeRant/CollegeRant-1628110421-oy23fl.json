But in these summer months i don't know what to do right now. I'm finishing up my last class prior to getting my degree in two weeks, working two part time jobs, constantly fixing my resume, which sounds good but it doesn't feel as if it's not enough. I love my family i do and I've recently been offered some entry level positions in my field (poli sci) they counter with does it have full benefits, pay, hours etc. Which i understand they mean well but it feels as if they are belittling the slight progress I'm making even with state political officials. To also add living at home also feels as if I'm failing at life.", "author": "thatdude3687", "created": 1628110421, "retrieved": 1632949151, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h7qa5st": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oy23fl/idk_what_to_do_next/h7qa5st/", "text": "Hey, if they're willing to house you until you land a benefits gig with consistent hours, rock on. Save up, and try to make 'em breakfast once in a while. \n\nThat said, it's really hard to land those kind of gigs without work experience, which usually comes from either taking those lower entry level/inconsistent gigs or knowing someone on the inside. Gotta start somewhere. If taking one of those gigs works out, go for it. But keep in mind not to be exploited in the process, which is real hard, and partially what your parents are probably looking out for.\n\nApply, ask for advice, and do the math financially and long term.
