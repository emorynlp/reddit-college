I was literally sobbing bc that would\u2019ve brought my 93 to a 69. I emailed my professor at 1AM and couldn\u2019t sleep all night until they responded the next morning saying that there was glitch in the system so I had until the end of the day. Told myself I would never procrastinate with tests ever again and did it for the next final lol. Good luck on your exam!",
