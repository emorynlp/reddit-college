  "text": "Also part of me is curious if other people went  through the same or if it's only my profs who decided it's going to be a  good idea.\n\nLike the tittle says, I  don't know who or why thought that just because I have to type my  answers on my laptop instead of writing them on paper I need less time  to think.\n\nI took 6 exams this  semester and two of the grades are already up... and of course, they are  not nearly what I expected nor what I could actually write in class.\n\nMy hands were literally trembling because I wasn't able to include 2/3 of the things I actually wanted to write.\n\nAlso  I'm referring only to written exams (multiple choice or essay-type  questions). I just don't understand the logic behind cutting the time in  half - it's not that those who want to cheat are going to be stopped by  the time limit anyways.",

      "text": "Professor here who cut the exam time by 1/3: I did it because I was afraid that long exam times would lead to more cheating. My reasoning was that if the exam is short, you have very little time to look up stuff you didn't prepare for. I would then adjust the grades upwards after the exam, which I did. It turned out my fears of cheating were overblown and it gave students unneccesary anxiety. So, I won't cut the exam time short next time. But yeah, that was my reasoning at the time, which I followed because I simply had no experience with online exams.",

          "text": "I see your point, however, I heard of some 'creative' ways to combat this e.g. people working in groups and out of 20 questions each has to find answers to 5 of them and then share etc. \n\nThis is just a personal opinion but I don't think written exams that aren't strictly monitored can eliminate cheating either for the reason above or because they can just.. copy it from the book and make it seem more \"natural\". Unless there is also an oral exam I don't think cheating can be detected.  \n\nEither way thank you for your answer and for actually reflectining on the outcome and taking into consideration for the next time - many professors don't do this.",

Really have no idea if he's gonna accept it and messaging him at this point is pointless\n\n> I was super anxious because on some of the questions I knew what I had to write more, but I didn't have the time \n\nthis is what has been happening for every exam. I took my statistics exam today which was multiple choice tho we had to show the process of how we ended up with that answer. If you didn't show your methodology properly your answer wouldn't be taken into account ... needless to say it was a whole MESS. \n\n> With both exams they created questions that you would be able to notice  if someone copyied from someone else, so I don't understand why cutting  the exam one hour short. \n\nExactly!! Besides, those who wanna cheat, still are going to cheat so it just isn't doing anything substantial except stressing people out.",

Like why can\u2019t I look at notes??? Im a firm believer that knowledge is not knowing the answer, but knowing where to find it. What is the point of memorizing all this shit!!!! You can\u2019t possibly retain all of the stuff you learn in college so you\u2019re going to forget some of it anyway",
