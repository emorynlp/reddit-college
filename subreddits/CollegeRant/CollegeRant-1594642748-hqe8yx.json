I just don't understand the logic behind cutting the time in  half - it's not that those who want to cheat are going to be stopped by  the time limit anyways.", "author": "hellosandwich_", "created": 1594642748, "retrieved": 1632950615, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fxy6i26": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hqe8yx/im_sorry_but_who_the_fck_decided_that_just/fxy6i26/", "text": "Professor here who cut the exam time by 1/3: I did it because I was afraid that long exam times would lead to more cheating. My reasoning was that if the exam is short, you have very little time to look up stuff you didn't prepare for. I would then adjust the grades upwards after the exam, which I did. It turned out my fears of cheating were overblown and it gave students unneccesary anxiety. So, I won't cut the exam time short next time. But yeah, that was my reasoning at the time, which I followed because I simply had no experience with online exams.", "author": "Marky_Marky_Mark", "created": 1594661721, "upvotes": 8}, "fxxq495": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hqe8yx/im_sorry_but_who_the_fck_decided_that_just/fxxq495/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1594653690, "upvotes": 11}, "fxxn9n6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hqe8yx/im_sorry_but_who_the_fck_decided_that_just/fxxn9n6/", "text": "I\u2019m sick of not being able to \u201ccheat\u201d on essay questions or math tests.
