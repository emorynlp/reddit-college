The class was assigned over 100 pages of reading over the course of 4 days, including the weekend which I have to work so I really only have 2 days to do it. How... HOW am I supposed to read 100 pages of complicated shit that I know I will have to reread and take notes on in 2 days???? Plus I have homework for THREE OTHER CLASSES!!!!! Let\u2019s just say this class isn\u2019t easy to begin with.. it seems really advanced to me and as though you need a background in history(which I haven\u2019t studied in two years) to understand what\u2019s going on.. tried to contact my advisor and she\u2019s not answering :D. I\u2019m so overwhelmed that I basically just broke down last night. So basically this is just a rant on how I will never realistically be able to complete my reading for this class in time, won\u2019t be able to participate in the discussions because I have no clue what\u2019s going on, and knowing that I will then be singled out by my professor for not participating !\n\nTL;DR: Having mental breakdown over 100+ pages of reading for history.", "author": "6elle", "created": 1599918229, "retrieved": 1632843051, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g5489hv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/irctzl/completely_overwhelmed_with_work_load/g5489hv/", "text": "Eventually, you learn to take concise notes. 100 pages of reading SUCKS but at least you are taking this class early on in college and can use the studying habits you learned here later on in your other courses.", "author": "russianbonnieblue", "created": 1600008375, "upvotes": 1}, "g5047fn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/irctzl/completely_overwhelmed_with_work_load/g5047fn/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1599954922, "upvotes": -2}, "g4zqh5k": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/irctzl/completely_overwhelmed_with_work_load/g4zqh5k/", "text": "What textbook are you using and what is the length of the course?

Try dropping the name of the book or literature into google. If you paste the name of the piece of literature into google, Quizlet will usually be one of the first search results that pops up. I will be a senior at the University of Arizona in January 2021. Last semester, i used Quizlet and bullshitted the assignments for my history class (History 203: Ancient Mediterranean Power & Identity) so that I didn\u2019t have to do the reading. I ended up getting an A or B in that class. That class was boring that it made me want to slam my head against the wall repeatedly. Sitting through the professor\u2019s lectures and esoteric ramblings was mentally exhausting.\n\nIt is ok to use online resources to crack the code, so to speak. I barely cracked a textbook last semester because i was able to find everything I needed online. Quizlet was a lifesaver for me last semester.
