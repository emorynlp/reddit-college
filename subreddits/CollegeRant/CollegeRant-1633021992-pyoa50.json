  "text": "Heloo guys ,Im 18(M) joined this college before 1 year.Im learning only in online due to covid for the past 1 year,Im an introvert only talked to few boys and 2 girls over online.Suddenly they forced us to come to offline classes(currently 2nd year).I made a bald cut in the midst of it drastically reduced my exposure to outside.I went to college on Day 1 (as it was new even though im in 2nd year)everything seems good.But from the Day 2 I started to feel lonely even though there are people around me.There are some guys who talk to me and I made effort to speak still I fell they are so different. on the Day 8 (today)A girl approached me(who i spoke in online)she was speaking casually and asked me to speak.I just blantly replied Im a Shy person.she then later talked me when im out alone where she is with her friends(outside the campus)\nI returned home in a depressed state.\n\nI used to watch lot of Anime,Kdrama,webseries and manga etc.And none of my friends in my class know what it is(guys and girls).I also dont watch what they everybody watch eg-cricket,regional meme pages,regional movies etc.What is wrong with me?Im feeling terrible now.now the college will be closed for the next 20 days(day 9 is the last day).Also i lived in the same place for 18 years and went to the same school for 15 years.I really had a great time with my school buddies but this collge thing took a toll on my mental health.most of the guys in my college acting cocky all the time .Also one more thing Me and my mom constantly having quarrels bcoz of my school buddies bcoz we have been hanging out occasionally. She thinks they do drugs and they will change me but in fact they are the purest and most trustable persons i Know...\n\nSORRY FOR THIS IF IT IS NOT RELATED TO COLLEGE.I JUST NEEDED SPACE TO POST WHAT IS IN MY MIND\ud83d\ude37",
