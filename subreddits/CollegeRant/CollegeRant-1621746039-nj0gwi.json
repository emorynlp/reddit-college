I still need to take two more classes before I can take the class I was supposed to be done with by first semester. Bc I can\u2019t take that class yet I\u2019m not eligible for the Chem  class I need to take so I\u2019m behind on that too. I have so many classes I need to take still and will have to do summer school this summer and the summer after next school year. \n\nI\u2019m gonna have to take at least 5-6 classes each term if I want to take my 3rd year on time. Idk if that\u2019s a lot but I also have to work 30-39 hours a week. \n\nBasically I just feel so upset that I\u2019m not gonna be \u201con time\u201d or at the same pace as everyone else and that the next year of my life is gonna be hell. I just wished I had realized sooner how much impact my academic choices in high school would have on me now.", "author": "Cooch_2119", "created": 1621746039, "retrieved": 1632842333, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"gz4qw9f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nj0gwi/so_disappointed_in_myself/gz4qw9f/", "text": "Thank you u/Cooch_2119 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m taking elementary and intermediate algebra rn, then in the second part of summer I\u2019m going to take intermediate so I can take college algebra in the fall in order to take the chem class that requires it as a cocurrent class.\n\nIt\u2019s a pain I feel you. I have to take that fall chem class to get into chem 101 so I can finally take bio classes. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll graduate in three years, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nThe way I look at it, in ten years, it won\u2019t seem so bad. Right now we can only see the beginning and it seems like too much.
