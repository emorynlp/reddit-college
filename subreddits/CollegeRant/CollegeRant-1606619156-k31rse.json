  "text": "I literally have two weeks left of school and one of those is finals week. My professors have been assigning a moderate amount of work for the past semester and now half of them are assigning insane amounts of work. I have one professor that just randomly assigned eight assignments all due on the same day. All that on top of also studying for finals. It\u2019s ridiculous.",
