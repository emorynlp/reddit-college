Your telling me I have to do 3 short essays and 18 multiple choice questions in a single hour ? Seriously, how is anyone supposed to accomplish this in such a short amount of time ? I don't understand why professors have to make tests into some sort of race. Not to mention, there was no timer telling me how much time I had left in the test. So I went 9 minutes overboard and lost quite a few points because of the penalty. Should i email my professor on how unfair the test ?", "author": "Miserable-Quail-1161", "created": 1627181988, "retrieved": 1632949198, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.31, "comments": {"h6js51x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/or3pn5/unfair_online_test/h6js51x/", "text": "I had a math exam in proctorio and the timer disappeared halfway through because of my slow internet connection.
