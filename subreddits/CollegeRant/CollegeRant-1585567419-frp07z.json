Of course, there have been plenty of assignments due during that time. But *not a single prof* reached out to clarify their new expectations until yesterday.\n\nOne prof expects that we've been keeping up with all due assignments (which is reasonable, but would've been nice to have confirmed two weeks ago). Another, who had a major project due date last week - and ignored my emails about it - just posted that the requirements of the project are totally different now, and it won't be due for another week. So basically, if you stayed on top of your work during the hiatus, fuck you.\n\nAnd from the other two? Still no word whatsoever. I understand that this is a difficult time, but seriously? Avoiding their responsibilities just pushes that stress onto us as students, which is a shitty thing to do in an already chaotic situation. How hard is it to send out an email blast? Just say \"Hey, don't stress about the deadlines, we'll deal with it in a week,\" or \"Keep up with x, y, and z so we can move forward in April.\" It's not asking a lot to have a little clarity and peace of mind about my courses through this.", "author": "IntrepidReindeer5", "created": 1585567419, "retrieved": 1632843569, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"flygu0a": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/frp07z/professors_mia/flygu0a/", "text": "Did you reach out?", "author": null, "created": 1585601894, "upvotes": 1}, "flxfu9q": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/frp07z/professors_mia/flxfu9q/", "text": "I believe professors in general should have a mandatory online orientation every year to better understand online assignments.", "author": "Dr-Cres-Chan", "created": 1585582064, "upvotes": 2}, "flxdp4z": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/frp07z/professors_mia/flxdp4z/", "text": "Professor here (see alias).\n\nYour professors are as overwhelmed as you are PLUS they may have children in the house PLUS they have to move everything online (and they may be very inexperienced or unsure as to how to do this). \n\nI did lots of emails and even videos for my students.
