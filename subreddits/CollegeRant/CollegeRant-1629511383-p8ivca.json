I currently am in the end of the second half of the summer session courses I have basically been in class since January and I am soo tired i thought i could just bang it out and get this last senior year over with , with no real break besides from work after i give birth but I can\u2019t and feel like such a failure as a mom and student. Its just a year but I would only have winter break and nothing until graduation next winter. Is it worth it to take the second half off and go back in january or just bang it out and get it over with. Also the classes are only 7 weeks but are pretty intense any advice would be great for this tired mama \ud83d\ude2d.", "author": "Silver_Least", "created": 1629511383, "retrieved": 1632841596, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h9qofki": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p8ivca/taking_the_second_half_of_the_semester_off/h9qofki/", "text": "Thank you u/Silver_Least for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've been feeling pretty burnt out too and I'm also on my senior year. I've been trying to prioritize my mental health first before anything and I think you should as well especially since you are expecting soon (congratulations). I'd see if your institution allows you to change from letter grading to credit/no credit grading.
