Gen Ed\u2019s get a lot of hate but a lot of people don\u2019t feel comfortable committing to a major and sticking with it. You don\u2019t get to explore other options, you do the field you apply for, and lots of students need flexibility. Main issue is also probably student life, most Americans want a \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience, they aren\u2019t going just for the degree, which plays into decision making",
