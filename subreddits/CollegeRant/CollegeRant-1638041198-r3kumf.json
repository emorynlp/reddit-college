  "text": "idk if it was someone that posted in this subreddit or another one about how being home for the holidays causes a decline in their mental heath (i swear i saw it on here somewhere lol) but i definitely notice changes in myself when i get home. not necessarily a decline in my mental health. for me, it\u2019s more so not caring about hygeine, sleeping on the couch in my mom\u2019s living room, and eating like shit (i had doritos and pepsi for breakfast lol). and to top it all off i have a presentation to give and an anatomy exam the week after break. and ofc my mom asks repeatedly \u201cwhen are you gonna go work on your project?\u201d but i genuinely don\u2019t feel like doing anything lol. i like being home to see my family but i would also love if i could actually get a break and not have things to do for school while i\u2019m home.\n\ntl;dr: when i come home for the holidays i become a lot more unmotivated. and school isn\u2019t making things better at all.",
