Imagine if you were in a trade school to be a mechanic. Your instructor talked about the concepts of an engine. How the parts fit together, who invented them, why they work together , and the components they are made out of. Then you get a broken engine and you have no idea how to fix it, because it wasn\u2019t discussed\u2026.no tools were mentioned nor effective processes for reasoning or any examples of how to fix  certain problems. \nThis is how some professors lecture. It\u2019s pure laziness. When I go to a tutor, they do wonderfully. They show an example, explain the reasoning and the tools(equations) necessary to solve the problem, then actually show you how to reason it out. Who would of thought that human beings learn from examples and repetition? \nI swear so much of college is a joke and whenever you have a problem it\u2019s just your fault for not \u201cstudying enough\u201d.\nMaybe the problem is inefficient teaching models.", "author": "Slybooper13", "created": 1632329448, "retrieved": 1632948434, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hea8vxb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ptbovo/i_wont_teach_you_how_to_pass_the_test_i_teach/hea8vxb/", "text": "Thats a good example.

We were in university physics 2. Which is supposed to be a calculus based class on electromagnetics, optics, and a bit of thermodynamics. This prof went out of his way to make the class easier and only used algebraic formulas. No calculus whatsoever. And his teaching style was great. But kids just like you still filed complaints because he wouldn\u2019t work out the exact problems from the exam/quiz. And all of those kids got caught using Chegg. And what did he do? He gave them a break. He let them retake the test. They still cheated. He let them pass anyway. You guys want everything handed to you on a silver platter. You need to be able to critically think for yourself. The professor\u2019s lecture should not be the first time you\u2019re seeing any given material. The textbook is there for a reason. Even the shoddiest textbook provides examples ad infinitum for each concept. If the only way you can pass a class is by having the professor work out the problems that will be on the test, then you should ask yourself if you\u2019re really cut out for this degree program.\n\nAnd before you call someone lazy, you should probably look in the mirror. You want everything handed to you. Why don\u2019t you try and make your own review? It\u2019s not difficult. You literally have a syllabus of what each exam and/or quiz is supposed to cover. The textbook is there. Khan academy is there. There are endless resources for you. Yet you want the prof to give you the solutions essentially. That\u2019s what I call lazy.", "author": "spring081220", "created": 1632333643, "upvotes": -12}}}
