As pretty much the baby, baby of the family I am pretty much an only child. With that in mind, you could understand the connection me and my mother have, just the two of us. \n\nThe problem right now though, revolves around college. \n\nIn June of 2021, I graduated high school, so naturally, in September of 2021, I started college. When I was touring colleges, my mom had my back 100%, but it feels like that has changed. All the colleges I looked at were out of state, and the college I chose is 7 hours away from my home. Not only did I chose this college for the education program, but also because it was far away. Living in a small town during COVID was awful. Like living in a small town, in general, isn't the best, but during a pandemic its pretty much death. \n\nI was so excited to go to college in August. But, when it came to move-in day my nerves kicked in and I started looking at colleges to transfer to. But now I don't want to transfer, but my mom wants me to. \n\nIn the beginning, after my mom left, I was dead set on leaving. I had not the best roommate. she wasn't mean or anything, she was actually wicked sweet but exactly like me. But, she is gone now. she couldn't handle being away so she went to a school closer to home.\n\nEverything has started looking up here. I have a great small friend group. my closest friend here is my new roommate since she was having roommate troubles as well. I changed my major to secondary education with a concentration in English and I couldn't be more excited. I am getting back into my paintings and back into playing tennis. I am actually enjoying myself. \n\nBut the problem is, my mom is dead set on me transferring for the spring semester. She wants me closer to home and at a smaller school. I don't want to leave, but my opinion doesn't matter... because if I try to cross my mother she cuts me off with the snap of a finger. she stops talking to me and threatens to leave me on my own with no help. \n\nI am debating whether or not to involve one of my older siblings to help me convince her to let me stay for at least the year. the sibling that I would get involved is her favorite child, and she always listens to him. but would that get me in trouble? \n\nI am thinking about giving up and just letting her drag me along like a puppet. I don't want to lose her and if something like college is going to do that then I feel like maybe I should just follow and let her make the decisions for me. no? \n\nI'm confused. I'm lost and I need help.", "author": "Anna17865", "created": 1631765523, "retrieved": 1632948524, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hd1r9qj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp64rk/my_mom_wants_me_to_transfer_colleges_but_i_dont/hd1r9qj/", "text": "talk to her. tell her you like it there and don\u2019t want to transfer. communication is key. if you need to involve your siblings then do it too", "author": "AffectionateDoctor93", "created": 1631772454, "upvotes": 1}, "hd1h9zm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp64rk/my_mom_wants_me_to_transfer_colleges_but_i_dont/hd1h9zm/", "text": "Just tell her that you will visit more often or something.
