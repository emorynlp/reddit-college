I learned quickly that universally difficult subjects like physics can be made enjoyable given the right professor. That is, one whose goal is to put his students first. But if your, or anyone's, course is nothing but reading from the textbook or hours worth of problem-solving in some BS platform like ALEKS or MyMathLab, that professor is lazy AF and would reasonably make any student hate the subject.\n\nIf you can, try using ratemyprofessors for future classes.
