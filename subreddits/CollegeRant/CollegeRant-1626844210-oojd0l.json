Some people have no problem commercializing space travel but the facts are that the planet is dying. It's too hot, the birds are sick, natural disasters are getting worse, the pollinators and amphibians are dissapearing at an outrageous pace. There isn't a single part of the planet that hasn't been touched by garbage. We need money to go towards conserving the planet and reversing damage. \n\nGovernments are only trying to look towards green energy because the problems with pollution and greenhouse gasses are becoming so severe that its going to cost them more from environmental disasters like wild fires, floods, and emergency aid, than to ignore the problems futher. Not to mention the battle for oil. Even then whatever they do is mostly for their own personal gain. New companies are going to make bank in green energy and that's the only reason they're racing towards it. Because it's \"popular\" now. Because they can make money. Because we're screwed and need to fix things. What am I working towards? Am I going to dedicate a lifetime of research towards conserving the planet and its species only for my progress to be purposefully slowed so the rich can have their fun? Will any work that I do be instantly reversed because of the negligence of the most politcally powerful people? There are way too many areas to focus on and I can only dedicate myself to one. I want to cry. If they don't think that this planet can be saved then I don't want to fight this hard for it anymore, and the real work hasn't even started yet. \n\nTL;DR: I feel like Mr. Incredible at the beginning of the first movie, \"No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to STAY SAVED, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?!\" It's so discouraging to want to save the planet just to watch it get trashed and the problems ignored by the same people who should be fixing it.", "author": "EveryDisaster", "created": 1626844210, "retrieved": 1632841743, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h5yuccl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oojd0l/careermajor_choice_is_the_most_discouraging/h5yuccl/", "text": "Thank you u/EveryDisaster for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
