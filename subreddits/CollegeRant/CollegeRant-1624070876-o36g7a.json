  "text": "Hi! Just wanna rant a bit cause that\u2019s what I do when I get anxious and panicky about my studies. I\u2019m having finals right now, just completed my Accounting and Marketing exams on the 15th and 16th. They were alright. \n\nBut the point is that I\u2019m having my Law exam this 22nd and I\u2019m studying the whole syllabus last minute :D After like 6 weeks of this semester, I stopped focusing during lectures. I didn\u2019t participate during tutorial sessions so basically I didn\u2019t practice any Law questions. It\u2019s just so mf hard to focus during online classes. I just get sleepy all the time! I actually planned to set aside like 12 days to study for my Law exam. But i kept procrastinating, and soon 12 days became 6 days :D\n\nLaw imo, has so many layers and rules to it. When I think I\u2019ve grasped a concept, I read the cases and suddenly I don\u2019t understand anything. The subject just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s dry and I have no motivation to study it. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what else to say. I feel like I wanna rant so much more but there\u2019s nothing left to say. \n\nI\u2019m gonna update here again and let you guys know what I get for my exams. Don\u2019t forget meeeeee.",
