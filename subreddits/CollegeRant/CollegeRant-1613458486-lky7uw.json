Lots of family and friends are practically throwing new furniture at us. We should be able to go home in a few weeks. Gofundme from friends and family has been able to replace important things like bedding and the like. Made a 100% on this doodoo assignment. Thanks everyone.\n\nUpdate: I totally argued with myself on my own points and everything, nailed it.\n\nMy group in a mandatory arts class (why do they call it an elective then) had an assignment to post a writing assignment on a Canvas discussion, then reply to two other students on their writing. It's due at 8 AM, in seven hours.\nDesktop Canvas has been down for us all day, but mobile works fine.\nI busted my ASS to write the ENTIRE thing on mobile, source links off my computer and all.\nAnd no one else replied. I have no other two students to reply to.\nHalf of my apartment just burned down last night and both of my cats died and I STILL did my assignment. Where the frick is everyone else? Am I gonna reply to myself?! I might do that if I don't see anything by 2 AM. I need to sleep though. Everything hurts physically emotionally and mentally and I have a lot of running around tomorrow to replace the basics I lost in the fire, plus my son's online schooling, plus whatever the fuck hellfire and brimstone my landlady is gonna rain down on me for the damage to the apartment.\nJust... Do your damn work. Stop making it hard for everyone else.
