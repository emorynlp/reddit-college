It\u2019s 4 years of being bogged down and stuck without a decent salary, and without much choice. I have done 2 years of community and still could not get into the only school I sort of was excited for. The other one kind of sucks but I can\u2019t move on with my life until I graduate. At this point I\u2019m just looking for entry level jobs without the degree and hoping for the best. I\u2019m going to be doing part time school so I\u2019ll graduate still unless I don\u2019t pass calculus which isn\u2019t even relevant for my major. Why doesn\u2019t anyone talk about this? I feel so stuck and it\u2019s sucking the life out of me.
