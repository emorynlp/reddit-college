  "text": "Hey, so I was a student worker for this health center that is kind of part of my school but they consider themselves as an independent organization. I began my work there as a volunteer, first, but then I got the opportunity to transition into a paid position. To make it short, I worked as a paid student worker for five weeks. I had to quit due to personal reasons.\n\nI sent a resignation email last night, and I got a reply from one of my supervisor saying that they CAN'T backpay me because apparently the documents I sent in for the HR onboarding paperwork hasn't been processed (and they've been 'processing' it for a long time, there's been a huge delay with everything.)  They said that if I resign now, then I won't be getting my paycheck because I am technically not on payroll, but I have signed up for work as a PAID worker regardless. This doesn't seem fair and I truly don't want to go back there. I've sent an email directly to the HR, but as you know with college bureaucrats, I have little faith in them resolving the issue.\n\nI just want to know what my next steps are.",

As long as you have proof of hours worked (clock-in receipts, security camera footage, logbooks, etc.), they MUST pay you for those hours. They CANNOT NOT pay you for hours worked.",
