I don\u2019t usually let that crap get to me but I\u2019ve worked so /hard/. Straight A student, STEM awards, Highest Honors, I self study, I know 2 fucking languages for Christ sake and she\u2019s more worried about how I\u2019m 25 and starting my bachelors. I just grew up thinking someone would be proud of me. I don\u2019t do this for her or anyone besides myself but damn\u2014 I just thought I would be able to say that my parents were proud of me for going to school.
