We're in a pandemic.", "text": "I'm a junior psych major and this semester of online class has literally been hell on earth for me, as i'm sure it has been for a lot of other students. At this point i'm convinced i'm simply not made for online learning, which is a scary realization considering I don't know when i'm going to be back on campus again. My grades have suffered tremendously. I made a 3.6 last semester now i'll be lucky if I get a 2.5 this time around. I know it could be worse, but it's hard to see it that way when i've set such a rigid standard for myself for so long.\n\nI keep trying to reassure myself that things were simply out of my control, and there is really nothing much I could have done about it. But even though I understand that, I can't help but feel so defeated.\n\nI know there are students out there who had the same challenge with online classes as I did, but being surrounded by friends who are making the same grades they've always made or straight up thriving with the online semester makes me feel even worse. And even the ones that were struggling somehow pulled through and it seems like i'm the only one who's come out with shitty grades. I know everyone's experience is going to be unique and I shouldn't compare myself to anyone else but I keep wondering if maybe I could have done more, studied harder or stayed up later. \n\nHonestly, I know deep down I should really just cut myself some slack. Sometimes I think as college students we have tendency to be too hard on ourselves. We set these rigid standard and beat ourselves up when we fail even when it's obvious the odds were stacked against us. I'm sure we can all agree this year was awful, this entire semester has been so unprecedented, I mean we're literally living through a pandemic. If there's any year we should be able to give ourselves a break it's 2020. It's gonna take me a while to fully accept this, and I go back and forth between acceptance and feeling like a loser about 50 times a day but if anyone else is going through this same thing, **this semester doesn't define who you are as a student.** You're still doing amazing sweetie. \n\nAnyway, like I said, i'm still struggling to practice what I preach and you know what they say, misery loves company. Is anyone else struggling with a huge drop in their grades? Come cry with me and complain about this dumpster fire of a semester.", "author": "cherriblossom_", "created": 1607656828, "retrieved": 1632843500, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gfleesr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kaul7a/come_cry_with_me_also_cut_yourself_some_slack/gfleesr/", "text": "God, I fucking feel this to a tee!

Just took a math final and bombed the hell out of it. Math professor didn\u2019t bother to teach and would send pre-recorded bland videos (class was marked as in-person).

Shit like this sucks because, no matter how hard you try or how hard you want to succeed, the accountability of it being you is pressed by everyone when in reality it was 100% the professor.
