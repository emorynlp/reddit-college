This professor told us he would accept late assignments up until 2 days ago and none of them have been graded. And even without that, there were online assignments that required us to buy the textbook to gain access but we couldn\u2019t complete them because the bookstore didn\u2019t have our textbooks until 4 weeks into the semester. He promised us that all we had to do was email him screenshots of our scores and he would change them from the zeros we got for completing them late. I completed those assignments as soon as o got the textbook and emailed him right after and he still has not graded him even though multiple people in class have reminded him. Also one of my EXAMS doesn\u2019t have a grade. My grade is still a 93% without these assignments in but I know there are people who are depending on those grades to bump their\u2019s up. Plus I\u2019m transferring schools and need my gpa to be as high as it can get so I can get the most money I can put of my new school and an A instead of an A- would be great. I\u2019m so pissed off.", "author": "kviiiie", "created": 1608695363, "retrieved": 1632950739, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ggue3ei": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kilfx8/grades_were_due_today_and_my_professor_hasnt/ggue3ei/", "text": "I had a professor before who didn't even grade any of the 8 assignments until finals week. I assumed that he was just going to be chill and give us all an A just for doing them, but he ended up giving almost everyone in the class 60% on every assignment. They were programming assignments and they all worked perfectly. I even emailed him to ask why I got 60% because there was no feedback and he even acknowledged that they all worked fine but said that he didn't care whether they worked or not, but that we did not do it how he wanted. But the assignments didn't specify how to do it just what the program needed to do.\n\nHe didn't even show up to the first day of class without notice, never even apologized for that, and he ended up canceling like 1/3 of the classes throughout the semester because his house was being renovated or whatever.

The professor emailed me two days before final grade submissions and was like \u201cI hate your final project because it\u2019s a PowerPoint\u201d. Mind you, this was a project-based course with an emphasis on research. There were only a few things that made up your final cumulative grade and for this particular project, we had to get their approval for several steps. I asked early on if the format of my project could be a PowerPoint, and they were all for it. \n\nIn the email, they said it wasn\u2019t formal enough to their liking anymore. We had a back and forth and through asking more questions, I noticed they started saying \u201cwork\u201d. Turns out, they hadn\u2019t graded anything I had turned in since early November. After asking several times what was wrong with all of these assignments, they sent me a follow-up email of a few small complaints per assignment (something they could\u2019ve just taken points off of and called a day). I had to convince them to let me pull an all-nighter of revisions on these assignments, because they wanted to turn in their grades early. \n\nNote: I had gotten A\u2019s on everything else I had submitted. They had given me excellent feedback and said I was doing really good work; so this email was bewildering to me. Personally, I think they got stressed and had all types of deadlines. This professor also does their own research and does a lot of professional submissions and publications. We had two textbooks for this class. One was co-written by them and they had submitted a chapter to the other one. At some point, our zoom classes had nothing to do with our work and grades and it was just them bragging about their accomplishments and what they were researching. I think they had a lot on their plate and expected me to fall in line. But instead of being humble about it, they tried to turn it around on me; like I didn\u2019t do what I was supposed to do.", "author": "skioo8", "created": 1608737591, "upvotes": 3}, "ggsl1ae": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kilfx8/grades_were_due_today_and_my_professor_hasnt/ggsl1ae/", "text": "This is fairly normal in my experience TBH.

I wouldn't know if this is their normal behavior, but with the pandemic they might be going through some crap.\n\n(But I also know that just because crap is happening, it doesn't make it an excuse for you to just drop your obligations. The professor should have figured out getting help or communicating about their situation)\n\nI hope your grades come in soon.", "author": "still_trying_my_best", "created": 1608696042, "upvotes": 41}}}
