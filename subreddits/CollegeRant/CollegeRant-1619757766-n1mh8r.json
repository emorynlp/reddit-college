I had a student miss an interview for a position at my lab, he wrote a very apologetic letter and we re-scheduled. I ended up hiring this student, that incident did not impact my decision. We developed a great relationship and he's doing amazing. My point is, this mishap doesn't define you, you need to be kinder and more forgiving to yourself. If the professor has not answered it's likely because he receives tons of e-mails a day and may take time to get to yours.", "author": "turanga_lilly", "created": 1619906081, "upvotes": 2}, "gwgptaj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n1mh8r/i_overslept_and_missed_a_5minute_zoom_conference/gwgptaj/", "text": "I just did the same thing!
