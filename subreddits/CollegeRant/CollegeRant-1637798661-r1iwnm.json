  "title:": "Short rant about being home for break",
  "text": "I would rather stay in my 10x8 dorm room that I share with a roommate I hardly ever talk to. Sleeping in the same bed I slept in all throughout high school (which was not a good experience) is not helping my mental health at all. I have no new college friends (I\u2019m in my first semester) and I\u2019m completely okay with that (seriously), but reconnecting with my 2 best friends from high school that I last saw 3 months ago has made me sink into a bad place. I love my family, but I hate the high school memories and feelings my room and my house are making me remember and feel. I don\u2019t particularly like or hate college, I just don\u2019t want to be reminded of how I felt in high school. Especially since these last 3 months have been monumental in allowing me to not be as sad. \n\nTldr my house makes me sad\n\nEdit: deleted a sentence that didn\u2019t matter \ud83e\udd20",

Home wasn't the greatest and the experience was always terrible but thankfully, things got better. Eventually I learned how to manage it all but every now and again it gets bad. It won't always be easy but it does get better. I can only hope the same for you",
