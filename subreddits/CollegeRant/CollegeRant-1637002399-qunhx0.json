  "text": "I'm burnt tf out man. \n\nI didn't even do these two assignments and now I'm at a C in this one class. I know it's my fault. I'm just not happy studying this subject. I keep thinking I absolutely hate school but I still paid for these classes. \n\nNow I only have one week left before the semester ends. I know damn well I'm not gonna pass the final exam cuz I have a terrible study method but I have one more project left to do this week to get some points. Someone give me some motivation, advice, or tell me I'm not the only one here.",

It\u2019s a sunk cost fallacy to keep taking the course because you paid for it. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cluck\u201d to pass the course.\n\n\nTake less classes in the future.\n\nHoly shit you vent a lot. You can message me if you want someone to listen",
