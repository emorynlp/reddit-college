  "text": "In my 3rd year of university and I still feel lost, I've switched majors three times and I'm currently an economics major. To be quite honest I don't fully understand what I can do with my degree I picked it because I was already in my 2nd year and had a previous major in the college of business and most of my credits would transfer over to this degree as well as me actually liking and being good at economics. Despite these reasons though, I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I graduate, and  I'm very anxious at the thought of just getting a degree, being in debt, and not having a steady source of income when I have to start paying off those loans. \n\nSometimes I feel that my major is not the right major for me. Even though I enjoy it, I would be at peace if I had chosen a more \"in-demand\" career/major like most people in STEM do. For context I'm a 1st gen college student, my parents are immigrants, my family has struggled financially my whole life, and I fell like I'm going to struggle in the same way as well.\n\nLong story short I would just like to know if anybody out there feels the same or might be going through the same situation, I'm not really asking for help but any advice or any stories of yall's would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Passion will take you farther than your degree. The degree opens doors, but your passion with land you the job you want. Do any of us know what we are doing? Generally, no. Just go with the flow and trust your gut. You are making the right decision by following what makes you happy. Ive seen that the degree doesnt matter as much as you think it does. For example, my friends tech company just hired a self-taught engineer with a BA in history.",

I'm kinda worried too and don't really know what a good major for me is. Did you try speaking to career services at your school? I'm about to do that.",
