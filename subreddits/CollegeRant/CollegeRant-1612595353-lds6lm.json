I'm hard pressed to find another year in the history of college that something like this happened where we can't live our college lives.

It sucks that I haven't even seen the campus I weirdly pay for stuff like \"cleaning\" and \"security' in my tuition, and that I didn't get to sit with my classmates and get to actually know people and leave my house and such.\n\nBut on the other hand: the only reason why I even started school was because of the pandemic- in my country you have to take a special exam in addition to your highschool grades as they appear in your diploma to get to study the subject of your choosing, it's sort of like the SATs and it's very controversial here because a lot of people just pay private programs to teach them how to pass the exam, so it creates a situation in which if you're rich and have the money to pay for those programs you'll pass, and if not well sucks for you.. as you can probably tell I'm highly against it as I discriminating and actually not a good indicator of a person's ability to study and their academic potential. Due to the pandemic that national test was cancelled and the universities allowed people who didn't take it to do one of two options: take an internal exam written by the department you want to study in, or to enroll on a status of \"on condition\" with you having to get a certain mark at specific classes, and if you pass (because those courses are already a mandatory part of your degree) you just start the next semester where you stopped.
