  "text": "Hey guys hope everyone is having a fantastic day. Currently wanting to cry over my latest chem exam. Does anyone else really struggle hard with this subject?\n\nI do really well in the labs, partner or no partner. But I'm in ochem 2 now and the classes themselves are barely passable for me. I had to take ochem 1 2.5 times (all online, and the half class was an emergency withdrawal due to adverse life circumstances) and the highest I got was a C-. I got Bs in both general chem classes. Ochem 2 I'm set to have a C.\n\nI'm majoring in biology and I'm good with bio classes. Just the chem ones are butchering my gpa.",

I don\u2019t have any advice for you other than to keep up the good work and get help if you need it from tutoring or YouTube.\n\nGood luck, from a fellow bio major",
