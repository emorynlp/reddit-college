I definitely think COVID and other shit that happened in my life the last year have are big components as to why I\u2019m having such a shitty experience, but that isn\u2019t all of it.\n\nCollege just sucks rn. I feel so dumb compared to everyone else and I truly do feel like the smallest fish just struggling to stay afloat in the biggest pool ever. On top of all of that, I literally haven\u2019t made any friends and there\u2019s no one that I really vibe with like that. I constantly feel empty, lonely, and so unmotivated. I have to consistently force myself to do my work and absolutely no passion, interest, or excitement goes into doing it.\n\nHigh school wasn\u2019t like this. With the exception of the SHITTIEST possible senior year, high school was fun. I was always excited for the most part and looked forward to seeing friends and learning new things. I was heavily involved and I was thriving. Now I have no motivation or ambition and I feel like I\u2019m just doing things out of necessity.\n\nOn top of this, there\u2019s pressure on me to succeed because someone is relying on me getting a job after college for personal reasons. That pressure, on top of the isolating feelings of COVID, having no fucking friends, and ending high school with experiences from shitty ass people has honestly made me feel so terrible.\n\nOh also, I\u2019ve had more panic attacks this school year than I think I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Nobody told me expensive ass tuition came with increased anxiety and depression. I feel so hopeless. I can\u2019t fail bc of people relying on me but everything is hurting my mental health so much. \n\nI barely have anyone to talk to and I feel like talking to others makes me a burden so sometimes I just say fuck it and keep it all in. I hate college so much so far and I wish I could go back to the easy parts of high school.", "author": null, "created": 1612448971, "retrieved": 1632842836, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"glznpgz": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lcgsqq/college_is_so_depressing_lol_help_plz/glznpgz/", "text": "Thank you u/dataenthusiastanon for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s been very difficult to watch all of you have to navigate what should have been an amazing part of your lives during a pandemic and my heart breaks for all of you.  I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing I told my twins.  Just because a school seemed right and you committed doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right one for you. You can change. You can find a better fit where you\u2019ll have friends and people who make you feel welcome. You can change majors. Do what makes you happy. College isn\u2019t about your parents, it\u2019s about you. One of mine did switch schools and is so much happier now.  Be true to yourself.   And reach out for help, there is no shame in taking care of you. \n\nAnother thing I would encourage is to look for social media opportunities to meet people. My son joined a discord group for his school last summer. From there he met a number of other freshmen and then formed their own discord. He was remote last semester, by choice, but this allowed him to make a group of close friends on campus.  He moved in with one last month on campus and now has a friends group that he spends his spare time with and whose company he enjoys.  I don\u2019t know that, in this climate, he would have been able to find them all on campus and would likely be quite lonely.    His twin sister made many friends on IG before going to campus and it\u2019s made her experience at a new school much better.", "author": "elizabethrubble", "created": 1612705747, "upvotes": 2}, "gm49963": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lcgsqq/college_is_so_depressing_lol_help_plz/gm49963/", "text": "I totally get where you're coming from. When I was a freshman (2017), I had so many issues going on with my family, and I wasn't making friends. I became very depressed. I'm a senior now, and I still don't have friends in college. The only friend I have right is my boyfriend, and I have my mom and my sister. I had to learn that it's just simply harder to make real friends in college than high school.  I also felt like everyone else was smarter than me, but I realized that the person that acts like they know alot usually doesn't. The way college is protrayed is a fantasy. In real life, college is stressful and hard.

I haven't felt *this* depressed before COVID.\n\nI was still depressed before COVID because of my avoidant personality disorder (AVPD), but college was definitely a lot more fun before COVID (I'm a Senior) and this pandemic has certainly **amplified my depression**.\n\nI'm typically an A-B student, but I'm already ditching most of my classes at the start of this semester and I'm even ditching my federal work study.\n\nI'm constantly bored and I don't have any motivation in school or work anymore.

I was lonely, bored, and burnt out. These feeling had gradually built up since August, and they fully emerged in October after avery stressful event and bad grades. I was able to recover slightly over winter break because my friends came home. However, I feel those emotions gradually building up again.\n\nI ambitious, social, and happy in high school, too. Everything seemed perfect.\n\nWe, the class of 2020, really have it tough, and I don't think others fully comprehend our situation. We had the best year of school, senior year, cut short at the best part when there was hardly homework and we had established college plans. We were ripped away from our friends before we could give our somewhat official graduation goodbyes. We couldn't spend one last summer with our high school friends and go out with a bang. That chapter of our lives was thrown into a fire before it was complete.\n\nEven worse, we have no friends in college and can't make any either because of restrictions. Unless a student was part of a group that all went to one college or doesn't follow safety guidelines, he/she is now completely alone. I am one of these students. Only one other person went to the same college as me, so I know 1 person at my college out of many thousands.\n\nOther college students might say, \"Oh it isn't that bad. We just can't hang out.\" You already had college friends.

I'm talking English teachers swapping out Shakespeare units for easier units on historical children's stories and math teachers turning their final exams into more fun \"would you rather\" quizzes. Not to mention, class of 2020 just bonding over all of our senior activities getting cancelled and post-grad plans changing (so many fucking memes!!!) \n\nAlso the fact that we all just kept hope going by assuming that everything would be back to normal by summer/fall 2020 (remember those days? lol) \n\nIn college, the professors don't really care as much and are basically just using the remote format to put more responsibility on the students instead of themselves. My current math professor only teaches for half the lecture period (the other half is \"teamwork\" in breakout rooms). Two of my professors don't even have live class sessions, and only one of them actually bothers to post pre-recorded lectures for us (not that they're especially helpful :/) \n\nAnd new friends and student bonding? Please. I haven't talked to anyone outside of my classes. My college at least tries with virtual events, but they're pretty low quality and attendance is non-existent (maybe everyone's busy with aLL THE FUCKING WORK PROFESSORS KEEP ASSIGNING FOR NO REASON?????). It's only been 2 or 3 weeks into the new semester, and I'm already so fucking burnt out", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1612451487, "upvotes": 3}}}
