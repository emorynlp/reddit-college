  "text": "Realistically, you have only 60 hours per week that isn\u2019t sleeping, eating, or walking. Out of those 60 hours per week, a student who isn\u2019t cheating can easily hit 60 hours per week of academics if they have a large workload for classes. It is very hard to time manage yourself out of that",
