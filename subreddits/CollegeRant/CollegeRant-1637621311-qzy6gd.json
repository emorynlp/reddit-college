  "text": "I can\u2019t get myself to work on anything even if I like the class/project and I know if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll probably fail the classes and won\u2019t graduate anyway. At this point I\u2019m trying to forget about the grade and just get something finished to turn in but just thinking about it all is making me not do anything. I don\u2019t really want to end the past 4.5 years barely passing but I\u2019m just over everything involving school right now idk how the hell im supposed to deal with an actual job after this",

You'll be done with it unless you continue your studies. This kind of thing you just have to look on the bright side and do everything you can to finish strong.",
