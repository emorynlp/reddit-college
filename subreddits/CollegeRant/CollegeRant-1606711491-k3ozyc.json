Use google scholar. It gives you the widest array of research. However you also should use your library database as well for a more nuanced look at what you're looking for. I noticed that you're searching for something about happiness and family time (?) so type in society AND family time or happiness AND family or something like that, not your entire thesis statement. Look at every article that's title seems to be something about what you're working on!\n2. If you come across an article that you can't access and your school doesn't have access, DO NOT PAY FOR IT!! Read the abstract, see if it has some type of similarity with what you're studying. If it does use this website\n\n[https://sci-hub.se/](https://sci-hub.se/)\n\nIt removes all of the barriers for the article and most likely has the article you need in a full PDF! I've been using it forever and it has not failed me yet. Just make sure to type in the DOI because that usually gives me better results over just the article title.\n\n3) Great you have the article in full but there's no way you can read this many articles in this short amount of time, that's were this website comes in.\n\n[https://www.skimcast.com/](https://www.skimcast.com/)\n\nThis website highlights the most important points of an academic article. IT MAY miss some things so it is not 100% perfect. If you're really trying to be smart and have time, read one article in it's entirety and then read it with a 30% skim and see how much it misses to see how much skim it takes you to \"get\" the gist of the article. I feel comfortable around 35% because some of the tertiary points get missed with just 30%. Read the highlighted stuff and see if the gist of the article makes sense, cite it and BAM! By no time you'll have enough research to feel comfortable talking about it in your paper!\n\nGood luck happy researching !", "author": "Jumpy-Comfort", "created": 1606750745, "upvotes": 1}, "ge5lqp3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k3ozyc/710_page_research_paper_draft_for_english_class/ge5lqp3/", "text": "At least it\u2019s a draft, I feel that.
