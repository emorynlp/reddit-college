  "text": "I am and honestly I got so tired of doing so many writing assignments that I half ass them especially if they say type 250 words for the first post and 150 for the replying post. Like I just write and make my post sound dumb to get that many words. Surprisingly I still have As in all my classes while I\u2019m doing that. So I was wondering am I the only one that does that or do other people do that too? I despise writing since that is not my favorite subject but I still try to have my assignments done.",

      "text": "I like writing, but the writing required for discussion posts and shit like it is super contrived. There are those stupid minimums and maximums, mention a quote that stood out to you, recommend a worksheet, blah blah blah. I know that in a way it\u2019s just training you to put up with shit you don\u2019t want to do, but why does my fucking math class have discussion posts? Why?",
