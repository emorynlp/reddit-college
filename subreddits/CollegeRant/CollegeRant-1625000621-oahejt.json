I managed to scrape by in community college with my lousy savings but now I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ll be able to get enough in loans to cover my costs. No financial aid, applied for every scholarship under the sun with no luck so far, and I have no one to co-sign my loans. It feels like everything is against me. If one more person tells me to fill out the FAFSA, I\u2019m gonna scream. I get so close to throwing my laptop out the window when I have to fill out that sham every year. Unfortunately, no one cares about you and your shitty, abusive home life if your parents make enough money. All through high school,  I was told, \u201cdo good on the ACT, you\u2019ll get free money, you won\u2019t need loans, the FAFSA will give you money.\u201d What a joke. My life feels more worthless than ever.", "author": "trying2getoverit", "created": 1625000621, "retrieved": 1632842158, "over_18": true, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3hgjk7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oahejt/never_hated_life_more_than_when_trying_to_pay/h3hgjk7/", "text": "Thank you u/trying2getoverit for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not like im broke and I will get pell grants. My family is upper middle class but I have a dad in college, my mother is in a lot of debt, I have three siblings, 2 of them in high school and one is going to be a senior applying to college this fall. We have mortgage, have to pay monthly payments for three cars, monthly bills, gas, groceries for a family of 6. Sometimes we don't have too much to spare\n\nMy mom managed to pay for my first two semesters of college by working overtime. I paid for  summer and my second year of college working two part time jobs and a $1000 scholarship that I won from my community college (low competition). \n\nI just graduated from community college and earned my associates degree. I will be starting my third year of college with no debt. I plan to continue working to pay for my third year, which should be manageable because its 2 classes at a CC and 2 at a university.\n\nWon't be completing a fourth year, most pharmacy schools do not require a bachelor's. My third year is just finishing up some prerequisties. I only applied to fafsa my third year in case I didn't make enough to pay for it I can use a stafford loan.", "author": "TheRapidTrailblazer", "created": 1625004426, "upvotes": 7}}}
