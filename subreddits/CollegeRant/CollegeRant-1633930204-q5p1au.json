  "text": "I know I be joking about it but srsly, my college class teacher just announced that tomorrow in class we have to pair up and work in groups for a project worth a lot of our grade. The problem is, I do NOT know how to talk to people. I don\u2019t know anyone in my class while the other students all seem to get along,  and the teacher is making us choose who we wanna be with, instead of her making the groups for us. Feel like imma be left out smh\n\nMy social anxiety is going through the roof bruh judge me all ya want but this is how I feel, anybody else? I have zero anxiety when it\u2019s just me presenting, but working in groups spikes my anxiety and idk what to do about it. May be my huge fear of rejection so does anybody know how tf to deal w that shit?? Please gimme dat sweet ol advice or share your experiences, as I can\u2019t go to sleep over this please help me I feel hella alone in this boat",

They're in college for a reason bigger than \"that's what you do after high school,\" mean business, and probably don't give two shits about your social skills so long as you do your work.",

      "text": "I feel this so hard.\n\nI really wish I knew what to tell you to make it easier.\n\nSometimes you just gotta wing it and just go talk to someone.\n\nI know it's so awkward talking to people you don't know and I hated that about high school. Not that this is very relevant, but this is a big part of why I decided to do college online for a little bit while I'm figuring stuff with my anxiety out.\n\nIn high school, I kinda would just try to look for someone in my class who seemed just as awkward and nervous as me and ask them if they had a partner already. A lot of the time, I ended up partnering with people who were actually really nice and smart. \n\nI know that might seem kinda weird, but honestly, it's kinda helpful to think about how other people are probably in the same boat as you even if it doesn't seem like it.\n\nI know social anxiety can be so \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16, but I feel like if you just pretend you're not scared for a few minutes while people are choosing their partners, it might make you seem a bit more approachable. \n\nIdk, I probably didn't explain that very well but I hope that helps, even if just a little!\n\nGood luck with everything!!",
