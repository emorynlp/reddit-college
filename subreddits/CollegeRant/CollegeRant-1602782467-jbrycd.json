The issue is I can\u2019t stand this online stuff, I\u2019m not a book learner at all and I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything. \n\nI\u2019m trying my best with it, giving it like 6 or more hours a day and I still feel I\u2019m struggling. (I\u2019m so invested in it bc I have a full ride scholarship rn but it requires me to keep high grades) \n\nHonestly tho all of this wouldn\u2019t be that hard other than 1-2 classes I have. My one class the teacher doesn\u2019t teach or have any interactions with us, all he does is post 2 assignments a week which are time consuming but easy to do. I\u2019m okay with that but then we have an exam after every 3-4 chapters and the exams are wild, they\u2019re nothing like the other assignments he gives, they\u2019re nothing even like the book; for example one question was asking for the definition of a word and when I went into my notes to look at the definition (which were allows to) the book definition wasn\u2019t even on the exam nor anything close to it! It\u2019s like we\u2019re studying the wrong book. To make it worse we only get a minute for each question so that\u2019s about 20 seconds to read and then 10 seconds to read all the answers leaving 30 seconds to process and decide which answers best, which can be hard bc some of them require math or just take a minute to understand. And the final cherry on top is these exams count as 80% of our overall grade. \n\nAnd the reason I say he refuses to teach us is because every time I email him, he gives a copy and paste type answer like \u201cthe key to success in my class is hard work, motivation, and focus\u201d or some bs like that or he\u2019ll just give the classic \u201cthis is college, it\u2019s just like this\u201d and when I ask a question regarding the topic or try to ask to set up a meeting time to talk about stuff I don\u2019t understand he dodges those questions (I\u2019ve emailed him 3 times about that)\n\nThe other class is a math class which I\u2019m fine with I just suck at math nothing big there tho.\n\nAlso am I the only one that feels teachers decided for online school to replace teaching with just more work? Bc idk bout u but I\u2019ve been swamped with work load after work load\n\nAnyway this has been my small rant about how online school is sucking for me, just trying to get it out and maybe hear some advice or anything", "author": "Working_History", "created": 1602782467, "retrieved": 1632842949, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 122, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g9nf0bi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jbrycd/online_school_is_kicking_my_ass/g9nf0bi/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1603376944, "upvotes": 1}, "g8z4445": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jbrycd/online_school_is_kicking_my_ass/g8z4445/", "text": "I have the same exact thing happening in my gen chem class where we will do super easy, almost intro to chem type work, for homework, and the tests are a whole different level. I\u2019m in a lab group with people from the same class but a different teacher and I just found out that their teacher does practice tests and other prep to help them and my teacher doesn\u2019t do jack squat. To top it off, all that we have for an actual grade is the tests which I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing very good at. All in all this class has ruined my self esteem and caused me to have several mental breakdowns over the course of the semester already. I honestly feel like I\u2019m just completing busy work that doesn\u2019t really benefit my education. Although I will say the classes I\u2019m doing best in right now have scheduled zoom lectures and that seems to help a lot just for pure organization purposes. I am the kind of person who hates lack of structure, and the lack of scheduled meetings as well as me not knowing what an actual college schedule should look like (I\u2019m a first year student) is really wild and quite honestly making life so much harder. Plus it\u2019s so hard to be in education mode living with my family.

We don't want bullshit work (which is literally what it is. They just won't call it that). I'd rather have a long assignment that takes work and thought than have a bunch of random shit to do that's the same thing over and over and a waste of time. And I LOATHE professors who's test doesn't match up with the content. I had a professor like that. End of the semester I found out he uses multiple people's tests and just gives them to us. It explained everything. He was too lazy to even make his own tests to make sure it matched the format of the rest of our work.
