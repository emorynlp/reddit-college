The reason why I want to take a semester off is that my real passion and the job I really want is to become a Real Estate Agent. I've already paid $300 for the courses and I've been studying essentially the entire summer to pass my course exams. However, I'm in a little bit of a pickle, unfortunately. So I bought the courses in April, and I only have 6 months (which would be late October) to complete both courses, and you have to pass the first course final to even begin to study for the next course. While I've been studying like a mad-man I also am not sure if I will have enough time to study for the 45-hour course (since it's taken me already till now to even feel ready for the 30-hour course exam). \n\nSo essentially I've been talking to my parents about maybe taking a semester off (because it would be almost impossible to take 5 courses while also studying for my license). Also, I took a summer course to get ahead of my classes, and I realized how difficult it was to even take one college class while also studying for Real Estate because of the studying and amount of terms needed for both classes.\n\nMy parents sadly are not fond of me taking a semester off. They think I'll not go back, even though the only thing I really want is to get my license. In a way, I'm not even interested in college anymore and would rather just work on my career, but I'm willing to go back Spring semester so my parents don't feel like failures for raising a \"Drop out\". I'm beyond determined to get my license and honestly it's the only thing on my mind right now. (my summer course was a math class and I confused Multiplicity with a municipality on a homework question and got super confused hahaha). \n\nBasically, do you think taking a semester off to go after your passion and your goal is really that bad? How many of you have taken a semester off and went back? What can I do to change my parents' mind on this and maybe let them be more willing to let me take a semester off? Will taking a semester off mess with my financial aid or GPA?", "author": "Jmoney_419", "created": 1595696508, "retrieved": 1632951610, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"fzkmnzs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hxq2pn/is_taking_a_semester_off_really_that_bad/fzkmnzs/", "text": "Can you do the real estate license in the summers? In the big scheme of things, $300 wouldn't be a ton to pass over, and if your parents are paying for your college, that's a big thing I would not throw away. It sounds like maybe if you did get your license, you wouldn't want to go back? If so, it might be worth it to stick it out. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are paying for college and ESPECIALLY if you are going into debt for it, don't let ANYONE make that decision for you. Now, I kind of think your parents may be right and that you should stick with college, but unless you know something I don't, college sounds like something worth sticking it out for.", "author": "GraduateU", "created": 1595983723, "upvotes": 1}, "fzc6wff": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hxq2pn/is_taking_a_semester_off_really_that_bad/fzc6wff/", "text": "I've considered taking a leave of absence lately because I just wanted to save money and kind of escape the idea of paying full tuition for a bunch of online classes. I know this is a bit of a different situation from what I'm describing, but as long as you are being productive on you time off, which you definitely are, there is nothing wrong with taking some time off to recharge your mind and settle your pathway. Something to keep in mind is that it's never too late to begin or continue something when it comes to education or career as (and i'd hate to say it like this) time really is a construct anyways. If your parents are still not really convinced at the end of this maybe you guys can meet in the middle and be a part time student taking like one or two classes during the fall instead?

It sounds like you also have a designated goal so I don't see an issue with taking some time off. Your GPA won't change, since you aren't taking any credits there's nothing to factor in. With regards to financial aid, if you have any kind of merit aid you need to check with your school's financial aid office because taking time off might affect it for future semesters. If you only have federal aid or loans you should be fine since federal is good for life up to a certain limit and loans only start coming due after 6 months of not being enrolled in classes.", "author": "squirrel8296", "created": 1595720794, "upvotes": 6}, "fz91oiy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hxq2pn/is_taking_a_semester_off_really_that_bad/fz91oiy/", "text": "Taking a semester off with a PLAN sounds entirely reasonable, but talk to someone at financial aid first to make sure that it will not have negative effects.\n\nIt will not hurt your GPA as long as you make sure to drop anything you have registered for.", "author": "jessamina", "created": 1595720425, "upvotes": 13}, "fz7quht": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hxq2pn/is_taking_a_semester_off_really_that_bad/fz7quht/", "text": "Call registrar and file for an educational leave.
