I've been in college since 2016 and the only reason why I am graduating late is because I've taken 3 part-time schedule and one full-time schedule for my first two years of college at a state college. And no, it was not because of laziness, it was a personal reason also I was planning strategically to earn a state scholarship where I have to maintain with a 3.0GPA which allowed me to go to an university I am currently attending for free since Fall of 2018. When I first transferred, I was astounded by the numbers of classes I had to take but I knew I had to catch up on my credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here we are in 2021, I am under the assumption I will be finally finished in the fall after completing two courses which are my last two Upper Division Major courses. Both courses are in level 4000's. Today, I called my advisor if she can remove an hold on my account so I can register for my final courses. Then, she gave me unwanted news and guys... when I tell you my heart sink to my stomach, I was pissed! \n\nShe revealed I have to take additional 5 courses to satisfy my concentration requirements. On my degree works there's a red box GENERAL COMPUTER SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS Still Needed: 15 Credits in CSCI 3@ or [4@](mailto:4@). When I click on either or @'s. A pop-up box appears of the list of classes in either the 3@ or 4@ category. I've taken courses such as: CSCI 3300, 3305, 3306, etc. I singe handedly alone received more than 15 credits in the 3@ category. \n\nTechnically they should count, right?? Well, they DO NOT. My advisor explained to me I have to take classes I NEVER took in either or 3@ or 4@ in order for them to count. She further explains I will be finished in the Spring or Fall 2022 given on my decision if I want to take the courses here or there, or finished them out in the Spring. I feel like the devil works hard to bring people down, I should sadly congratulate his effort... Here I was, extremely overjoyed I passed my final math course, Cal2, with a B. Excited to take down what I thought would had been my final 2 courses... now it's 7, smh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs stated before guys, I am upset, sad, and stressed all at the same time. I almost want to call it quits if I am being honest here right now. Some will tell me don't quit. Some will say you are almost at the finish line. I know... I won't but the feeling I am experiencing right now is making me depressed. And I know people have graduated college late. I recently have a friend who graduated with the same degree and concentration last week, he'd been in college since 2015. Also, I have a cousin who started 2011 finished in 2018. I am so sick and tired of the bs man.\n\n I seriously need a break from school. I never took a gap year off or anything and maybe that's what I need. The level of stress I have to endure to maintain my scholarship as well as passing a course with a C is off the wall sometimes. The constant fear of \"what ifs\" looms through my mind time to time. Well I am finished with my rant. There is a lot more I would say regarding to college as far as what I would done differently or choosing a different path but I think I will post on another sub-reddit for those, lol. Thanks for reading while I wallow in depression for awhile and tell my parents unfortunate news. Have a good day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Received unwanted news from my advisor where I have to take an additional 5 courses and I was under the assumption I will be done in the fall after completing 2 courses.", "author": "Kikawaru", "created": 1621012797, "retrieved": 1632842397, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {}}
