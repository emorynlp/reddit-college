By this I mean they either want to be called Professor OR Dr. which is fine, but they get very upset if you call them the other one they don't like. For example, they want to be called professor, and get upset when you call them Dr. \n- Telling students what tech they can and can not use (as long as it isn't disrupting others)\n- Telling students they can't talk before or after class (What the fuck?)\n- Not allowing students into your zoom call because...

Well, sort of.  We have to keep the doors shut and locked because of school shooter security protocols, but if someone comes to the door, I say to open it.\n* I don't care how students refer to me.  The only name I won't accept is my first name.  I'll even accept my last name spelled incorrectly, though.\n* I'm considering doing this in the future.  This semester, students have been in the room clearly working on assignments for other classes and not mine.  I've had a student ask \"what is this annotated bibliography we have to do?  what is that supposed to be about?\" and it was the subject of the entire lesson, and the words \"annotated bibliography\" were up on the projector.  That student has now wasted class time of others by asking a question they wouldn't have asked if they were paying attention.  I didn't used to care about technology use, but since attendance has no bearing on grade in my class, I don't see why they're showing up if they have no interest in the lesson.\n* I encourage students to talk both before and after class.  That's ridiculous.\n* I haven't used Zoom during the pandemic.  I don't feel like it's fair to expect students to show up for a live discussion when they are having trouble getting access to an appropriate learning environment.  I've recorded all lessons, though.\n* I don't require doctor's notes.  I don't even necessarily care why students have to miss.\n* I already covered that attendance is not mandatory and not tied to grade.  That's why I hate when students come who clearly have no interest.\n* I forget to put my PowerPoints up, but I put all videos of my class up.  The PowerPoints are basically useless, since they only exist as a way of letting me remember what I'm supposed to talk about.  I do put about half of them up, though.\n\nYou don't cover this, but for about half of instructors right now, this is the first time they are teaching online and after this they never plan on teaching online again.  They are just trying to ride this out.  They haven't been provided any technology or compensation for this incredibly-advanced skill they've suddenly had to learn, which isn't really fair to both instructors and students.  \n\nBut, like 90% of the things you mention here I also disagree with.", "author": "chrisrayn", "created": 1619895570, "upvotes": 2}, "gwi6mni": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n20c3f/professors_stop_being_so_power_hungry/gwi6mni/", "text": "So I agree with some of this.

If students are disruptive or spamming memes in chat. \n\n2.) I respond to all e-mails, but I sometimes just direct students to office hours or to the syllabus. This is more a problem of e-mail volume than how I'm addressed. \n\nIf I'm addressed incorrectly, I will gently correct it.\n\n3.) This isn't something I can relate to unless it's unauthorized recording.\n\n4.) Talking before and after class is fine. Talking during class is not. Often students are not good at making this distinction, which means I have to mute all.\n\n5.) I don't allow access to the zoom call if students are not using their university affiliated e-mail accounts. This prevents zoom-bombing. \n\n6.) I don't require a doctor's note but the disability office usually does, and I require documentation from them. In the U.S., this is inequitable because the health care system is fucked. Unfortunately, we have to have some standards of documentation for making academic accommodations and exemptions. \n\n7 and 8.) This is an interesting problem. If I make attendance mandatory and don't post powerpoints, then students actually come to class. Students learn far better in class than they do on their own, and the class average and outcomes are always better. This system is harder on working students, however. \n\nIf I don't make attendance mandatory and I post the slides, then it makes the lives of very busy students a bit easier. However, most of the students stop coming and they don't learn well on their own.
