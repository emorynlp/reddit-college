Well lucky ol\u2019 me ended up in basically a full group of these assholes for my semester long group project in one of my classes. They\u2019ve openly admitted to having not watched any lectures or done any homework since the very beginning of the semester, and its essentially just me and one other group member doing all of the work. They simply show up when we meet to do work so that we can\u2019t mark them as having done nothing and sit there doing nothing the whole time expecting me and the other person to essentially do all of the work. When I don\u2019t know how to do something to they all get pissed WELL GUESS WHAT SHITBAGS ITS NOT MY JOB TO DO THIS ENTIRE CLASS FOR YOU MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY DID WORK EVER IN YOUR FUCKING DUMB PRIVILIGED LIVES YOU WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER YOURSELF. I have a pretty intense major and have alot of work for my other classes to but leave it to these assholes to put all of the work on me and the other kid anyways.

My experience was a year ago (going on two once Fall comes), and I'm still salty as shit. \n\nOP, if it's not too late start recording all interactions and let your professor know what's going on. If they get in trouble, fuck them. Continue with the project as usual though, so at least YOU have something to turn in. If they don't know wtf is going on, that's on them. Put your foot down. \n\nAnyway, if you want to read an equally boring and frustrating story, keep reading. Lol\n\nIn my case I got stuck with two people who may have had autism, they did JACK shit, and the teacher for some reason didn't give them the proper accommodation to do another project. \n\nHaving autism isn't *bad*, (I'm autistic, but trust other people on the spectrum are capable of being shitty partners. Which is why we're often given other work or allowed to work by ourselves if we ask) but it was a hodgepodge of shitty personalities + oblivious ole me.\n\nBasically one was some asshole who was... Not emotionally equipped to deal with university. He yelled and threatened anyone when the conversation wasn't going his way, and of COURSE I learned this shit *after* he stormed out on me after I was exasperated that after everything we discussed he still brought nothing to the table (fuck me for thinking a grown man in college was capable in doing the work, and no I wasn't aware he was on the spectrum at the time). He ended up joining another group the week before the project was due starting that IIII wasn't doing shit.\n\nThe other... Well first of all he was obsessed with learning about his name. But we can't do a project based on just HIS name. So I had to do gymnastics to come up with a topic on the anthropological importance of names. Then I guess his special interest was in math, so instead of helping me, he refused to communicate with me and never told his folks in the math lab that he had other obligations. Guess who looked liked an asshole when I saw him in the math lab after I got tutoring, and was livid as fuck that even when seeing me in person and pulling him aside that he didn't want to speak about the project. Not even for 5 minutes. \n\nThen I had to leave my folks EARLY the night before to get this shit done. Where was he?? Living it up with HIS family when the project was due that following Monday. So I told him he better get his lily ass over here before I do this shit myself and take all the credit because I was sick and tired of his antics. So he gets there, and he hands me what? A PICTURE *screenshot* file of shit that he shoddily wrote down in the Notes app (dunno why when all students have access to Word). It was only ONE paragraph, and the grammar was atrocious. Y'all, this project was 10-20 pages. I had already done 10 going on 15 to make up for the asshole that stormed out. He had to do the bare fucking minimum. Just sit there, and write the 4 pages that were left with me helping him through the way. You know what he did? He dipped. Not even a good 15 minutes in because he INSISTED that he had to do math problems in another part of the library.\n\nThe ice cream on the cake? We had the discussion on whether we should present or not. He wanted to, I told him no that would be a terrible fucking idea because he didn't do shit, and I'm the only one who actually did research on this shit and even I'm not ready. \nThat day, I texted him EXPLICITLY but to present. I wasn't there to stop him because I WAS STILL WORKING ON THE PAPER. He panicked and didn't finish before he had to tap out. Allegedly. But guess who looked like the asshole who just left their OH SO POOR partner to fend for themselves?? All because I walked in right after, thick ass paper in hand of course lol.\nAnd yes, he dipped before I could say anything because he could tell I was about to rip him a new asshole in the middle of the lecture hall \n\nAm I innocent? Nah. Why? Because I'm a dumbass who can't see a red flag even if it knocks me upside the fucking head. \nI now vow I'm doing shit SOLO, unless I absolutely have to. \nAt least if I fuck up it's all on me. \n\nI still got a A+ in the class btw, but my social standing is in the gutter with those other classmates. The professor and I are cool though because she was the only other person seeing the bs those two put me through, and felt bad she didn't make them do something else lol. \n\nOof, I feel like I need to open one of my box wines because typing out that shit has opened some salty, salty repressed emotions that I was *not* prepared on having tonight.\n\nGood luck, love.
