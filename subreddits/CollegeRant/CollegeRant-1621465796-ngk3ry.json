I understand they're human and make mistakes. Many of the professors I've had have been courteous and professional, especially due to COVID. I would even go as far to say that I had one professor who really went overboard in being accommodating because some of the things he let slide for people shouldn't have been acceptable.\n\nHowever, this past semester I had a terrible stats professor. She teaches at my college and she is also finishing up her own doctorate degree. At the beginning of the semester, she had to move in the first 2 weeks of the school year. \n\nFirst off, she had to cancel class twice, once because of the move she had. Okay, not a problem, sure. Things happen and you can't control it. But every single lecture, twice a week, she was never on time. Again, she is a student herself and I understand she was busy. But the times of her classes were so inconsistent. Secondly, because she had missed those days and on top of that, dismissed lectures really early or pushed back exams, she didn't finish all of her lectures. There was supposed to be 15 in total, which would have worked for a full semester, 16 week course that meets twice a week. Because of all the shit on top of shit, she barely squeezed in 14 lectures. That's fine and cool by me. But the way she taught was infuriating. She barely spoke up, went through things super fast even if people told her to slow down, and she was visibly upset that no one was active and participating. She would make passive aggressive comments. It was so bizarre. She also did her computations wrong many times and had to take a break in order to reorganize herself and get back to class. It was a stunning show of unprofessionalism. I could not believe she was teaching. \n\nAlong with these 15 lectures were 15 assignments. My understanding was, we do the lectures and then we do the assignments. Obviously we would be quizzed and had exams throughout the semester to go along with it. Yesterday, she posted an announcement that we could either a, attempt Assignment 15 (which we WEREN'T taught about) or b, write a reflection for the course. This was not optional. We didn't have an assignment dropped, even though it makes sense that we only learned 14 core topics and only 14 should be done, right? \n\nNope, she said the title of my post. Its *our* responsibility as students to complete 15 assignments. Well, as a professor, it was your responsibility to teach us 15 topics right? I honestly don't understand her logic. Many professors I've had in the past, although it messes up their whole grading criteria, would find it sensible to just drop that last assignment. The only thing that makes it slightly okay is that we can just write a reflection for the course.
