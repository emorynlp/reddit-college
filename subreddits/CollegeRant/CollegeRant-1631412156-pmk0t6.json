  "text": " Context with college: I applied to a lot of colleges and was accepted to many of them. I narrowed down my choices and settled on one, talked it over with my parents, and sent in the deposit, and started planning class schedules and looking for roommates. A month later my parents want to talk to me and explained that they misinterpreted the total cost of going to the college I picked. They said I was going to need to go to the local college that my brother was also attending. So literally all by myself I needed to cancel everything and try and set everything up with the local college. I did all of this without a word of complaint and got 0 sympathy from anyone. Even worse the university couldn't offer me anything since it was past the deadline for scholarships and tried to offer me high-interest loans (which felt more insulting than anything). I tried shrugging it off and joined AFROTC during the fall semester and did well until I was medically disqualified (my eyesight is absolutely awful) right at the end of the semester without warning. Literally a week before final exams I was devastated, stressed, burnt out, and couldn't focus on studying. I did ok/well on every exam except math where I went from an A to a C- which put me under the limit to take Physics (a very critical class) and messed up the whole schedule I planned out two months before (and had already signed up for). I tried petitioning for a waiver since I was only a few percent away from the limit and because it was an honors class. I emailed the department multiple times and didn't get a response until three days before the beginning of the semester where I was automatically unenrolled from Physics and I needed to scramble to fill my schedule with classes that I needed to graduate/fill my schedule. I also did this all by myself.\n\nI'm starting my second year in a few days and I'm not really looking forward to any of my classes (mediocre teachers/a few heavy classes) and I just feel lost. Has anybody else gone through this?",
