I just needed a place to vent and to possibly talk to others that may understand. Today the President of the college I attend emailed us and said that we are going to have a vital graduation. I completely understand why. I know safety is important. I know that this is a sacrifice that needs to made to protect others. I also cannot help but feel heartbroken. I am a first generation college student that is also in the honors program at my school. My father passed away in 2018, my 2nd year in college at the time. I had to overcome so many obstacles on top of getting myself through school in general with no support from my family. My mom, if anything, encouraged me to drop out just for her own benefit. Now, my celebration of it all is just me staring at it through a screen and getting something in the mail to show for it all. \nI also want to make it clear my intention is to not come off as selfish. I know this needs to be done. I am also incredibly sad that I cannot experience something that I have been looking forward to for four years. \nIf you read this far, thank you so much for listening. \u2764\n\nTL:DR I am sad that my college graduation will be online as a first generation college student.", "author": "xPastelPeachx", "created": 1612199392, "retrieved": 1632843585, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"glmd65w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/la87yr/i_just_learned_my_college_graduation_will_be/glmd65w/", "text": "Thank you u/xPastelPeachx for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm a first gen student too and while my family has been supportive it still crushes me that I won't get to walk and have a real ceremony. I watched my sibling have a virtual hs grad and it was terrible. They said it didn't even feel real. Covid ruined the last 3 semesters of my education and now it's ruined my graduation too. Im afraid I'll get my degree and feel like a fraud because it doesn't feel like I've actually finished college. I just feel frozen as a junior waiting for covid to end so we can resume the spring 2020 semester.

Not even an email explaining it was cancelled. I too will be the first college grad in my family and with honors this Dec and I anticipate an online graduation as well. The past year has been extra hard and hopefully, employers and others will see that we faced that and continued forward the best we could and accomplished our goals.

It\u2019s a loss. You earned the public celebration and acknowledgment, and you are not getting it. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t help much, but you should know that everyone at your school\u2014the staff and administrators, professors, everyone\u2014shares your sense of loss and regret. At most schools we will do our absolute best to make your virtual graduation just as special and cool and meaningful as we can...but we all know it\u2019s not good enough. It\u2019s not the same. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that, among all the major and terrible losses this pandemic is inflicting on so many people, there are also these smaller losses that (to the people who suffer them) don\u2019t feel small at all. \n\nSo go ahead and feel sad about this. It sucks. \n\nBut at the same time, maybe there\u2019s a way to feel some extra pride. You did something and accomplished success in a way that is difficult and honorable even in good times. And YOU did it in terrible times. That\u2019s a big deal. Even if you don\u2019t get the public celebration you want (and deserve) you do get the inner pride and knowledge that you came through some of the hardest tkmes any college student has ever seen. You stuck to it and you won. Good for you!  Keep that knowledge and pride and remember it. Whatever comes next, you know you can handle it and you can recall that you ARE a superstar.", "author": "lepidio", "created": 1612203909, "upvotes": 13}}}
