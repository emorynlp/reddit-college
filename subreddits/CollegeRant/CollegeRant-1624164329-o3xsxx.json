College is a pain in the ass.", "text": "So right now I'm 27, I've struggled with bipolar my whole life but I was only diagnosed when I was 25. I have bipolar type 1 rapid cycling F31.12. I see a therapist twice or more a week, see a psychiatrist at least once a month, and after seeing several psychologists about this: they've all said this isn't something that will ever go away or probably even be easy to manage. I'm going to always struggle with some extreme mood swings that go to levels most people can't even comprehend and I'm always going to struggle with mania and sometimes full-on psychotic episodes just because that's just the shitty way I was born.  \n\n\nSo when I graduated high school I wanted to go to Calarts which is a school I've always wanted to go to since I was like ten. I didn't have the best grades in the world and my father refused to sign my fafsa forms so even if I got into Calarts, I couldn't afford it period, so I decided to go take some semesters in community college. First semester I didn't do too bad in, I ended up with a 2.75 GPA, but my bipolar problems that I was already struggling with began to really kick into overdrive and I quit college altogether because I felt like I was smarter than everyone there and could make millions on my own and started doing my own freelance related animation work. I actually had some decent success in this and worked on some animated pilots but I slowly lost my mind completely and I ended up being homeless, turned into this insane vagrant type of character, began trainhopping all over the country, would have a daily get rich quick scheme that typically involved me going into an apple store and basically scamming people online, started having legit psychotic episodes one of which included me stomping around Manhattan in a snowstorm wearing nothing but my underwear believing that I was an alien put inside of a robot body and I was sent here to survive a reality TV show, and like... I was nuts. A few years later during a moment of sanity, I looked at myself and said enough is enough, I get a job working at Target for a few years, ended up getting my own insurance, and eventually decided to see a psychologist and look at that it turns out I have a pretty horrible mental illness that has been screwing me over in ways I couldn't ever understand until that point.  \n\n\nSo fast forward after a year and what was considered intensive treatment, I decide I wanna go back to school summer of 2020 just because I've always wanted to fulfill that dream of having that damned diploma and being part of Calarts even if I don't need it per se.  I decide go back to the same community college in order to save money and also get my GPA up so i can get some scholarships and I take a sociology class and a philosophy class and I'm doing really well in both of them and have close to a perfect grade thus far. It was a week where in both classes we needed to work on our final papers and bam I suddenly have an extreme depressive episode and I'm basically in the corner of my room curled up in the corner and rotting and not even eating anything or drinking anything for a day or two. Suddenly I had a massive mood swing which got me up and doing things about but instead of coming back to normal, I start going full-blown hardcore manic and decide I'm going to write the greatest papers known to mankind and waaaaaaaaaaaaay overdo them despite the fact that both of my professors stated the only wanted around five or six pages but I had decided that wasn't enough and I was going insane and writing like twenty or more pages. This plan completely backfired and I didn't get my sociology paper in on time so it was an F and my philosophy professor, even though he said it was a very good paper, took off a significant amount of points for not following directions with the length or even the subject matter. So both my grades went from As to a C and a B overnight because of that.  \n\n\nFall classes happen and I'm taking an art history class which, on paper, I should theoretically be great in due to my history with doing art, a literature class, and a trigonometry course. Like the previous semester, I'm doing really well in them at first however this time, instead of getting depressed first I ended up going manic/somewhat psychotic during these online classes. I don't know how to fully describe what it's like to not be lazy, not be distracted, and be paying full attention in a math class and still bomb it despite math being one of my favorite things, but I did and it's largely because of the fact I just wasn't there mentally. It's worth noting that I didn't fail all the tests, some of them I did really well in, I just messed up the ones that were important enough to the overall class and it screwed my grade up. It was the same thing with my art history class where I knew a lot of these artists already but I was just going so insane that I managed to bomb everything I'd turn in or I wouldn't get it complete in time, not because of time management problems, but literally me just not being totally sane. Ironically I did really well in my English class \\*because\\* of that ludicrous insanity and my professor actually really appreciated the very sharp comments and super in-depth analysis things I'd do of our literature for the assignments but just like the sociology class, I got super depressed during that final exam and I ended up not submitting it in time and my grade in that class went from an A to a C overnight.   \n\n\nI've been basically bouncing with a 1.68 GPA right now and of the past three classes I've taken, I've only really passed one of them.  I've withdrawn from a lot of classes so it's not \\*quite\\* the end of the world as it would only take retaking some failed classes and getting at least an A in one of the classes I got a C in to really fix it. That said, it's still difficult and this whole thing frustrates me because even if I have a small little episode and I'm able to catch myself before things get too off-balance, a lot of times it's just too late to do anything about it and my grade for that class is basically screwed even if I got a perfect score on everything else submitted afterward. Heck right now I'm supposed to be retaking my sociology class for a better grade but I'm going to have to drop out of it all together because I somehow managed to fuck up to the point of not even fully realizing class was going on and missed the first week and I tried this week to really save that but it was just too late and even though the class isn't over, I did the math and it's just too late.  \n\n\nSome people have told me only take one class a semester but with the nature of this weird disorder, it's like it doesn't exactly matter how many classes I'm taking because this isn't about it being too hard to manage as much as it's about me being mentally sane if that makes any sense. Every so often I'll have someone try and politely say I'm a fuckup and that college isn't for me and I obviously wanna just say fuck you to that but at the same time, someone shared a statistic with me where bipolar people pass college less than 10% of the time and of those 10% it's predominantly people with a lesser and more manageable form of the disorder, not the crazy shit I have, so yeah it is true that college technically isn't for someone like me because the way everything is set up is not in my favor.  Unfortunately, that's just the situation I'm in BUT I'm dedicated to not quitting because I don't fucking care how, I want to just actually do something I've dreamt about since I was a kid and also to spite a lot of teachers I had growing up as a kid who thought I had autism and outright told me things like \"you'll never amount to anything because you're just not wired right\"  \n\n\nIt's just frustrating as fuck though because I know total dumbfucks who've been able to pass college with flying colors and I also know plenty of lazy shits who've played their cards right and were able to get through college without much issue. I'm not stupid and I'm not lazy but fucking hell I hate this because, without any real context of this disorder, it sure looks like I'm somehow both at once. I've finally decided to suck it up and contact the student disability service center at my community college and see if there's any type of help or assistance I can get for something like this, but since I'm having these episodes seemingly without any triggers that I can even identify, I'm not sure how far that's gonna go.   \n\n\nTL;DR I'll be doing really well in a college class and then I'll have a bipolar episode and either fuck up so hard I fail the class or fuck up in a way that severely lowers my grade. Sometimes I'm able to catch it, sometimes I'm not. Currently seeking therapy and on medication, however, I've had currently now three psychologists tell me this is always going to be a nightmare to deal with in my life with medication and therapy only making it somewhat manageable.", "author": "ChrisHansonTakeASeat", "created": 1624164329, "retrieved": 1632842195, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h2ec5fw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o3xsxx/i_have_bipolar_college_is_a_pain_in_the_ass/h2ec5fw/", "text": "Thank you u/ChrisHansonTakeASeat for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
