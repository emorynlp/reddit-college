The first thing I discovered when I had to take my courses online was that it took considerably longer to cover the same amount of material or get the same amount of work done in a Zoom classroom. Even once an instructor is proficient in running a Zoom classroom (and many of us were thrown into it and had to learn on the fly), everything takes longer: the interface is unwieldy, transitions take longer, it's easier for students attention to wander, and time is wasted repeating instructions and getting them on task. I suspect that many professors in this situation tried to make up for lost in-class work by shifting that work to homework.", "author": "SnooHobbies3488", "created": 1608741491, "upvotes": 4}, "ggoh7uw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/khn883/dear_professors_i_know_structuring_upper_division/ggoh7uw/", "text": "Yeah it sucks;(", "author": "jakepem91", "created": 1608631675, "upvotes": 1}, "ggo3kuu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/khn883/dear_professors_i_know_structuring_upper_division/ggo3kuu/", "text": "This!!! My only saving grace was my lack of filter and my professors having monthly check ins.

Then midterms and finals and additional \"more heavy\" weeks. Any time I completed a class with a decent grade, I'd fill out those check ins and say how the work was way too much.

I was super frustrated with this class and the professor was reported to the dean. She had to take down so many assignments from the syllabus and she was consistently behind on grading the assignments that had already been turned in. Like a month behind. I don\u2019t see why the professor would do that to herself as all assignments were written and not quizzes or multiple choice.
