I have scars on my arm from over 3.5 yrs ago from self harm and get super self-conscious about it. Like, they aren't fresh scars/wounds, but still, the scars are pretty easy to notice. It's also hot pretty much forever where i live too, so wearing jackets, hoodies, etc. (even light ones) are a horrible idea, esp as someone who sweats easily (aka i can easily start sweating even in shorts and a tshirt in weather 17\u00b0C/62.6\u00b0F or above).\n\nOn the other hand, on zoom, all they see is my face, which is absent from signs of shitty mental health (with the exception of my shitty rbf, but that's easily dismissed as \"just my rbf\").", "author": "ItzN0tMe", "created": 1629317321, "retrieved": 1632841605, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h9g4naw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6z4aq/gonna_kinda_miss_online_classes_tbh/h9g4naw/", "text": "Thank you u/ItzN0tMe for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
