I think it's different when people have physical requirements to live that's not being met.\n\nSome people are gluten free / have allergies and their schools straight up aren't considering that. Those people really have the right to complain especially if the dining hall is their only option and they can't afford groceries, or don't have transportation to get their own food.\n\nAlso, if we're paying so much for a meal plan they could make the food options healthier. Healthier food is something they fully have the ability to serve and it helps students perform better in school. \n\nI'll keep complaining about the shit food they serve because it's a problem that can be fixed and it's the student's money being wasted.
