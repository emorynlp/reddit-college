  "text": "Suck it up and eat the goddamn food. I hate when I hear kids complain about dining hall food. Do you know how lucky you are to even have food? Housing? \n\nJust because the dining hall isn\u2019t as good as mommy\u2019s cooking doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inedible. Just fucking eat and move on with your day.",

      "text": "Nah because some people have dietary needs that aren't considered at their schools. I think it's different when people have physical requirements to live that's not being met.\n\nSome people are gluten free / have allergies and their schools straight up aren't considering that. Those people really have the right to complain especially if the dining hall is their only option and they can't afford groceries, or don't have transportation to get their own food.\n\nAlso, if we're paying so much for a meal plan they could make the food options healthier. Healthier food is something they fully have the ability to serve and it helps students perform better in school. \n\nI'll keep complaining about the shit food they serve because it's a problem that can be fixed and it's the student's money being wasted. Definitely not sucking it up.",
