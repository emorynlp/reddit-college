  "text": "So this past summer I dislocated my knee and have had to be in physical therapy since with a lot of restrictions on what I can do, so they gave me a STATE ISSUED temporary handicap pass so that I wouldn\u2019t have to walk as far on campus. This fucking school gave me a parking ticket for not parking in the general lots, despite saying online that if you have a state issued handicap (temporary or permanent) pass you can park wherever. I brought it up with the parking admin and they told me to just pay the fine. I\u2019m losing my mind I hate this corporate bs so much. \n\nTLDR I got a parking ticket for a spot I was allowed to park in and admin told me to pay it anyway.",
