  "text": "I am so fucking tired of professors not updating grades until the last week of the semester how the fuck did I raise my grade from a C to a B then to now a D. It makes no fucking sense why are you out now grading the midterm that shit was over with 2months ago.\n\nIt's not fair at all and puts more stress on the student because how are you gonna deduct a whole bunch of points for the same mistakes that COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED HAD YOU FUCKING GRADED SHIT ON TIME.\n\nI DONT CARE THAT YOU HAVE 180 STUDENTS HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS DO TO AND THEY STILL UPDATED GRADES REGULARLY. \n\nI genuinely do not have sympathy for professors because students don't even get half that grace. Update your stupid fucking grades so I don't have a roller coast of emotions seeing my grade got o C, B D.\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 Which may I had happened all within this week. I had a fucking C for pretty much my entire semester then a B when they final updated fucking midterm grades and the final has me at a 69 and then! We get another grade weight change policy and now I am at a 64 even after asking for help professors can choke.\n\n\nTl;Dr: professors who don't regularly update grades are assholes and complete hypocrites for expecting work on time.",

If you want this kind of course structure you should go to community college which caters to this high school mindset.\n\nStudents actually receive far more feedback, assignments, and opportunities for improvement in universities now. When I was a student 20 years ago, most of my classes had a final exam and that's it. 100% of the grade was dependent on the final exam score. You didn't get your exam back and there was no feedback.",

Ideally, about 30% of the grade should be accounted for before a student has to make a decision about whether or not take a W. \n\nHowever, that is not in line with weekly or bi-weekly feedback. We aren't equipped and probably never will be for that degree of hand-holding. \n\n Not only that but part of the idea of the university is that it's a place for students to independently conduct research and explore ideas.",

The biggest offender is computer science. I would say about 15-25% of CS students at any given university are interested in computing as science. Those students belong at the university. \n\nFor all of the others who really just want to learn coding as a trade, they would be better served through other kinds of instruction.

I've had professors from HP, Wal-Mart, and a company that contracts with Boeing.\n\nHeck, my university values industry experience so much that if you have a relevant bachelor's degree and a certain number of years in the relevant industry, they'll consider hiring you as a professor - no graduate degree required.\n\nOf course, this being a Mormon school, they also like to see some modicum of adherence to Mormon standards, so some professor wannabes might stay away.",
