It makes no fucking sense why are you out now grading the midterm that shit was over with 2months ago.\n\nIt's not fair at all and puts more stress on the student because how are you gonna deduct a whole bunch of points for the same mistakes that COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED HAD YOU FUCKING GRADED SHIT ON TIME.\n\nI DONT CARE THAT YOU HAVE 180 STUDENTS HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS DO TO AND THEY STILL UPDATED GRADES REGULARLY. \n\nI genuinely do not have sympathy for professors because students don't even get half that grace. Update your stupid fucking grades so I don't have a roller coast of emotions seeing my grade got o C, B D.\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 Which may I had happened all within this week. I had a fucking C for pretty much my entire semester then a B when they final updated fucking midterm grades and the final has me at a 69 and then! We get another grade weight change policy and now I am at a 64 even after asking for help professors can choke.\n\n\nTl;Dr: professors who don't regularly update grades are assholes and complete hypocrites for expecting work on time.", "author": "Fickle-Management", "created": 1619573339, "retrieved": 1632843433, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"gw4f17s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n03rnk/there_needs_to_be_a_deadline_every_week_or_two/gw4f17s/", "text": "Thank you u/Fickle-Management for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
