I been waiting for a grade update for over a month and now they tell me my request has been denied. The exchange coordinator has told me not to email them again. It is just so unfair. After about three months of waiting my request gets denied and I can\u2019t do anything about it. My question is, who else can I reach out to? And, can I get in trouble for continuing this if I find the grade pretty unfair for multiple reasons?", "author": "km48636", "created": 1627679050, "retrieved": 1632841694, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "comments": {"h74oiz3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/outwa1/unfair_grades/h74oiz3/", "text": "Thank you u/km48636 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
