  "text": "Okay guys. I been waiting for a grade update for over a month and now they tell me my request has been denied. The exchange coordinator has told me not to email them again. It is just so unfair. After about three months of waiting my request gets denied and I can\u2019t do anything about it. My question is, who else can I reach out to? And, can I get in trouble for continuing this if I find the grade pretty unfair for multiple reasons?",

The ombuds office is probably not going to be the right venue unless there\u2019s a problem with the grievance process. \n\nOP says in a different comment that the professor agreed to change the grade and then didn\u2019t, so that will be important information to include evidence of in a grievance. I may be wrong but this sounds to me like a professor who is on summer break and forgot about the student. It\u2019s not good or okay but it happens and can be fixed. \n\nWithout more context, though, no one can help.",
