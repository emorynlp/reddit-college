My first two years of college were at a CC so I was pretty lazy and didn\u2019t do anything besides easy classes and my part-time job, so coming to a 4 year university and realizing that a lot of companies already hiring for summer internships and the deadline was less than a week after I learned about it was pretty jarring to say the least. I kinda spit up a resume and applied to a few places, but that\u2019s the only one I even got an interview for. I polished up my resume a bit and am still applying to some random openings I see for summer internships but at this point I\u2019m not gonna try and stress myself out over it. I\u2019ve heard many people say it\u2019s harder to get an internship than an actual full-time job in the same field which I think is ridiculous",
