We were told not to come back after Spring break and all classes have been virtual since.

I've seen professors that truly miss being in the classroom and I can tell they feel a bit lonely but revive a bit when zoom classes start.  I've also had at least two that were like \"read this, do that\" and that was the limit of their engagement, but I don't know what else is going on with them, if classes tripled, their kids, dogs or spouses are at home.

I won\u2019t mention any particular situations that have popped up. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything especially awful that I\u2019ve let happen. But, here are some behaviors I\u2019m not all that proud of this semester:\n\nI\u2019m a little slow to answer emails sometimes, taking the full 24 hours stated in the syllabus to answer. Grading is slower. In-class joy is down immensely. Classroom lessons are more disorganized. Online video content for online work isn\u2019t finalized until the week of, sometimes midweek. Sometimes dates are wrong. Quiz questions need revising. Less available in office than usual. \n\nBackground: English instructor, 37, married with a teenager and a toddler before lockdown. Found out about a week before lockdown that we were pregnant. Kids out of daycare and school, finishing spring entirely from home. Have ADHD and was suddenly in a house with all the child noise. Wife allowed to work from home until childbirth and maternity leave are over. I\u2019m forced to work online and build a class online in a week. It sucked.\n\nSummer semesters, I lost out on a class I usually get to teach that brings in money we have come to rely on. I\u2019m full time but that extra class would have helped a lot. The stimulus money we got almost covered that loss, though, so that\u2019s good. Taught in second summer. Did home updating to pass the time until class started.\n\nFall: first semester completely online class, but I still have half face to face students. The half face to face only see me half the time, so my lessons become this weird Frankenlesson where I\u2019m having to split everything oddly and not how it was designed. Many engaging lessons moved online. I love teaching because of the interaction and the large groups and those are gone. Everything online after thanksgiving. Baby born before thanksgiving. \n\nMy sleep schedule is shit. Baby awesome. I start to resent work because it keeps me away from my family at home. I used to spend a lot of time at home because I could get my work done there while the kids are at daycare and my wife is at work. That no longer happens. I cannot get work done at all. There is no quiet space. Just ADHD noise always.\n\nSpring: Classes now completely built online, to the degree I can with no experience doing that. Decide not to grade Monday thru Thursday because wife needs help and I want to spend more time with my kids. She is back at work. Kids are in daycare. Daughter back at high school. We could get COVID at any moment and don\u2019t have the vaccine yet. Forgot to mention that in the fall, because we wanted to protect ourselves and our kids, we had to pay 500 a month for daycare even though our kid wasn\u2019t going or she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to return in the spring. Spent 2000 dollars on literally no return. But now both are in it and that\u2019s an extra 500 a month. Teenager needs license. Driving with teenager. I can only grade on weekends. Teaching sucks but is better because two classes are small enough I don\u2019t have to split the class into halves each week. Every lesson is a full lesson. Grading sucks. I love teaching for the teaching and hate the grading.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen my parents or brother or sister in law or niece or friends or had a date with my wife or anything normal I used to do at all since the pandemic started. No Christmas or thanksgiving. It\u2019s been surprisingly hard. My wife and I have gotten closer, but we are struggling with not seeing our friends and family. Her grandmother died. An official in our church died. My best friend\u2019s husband didn\u2019t handle COVID lockdown well enough to avoid cheating on his wife. I can\u2019t be there for my family and friends. I come to Reddit more than I should. Showers have gotten longer. Toilet trips longer. Too much YouTube. Not enough experience. Everything sucks. Happy as hell to have a job, but it\u2019s not like that fact erases the experience of responsibly handling a pandemic. Feel guilty if I feel anything negative because of how small my struggles are compared to others.\n\nI love all of you and hope you\u2019re doing well this semester. I hope my actions save your grandmother or sick cousin across the country from me. A trip to Walmart with half of people not wearing masks tells me I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop trying.

The profs are the ones with power in this situation. Students disliking you/being mad at you/being general PITAs for making them do hard work is pretty much part of the job description of professoring. \n\nIf profs are struggling, why wouldn't they expect that their students are struggling too? It's up to profs to help students, or at the very least, not harm them. Again, that's part of the job description. If a prof recognizes that they are unable to help/not harm then it's their responsibility to speak up on behalf of their students, for instance, by telling administrators that they can f off with ridiculous requirements. \n\nUnfortunately I haven't witnessed many profs who are willing to do this until their own butts are on the line due to job cuts. Only then do they complain. I have little sympathy when so many of them have been silent as the entire system of academia has been falling apart for at least a decade. I have little sympathy when so many of them have been promoting a culture of toxic overwork that's turned academia into a miserable experience for many with sky-rocketing mental health issues among students. \n\nUntil those with power in academia start supporting those without it I'm not much inclined to support them. If a prof were to level with a class and be forthcoming about the fact that they're struggling too and that they think continuing on as normal at this time is absurd, maybe I'd be a little more understanding.
