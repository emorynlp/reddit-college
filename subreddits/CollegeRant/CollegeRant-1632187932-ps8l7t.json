And I know the common saying at college is that you can only do 2 of the 3 Ss: Sleep, study, or social. I'm not great at meeting people at a college environment: I suck ass at first impressions and making the conversation interesting enough for them to want to hang out a second time. So I have decided to just study and maybe sleep with a bit of depression on the side. Staying at the apartment alone on the weekend fucks you up emotionally and mentally.\n\nRegardless, I just took my first actual serious exam right now which is worth 30% of my grade and I bombed it. I thought that I studied enough and knew the content , but I didn't. I didn't study hard consecutively for the weeks that we had for preparation, but I knew the content enough where I thought that an 80% was something I can get. Honestly, if I get a C-, that's a miracle. It just messed up the rest of my day and I've been in a slump since. There's no curve on the exams, but at the end of the semester they might curve the collective whole if everybody didn't perform so well. The issue is thatthis is a class recommended for Juniors and Seniors, so I am a bit behind in terms of content, I'm a sophomore, so I don't think that this curve will be able to save me. Just hearing the others talk about it as they walked out makes me assume that they did pretty well. They estimate that it will take until Wed. for the scores to be out, so I'm just dreading the next two days.\n\nIt sucks knowing that my GPA is going to tank because of this course. I think I can still take it P/Np, but it's a required course. I'm a Bio major and have taken some of my pre requisite classes P/NP that it will look bad on my transcript if I do so another time. I'm just angry at myself for being that overconfident, and I'm really upset that I couldn't have done better.", "author": "J_tnguyen", "created": 1632187932, "retrieved": 1632951414, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hdqbv9y": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps8l7t/just_had_my_realty_checked_today/hdqbv9y/", "text": "I had a calc class is college that \"wasn't curved\". I got a 35% on the first exam, which crushed me. Found out later that the median grade was a 17%. Needless to say, the grade was curved. Professors sometimes dont curve individual grades or exams because its way easier to curve everything in the end. Curving at the end also gives us a lot morel leeway if we accidentally make an exam too hard, and then over correct on the next one (since you would basically never curve down). The point being, dont stress yet, wait to see what the grade distribution for the class is, rather than your own gut feeling about your individual grade (before you even know it).", "author": "titosphone", "created": 1632239651, "upvotes": 9}, "hdoxxw9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps8l7t/just_had_my_realty_checked_today/hdoxxw9/", "text": "Genetics suuuuucks. I feel you dude. I bombed my first exam in zoology which was genetics heavy. I got a 66 WITH an 8 point curve. However, I also work full time and we had a hurricane two weeks after school started \ud83d\ude43 I love college haha. It'll get better. One class compared with all your classes is not the end of the world. As long as you recognize what you did. Also, socializing does in fact help. Maybe go study at a coffee shop and see if there's another bio student around. I try to talk about what they're studying/majoring/career goals are.
