  "text": "Right now I'm having one of those rare moments where I feel super motivated to get everything done, and usually I'd get a huge chunk of the semester over with, but right now I finished all my assignments and I can't finish anything else because they aren't released yet, and probably by next week or so, I'll be back to being super unmotivated again and frustrated. I ust wanna finish all assignments so I can end this semester, I just want a break.",

If we allow everything to be available and allow people to work ahead, a sizeable portion of people get confused and submit the wrong assignments/do them incorrectly. This *shouldn\u2019t* be as large of an issue as it is, but it is, especially with a large class.",
