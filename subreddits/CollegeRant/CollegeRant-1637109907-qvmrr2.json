  "text": "i\u2019m taking anatomy and physiology this semester and ofc it\u2019s not the easiest class ever (the professor suggested that we study an hour a day for this class so ofc it was intimidating). this was our third exam and i was determined to do better on this one (first exam i got a 82%, second exam i got a 76%) a c isn\u2019t bad but i knew i could do better. i took the exam today and felt confident going into it, but then the questions made less and less sense as i went through it lmao. there was nothing i could do at that point so i just finished the exam and left. we usually get our tests results back super fast, and i saw that my overall grade was lower. then i saw i got a d on the exam \ud83d\ude2d i\u2019m trying not to beat myself up about it but it\u2019s hard not to lol. plus i still have a b- in the class and there are other assignments we have before the semester ends. and it is my fault for sure, i\u2019ve been saying i need to improve my study habits for forever. at least i know what not to do for the final lmao\n\ntl;dr: i got a d on an exam i studied for, trying not to beat myself up about it because there are more assignments we have before the semester ends and i still have an overall good grade in the class.",
