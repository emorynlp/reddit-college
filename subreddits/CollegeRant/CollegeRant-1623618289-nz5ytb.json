  "text": "I have a TERRIBLE instructor with a TERRIBLY designed class. There are over 25 separate graded assignments due every week. Even if there were a regular 16 week course and I didn't have other classes, this would still be tough. The instructor keeps emailing us random bs and I'm about to lose my darn mind. I don't know what to so about this. The university needs to know but I don't know how to tell. Department head is too busy. I composed an angry email rant(below) back to the instructor. I just do not know...\n\nI feel like there's a lot going on here and these test results indicate that. Students don't take summer courses for the fun of the missing out on all the summer stuff, we do it because we ARE serious about it being a priority and it's incredibly insulting to insinuate otherwise when you have no idea of our current life circumstances but are yourself busy with summer activities and sending your student emails with vacation pictures instead of applying yourself to helping us average higher than a 69% on an exam. There is audio missing on many of your lecture videos, poorly worded exam questions and you have not done anything to help us but say you don't know how to.",
