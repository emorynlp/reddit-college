If I thought I could learn physics and organic chemistry independently online, I would have registered for online classes. I don\u2019t know if I can do this. I\u2019m such a hands-on learner. Being in lab is such a huge part of the way I learn science and I\u2019ve done well so far, but now that\u2019s gone. I\u2019m so scared I\u2019m going to tank my GPA because of this. PLUS now everything\u2019s going be accelerated because classes were canceled entirely for two weeks so that the professors could figure out how they\u2019re going to do this. Regular online classes are hard enough, but accelerated online classes that were thrown together in two weeks is going to be an absolute shitshow.
