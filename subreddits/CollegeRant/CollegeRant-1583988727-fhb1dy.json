  "text": "I just need to get this out. I completely understand the concern around Covid 19 and the move to online classes is absolutely needed given the circumstances BUT...\n\nI didn\u2019t sign up for this. If I thought I could learn physics and organic chemistry independently online, I would have registered for online classes. I don\u2019t know if I can do this. I\u2019m such a hands-on learner. Being in lab is such a huge part of the way I learn science and I\u2019ve done well so far, but now that\u2019s gone. I\u2019m so scared I\u2019m going to tank my GPA because of this. PLUS now everything\u2019s going be accelerated because classes were canceled entirely for two weeks so that the professors could figure out how they\u2019re going to do this. Regular online classes are hard enough, but accelerated online classes that were thrown together in two weeks is going to be an absolute shitshow. I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\n\nI\u2019m thankful that my school is taking a proactive approach and prioritizing student wellbeing, but that isn\u2019t going to make the abrupt switch to online any easier.",

It is also seen as a good thing if your college closes, because who would want to attend a college next year where it didn\u2019t close down for a global virus? \n\nColleges don\u2019t care about students; colleges care about the bottom line",
