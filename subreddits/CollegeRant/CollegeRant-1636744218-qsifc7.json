  "text": "I'm switching fucking majors, my teacher has missed almost 5 weeks now out of a goddamn 14 week semester and all I've learned in my Mechatronics course are the six simple machines that I learned in elementary. I've wasted so much fucking time at this college and am afraid it's going to prevent me from going to a better college.\n\nBesides my major sucking ass the two classes I have as extra, computer essentials and psychology are fucked. The computer essentials asshole just uses outdated stuff for Microsoft word from 2016, can't even find the shit he wants me to do in the assignment because his photos are old and outdated as hell and my psychology teacher just plagiarizes from fucking Quizlet and other colleges, a professor with a PHD in psychology is teaching me worse than my high school psychology teacher did.\n\nI want to continue my education but holy hell this college is either gonna make me drop out so I won't fail my fucking classes and have to pay back my loans or I'm gonna fail and try to transfer to an online college so I can at least make money while in school. Literally no in-between, my teachers are shit and just copy/paste and give us bad grades when their assignments and sources and notes make literally no goddamn sense.",

Trying to withdrawal from all courses and switch colleges/majors next semester so I won't have to pay back loans or have a horrible gpa. Wish me luck.",
