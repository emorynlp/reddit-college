      "text": "Depends on the course and the price. You say you want to learn an instrument, but if you were to take an instrument class what would it cost you for a semester? $1000 for the course? Compare the cost of that instruction time to taking a 30-60 minute lesson once a week for a semester with a local teacher in your area. Which would be cheaper? I mean if you\u2019re looking to get a credit for something you are really interested in then go for it, but it might be much more expensive than just getting a local teacher.",

                      "text": "To major in music, you usually need to be proficient in an instrument before applying. There is an audition process you have to go through in order to be paired with a professor, and to be placed in a band or orchestra. Music majors usually go two routes, performance or education. Performance majors are geared toward symphony or professional music career, in some capacity. Usually teach music lessons after degrees and public schools, play with local orchestras or other gigs, and usually have another job outside of music. Educators become band directors at schools. Music school life is focused on practicing, practicing, and practicing. It\u2019s not really a degree you can just stumble into. \n\nIf you want to learn an instrument, you can inquire at the music school about possible teachers for whatever instrument you want. All music schools have music students that can give lessons. Some schools might have a course where you can explore music instrument, but depends on the school. As suggested by others, going the independent lessons is probably the way you want to go. So contact the music school and go from there.",
