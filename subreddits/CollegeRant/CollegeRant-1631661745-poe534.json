That's usually the case when you have a certain amount of credits that you can put toward electives, but that could add up to a minor if you focus on a centralized subject.\n\nOtherwise, a minor can drive students to put off graduation by a semester or even two, and that's when its worth is debatable. Still, that could be easily solvable by taking an extra class or two some semesters.\n\nMany times, if you want to specialize in an area your major touches on or relates to, you can do that through expertise elsewhere, too. You can gain that in an internship, job, or research experience. Some options in that might even require less commitment than a minor since you're unsure about it.", "author": "yourangleoryuordevil", "created": 1631665620, "upvotes": 2}, "hcvxz2v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/poe534/is_doing_a_minor_worth_it/hcvxz2v/", "text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea.
