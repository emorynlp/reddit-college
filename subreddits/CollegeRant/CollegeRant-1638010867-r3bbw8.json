  "text": "Idk what I\u2019m really looking to get out of this post, maybe just see if anyone else has been in my shoes and can make me feel less alone, I don\u2019t know. It seems like everyone around me is always gossiping about their \u201cfriend\u201d, excluding someone intentionally, backstabbing to gain something, hurting others with their actions for personal benefit, etc. and I\u2019m just exhausted. I went to a small Christian school/was homeschooled most of my upbringing. I wasn\u2019t some isolated homeschooler and I did have a lot of friends, but they were definitely ones I made intentionally instead of just being a group of my peers I was around all day because of school, I guess I also never really had much experience with the whole \u201cpolitics of high school\u201d thing and maybe that\u2019s my problem, idk. It\u2019s just really been depressing to watch and I feel so lonely. What\u2019s weird is my college experience has been \u201csuccessful\u201d, I\u2019ve had a good time at school, I\u2019m involved with teams/clubs and I\u2019ve made friends, I just feel like a lot of it is shallow and not really the lifelong bridesmaid or relationship material I was told I\u2019d find in school, idk. I also took a gap for medical reasons + life reasons (major life threatening surgeries, loss of a serious relationship, the works) and so I\u2019m a year or two older than many of my classmates, however I feel like I\u2019m 45 and watching kids play, there\u2019s just this disconnect and I want to know how to fix it.",

I stopped talking to my friends due to some hectic circumstances and found that some hobbies are better enjoyed when you're by yourself. If you want to alleviate loneliness, take up a hobby and post your work online. I've been doing that. This is the best I can do to help. It's not worth it to build a platonix relationship based off being in an echo chamber of ideology, that's how brainwashing happens.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been alone the majority of my life and have gone through the whole \u201cHighschool politics\u201d bullshit. It\u2019s not as cool as you think. It\u2019s just a load of bullshit encapsulated by regret. Blows my mind how one stupid person can create a literal shockwave into a friend group simply because, everyone at that age is emotionally immature. \n\nAs much as finding hobbies or whatever works or doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s hard to not feel alone. I am sitting in my room staring at the ceiling wondering where the hell I went wrong almost every day. The worst is when you get that feeling and it hits you to your core. You start feeling cold almost like you\u2019re going to cry but, you can\u2019t. You physically can\u2019t. \n\nThen, you take steps to talk to people. It goes decent. You start to initiate more and people ghost you. When I got ghosted by the majority of people to talk to, that\u2019s when I knew that life is a bunch of bullshit. People come and people go. You can\u2019t control it. All you can really do is watch from the outside, wish it was you and proactively move on. \n\nIt sucks but, allowing it to eat you up forever isn\u2019t worth it. It takes a mentally strong person to survive indefinite solitude without ending up dead on the other side. Hopefully, you\u2019ll come out a far better person.",

      "text": "My lifelong, groomsmen friends have come from my time working at a summer camp, not from college. I have a few fairly close friends at school, but I have friends I'd drop everything and drive half way across the state for from camp. I also think having health problems kinda forces you to grow up too. I have had a bunch of surgery since I started college back in 2019 and eventually had to have my leg amputated back in January just as the spring semester was getting going and I definitely don't feel like my classmates. I had to get real serious about school really quickly if I was going to make it through last semester with my GPA intact. I fight off those feelings of loneliness by just jam packing my schedule. I'm taking 17 hours, I have an on campus job, and I'm heavily involved in undergraduate research. It's probably not the healthiest way to deal with it, but I only have a year and a half left and I'm hoping that grad school will be better.",
