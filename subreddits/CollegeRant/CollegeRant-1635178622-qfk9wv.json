  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI am a second year student at a pretty well known private school that shall remain unnamed because it's not really important. I am working on my undergrad in chemistry and I have to say, college sucks and rocks at the same time. Let me explain:\n\nThis semester has been really, really tough on myself and some of my friends who are also chemistry majors. We are required to take a higher level physics course and the lab that comes with it for both semesters, and honestly it is beating us down. On top of that, I have some other classes that I don't have any particular fondness for, but have to because of the general education requirements. What I find that sucks about being a STEM major is we tend to get romanticized by academia as these all-stars that are incapable of limitations and inability in their fields. This translates into being pushed hard by the curriculum of the university you are attending. I may be biased, but STEM majors are by far the most stressed out of all the students in a given college campus. There are lots of times where you feel like you don't live up to your major. It's not just the grades you shouldn't have gotten on an exam or an assignment, or the late nights working and worrying about your marks to the point of losing sleep. It's just that I hate that I can't do better at handling it all. I feel absolutely pushed to my limit everyday I'm here. Without question, this is the most challenging time in my life so far, as it is with most college students (especially STEM students). My grades here and there could be better, I'm having some difficulty in some classes (fortunately my professors are understanding, which is more than many can say), and in all I've been feeling like an inadequate student. I do not disbelieve that I am capable of doing well in my field of study, nor do I intend on changing majors, but I do really want the struggle to stop. There are days that I don't do any work or anything productive because of how paranoid I am about it all (sounds counter-intuitive but if you've been there you know what I mean). My anxiety is through the roof, and I'm afraid that I am going to sink down to an absolute low point. In short, it is a horrifying time to be me right now.\n\nHowever, I also must say that being a STEM major is the most rewarding thing that I have done so far in college. It has made me see how well I can push past hardship and be just fine, and not to mention that I have meet some great people along the way. Everything is hard as a STEM major, but nothing great in life comes easily. Take it from me. I was not a good student my first semester freshman year. Online classes were just not my vibe and basically I became very, very laid back. Academic probation and sear determination to not get kicked out of a good school made me bounce back and make dean's list second semester. Those five A's and two B's were the hardest A's and B's I earned in my academic career, but I got them. So I suppose I'm not a bad student, but I can't help to admit that I still feel afraid of what is going to happen next. I can't say that I'm happy with myself at the moment, and those feelings of inadequacy as a student are still lingering in me. I don't know what to do, but whatever it is I hope it can make me feel better about myself as a student and as a person.\n\nTL;DR: being a STEM major in college is hard, failure and success is all part of it, and being afraid of your own abilities or lack thereof.",

      "text": "Been there! I guess I'm in a STEM major, but it doesn't feel as serious - Biology/Pre-med. I actually feel challenged by my intro to Chem and phys. But my time is strained by family life with a toddler and two stepkids. Also, a partner who can't drive. \ud83d\ude05 also, I'm 28 going on my third time back into school after a 5 year hiatus. Sooo, definitely feel stressed more than most. Luckily I got to one of those \"non-traditional\" student universities, which is still a credible university. \n\nFortunate, i do still feel though. My kids, partner, and friends all like how much I learn and tell them about. So, that's cool, and I think I'll still be able to get into the medical program in my nearest city's private institution. \n\n(Also, meds for anxiety have really helped me with school during a global pandemic)",

      "text": "I was a biology major my first semester of college and then dropped it into a minor and did an art major instead. I love biology but at the age (18-21), I wasn't willing or really disciplined enough to make it so that majority of my time would be spent studying. I also have a rough relationship with my family and romantic relationships at the time which frankly would have made it too stressful to really commit myself. \n\nScience and similar (stem) is a great degree if you have a strong passion for it, but you really need equal dedication to studying for it.",
