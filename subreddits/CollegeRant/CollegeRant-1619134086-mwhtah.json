Of course work is stressful. But being able to A) earn money from it and B) come home and ... that\u2019s it and C) in their case at least having a real sense of stability. I tried to make the comparison\u2014 imagine the most stressful thing you have to do at work, where you feel so confused and in over your head, you have to do that every day and then after that you go home and have to do it for 4-6 more hours. I will add that my dad never went to college and now has a really good job (which could never happen now) and that my mom went to cosmetology school part time. So neither of them have a real grasp of what it\u2019s like to be in my shoes. So right now I\u2019m broke, exhausted, and have literally no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life\u2014 and somehow they think that our situations are equal because they\u2019re different. I don\u2019t want to minimize the stress they feel but I just don\u2019t even know how it could compare. I\u2019d take a mistake at work or interpersonal relationship stress any-day over trying to study for 7 hours for my economics exam that looks like it\u2019s in a different language to me and makes me feel like my brain is turning on itself and then u get to the point of ur brain just blocking your ability to do anything. School just makes me feel like shit all the time.
