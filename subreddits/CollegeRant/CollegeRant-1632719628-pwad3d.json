  "text": "My roommates are chill people, but I sort of wish that I was rooming with others. One of my roommates just sleeps all day, the other just wants to stay in his room, and the last guy overloaded his schedule so he's either always in class or out with study groups. For the most part, I'm the only one in the living room and it sucks since I also haven't had that much success meeting new friends in college. I'm not great at initial first conversations and don't have the courage to approach people cause of bad social anxiety. So that means I basically have just been studying and alone with my thoughts. That sucks since I feel that I am wasting my college experience and social life. Covid fucked me over and my orgs have been slow to start. I mainly have lectures for my classes so it's already hard to meet people. I am sociable, but I'm not great at making that first step to become friends with someone else. I might just be overthinking it, but it's either I feel that I'm too boring or can't take hints that the other person is uninterested in the conversation. First week that I was here and I was told by one of those roommates and sister that I make boring small talk  questions when talking to people. \n\nFor the few people that I have met, I haven't been able to click with them that I want to hang out with them outside of classes. It just sucks since I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to",

          "text": "the most fun I had was today where I went out to get food with a friend because she invited me. And it really hit me in the gut how lonely I have been these past few weeks. And I\u2019m ugly, so that\u2019s another blow to my self confidence to try and talk to new ppl. Like also as sad as it sounds, I\u2019m really jealous of those ppl who are able to immediately click and connect with others plus hold meaningful conversations. I\u2019m not able to do that, so I don\u2019t really hang out with anybody else. \nBack to my roommates, they are all great at the beginning but over time they\u2019ve just devolved to being recluses. The first guy literally just plays on his PS4 all day because he only took easy classes with little to any work. The guy who sleeps all day only talks to me when we\u2019re both in the kitchen, and it\u2019s a few exchanged words about our days. It\u2019s weird since in high school,  I was fine with being alone, mainly cause I had a group to hang out with during the school day. So it exhausted my social battery when I got back home, now since I don\u2019t hang out or talk with anybody I don\u2019t have anything to do, it sucks. I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed social interactions until college",

      "text": "Yep, I work at my school's dining a hella lot like almost 40 hours a week but that's cause both myself and my family are flat broke. Anyway the point is yeah I live with 3 other guys but we don't know each other previously, but I never see any of them cause they live in their rooms I literally hear them playing Madden and watching TV but they don't wanna hang or even come downstairs. Only 1 guy is chill but he works nights most of the week bit when he's available he may hang but then he is also the one who smokes weed in the living room but idc tbh \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe neighbors next door are also 4 guys but I see them hanging downstairs in the living room everyday when I get home from work 930 10 ish. They keep the front door open and seem really easy and chill, actually went over today with a 24 pack of Bud Light \ud83d\ude01 and introduced myself cause at this point I'm not gonna get nowhere with my current roommates...",
