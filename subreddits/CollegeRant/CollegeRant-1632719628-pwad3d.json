One of my roommates just sleeps all day, the other just wants to stay in his room, and the last guy overloaded his schedule so he's either always in class or out with study groups. For the most part, I'm the only one in the living room and it sucks since I also haven't had that much success meeting new friends in college. I'm not great at initial first conversations and don't have the courage to approach people cause of bad social anxiety. So that means I basically have just been studying and alone with my thoughts. That sucks since I feel that I am wasting my college experience and social life. Covid fucked me over and my orgs have been slow to start. I mainly have lectures for my classes so it's already hard to meet people. I am sociable, but I'm not great at making that first step to become friends with someone else. I might just be overthinking it, but it's either I feel that I'm too boring or can't take hints that the other person is uninterested in the conversation. First week that I was here and I was told by one of those roommates and sister that I make boring small talk  questions when talking to people. \n\nFor the few people that I have met, I haven't been able to click with them that I want to hang out with them outside of classes. It just sucks since I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to", "author": "J_tnguyen", "created": 1632719628, "retrieved": 1632840983, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "comments": {"heftwza": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwad3d/unlucky_with_roommates_and_social_life/heftwza/", "text": "Thank you u/J_tnguyen for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
