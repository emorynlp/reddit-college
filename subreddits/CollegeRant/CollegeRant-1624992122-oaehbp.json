These past two years have been nothing but soul crushing. The majority of my professors were horrific (especially after the pandemic when most of them became nonexistent and relied on Pearson to do everything for them). The social life at my CC was also nonexistent. The second class let out everyone raced home. I remember going to the student game lounge after class on a Friday at like noon hoping to meet people and the place was a ghost town. Since there were no frats the only parties were held at the men\u2019s soccer house, and as a guy the only way to get in was to be close with one of the players. I need reassurance that a 4 year university is better before I cry or something.", "author": "tate3223", "created": 1624992122, "retrieved": 1632949635, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3hz62x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oaehbp/someone_pls_tell_me_university_is_better_than/h3hz62x/", "text": "I transfered over from my local cc. 99% of people are there to get their degrees man.
