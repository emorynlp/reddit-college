  "title:": "Professor locked online exams so that I would have to purchase the $120 connect code",
  "text": "I have an online course, and it runs through CANVAS and Connect. All the assignments are linked through Connect which needs a code to activate. I was using the 2 week free trial and blasting through all the assignments to avoid having to pay another $120, and as I\u2019m approaching the finish line I notice the last two exams are locked until a month out. I emailed my professor who promptly told me, \u201cThe exams weren\u2019t supposed to be open yet, and I noticed the error due to you working so far ahead\u201d. So essentially I\u2019m forced to buy this code just to take 2 exams now which would have been open regardless.",

Sometimes the professors can extend the length of a free trial too. They're all just people and mostly understanding. Good luck, good job working ahead though!",
