The class size is very small and word on the street was they were going to divide commencement up between majors to make it even smaller.\n\nInstead, they're just going to post a slideshow with some pictures and call it a day. I'm angry and heartbroken. The school is hosting a 100+ person alumni event tomorrow evening, but it can't do a small graduation with maybe 20 people a major. \n\nI didn't even think I'd make it this far in life but instead of celebrating what I thought was impossible, I'll be watching a few shitty iphone pictures slide past my laptop screen for an hour and that's it.", "author": "nadehlaaay", "created": 1605634832, "retrieved": 1632951527, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gco7e06": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvxepo/my_graduation_ceremony_next_month_is_going_to_be/gco7e06/", "text": "Idk what my school is doing come spring graduation, but if it's the same then I'm just gonna have my degree mailed to me.

My university is doing the same exact thing with this semesters graduates, as well as last semesters. They postponed last semesters graduation in the hopes that COVID would be over by now, but obviously that hasn\u2019t happened. They even still expect us to buy a cap and gown for it as well. I am not happy about the entire slideshow deal, who is actually going to sit there and watch it other than the people graduating? Even then, I know lots of people who won\u2019t waste their time to see their picture go across a screen for a few seconds.", "author": "Your_Name_Here1234", "created": 1605658142, "upvotes": 9}, "gcns0vv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvxepo/my_graduation_ceremony_next_month_is_going_to_be/gcns0vv/", "text": "Are you gonna show concerns to higher up and voice it out? Graduation should be the finish line and a better day for everyone to celebrate. This shouldn't even happen. \n\nUnfair they let Alumni have a big day and they probably risk bringing COVID on campus. But a new graduate like you has to instead watch a slideshow and recorded video? \n\nMy school did their graduation in late October with tents and chairs set up in the big parking lot and set up 6ft distant chairs and people wore their masks.\n\nDo a petition!", "author": "Mya19", "created": 1605652988, "upvotes": 11}}}
