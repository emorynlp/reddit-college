This year it feels impossible to actually learn as much. At least when you\u2019re in person, you have to study to take the quiz and tests. Now, it\u2019s just either taking the hours out of my day to read the textbook, and find the information, or just type it into google and get all the answers in 10 minutes. \n\nThen there is the issue of finding all of your assignments due dates. Some professors have their blackboard, so unorganized and unclear, I feel like I have to dig through 8 folders to find the due dates that don\u2019t show up on the calendar menu. \n\nAnyway, I felt more motivated to do the work after class when they were in person. Instead, I\u2019m locked in my room from 11-5 most days, and all I want to do is get the assignments done in any way possible, and go enjoy myself in the evenings.", "author": "MuskiePride3", "created": 1600533278, "retrieved": 1632950188, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 396, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g82epk2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ivvtgm/online_school_is_less_about_learning_and_more/g82epk2/", "text": "Time suck-write, spell/grammar check, submit, repeat.", "author": "Tumbleweed_Life", "created": 1602121434, "upvotes": 1}, "g5zmvtc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ivvtgm/online_school_is_less_about_learning_and_more/g5zmvtc/", "text": "Imagine learning a whole new language this way , I have to work twice as hard to retain this stuff for my own personal understanding", "author": "Wringl_-_-_", "created": 1600615428, "upvotes": 1}, "g5ww7ql": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ivvtgm/online_school_is_less_about_learning_and_more/g5ww7ql/", "text": "Junior here. Totally feel you in this. I wake up at 8am and I dont stop doing assignments till 9 or 10 pm. There is no teaching in any of the classes, just flying through slideshows.

Instead of going straight to the HW you have to teach yourself tha material and then do the HW so each assignment takes doible the time. And like you said, no motivation whatsoever, just sitting behind a screen 24/7 waiting for that grade to posted and that class to start and that assignment to be posted. Its been a nightmare for me.

That's why lectures have to be a certain amount of hours, as do labs, as do readings and homework, as does everything. Those \"3 credit hours\" for your one class are more important in pretty much the whole world than the actual grade. When you call universities or ask about financial aid, they say \"well it's $\\_\\_\\_\\_ per ***credit hour***\" which just further exemplifies the point. Everything is about time invested in regards to higher ed. Success (passing instead of failing) is important, too, but what is ***mandated*** is the amount of time spent. Ever had a professor run out of things to do during a lecture and have to think of more stuff to keep going? Another symptom of this.\n\nAnyways, so what I'm saying is, what you're describing in your post is what ***you*** get, or want to get out of college. But, make no mistake, universities just simply need you to spend that exact amount of time throughout a semester doing all of those things regardless of anything else about those things or about you, other than that you can't do poorly in them. So the take-away is, make your own system of value for your classes and what you're learning in them. If they're making you miserable, drop and swap them with help from your Advisor before it's too late to do so. There's probably going to be 2 semesters of all-online, like this, due to COVID. Spend them doing the classes you can get away with taking right now that you are enthusiastic and curious about. The subjects and activities that feel repulsive to you should be skipped now and taken later in more normal semesters. Where they are unskippable, you gotta dig in, remember the truth of the first paragraph I wrote here, and then find your meaning of why you personally want to spend that time and do well in the course that takes so much of it", "author": "ConnorCarbon", "created": 1600543251, "upvotes": 4}, "g5u778w": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ivvtgm/online_school_is_less_about_learning_and_more/g5u778w/", "text": "i feel this too! my parents are hounding me to attend all lectures live even though a) they aren\u2019t mandatory, b) i don\u2019t learn through lectures, and c) they\u2019re recorded!! it\u2019s hard enough just remembering due dates for things i\u2019m actually graded on let alone all the technically nonessential stuff. working and doing online classes is tough", "author": "rebonk", "created": 1600537866, "upvotes": 7}, "g5u0xjl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ivvtgm/online_school_is_less_about_learning_and_more/g5u0xjl/", "text": "U can just remove the online part because this applies for all schooling.

Luckily there are a lot of good videos online for the class in currently doing. Thing is I enjoyed in person class. You learned cool stuff and it wasn't that hard now it's like nonstop grueling work. I spend all my time trying to force myself to get my stuff done and to study so I know stuff for 1 class. That's right because of a combo of covid and this being the last class before I switch to metro I only have 1 class this semester and no job and I spend all my time trying to study for it and still get super stressed out and score lower than I'd like. Online school freaking sucks and I miss actually being able to take time to play some video games and relax over the weekend. And my teacher being disorganized makes it much worse. I wish I at least had my Chem teacher from the spring semester he was super well organized and it made a huge difference during those online classes at the end of the semester when covid made us switch (he was awesome before that too but yeah).", "author": "Pacman042", "created": 1600534140, "upvotes": 29}}}
