(i was invited as well). All 5 of us are 20-24 years old.\nI find it a bit weird if they decided to go. I remember when I was in High School and when a bunch of 20 something year olds came it was the most awkward and weird thing ever. People talked so much crap saying \u201cdon\u2019t you have a job to get too?\u201d \u201caren\u2019t you in uni or collage?\u201d \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you at a collage party then?\u201d and then they would talk A LOT of bad things about the girl who invited them. Saying she\u2019s a Sl*t and all that. And it gave off very much pedo vibes to every female around. I even felt uncomfortable dancing at that point. \nThese guys want to go but it\u2019s a house filled with minors and to me it\u2019s weird. \nDoes anyone else think it\u2019s weird or is it just me? \nLike you\u2019re in your 20s partying with a bunch of high schoolers. If you want to party that bad, throw one yourself maybe? My bf has PLENTY of friends to throw a big party and none are minors. \nI would tell this to my bf and his friends but i don\u2019t want them thinking i\u2019m trying to stop them from doing something or whatever. Yes, I can state my opinion but at the same time I feel like they won\u2019t get it unless i say \u201cyou\u2019ll look like a pedo\u201d and I don\u2019t want to do that lol. \nWhat do any of you think?? Am i over thinking or is this a reasonable thing to bring up??", "author": "sabmichelle", "created": 1625583799, "retrieved": 1632842025, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h48simr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oewq0v/is_partying_with_16_year_olds_weird_for_a_2024/h48simr/", "text": "Thank you u/sabmichelle for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
