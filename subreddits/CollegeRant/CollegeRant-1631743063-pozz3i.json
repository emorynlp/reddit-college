I feel extremely behind and incompetent. I also get really jealous seeing other friends already having their life together and a good and stable job. I\u2019ve applied to 12 psychology relating jobs throughout my college years and got no calls back because my resume consists of fast food cashier and being in clubs so it\u2019s pretty weak. How am I supposed to find a good job if I have no experience at all? This is the point where I feel that college truly is a scam. Any advice would be amazing because I am truly lost and stressed about my life. But really I\u2019m just venting to get everything off my chest.", "author": "royallmilkk", "created": 1631743063, "retrieved": 1632948522, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hd1jptq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pozz3i/im_extremely_overwhelmed_and_stressed/hd1jptq/", "text": "Hey it's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed! Also, just focus on yourself and don't mind them! As long as you still want to have a job related to psych, then you'll work smart and hard to have one! Just a change of mindset and perspective is what we all need sometimes. Resting is also a must to keep yourself fresh! Your life is only beginning and you're still young so believe in yourself hmmmkaaaaay?", "author": "teenwolferer", "created": 1631767271, "upvotes": 5}}}
