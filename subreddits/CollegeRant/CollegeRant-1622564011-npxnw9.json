  "title:": "I registered for a class thinking it would be mostly online but it is not",
  "text": "Basically, I registered for a lab course as it was listed as \u201conline with some campus meetings\u201d vs other courses which were listed as strictly on campus with set meeting times. Now I am checking the syllabus which just posted and all the meetings are in person. The content available online includes online activities, videos, powerpoint slides, handouts, and testing. I can see how this may still fall under how they categorized it but in that case why even have separate categories for the two classes if they were both going to be predominantly in person? I\u2019m just frustrated. I was relying on the flexibility of a course which seemed mostly online which I now don\u2019t have. I\u2019m also mad that the class was presented as not following a typical lab format yet still does exactly that beyond online testing. Part of my preference towards that format is that i\u2019m immunocompromised and in the event I get sick I was hoping I\u2019d be able to more easily keep up with content. Plus, if it had been more clear, I could\u2019ve taken the time to search for courses at a different institution which would have better fit what I was looking for. I also emailed the professor about the in person class schedule beforehand and all he said was that they were still putting together the syllabus and had no set in person dates yet, but I kinda doubt that if they were planning on having them all in person they wouldn\u2019t have known that ahead of time. I realize tho I could\u2019ve put more effort into considering other options so this is honestly a rant on both my annoyance with the college and my annoyance with myself for not being more careful. There\u2019s not much I can do now except hope for the best lol. To anyone else taking summer courses, good luck!  :)\n\ntldr; Class seemed like it would be more online than it is. I needed a more online based curriculum for multiple reasons but now just have to make the best of it",

      "text": "I actually dropped my lab this summer for this reason. It said synchronous online and NOTHING about in person, but just in case I emailed the instructor over a month ago asking (other sections & classes knew, so it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t know) and he didn\u2019t even email me back. Posted the syllabus day 1 that everything was in person and I dropped it. Wouldn\u2019t want to take someone that wouldn\u2019t respond to a very nice short email anyway within a whole month anyway.",

For now I\u2019m gonna stick it out but I have two weeks to drop the course so I guess we\u2019ll see what happens. Good luck if you end up taking the lab again in future!",

      "text": "When I was hired for my job, it was one week before classes started. They had to come up with a schedule for me, cobbled together from various part-time instructors.\n\nWhen we suddenly stopped for COVID spring break of last year, we found out about an hour before the students. \n\nWhen we hit fall of last year, we found out a week before that all of our classes would be face to face and not online.\n\nIt is entirely possible your instructor had no idea. We generally find things out around the time the students do, and have to put everything together last minute at a breakneck pace, hoping we are prepared on day one.",

He may have been just as upset as you were and just as surprised.",
