Now I am checking the syllabus which just posted and all the meetings are in person. The content available online includes online activities, videos, powerpoint slides, handouts, and testing. I can see how this may still fall under how they categorized it but in that case why even have separate categories for the two classes if they were both going to be predominantly in person? I\u2019m just frustrated. I was relying on the flexibility of a course which seemed mostly online which I now don\u2019t have. I\u2019m also mad that the class was presented as not following a typical lab format yet still does exactly that beyond online testing. Part of my preference towards that format is that i\u2019m immunocompromised and in the event I get sick I was hoping I\u2019d be able to more easily keep up with content. Plus, if it had been more clear, I could\u2019ve taken the time to search for courses at a different institution which would have better fit what I was looking for. I also emailed the professor about the in person class schedule beforehand and all he said was that they were still putting together the syllabus and had no set in person dates yet, but I kinda doubt that if they were planning on having them all in person they wouldn\u2019t have known that ahead of time. I realize tho I could\u2019ve put more effort into considering other options so this is honestly a rant on both my annoyance with the college and my annoyance with myself for not being more careful. There\u2019s not much I can do now except hope for the best lol. To anyone else taking summer courses, good luck!  :)\n\ntldr; Class seemed like it would be more online than it is. I needed a more online based curriculum for multiple reasons but now just have to make the best of it", "author": "chunkycorn", "created": 1622564011, "retrieved": 1632950880, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h09j3u3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/npxnw9/i_registered_for_a_class_thinking_it_would_be/h09j3u3/", "text": "You should report this issue to a department head, that's not fair to you and other students.", "author": "Samehra", "created": 1622598756, "upvotes": 1}, "h07szei": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/npxnw9/i_registered_for_a_class_thinking_it_would_be/h07szei/", "text": "I actually dropped my lab this summer for this reason.
