  "text": "Not academically, but socially. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried harder in my life to try to find something socially, but I either fuck it up, no traction is gained, or something else happens and I\u2019m never able to join a group of friends. Fuck it, I\u2019m giving up. I tried damn hard to claw myself out of a very low period, and yet I failed, I feel myself sinking again, and I\u2019m still alone. I literally see people make best friends in like 2 weeks and in the 12 weeks I\u2019ve been here I still have fucking no one, and I\u2019m almost sure people hate me or think I\u2019m stand off-ish. I just don\u2019t even know what to do, and quite frankly I\u2019ve pushed so much I just fucking give up. This is probably a sign to just focus on myself because I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to do anymore.",
