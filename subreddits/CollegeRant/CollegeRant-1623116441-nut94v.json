I usually don\u2019t post on reddit but I had to get this out somehow. My mom has been battling a terminal illness since I was 15 and her medical bills and my own collected debt have clashed and now we\u2019re stuck financially. I was trying to pay it off by taking up a job at the hospital since I thought a) it pertained to my major and b) I like to have more healthcare experience as I want to do Genetic Counseling. I have to most likely transfer home now to finish up college even though I had dreamed of finishing up here in an out of state college. I just feel like a failure as I was almost done. I know I can still make it but I feel I\u2019ve let not only myself but my family down as they were rooting for me. Im not sure to take a gap year or to keep going as I want to mentally rest from all of this stress (COVID to now). Sorry I sound so downerish but I couldnt hold it any longer. -E\nTL;DR: Due to financial constraints I have to go home to finish college when I wanted to finish at a college I enjoyed", "author": "BunnE3", "created": 1623116441, "retrieved": 1632949736, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h0zqevu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nut94v/feel_like_a_failure/h0zqevu/", "text": "You're doing school while facing major personal hardships, working, AND dealing with a global pandemic.
