      "text": "I feel you so fucking hard. But I also feel myself growing resentful of it all. If I could spend all day working and have the night off, like a job, then I would be alright with it. But as it is, I\u2019m currently working all day, taking 45 minutes to make and eat dinner with my husband, and then working until 11 or 12. Repeat that shit the next day. I\u2019d love to look forward to summer vacation, but I\u2019m taking just as heavy of a load over the summer. I made the mistake of looking ahead at the syllabi for my classes and one of them wants a 10 page paper 3 weeks after class starts. Another will be covering a 900-page book in 5 weeks (she doesn\u2019t teach, we just read the book and write at least 1100 words a week). I\u2019m praying so hard that my other classes aren\u2019t ridiculous.\n\nAs far as your classes, try to not give up now. As irritating as that is to think about, try to think about how upset (pissed as shit) you\u2019ll be if all of your hard work over the semester went for nothing because you let go in the last couple weeks. That\u2019s not easy, I get it. Feeling tired, hate it, just want to have some fun, or just do literally nothing. Whatever you do, you don\u2019t want it to be school anymore. I\u2019m right there with you. But I know how devastated I\u2019ll be if I don\u2019t finish well after all the work I\u2019ve put in over the semester. I hope this motivates you enough to help. I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t help, but at least know others can empathize with you. \ud83e\udd0d",

I don't have much experience in college (class of 2020), but this semester is looking like I will make my first B's. I have been completely checked out since mid-March when I should've had spring break. College has been the worst experience of my life so far. I have no friends because I am at home, and all my high school friends went off to their colleges. The burnout, depression, and pure loneliness are surreal.",

The only people that should be making that kind of money are people involved with the coordinating and running of an entire department. \n\nThe administrators can be crooks though, especially the financial aid offices. The federal government is to blame too, because these colleges raise the price of tuition knowing the government will just give anyone a loan. Now, these students graduate and some have to get loan forgiveness and the government loses whatever the excess left over was because the person simply cannot pay back a home mortgage at 20 something years old in ten years on 50k/year. These universities are inadvertently stealing from tax payers if you think about it.",
