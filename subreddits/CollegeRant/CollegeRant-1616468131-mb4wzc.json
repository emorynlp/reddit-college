It was replaced by 2 sets of 2 days off to give us 2x 4 day weekends, and a few other days off here and there. The second 4 day break is starting April 1, and they are closing all of the food halls, and trying to get people to leave campus. You  have to sign up to stay in your dorm. It takes 6 hours round trip for my family to drive me here, so my break essentially becomes 2 fucking days. They were going to pick me up on March 31 and bring me back april 6, but then my calc teacher decided to have a test on april 1, which is the only class where I have regular in person tests. There goes what might have been the closest thing to a fucking break I would have gotten.
