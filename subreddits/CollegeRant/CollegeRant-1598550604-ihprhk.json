  "text": "I was recently discharged from a 5-day hospital stay. I didn\u2019t party, kept my social distance, wore my mask. I now have to quarantine for 10+ days. I will be continuing the rest of my semester off of campus as such. It is not worth it. I have been through so much pain and had a close encounter with death. Please guys, stay safe. It isn\u2019t worth it.",

Depending on the circumstances, it only takes one person to make a difference. \nHope you are feeling better and you don\u2019t lose faith in perusing your degree. \u2764\ufe0f",
