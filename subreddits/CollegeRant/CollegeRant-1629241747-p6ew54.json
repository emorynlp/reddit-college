A lot of people here move out in like their late 20s. I\u2019ve only met like two people who stay at the dorms in my university but the majority still live with their parents. I will admit I feel like I\u2019ve missed out a big part of the college experience because of this but it\u2019s also nice to be with my mom during this challenging part of my life.", "author": "Inevitable-Tomato-81", "created": 1629241747, "retrieved": 1632949090, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h9f6a19": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6ew54/anybody_here_go_to_college_but_live_with_their/h9f6a19/", "text": "I have for my first couple years. My school (nearest one offering my major) is 2.5hrs away now though and basically forces me to spend that $10k on the dorm/food and simply miss out on home life. I\u2019m pretty pissed, but I know I don\u2019t have the ability to drive over 5 hours a day, do homework, and still have any free time without burning out. If you can live with you parents through college, I\u2019d 1000% recommend it. Save yourself thousands easily. You can hang out on campus all day long and even spend the night with people you know occasionally. At the end of the day though, the minor convenience and location of your bed will likely save you $10k+ in the end.", "author": "XxNHLxX", "created": 1629302040, "upvotes": 3}, "h9eaq9p": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6ew54/anybody_here_go_to_college_but_live_with_their/h9eaq9p/", "text": "I was thinking about this recently.
