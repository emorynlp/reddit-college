Half of me is like \"fuck it\" and the other half is like constantly panicking lmao. Every time a new semester starts I become even more depressed than I normally already am lol\n\n\nI just feel so unhappy with where I am in life, and I feel even worse because I can't progress because I'm stuck in this country doing this useless ass course. And I say useless because out of the 3 years, 1 year is dedicated to non-course related LMFAO.

I also feel very unhappy with my degree and the path that I've taken, but even if it gets harder every semester I think we should stick it out till the end to at least get the goddamn diploma. if we have to go through such misery we might as well get that piece of paper - whether it will be helpful or not. plus, there's a higher chance you'll regret dropping out than not dropping out.", "author": "bibicicimici", "created": 1629584769, "upvotes": 7}}}
