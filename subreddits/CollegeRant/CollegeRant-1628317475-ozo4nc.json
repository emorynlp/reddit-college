There\u2019s no mask requirement and if you submit proof of vaccination you don\u2019t need to be tested at all. Especially with the new variants going around, the last thing I want to do is sit in a small room surrounded by people no longer wearing masks and having zero testing to ensure they aren\u2019t spreading it. I\u2019m having to plan on getting a test done myself before I can go home on weekends because I have a parent who\u2019s immunocompromised and I can\u2019t risk bringing something home. This is setting up to be a huge mess when everyone gathers together right away with basically zero rules set in place. If nothing else, I don\u2019t want the \u201ccommon cold\u201d or \u201cflu\u201d that\u2019s going around to be reduced symptom covid and not know it until it\u2019s too late..
