      "text": "Why would you be? It\u2019s only one week. Just get up and go to class at 8 and again at 10. It sucks, but that\u2019s how the schedule is this time around. You should also email the professors to explain your situation and state that you will read the syllabi and get information from a classmate to get caught up. Do not ask \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d as the syllabi will tell you that. If you still have questions after reading them and going over any material you miss, take those questions to office hours.\n\nLong story short, you should be fine. Just take a deep breath and get up to speed. :)",
