I\u2019m a first year student so it was a bit of a challenge to transition from hs to college online. However my second sem, I did slacked off and now I\u2019m getting B\u2019s with a couple A\u2019s. It\u2019s not bad, but I know I  can do better. I\u2019ve been so stressed about GPA, I don\u2019t want it to go down. There is a couple of classes where I\u2019m borderline and I\u2019m manifesting really hard that it stays a B. I\u2019m  hoping my parents understand how difficult a year it has been. But I do procrastinate a lot and don\u2019t get in on top of my priorities and that\u2019s a habit I need to fix. I just need to find new studying habits and not keep making the same mistake over again \ud83e\udd72", "author": "milkteamami4", "created": 1621747843, "retrieved": 1632842334, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"gz4t7kv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nj0xhq/feeling_down/gz4t7kv/", "text": "Thank you u/milkteamami4 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I completely understand and relate to what you\u2019re saying. Honestly, I\u2019ve been struggling this semester too (it\u2019s my second as well) and I\u2019m giving my finals, still haven\u2019t figured out how to fix my procrastination or my anxious brain. I\u2019ve come to realise that \u2018disciplining\u2019 yourself and creating an effective routine takes a lot of time and consistency. So as long as you\u2019re ready to put in those two things, you\u2019ll be okay. And this doesn\u2019t mean you start giving into hustle culture or just go go go. Even taking out your books/notes, setting them on the table is a big achievement if you struggle with procrastination/time management and/or anxiety. It\u2019s also important to remember that it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t end up sticking to schedule (which I recommend you make) or aren\u2019t as productive as you thought you would be. Expect goals out of yourself which are realistic. Start small, divide the big tasks into smaller portions to get going. Download study apps, put on a \u2018Study With Me\u2019 on YT. Find a study buddy, or an accountability partner. Try things until u find something which feels right and comfortable for you. Don\u2019t forget to take breaks, and most importantly, forgive yourself if you haven\u2019t reached the point of accomplishment that you wanted to. At university level, Bs are pretty great too. And during all of this, I hope you realise that you\u2019re doing great!
