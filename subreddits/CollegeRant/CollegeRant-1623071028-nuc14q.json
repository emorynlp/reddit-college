  "text": "First some context. When the pandemic hit last spring i took an incomplete in a couple classes, including my capstone class. As a history major research had become difficult to impossible with all the libraries and archives closed down. Adding to that my grandmother dying from Covid and mental health and motivation at an all time low and I just couldn\u2019t do school at that time. Additionally I was out of work (I\u2019ve worked about 25-30 hours a week through college to support myself) and didn\u2019t qualify for stimulus checks initially so once the restaurant I worked at opened back up I was there full time to make up for lost money. I had a year to complete my capstone, so in January I contacted my professor to get the ball rolling on finishing that class. A couple weeks and a couple more emails went by with no reply. I contacted my advisor about this and she put me in touch with the head of the liberal arts department, who got in touch with the professor and told him to get in touch with me. Finally he responded and we had a couple zoom meetings where we discussed my capstone and established a due date, June 11. I got the rough draft done on March 22 and sent it in to him that night. He responded immediately saying he\u2019d \u201cget to it when he can and give me feedback then\u201d. I gave him about 10 days and followed up with another email asking to set a time for a zoom meeting. No reply. I emailed my advisor a few days later who just told me to \u201cbe patient\u201d. Now it\u2019s June 7 and I have 4 days until the due date, with no follow up on my rough draft, so I\u2019m going to email him again this morning. The worst part is me and my gf scheduled a two week long vacation starting on June 12, assuming my capstone would have been finished by then since that was the due date we set. When we get back I\u2019ll be starting my first post grad job so I\u2019d like to not have to push my due date back at all given what I have lined up soon. I\u2019ve just been frustrated with this professor through this whole process and now his inability to respond to emails and review my rough draft is screwing with other life plans.",
