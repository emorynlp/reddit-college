In class the professor doesn't even teach, he just dicks around talking about movies or some shit and tells us to turn off our phones and listen to him. If anyone in class asks for help he says no and instead sends them khan academy videos via email after class. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis shit is pissing me off so much that I usually take 3-4 10 minute breaks throughout the class. Currently on a break right now, actually. I'm sick and fucking tired of driving to class and being forced to listen to YET ANOTHER tenured cunt talk about how awesome he is all day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease just kill me.", "author": "Fuck-College", "created": 1632770837, "retrieved": 1632951434, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"hej47f9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwohzx/why_the_fuck_am_i_having_to_attend_an_online/hej47f9/", "text": "You know what?\nI never understood why employers have said for the past ten/fifteen years that online degrees are worthless.\nYou absolutely just cleared everything up for me.\nThank you.", "author": "katCEO", "created": 1632785663, "upvotes": 12}}}
