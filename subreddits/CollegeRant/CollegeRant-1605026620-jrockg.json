I genuinely have no reason why and trust me I'd fess up if I knew I did something stupid. I've asked and she said she just doesn't like me.\n\nAnyways, I came home last night to my apartment and I noticed raw chicken sitting out on the counter. Obviously it was being left to thaw but if you're gonna thaw frozen chicken overnight, you do it in the refrigerator so it doesn't breed bacteria. I like to cook and I'm also a senior biology major, so I thought this was common knowledge.\n\nSo, in an attempt to save her from food poisoning, I put the chicken in the fridge as it won't breed any bacteria at that temperature while still being able to dethaw.\n\nI wake up this morning to the most nasty text ever saying how dare I touch her shit and she doesn't care on my opinion of food safety (opinion???)\n\nThis bitch is in pharmacy school. A doctorate program. And she doesn't know you can't leave RAW CHICKEN OUT OVERNIGHT IN A 70 DEGREE ROOM.\n\nupdate: she blocked me on snap. We're 22 and 23 years old.

Nevertheless, she shouldn\u2019t be that mad for something that was meant well.\n\nAlso, this post taught me something new. When we\u2019re making a large amount of chicken we always just let it thaw overnight outside of the refrigerator. I never thought about the possibility of it growing bacteria.
