  "text": "Are you KIDDING me right now??? This is the worst possible time for stupid Chinese made Amazon godawful products to quit on me. \n\nMy exams require Proctorio so I do the 360 spin on its hinge (my hands are shaky and would probably be unintelligible by the instructor.) I put the cam back in its place and...? Boom, black feed. The lights turn off on the damn thing. \n\nNow I'm in a bad situation. I have to take a 60 minute midterm without a webcam which means the teach is gonna think I'm cheating and the whole thing is gonna be a big fat 0 or potential academic dishonesty. Proctorio did not kick me out, but doing the entire test with a black feed was haunting. I did voice my frustrations about the broken webcam on the recording and emailed him right after, but I'm still so pissed off.\n\nTldr: My cheap Amazon webcam busted during a midterm and now I'm worried the teach will think I'm cheating.",

      "text": "FUCK Proctorio.  Reminds me of last year when I was taking the first test of the semester in my calculus class and the teacher allowed us to use Desmos (online graphing calculator).  At one point, I tabbed back from Desmos to my test and just got a blank white screen.  Tried clicking; it did nothing.  So I refreshed, and in doing so was kicked out of my test.  I got a 28 - a really awesome way to start the semester, right?  Damn I'm lucky I eked out a C and was thus still able to move on to the next course.\n\nThankfully I have a different teacher who doesn't use that shitty spyware.  Not to mention it only works with Chrome, and there's a reason I use Firefox as my primary browser instead.  I don't trust Google with my data and Firefox is faster on my computer as well.",
