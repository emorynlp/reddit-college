I eventually learned that most people have a lot in common with you and they aren\u2019t being mean or judging you at all. I became comfortable being uncomfortable. Now I would consider myself an extrovert (not an over the top one by any means) but I do enjoy meeting and talking to new people. Which has lead to many opportunities that I would have missed out on if I stayed to myself like I had in the past. Most extroverts (myself included) feel bad when we see someone alone. Now myself I just say \u201chey\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d just to make the person feel more included. I never push anyone to do something they\u2019re not comfortable with, and I feel that\u2019s where a lot of extroverts go wrong. Anyways I hope you get more comfortable with college life and stick to what you WANT to do and don\u2019t have anyone force you out of your zone.

For example, try finding clubs or student groups that interest you. In my experience, those tend to be a bit smaller and a bit less dramatic/frenzied, and thus easier to handle (maybe because some interests naturally draw in introverts, just as others are more appealing to extroverts). You can also take things slow with classmates or roommates - a study session for a test with 1 or 2 other people, a quick bite to eat with someone you chatted with during class, etc. It doesn't have to be a raging party or big \"event.\" \n\nOnline classes and clubs are a good idea, too (both my work and my PhD research focus on online learning, so I'm definitely a proponent), but I would caution not to use them as a \"crutch.\" Not saying don't do it at all, or don't have a fully online courseload if that works for you and your academic plans - just that you should also take advantage of your time in college. They say it's \"the best 4 years of your life,\" and while that's generally garbage it *can* be a great experience if you do it your way while making the most of the opportunities in front of you.  \n\nYou've probably heard it a million times (I did/do, too), but probably from extroverts and social butterflies who don't understand that there are many ways to be \"sociable.\" Just be you, but a you that is open to occasionally reaching out, taking a risk, or finding something new.
