I am living at home and commuting, but am super excited to meet new people and join clubs and be involved, especially since I won\u2019t be living on campus. I\u2019ve been to a few parties this summer with all kids from my high school and a bunch of them were super rude about the fact that I chose commuting to Long Beach over going away to Santa Barbara. They made it sound like I was gonna go four years with no friends and no memories. I\u2019m super excited about going to Long Beach, but with one week left before school starts, besides the worry of my workload and academics in general, these words are kind of starting to get to me. I guess I just wish that people would respect other peoples college choices because whatever plan you\u2019ve made for after high school and beyond is valid and up to no one else. I can still go to parties and be young and dumb even though I\u2019m commuting. I\u2019m just not paying. $20,000 more a semester to do so.", "author": "Sorry_Poet_5446", "created": 1628911168, "retrieved": 1632949108, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h8yyxjt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p40dh4/letting_peoples_words_about_my_commuting_instead/h8yyxjt/", "text": "Hey bud, don\u2019t fucking listen to those fools.
