I'm scared that I'll mess up and do everything wrong or that I'll get to work late or stuff because it's like a 30-minute drive and anything can happen. Plus, what if I get my internship wrong and that just invalidates it? I already spoke to my professor and he says it's cool but I'm still scared as heck that I might mess up the procedure. It shouldn't be too hard but if college has taught me anything, it's that a lot of things are stupidly designed.\n\nI'm sorry, I just needed a place to vent. College has left me with horrible anxiety about life in general and I'm already in my final year so I can't exactly back out. I also mess things up a lot and am forgetful and being socially awkward has not made anything easier.

If the drive is 30 minutes typically at the time you leave, allowing 40 minutes should be plenty of time most days. Allow an extra 20 minutes your first week.    \n  \nGas up the car the day before.  \nCheck oil level and tire air the week before.   \n  \nIf you did what you could to prevent automotive problems, and something pops up on the road, you might just have to let your employer know you'll be delayed.

If you are scared of forgetting, set up a lot of alarms.

You are there to learn and all the workers know that. You will know very little about the work performed. Someone will be training you and teaching you how things are done.\n\nYou have a great opportunity before you because it is the time to ask questions. Dont be shy or scared to ask questions. You wont know what the heck is going on and it will be expected that the intern will ask questions. If you ask questions then people in the company will see that you are interested in the task at hand and will see you as a good potential candidate.\n\nGood luck and congrats on obtaining an internship!!", "author": "RainyFL", "created": 1622482712, "upvotes": 61}, "h03p0cd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/np74f2/im_scared_of_my_internship/h03p0cd/", "text": "As someone with anxiety I think I can understand a little bit of how you're feeling.
