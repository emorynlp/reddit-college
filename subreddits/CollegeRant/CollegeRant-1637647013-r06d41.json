  "text": "I am a high school junior right now. Im in a program where i get to go to a college and take actual college courses there. It is a lot more challenging than i thiught it would be and now im getting low Bs in those classes. I have a 3.5 gpa in my high school but i dont even know if thats good. One of my college classes dropped to a 76 because of my participation and its so hard to talk in that class because i cant even voice an original thought. I try to get close with all my teachers for connection and letters but i dont even think they like me because they dont try to get close with me. I envy the kids who can do that so effortlessly. I feel like my college gpa is going to tank in this first semester. I think i can maintain a 3.5 gpa in high school but im scared for my college gpa. Im scared that i wont be able to do good enough to get recognized in good colleges. I wish i could get help in my college classes but in that class no one will talk to me. The only time i talk to people is in my group but im mostly left out of the conversation and it sucks. Im so scared theat my college gpa is gonna be the reason i cant do what i want. I want to become a nuerosurgein but i cant think of any reason any college would like me. Sorry this turned into a rant but im hoping one of yall can awnser the question.",
