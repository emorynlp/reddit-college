  "text": "yeah, i understand the point of proctored tests and quizzes, but my professor has taken it too far. she stated that if she suspects that we are \u2018cheating,\u2019 or not complying with her testing protocols, she will automatically fail us. this means.. no background noise AT ALL, looking down for a bit is prohibited, nothing is allowed to be in your room, NOT EVEN A TRASH CAN. i live at home with my family because moving out is expensive.. our internet is shit, my sisters do not care if they\u2019re being loud, and i have two dogs.. very vocal ones. my teacher also opens tests at 4:00pm and closes it at 11:59pm, which is so dumb because i work within that time frame.. so whenever i come home after work, i have to hop on that recorded test. i can\u2019t even test outside of my house because no library or cafe would be open after 10pm. \n\nalso this whole recording thing is such an invasion of privacy, and i heard the software they make you download on your computer is pretty invasive as well. fuck college.",

I\u2019ve done security stuff for a while now and it\u2019s pretty much common sense at this point not to download software that has root access and can lock you at any point. Also, editing the registry like that is extremely unsafe. I get that we need to curb cheating and by all means, cool but, we really don\u2019t need to throw privacy out the window to do it. \n\nHoping someone out there has the balls to make a change.",
