I tried taking a summer University Physics 2 class ( 5 weeks) at a Community College (not my 4 year University). On the first day (today) I dropped. Ik myself and the level of stress I can handle and it was just too much. The speed is 3x as fast as the normal class (from my professor) and I spent 5hrs trying to understand two practice problems from the hmwk (watching videos,reading textbook). So I decided to take it in the fall at a slower pace. I'm still on track to graduate in 4 years since I was able to enroll in a class for the fall (at my Uni.). So realistically I don't have any consequences from doing this (my class load is the same since I just swapped another class for Physics). But it's making me second guess if engineering is for me. I feel like I made the right choice logically but it makes me feel unworthy of my major. Feeling low all around. \n\nTldr: Took and dropped a Physics 2 summer class and it hit my self esteem pretty bad.", "author": "Red-Velvet14", "created": 1626134998, "retrieved": 1632841782, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4zcea2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oj3y9m/summer_class/h4zcea2/", "text": "Thank you u/Red-Velvet14 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
