Sure I get an email confirming that this assignment or this exam has been sent, but I'm currently looking at the last exam that I just sent like 10 mins ago, thinking to myself, \"But what if I haven't sent it?\" Like it may show that it is in the submission box, and it may say an email has been sent saying the exam has been submitted, but my brain refuses to accept that it has been submitted. I should be excited about finishing my first year, and instead, I'm just panicking about if my exam has been sent. I hate my brain.", "author": "Plague_Doctor_Xander", "created": 1620927603, "retrieved": 1632842421, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {}}
