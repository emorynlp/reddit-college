  "text": "My college tried to send my parents a letter regarding disciplinary action. I am married and have been independent from them for five years now. Why are they still trying to contact my parents? Is there any legal action I can pursue - I feel like this \"undiscrimenitory\" college is trying to put me in the hot seat with my family, and am really annoyed with the reason for the disciplinary action to begin with. Any thoughts?",

Who the officer is depends on your university, sometimes they're in the registrar's office or they might be a dedicated individual. After you notify the on-campus contacts you may want to also contact the department of education if you do not get a satisfactory resolution.\n\nIf it is related to something in your personal life (legal trouble in particular) it is a grey area, that you should ask the on-campus FERPA enforcement officer (again they might be in the registrar's office or a dedicated person).
