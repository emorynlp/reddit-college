You made me feel stupid and you embarrassed me. I had a question about a few terms on the study guide. The class didn\u2019t bother to stay longer then you finishing your last word for review. So I waited and came up saying I had a question. You yelled \u201cwell too late now.\u201d You embarrassed me. I quickly asked about 2 terms and then lied and said \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d when you asked if that was all. After that I ran out of there and started crying. You made me feel stupid. I no longer enjoy you or your class.\n\nSincerely,\nMe...", "author": null, "created": 1572904010, "retrieved": 1632843386, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"f6l5k2z": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/drosl7/to_my_bio_214_professor/f6l5k2z/", "text": "i think you should talk to them or at least email them about how you feel about the interaction and how you felt that it was targeted and uncalled for. you have every single right not to like this professor but they are people too and emotions get the better of us sometimes, i hope it gets better!", "author": "camrymarie", "created": 1572929674, "upvotes": 6}, "f6k5fbd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/drosl7/to_my_bio_214_professor/f6k5fbd/", "text": "I\u2019m sorry.

The one person who didn\u2019t deserve it. \n\nWhen you\u2019re old and in your career you\u2019ll deal with this stupid bullshit too. You can either beat yourself up about these interactions or learn from it. Try to learn from it. Think of comebacks. Sarcastically apologize for being such an inconvenience. Ignore nasty comments and continue to be professional/ask questions. Ask stupid questions and piss them off even more. \n\nFeel better!", "author": "lovelyllamas", "created": 1572905306, "upvotes": 30}}}
