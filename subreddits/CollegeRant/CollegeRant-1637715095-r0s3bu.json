  "text": "I'm failing every class I'm taking because I won't do the assignments. I don't want to. I have no energy, no motivation, no interest. I wholeheartedly refuse to do one more goddamn thing I don't want to do. \n\nI'm tired of waking up every day in misery and forcing myself to do things that I hate. I'm fucking done.\n\nI just want to break something because I'm so fucking frustrated with this stupid fucking shit. So I guess I'll break and ruin my life? Or something overly dramatic like that. \n\nROTC gonna be reaaaaal happy about this. But I don't give a shit, I just don't give a shit about anything at this point.\n\nWith love,\nwaterBAAL\n\nTl;dr: I can't do it anymore. Or I can and I won't? I don't know.",
