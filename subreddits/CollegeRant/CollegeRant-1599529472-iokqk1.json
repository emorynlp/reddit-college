However, with my hybrid classes, I feel like my professors think they can just pile on extra assignments, quizzes, and discussion boards. It feels like once I finish one assignment, I get a notification  that I have new work in blackboard. \nTL;DR. Absurd homework due to online.

Increasing the number of assignments/quizzes can be an attempt to ensure students are doing the readings, watching the lectures, etc. \n\nAnd, during COVID, keeping students connected to the course outside class meetings \u2014 if there are any \u2014 can help them feel less isolated.\n\nThat said, this can lead to overwork. But is this really a lot of extra work? Quizzes, if short, don\u2019t take much time but help the instructor gauge whether the redesigned course is working.
