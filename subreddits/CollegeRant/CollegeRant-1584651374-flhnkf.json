I took them up on this offer because I do not want to deal with my parents who I am sure are going to make it as hard as humanly possible to get any school work with their shenanigans.\n\nWell that has all gone to shit. As of right now, it looks like my school will be evicting everybody they can out of the dorms. I look forward to going back home and having to put with mom\u2019s hot takes with what I should do about my depression. I look forward to them trying to get me to enlist in the military. I look forward to them coming up with a million and five different errands that we have to run all of a sudden, and I look forward to them nagging me about schoolwork, and then if something doesn\u2019t quite go their way I look forward to being yelled at. \n\nThanks COVID-19!", "author": null, "created": 1584651374, "retrieved": 1632951371, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"fm6jdgg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/flhnkf/fuck_this_covid19_shit/fm6jdgg/", "text": "Small update: I\u2019ve requested to stay on campus for the rest of the semester, and honestly I\u2019d doubt they would evict me because our town has enacted a stay at home order.", "author": null, "created": 1585795402, "upvotes": 1}, "fkyuuum": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/flhnkf/fuck_this_covid19_shit/fkyuuum/", "text": "I would appeal to the School to see if you can stay.
