I don't know why I didn't write this earlier, but after 1 year of Online College, I haven't learned anything, I don't know which subjects are being taught, I am not enthusiastic about competing with others, I sleep through classes (nobody turns on their camera, not even teachers), Classes just seem to happen as background YouTube videos, I don't give college the slightest of importance. I wasn't a Straight A student before, but now I am, through Online Examinations (you know what I mean) and I am not proud of that.\n\nI know most of this is on me, but my college is also not strict enough. They don't have Online Proctored Exams; every student has some issue or the other so they end up dropping the whole proctoring thing; They aren't strict about how the attendance should be marked, there doesn't seem to be an incentive to achieve more, and the whole vibe is like that, all this just lowers the bar for excellence. \n\nI want to change this, I want to reach out to the dean, and express how I feel, and if changes could be made to the system. I wanted to know if I should do it, or not, and if I should how and what should I say.

The teachers are untrained. The class is extremely unengaging, now that everything else gets stripped away and all you can hear is how mundane the lecture is.

But you could try. And it might be good for them to hear your experience and perspective even if nothing changes. \n\nI think what you could do that could have more impact is get one or two of your classes more motivated. Be that person who puts their camera on. Participate in class. If you don\u2019t know your classmates, get to know them (message them on zoom?) and form study groups. Study groups are great for staying accountable and actually getting work done. And then you have friends you can see in class too.", "author": "Emotional-Shirt7901", "created": 1625832193, "upvotes": 5}, "h4kw4zf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ogs0x3/the_degraded_quality_of_online_education/h4kw4zf/", "text": "I think it's the same story with all the colleges in India. I haven't learned anything either. You're saying your university doesn't really proctor exams or take attendance seriously and to be honest that's actually a really good thing specially when not much is being taught anyway. My university is specially strict with attendance.  It's problematic because you cannot miss classes and self study despite not learning anything from the class. It just wastes time.They do proctor exams but people who cheat tend to get away with it very easily. \n\nIf you really feel that something better could be done or if other students face similar thing maybe all the students together could approach the dean To be honest Indian universities usually do not really give a shit when students complain.", "author": "android0698", "created": 1625830087, "upvotes": 1}}}
