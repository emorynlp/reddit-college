The previous posters have some great recommendations. I also like to have a study buddy where we hold each other accountable via a video chat like FaceTime where my phone is then tied up so I can\u2019t pick it up as a distraction. We send chat messages at the beginning to each other with what we verbally say we are working on and we update each other as we go.", "author": "lipsnip", "created": 1603744814, "upvotes": 1}, "ga6ibik": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jib9m7/you_ever_needlessly_beat_yourself_up_about/ga6ibik/", "text": "So something that helps me actually do the assignment is having something about doing it to look forward to. \n\nRight now, I enjoy writing out my notes because I spent a year improving my handwriting. The way I take notes is super satisfying, so I often find myself flipping thru my notes out of pride! I have found an amazing pen to use which makes writing enjoyable. I also only allow myself to drink energy drinks if Im at work or doing school which incentivizes me to actually do assignments.\n\nBut don\u2019t beat yourself up over it\u2014everyone is struggling right now. Reach out to your professors and let them know you\u2019re having a hard time finishing your work for all your classes in a timely manner. Your procrastination habit is heavily influenced by your environment, and you\u2019d probably do better under normal circumstances. \n\nAlso, college isn\u2019t for everyone. If you want to take time off to work for awhile, that\u2019s totally okay. Lots of people do. You can even look into taking only a half-load of courses. This could be for one semester just to build better habits, or you could do it every semester if you find that you prefer it. It\u2019ll take longer to finish your degree, but it won\u2019t be nearly as taxing to your mental health. Plus, you can (hopefully) work more while you do this so you can pay for school as you go along. I have a couple friends that prefer this method of doing college. \n\nBest of luck to you!", "author": "TrueRusher", "created": 1603729907, "upvotes": 3}, "ga65wry": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jib9m7/you_ever_needlessly_beat_yourself_up_about/ga65wry/", "text": "I posted this over on the college subreddit but I think it applies here too.\n\n1. Do a list of what you want to get done that day. Even if it\u2019s watching an episode of a show and eating lunch, throw the assignment in there. \n2. Open your laptop in a designated space for schoolwork and start the assignment. I promise you, that by this time you\u2019ll be in the mindset. \n\nIt\u2019s so much easier to get things done when you have a schedule to go by. Also, checking things off helps you feel accomplished and that helps boost your overall mood.", "author": "catpropproblems", "created": 1603723647, "upvotes": 16}}}
