My room is a mess. I work full time as a night stocker and I go to school full time so I only really have the weekends to clean my living space. \n\nOther than that my proctor and I (there was a legit real lady on the cam watching me) spent like 5 minutes trying to get her to see my government ID b/c it kept reflecting from my computer screen and I was shaking.\n\nIt\u2019s my first year in college, and this is bullshit. I was going to take a year off after this semester just because I don\u2019t know what I want to major in, but I might just say \u201cfuck all of it\u201d and give up my scholarships worth probably over $2,500 cuz this just makes me die inside dude. I\u2019m not ready for this shit.\n\nEdit: nvm I can\u2019t drop out otherwise I\u2019d be paying $4,000+ besides my unsubsidized loan \ud83e\udd21", "author": "pyrrhicperson1643", "created": 1611261502, "retrieved": 1632842771, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 280, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gk3mxom": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l276su/fuck_school_fuck_this_bullshit_and_fuck_examity/gk3mxom/", "text": "Thank you u/pyrrhicperson1643 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Gotta show them my dysfunctional space, throw a blanket over my other monitor, give them remote access to my personal computer, clean off all the random shit that\u2019s piled up bc I don\u2019t have the energy, just so they stop assuming I\u2019m trying to cheat on a damn practice quiz.
