Everyone is so immature and mean and fake and etc. I hate this place it makes me feel like I\u2019m regressing back to my 13 year old self. I can\u2019t go through another situation like middle school again. I keep thinking I\u2019ve made friends and they end up being assholes. I need to get away from this so I don\u2019t become suicidal again but I can\u2019t drop out and idk what else I can do\n\n\nTLDR: \nThis place is just like middle school and I feel like I\u2019m regressing because of it", "author": "Prettymothman", "created": 1632812699, "retrieved": 1632840981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hekhcqs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/px0tbz/my_college_is_exactly_like_middle_school/hekhcqs/", "text": "Thank you u/Prettymothman for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
