I\u2019m going to a state school in my state of Texas, but it is 8 hours (400 miles) away from home even though my home is also in Texas. \n\nSeeing my family or getting to go home is always a blessing because we struggle financially and can\u2019t afford plane tickets all the time and I also work at a bank and can\u2019t just leave for extended periods of time nor can i afford it. \n\nAnyways, this realization is what makes this hard. My parents came down to visit me and they leave tomorrow and this pains me. I\u2019m very close with my family and I hate being away from them. Also, being in a small college town COVID ruined my chances of meeting friends my first semester here. I don\u2019t have any hobbies and all my summer classes are online. I can\u2019t even fully enjoy them being here because all i keep thinking about is they\u2019re going to leave. I don\u2019t have any friends here either so their absence is going to be so obvious and i\u2019m really going to miss them. \n\nAny tips? We\u2019ve all been here before.", "author": "graciousonionthrowra", "created": 1627221525, "retrieved": 1632841717, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h6h30cr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/orc1nl/horribly_homesick/h6h30cr/", "text": "Thank you u/graciousonionthrowra for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
