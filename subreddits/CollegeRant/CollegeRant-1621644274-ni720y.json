There is no paid vacation time in college or during my seasonal internships. I've been working from home and learning from home. I know it looks like I'm lounging around on my laptop, but I'm actually trying to get stuff done. I do have free time and holidays, of course, but do they coordinate with me? nooo.\n\nMy parent planned a trip to Orlando back in the Fall for June and I said that I can't do those dates, also Covid. And he was like, well I'm just letting you know. Passive-aggressive much. Now he keeps trying to guilt me but it's just coming off detached from reality. Literally the most crowded hottest time to go to Florida right now with people itching to get out of quarantine.\n\nMy aunt literally was texting me about how my cousin, who is the same age, also has a full-time internship and is going. Again very passive-aggressive. Talked to my cousin. Turns out her start date is *after* the trip. Even my cousin was like there's no guarantee she won't have to leave halfway through. Are all older adults this detached from reality? Also, the aunt lives like an hour from the hotel while I'm like two states away, so I have to figure out transportation and meals, but I'm welcome to squeeze in with 4 generations of people at the hotel for free and work for 8 hours a day while they roam around because *family*\n\n**TL:DR** Think that older adults near retirement age just don't have a concept of what it means to be a college student these days\n\nedit: I'll add that I said I'm not going months ago, and this is what they're bothering about this week.
