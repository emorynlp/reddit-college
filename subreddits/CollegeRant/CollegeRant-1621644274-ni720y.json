  "text": "I swear a whole chunk of my family doesn't understand that I can't just drop what I'm doing now that I'm not a kid who can just be dragged wherever. There is no paid vacation time in college or during my seasonal internships. I've been working from home and learning from home. I know it looks like I'm lounging around on my laptop, but I'm actually trying to get stuff done. I do have free time and holidays, of course, but do they coordinate with me? nooo.\n\nMy parent planned a trip to Orlando back in the Fall for June and I said that I can't do those dates, also Covid. And he was like, well I'm just letting you know. Passive-aggressive much. Now he keeps trying to guilt me but it's just coming off detached from reality. Literally the most crowded hottest time to go to Florida right now with people itching to get out of quarantine.\n\nMy aunt literally was texting me about how my cousin, who is the same age, also has a full-time internship and is going. Again very passive-aggressive. Talked to my cousin. Turns out her start date is *after* the trip. Even my cousin was like there's no guarantee she won't have to leave halfway through. Are all older adults this detached from reality? Also, the aunt lives like an hour from the hotel while I'm like two states away, so I have to figure out transportation and meals, but I'm welcome to squeeze in with 4 generations of people at the hotel for free and work for 8 hours a day while they roam around because *family*\n\n**TL:DR** Think that older adults near retirement age just don't have a concept of what it means to be a college student these days\n\nedit: I'll add that I said I'm not going months ago, and this is what they're bothering about this week. There is something cathartic yet troubling about how many of us are in the same wobbly boat, just trying to balance ",

If they were in the same position they'd either do the same thing or do the opposite and suffer actual consequences. If you go with them and shit the fan they'll most likely just say you're irresponsible for not finding a way to make it work out for THEM. Just do you and tell them if they're gonna keep guilting you that you have nothing to talk about because your decision is final. Part of being an adult is being responsible and sometimes not doing something you really want to. Them saying otherwise looks pretty bad on them",

My mom got all pissed off because I should know how long they will be. I'm reality, she wanted me to take the car durning her lunch break so I could run errands for her.

I am a full-time student with a part-time job and my mother doesn\u2019t understand that yeah, technically no one was forcing me to study during Easter brake this year, but I had a huge exam right after the break and simply couldn\u2019t drop everything and go with her for a family-visiting tour. I don\u2019t think working adults understand that with university it\u2019s so much more difficult to have those precise borders between free time and work time, where you can schedule for things way ahead, because work often spills over your free time and you simply are unable to tell how much it\u2019s going to take to finish something.",

They can\u2019t comprehend being broke as a joke, single, and time starved on top of it all.",

I felt like a jerk for working because I never saw my family and when I did, I was either too tired and spent all day sleeping or they were too busy. They would always ask me to take days off but you could get fired (and people did) for taking too many days off.",

Anyways, my mom wants me to go, but her wedding date falls on a day where I have a huge exam and work. Plus, I have to do well in this class or it will bring down my GPA and my scholarship goes out the window. I swear families don't understand how much a priority college really is. You can go on vacation any other time when you're not in school. They're just going to have to realize that your education comes first above all else. Plus it's not that they don't understand, but rather it's that they don't want to. Internships don't fall right out of the sky.",
