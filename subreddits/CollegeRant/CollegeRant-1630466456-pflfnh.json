A question that I have always battled with TRUE SELF CARE. I know some of you will say; oh yes it is possible and I know it is possible but are you really  taking care of yourself? Are you looking out for your mental, emotional and physical health? I ask you because being a student is draining and then being a student in this pressurized generation ( Gen Z) can be crazy and create a false sense of care; yes false sense, I mean just following the trend because it looks good but not actually do it you know putting on a face mask just to take a pic for the gram and tag selfcare sunday. Now how do I properly take care of myself, you may ask. Before we go on let me ask you this question;\r\n      What do you truly want: Yes, this question is surely part of the self care  journey. Ask your self what do I want for myself to be better, you might also need to ask yourself what is TRUE SELF CARE (mind, body and soul), you may also need to structure the areas of your life that needs care in a SCALE OF PREFERENCE. Now let me just drop a few helpful tips that has helped me. \r\nPHYSICALLY:\r\n1)\tCheck yourself;  you might notice something about you or your friends have told you about some in healthy things about you. I am suppose to put this in general tips but even thing comes down to the physical. I remember my friends always telling me about my weight and I was just telling them to stop body shaming me and that I was beautiful (even if I am still gorgeous) and I found it extremely toxic. Until I fell sick that was when I realized that I was actually underweight; sometimes for every word spoken there is an atom of truth. When you finally notice it don\u2019t be depressed about it but cautiously work towards been better, remember I day at a time.\r\n2)\tExercise: the holy grail of all advice that every one preaches about, apart from the fact that it keeps you fit. It also helps connect neurons in your brain and help you memorize and you stand better.\r\n3)\tDrink water: I am clapping like a black aunty in your face telling you to do this and that all I have to say on periodt\r\n4)\tGo for a walk or better still run: it suppose to be under exercise I know sis but for those of us that find the word exercise a Lil bit heavy let\u2019s do this; I read an article on a woman who lost a lot of weight by just walking everyday (and her meal Plan as well but you get the point). Going for a walk also helps clear your mind and help you a organize stuffs in your head \r\n5)\tIntroduce supplement and take more greens  \r\nHope you are learning something?

You don\u2019t have to get something fancy for the gram just a notebook will do for now and for just 5mins; try to be committed.\r\n2)\tRead books: any book apart from school work please\ud83d\ude44. This helps to expand your mind and view on certain things in life; and some motivational books can also boast your confidence\r\n3)\tListen to audio books: for people like us that are either too lazy to read or just aren\u2019t book people I tell you this has come in handy.
