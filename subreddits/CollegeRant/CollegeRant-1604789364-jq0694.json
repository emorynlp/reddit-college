  "title:": "Fuck this. I'm too burned out and overwhelmed to even want to continue college.",
  "text": "I guess living for short-term gratification really ruined me. I guess never developing good study habits really ruined me. \n\nNow I'm overwhelmed with this essay I don't know what to do with in my English 102 class, with all these midterms in my other classes, and with online school in general. I'm just so burned out after all the high school stress, and I'm just ready to fucking give up. \n\nI'm considering trade school. Entering politics. At this rate, the military sounds appealing even if I don't want to partake in imperialistic wars. At this point, anything but this. I don't even have the willpower to continue, with how far behind I'm going to get in these first-semester classes without zoom lectures or connections to students or even the prof.\n\nSaddest thing is that a college education is fucking mandatory in America, and its expensive (yea I know im only going to community college but still) and potentially could backfire if the future doesnt turn out well for even the CompSci major (which I'm going in)......\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if I just end up taking a gap semester, but my parents expect way too much of me and already know I'm lazy as fuck. They are ready to fucking feed me to the wolves if I disappoint them. Help me.",

          "text": "i thought my parents would yell at me, but thankfully they were understanding of my wishes to take a semester off. To get exercising, \"self-educating\" i.e. reading and watching a bunch of educational stuff, and if possible find a source of income.\n\nI would rather wait for in-person classes to come back. They were SO much better.",
