I did not score bad to speak of. My grand total was 348/400 in the end term examination. The highest is 349/400 which has been scored by someone who has been trying to sabotage me since I got a seat at this college. This course has been my dream since childhood and I knew that I would do really well once I am in it.I have been working really hard since day 1.  I have been extremely responsive in the class and I have been doing really well, my classmates and teachers have been acknowledging this .People will think that I am just a show-off now and I have no real talent.
