(LoR ordeal)", "text": "Say a student who took your 6-week summer course asked you to write a LoR for her one month before the application deadline, and you agreed. You asked when she needs it, she said maybe 1 week before the deadline. She thanked you profusely and sent you all relevant information about her so you could write the LoR. You guys worked together in that 6-week course and although you two were not specifically close, you know this student has the drive to study as she finished all her tasks on time and cared about the class and she actually got an A in your accelerated summer class. \n \n10 days before the deadline, the student sent an email to remind you of the LoR you agreed to write. You did not reply. \n\n3 days before the deadline, the student sent another email to say she is sorry to have taken up your time, and that the LoR does not need to be anything big, you can write anything you want about her in your class, but she hope you could still send her the LoR so she could finish the application on time. \n\nTomorrow is the deadline. And there is still no sight of any communication from this professor. \n\nSo should I give him the benefit of the doubt and think he likes doing things last minute, or will he just not write the LoR which he agreed to write in the beginning?", "author": "FluffyStuffInDaHouz", "created": 1630041419, "retrieved": 1632841545, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hais9ab": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pcgtgy/this_type_of_professor_lor_ordeal/hais9ab/", "text": "Thank you u/FluffyStuffInDaHouz for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
