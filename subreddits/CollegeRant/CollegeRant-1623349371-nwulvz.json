You should always ask me if I can write you a strong positive letter.  An LoR is really a reference and I\u2019m not putting my good rep on the line for most students A or no A.  An A means that you followed instructions.  What else have you done or failed to do?  Sorry but that isn\u2019t sufficient to get a good letter from me.  I need to see that you think critically, that you can think for yourself before I\u2019d even consider writing an LOR.  Coming to class is not a good reason for an LoR.  Participation isn\u2019t enough either\u2026 did your participation enhance instruction, did you ask insightful questions?  \n\nTo be good in grad/law/medical/nursing school means following instructions isn\u2019t enough.  Maybe you aren\u2019t ready for this even though you want it\u2026 they may be doing you a favor.  I\u2019d recommend you ask your profs why they said no.  I\u2019d always say no to a student who didn\u2019t give me an indication that the probability for success in grad/law/medical/nursing school is significantly higher than the probability of failure.  I\u2019ve seen a lot of students burn out, attempt to die by suicide while in post-bac school.  It isn\u2019t pretty.  \n\nHow close to the deadline did you ask?  A student needs to give me at least 30 days but hopefully 8-10 weeks to write one of these.  I need time to write one and take care of everything else going on.
