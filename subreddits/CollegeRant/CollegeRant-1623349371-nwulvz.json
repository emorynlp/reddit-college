  "text": "Goddamn, it\u2019s been so hard getting letters of recommendation during the pandemic. Even though I got A\u2019s in all my classes, am a 4.0 student, actively participated in the zoom meetings, did all homework and extra credit, busted my ass in their classes, they either outright refused or ignored my request. When it was In person classes, it was so much easier to get them. \n\nI received my last refusal today in an email and I\u2019m heartbroken, as that was the last Professor I could ask and now I can\u2019t apply for any programs or most scholarships. There was only 2 professors who I got to know better/and I felt got to know me on zoom. The non-zoom, non-synchronous profs didn\u2019t even bother to respond to my email.\n\nI give up.",

      "text": "How did you ask?  You should always ask me if I can write you a strong positive letter.  An LoR is really a reference and I\u2019m not putting my good rep on the line for most students A or no A.  An A means that you followed instructions.  What else have you done or failed to do?  Sorry but that isn\u2019t sufficient to get a good letter from me.  I need to see that you think critically, that you can think for yourself before I\u2019d even consider writing an LOR.  Coming to class is not a good reason for an LoR.  Participation isn\u2019t enough either\u2026 did your participation enhance instruction, did you ask insightful questions?  \n\nTo be good in grad/law/medical/nursing school means following instructions isn\u2019t enough.  Maybe you aren\u2019t ready for this even though you want it\u2026 they may be doing you a favor.  I\u2019d recommend you ask your profs why they said no.  I\u2019d always say no to a student who didn\u2019t give me an indication that the probability for success in grad/law/medical/nursing school is significantly higher than the probability of failure.  I\u2019ve seen a lot of students burn out, attempt to die by suicide while in post-bac school.  It isn\u2019t pretty.  \n\nHow close to the deadline did you ask?  A student needs to give me at least 30 days but hopefully 8-10 weeks to write one of these.  I need time to write one and take care of everything else going on.  Less than 30 days notice means an automatic no from me.",

I\u2019m saying I need to see more in order to write a solid LoR, someone who only does what they\u2019re told isn\u2019t worth the time it takes for me to write an LoR.  Trust me it isn\u2019t due to it being online\u2026 they know the deal.  Online is a doozy\u2026 for the professors too and I\u2019ve written more than one LoR since transitioning to online classes. Most people that teach at CC needed LoRs to get to grad school\u2026 I\u2019d write the same LoR for post-bac school or a scholarship\u2026 so what it\u2019s for is irrelevant in that sense.  \n\nI\u2019m saying that it would be helpful if you had conversations with these faculty and asked them why not.  Don\u2019t be whiny or complain.  Say something like \u201cI understand completely why you couldn\u2019t but I\u2019d like to learn what I can do to make a better impression, what can I do to get a positive, strong LoR.  I ask because I really care about what you think\u201d.",

It is REALLY hard to get LORs from professors because they have so many students, and getting one can be a challenge...getting a GOOD one can be nigh impossible.

So, they know if a professor gives back recommendations. They also know if a professor hands out stellar recommendations like hotcakes, even if the students don't deserve such high praise.\n\nWhen we write letters, our reputations are on the line. I need to be honest in my recommendations so future recommendations are taken seriously. If I make a mediocre student out to be a great student, then I'm doing a disservice to the great student who asks me for a letter in the future.",

With these past 3-4 semesters being online, many professors just simply don't want to write LORs because they didn't really get to know the person as a student outside of a screen in a lab, group, or in-person classroom.",

Getting an A in the field does not mean that you truly know how to apply the subject, and a LOR can speak to both your character and your strengths and weaknesses. The problem is that most people think that a LOR is enough, but it is a good LOR that matters. Professors will generally write LORs, but a LOR that says nothing but \"They were a good student\" can be more harmful than having no LOR at all (at least from what I have gathered from grad school admissions counselors).",

          "text": "I only asked for one academic LOR as I feel professors can be very slammed, and to really get one that is strong, you want to zero in on a professor (although this varies from field to field, and in some fields, having all two to three being academic may be your best bet...talk with admission counselors at the grad school for more). As such, I made sure it was a professor who was well respected in their field and that field (and their professional focus) was similar to mine (with same degree as mine). I asked shortly before the semester ended, and I gave them a deadline as to when to expect application requests for it. Finally, I am continuing to stay on active and good terms with them, and will follow up when grad applications open.\n\nSo, tldr: Do NOT ask for LORs at the last minute (when you are applying for grad schools), but instead ask when the semester is almost over (a few weeks before finals) if a STRONG LOR can be provided by the professor (with as specific of a deadline as you can).",

              "text": "Don't feel bad about asking. If you think about it, every single one of them had to do what you're doing to get to where they are now, no matter how much they seemed to have forgotten that. They all had to ask for letters of recommendation and they are all very lucky their profs took the time to do it for them - I never understand the arrogant profs who turn around and say \"I'm way too busy I can't do that, that's not my job, how dare you even ask or waste my important professor time reading your email that I likely won't reply to!\" It's like that \"fuck everyone else, I got mine\" attitude that so much of the world has nowadays. Not that I expect the profs to do it for any student who asks, I understand why that's not feasible but acting offended that a student even asked is ridiculous, especially when they damn well know you *have* to and your future depends on it due to an academic construct that you had no part in deciding.",
