  "text": "i\u2019m doing great in my first semester so far (all A\u2019s wooo), and i\u2019m considering changing my major to urban planning but i\u2019m so anxious one day i\u2019m going to be hired as an urban planner or a related career and i\u2019m going to have no idea what I\u2019m doing. It doesn\u2019t help that i\u2019m not interested in graduate school.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make an impulse decision and change my major to urban planning and immediately regret it. It\u2019s not too much of a change from my current major, but i\u2019m still super anxious.\n\nI feel like i\u2019m going to do great in college and horrible in the real world, does anyone else have the same worries?",

      "text": "What you're going to find is the majority of what you do in college is useless and completely irrelevant to the real world. If you major in Urban Planning, you will graduate after 4 years hardly knowing anything that you'll actually need on the job. That's why employers have probationary periods and spend so long training new hires, because college doesn't teach you anything.\n\nEver wonder why you'll be taking Music Appreciation and Calculus III your third year into an International Business degree? It's not to help you in International Business, I can tell you that much.",

      "text": "You\u2019re doing great! If anything, I think this is the perfect time to change since you\u2019re still a first year. But also know that change in inevitable, life happens, and we\u2019re all forced to adapt one way or another.\n\nLike I\u2019m a 5th year and I\u2019m questioning everything as I\u2019m about to graduate in spring. And I\u2019m learning to be okay with the unknown and have a prospective plan for the next 5 years or so. It doesn\u2019t mean I plan every single thing, but I have a trajectory and just moving in that direction. That way I have room to move in different branching paths that may not have been apart of my initial plan but I\u2019m still in a forward direction vs turning 180 behind me.\n\nYou sound like a very studious and hard working student so I have no doubts you\u2019re going to do great!(:",
