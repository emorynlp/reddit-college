  "text": "i\u2019m doing great in my first semester so far (all A\u2019s wooo), and i\u2019m considering changing my major to urban planning but i\u2019m so anxious one day i\u2019m going to be hired as an urban planner or a related career and i\u2019m going to have no idea what I\u2019m doing. It doesn\u2019t help that i\u2019m not interested in graduate school.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make an impulse decision and change my major to urban planning and immediately regret it. It\u2019s not too much of a change from my current major, but i\u2019m still super anxious.\n\nI feel like i\u2019m going to do great in college and horrible in the real world, does anyone else have the same worries?",
