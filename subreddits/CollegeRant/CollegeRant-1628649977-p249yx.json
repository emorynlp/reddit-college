I entered the course proudly and was looking forward to whatever it is I may encounter since ofc it's quite known that engineering can be a pain. But in my country's current situation, students have been taking their classes online. Now I'm in my 3rd term and because of this whole online set up, day by day I feel like I'm slowly having a burn out and now I'm not enjoying my course anymore especially because of the subjects I am currently taking. Everything feels like a burden and a chore and I'm not looking forward to learning anymore. atm I just want to get out of the situation since it's been taking a severe toll on my mental health and it causes me to greatly underperform. A lot of factors are to be considered before I make decisions and I just don't know where to start looking. So the question is, would it be too early to shift out? is it really time for me to leave this course despite it being my (formerly?) dream course?\n\nAnyway, any advice/suggestion/insight would help. I hope y'all be kind to me. Thanks a lot!!", "author": "archieasks", "created": 1628649977, "retrieved": 1632949125, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h9cw2mq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p249yx/some_good_advice_for_a_lost_college_freshman/h9cw2mq/", "text": "I cannot imagine being a freshman in college during the pandemic. Not only are you adjusting to college, but you have to deal with learning online. I can see how it would feel like a chore. \n\nHow I got through online learning was thinking of everything as a game (which I guess technically the point system is). Having good grades was my reward. \n\nIf you\u2019re a more visual person write out a list of accomplishments that you want to accomplish. Think of long-term goals such as graduate school, career, honors distinction, etc. Along with the long-term goals I like to do a check-list or to-do list for either the day or week. Seeing everything I checked off makes me feel productive. \n\nThose are just some tips. If you want to discuss further I would be happy to talk.", "author": "Ok_Candy7704", "created": 1629248725, "upvotes": 2}, "h8htr9f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p249yx/some_good_advice_for_a_lost_college_freshman/h8htr9f/", "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore mech engineering student and I completely understand what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve actually had the exact same thoughts pertaining to leaving college. Firstly, I would attend this first semester as I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s in person for you (it is for me). Second, develop a backup plan. If shit goes south with school and we lock down again, and if you do decide that you\u2019ve had enough, make sure you have a plan for employment, whether it\u2019s temporary or a potential career. My backup plan is to get my CDL and do over the road trucking, as an example. The last thing you want to do is be stuck in a bad situation because you weren\u2019t proactive. Despite all of this, I still recommend you stay in college. You did the work, you made it this far. Why not follow through on that dream? Plus, if you get your degree, you\u2019ll get paid far better than most trade jobs (besides owning your own trades business). I know this sucks, but try your best and don\u2019t sell yourself short. Once you get your gen Ed\u2019s out of the way, classes will become a lot more interesting, trust me. It just takes time.", "author": "SnooCookies1419", "created": 1628653413, "upvotes": 3}}}
