  "text": "Coming into college we technically already have a degree in liberal arts and that's our high school diplomas. The fact that I had to spend half of my accounting degree forced into studying irrelevant subjects like a foreign language that I will realistically never use angers me. What a huge waste of time and a pathetic excuse to fund obnoxiously high professor salaries onto a student's tuition bill. If that particular field interests you, then good for you, but no amount of justification will convince me that it's okay to force other subjects onto people that are already paying a ton of money for a degree. If these classes mattered as much as universities claim, then why do employers only look at my major courses?",

The value of a well-rounded education is immeasurable. Do I use my linguistics, philosophy, or economics knowledge (all courses I took that satisfied my LA requirements) directly in my research? No. But that knowledge helps me see the underlying structure and pattern in the world around me.\n\nSeeing the implications of information theory in semantics, thinking about the metaphysical backing (or lack thereof) of information as a meaningful object, how information asymmetries guide markets in a way that makes information a valid economic tool, and then being able to use information theory in my physics means I can achieve a deeper understanding of the world.\n\nit also opens up inter-departmental conversations, like whether or not Gauge Theory might be useful in looking at economic systems, or how scientific language functions and can be refined for more efficient, precise, accurate, and accessible communication.",

You can get public speaking experience, chances to practice time management, have opportunities to broaden your study techniques, expand critical thinking skills, and use it as a networking opportunity. Maybe 20 years down the road you\u2019ll apply for a job and the person interviewing you will be one of the members of your anthropology class group project. In order to get a job with your degree after college you need to be competitive. Think about the liberal arts requirement as an opportunity to broaden your skill set. You can only improve yourself.",

Granted its more likely to be 6 figures on the coast, but the cost of living is higher too. Professors are not making CEO salaries.\n\nLanguage proficiency is a resource that can help you get employment.  Its your choice not to take advantage of that.

      "text": "Comments about being well rounded just seem odd to me - it almost seems like a patronizing boomerisic remark to me that I can\u2019t seem to shake. The only general ed class that was even remotely useful was a math substitute with statistics, and even then I couldn\u2019t name you the 6 tests or regurgitate a fraction of what was covered.\n\nLet\u2019s not pretend you don\u2019t remember 80% of the stuff learned in your major, let alone freshman classes about world history, US history, English, Univ (wtf was this class), and a foreign language. \n\nI have never used French in the 5 years since I took it. If you can\u2019t properly type an essay with decent syntax as a freshman with English being your first language then college might not be for you. US history, both semesters mind you, are in general completely useless. You will not be pressed to recall battles from the civil war.\nI had to take what was essentially a home room class as well as RWS (1&2) which taught remedial high school skills at best.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t learn skills that transcend the class itself and are useful in the future, but let\u2019s not fucking kid ourselves and say that your core classes were worth a few semesters of your time and potentially tens of thousands of dollars.",
