I want to provide a nice future for my nonverbal autistic little brother. I'm trying my best but I feel like I'm falling behind everyone else. I'm just incredibly worried for my future and that of my family. All I want in life is to make them happy.\n\nIm a rising sophomore and I have almost no volunteer/internship experience. The most I've done was volunteer at a youth summer program in HS, but other than that, I've got nothing. It's even worse that I attend a really big and competitive university, so opportunities are more scarce and I literally have no experience. I grew up in a low-income area and I'm afraid I'll never be able to give my family the life of the middle/upper class. I would honestly sacrifice anything for them.", "author": "Narguin2", "created": 1626948812, "retrieved": 1632841736, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 18, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h63zw8s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/opaya7/im_not_good_enough_im_terrified_i_wont_ever_find/h63zw8s/", "text": "Thank you u/Narguin2 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also struggle with feeling incompetent and not enough. Something I regret about my college experience is not taking advantage of my school\u2019s resources. I have social anxiety, among other mental problems, but you should gently push yourself to talk to people in the career office. I find emailing professors to be less stressful than talking to them in person (also because I never raise my hand in class) so maybe try emailing some professors you like and ask for advice.
