I haven\u2019t had any internships yet so that makes me already feel very behind. but my mentor told me that i need to use linkedin more and how it will help me build my network and all that. but boy do i hate linkedin. before using linkedin i assumed everyone was in the same boat as me when it comes to having little experience with their degree. but now that i am on linkedin and seeing everyone around my age doing these amazing things and internships i just feel so discouraged and lost. i feel like i\u2019m already too behind to even get started. i\u2019m so worried about not being able to get a job after college and just feel so stressed and overwhelmed. it also doesn\u2019t help that my depression doesn\u2019t really allow me to do anything and i don\u2019t put in the time or effort for internship searches. i\u2019m kind of just focusing on my classes and this remote learning bs is definitely not making me motivated. okay rant over \ud83d\ude43", "author": "tarobean_18", "created": 1618258222, "retrieved": 1632843497, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 39, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"guaklhc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mpm7ua/linkedin_makes_me_realize_how_pathetic_i_am/guaklhc/", "text": "Thank you u/tarobean_18 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
