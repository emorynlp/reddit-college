The problem all semester is that the quizzes have a lot of incredibly specific questions that are rarely covered in the reading or the lecture and I\u2019ve struggled with them all semester. These quizzes are not open book. \n\nThe grades show a class average of every quiz and the average is always above 90%, most students are scoring 100% every week. I\u2019m the only person who hasn\u2019t aced almost every single quiz; my worst grade is a 70%, my best grade is a 90%. I was curious so I decided to investigate. I took my last quiz, got a B, but copied and pasted all the questions before submitting. Afterward, I looked up the terms and subjects in our textbook, but nothing came up. I would literally have to had done research outside of class material to know some of these answers. So, still curious, I copied the first question into google and it came up immediately, not just the question, but the correct answer. I did this for all 20 questions and every single correct answer came up immediately. \n\nSo, either every other student in the class knows what\u2019ll be on the quiz and studies beforehand, or they\u2019re all just googling the questions and getting the answers cause they know our professor is copying and pasting his quizzes. \n\nI feel like a moron. I have the lowest grade in all the quizzes, but it\u2019s likely cause I\u2019m the only one not cheating.", "author": "MiddleweightMuffin", "created": 1628879125, "retrieved": 1632950338, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 199, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"h917y7a": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p3r10j/everyones_cheating_and_i_get_screwed_for_being/h917y7a/", "text": "Love the title .", "author": "letusrantbbg2021", "created": 1629037439, "upvotes": 1}, "h8xm7lc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p3r10j/everyones_cheating_and_i_get_screwed_for_being/h8xm7lc/", "text": "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to hell for saying this, but everyone (professor and classmates) but OP is shitty here.

And your fellow students? Absolutely shitty for thinking that academic dishonesty is acceptable. Any competent professor would\u2019ve weeded out their cheating ages ago, or at least any professor that cared would\u2019ve. \n\nI know the circumstances were shitty. The professor should\u2019ve set up quizzes that actually pertained to the course work. That\u2019s what a good professor does. However that doesn\u2019t mean that cheating was the way to go. What everyone should\u2019ve done instead is gone to the head of the department or the dean to roast your professor. \n\nStick to your standards, OP.

And guess what, I have post-it notes right in front of me which I pastes onto my computer\u2019s bottom end with tons of formulas in them. So when I do that math, I can look at them all I want and he would not know. Am I cheating? Maybe. But Im doing all the problem correctly and get good grades in this class because I spend time in practicing the problems rather than memorizing those formulas in the first place.
