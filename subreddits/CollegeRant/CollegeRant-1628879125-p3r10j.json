  "text": "My summer Political Science course is pretty straight forward\u2014weekly reading, video lecture, supplemental reading, short discussion, and quiz. The problem all semester is that the quizzes have a lot of incredibly specific questions that are rarely covered in the reading or the lecture and I\u2019ve struggled with them all semester. These quizzes are not open book. \n\nThe grades show a class average of every quiz and the average is always above 90%, most students are scoring 100% every week. I\u2019m the only person who hasn\u2019t aced almost every single quiz; my worst grade is a 70%, my best grade is a 90%. I was curious so I decided to investigate. I took my last quiz, got a B, but copied and pasted all the questions before submitting. Afterward, I looked up the terms and subjects in our textbook, but nothing came up. I would literally have to had done research outside of class material to know some of these answers. So, still curious, I copied the first question into google and it came up immediately, not just the question, but the correct answer. I did this for all 20 questions and every single correct answer came up immediately. \n\nSo, either every other student in the class knows what\u2019ll be on the quiz and studies beforehand, or they\u2019re all just googling the questions and getting the answers cause they know our professor is copying and pasting his quizzes. \n\nI feel like a moron. I have the lowest grade in all the quizzes, but it\u2019s likely cause I\u2019m the only one not cheating.",

OP you clearly tried really hard in this class, and to find out that your professor didn\u2019t give two fucks is disheartening\u2026and believe me I understand that feeling well. And your fellow students? Absolutely shitty for thinking that academic dishonesty is acceptable. Any competent professor would\u2019ve weeded out their cheating ages ago, or at least any professor that cared would\u2019ve. \n\nI know the circumstances were shitty. The professor should\u2019ve set up quizzes that actually pertained to the course work. That\u2019s what a good professor does. However that doesn\u2019t mean that cheating was the way to go. What everyone should\u2019ve done instead is gone to the head of the department or the dean to roast your professor. \n\nStick to your standards, OP. And to all the people telling them that cheating is okay, take a long look at yourselves and remember that someday you\u2019re going to be caught and put on academic probation, or worse\u2026expelled.",

Like I said in another comment of mine, if you want to be prideful and do everything by the book then do that if it helps you sleep at night. But remember that your peers that cheat probably have higher GPA\u2019s and have more time outside of school to dedicate towards learning practical skills. That results in more opportunities for success. Again, if you want to do it by the book then that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t degrade others that did what they had to do to succeed, especially when the professors don\u2019t care enough to make original material.",

I\u2019m not perfect myself, I\u2019ve made mistakes. You\u2019re supposed to learn from your mistakes, and that\u2019s what I chose to do.\n\n> your cheating peers (have more opportunities for success)\n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between being efficient and cutting corners. When you cut corners in the real world, it doesn\u2019t matter what your gpa was or what\u2019s written on that little slip of paper. You get fired. \n\nAlso think about this, how many future students do you hurt by cheating? You know those numbers that schools and universities care so much about? What\u2019ll happen if you start inflating the numbers of a shitty teacher? The professor won\u2019t ever properly teach, and students will suffer from improper instruction, leading to the bullshit that OP went through because the professor went unchecked for long enough. \n\nI stand by what I said. Cheating doesn\u2019t just have the potential to hurt you, but it also has the potential to hurt others. There will always be consequences to your actions.",

Those of us that give a shit will make new questions each exam, but there\u2019s only so many questions we can ask on a topic.  Students posting exam solutions online makes it harder to do this.\n\nThe other consideration, which students probably don\u2019t see, is that academic promotion, tenure and continuing employment for adjuncts is based on feedback surveys and student performance. It\u2019s easier to reduce quality of assessment to influence student performance and satisfaction than it is to spend a lot of hours, typically unpaid, engaging with students and creating new assessments that are of sufficiently high quality to achieve the same result.",

And guess what, I have post-it notes right in front of me which I pastes onto my computer\u2019s bottom end with tons of formulas in them. So when I do that math, I can look at them all I want and he would not know. Am I cheating? Maybe. But Im doing all the problem correctly and get good grades in this class because I spend time in practicing the problems rather than memorizing those formulas in the first place. And when you practice enough problems, the formulas stay in your head too. So study smarter, not harder dude. Mark my words!",

With only 1 questions quizzes timed at 1 hour each, and testing atleast 3-4 concept applications, we honestly were left scrambling for time. In the endsems as well, no one could get above a 60 out of 70 despite online examination, 3 hours, 5 questions only and no proctoring softwares. If a student has really put in effort, nothing goes bad on the exam day and grading is done relatively, this system really works in favour of everyone.\n\nIn some other courses with no open book tests and extremely specific memory based questions whose answers would def exceed 300 words, the ones who cheated easily scored 10 whereas those who stuck by the rules barely got a 7",

The simplest answer is usually true. \n\nYou are right, however, it is only a theory.",
