I feel like there\u2019s not enough time in my day, no matter how early I start or how I study. I am a lecture behind my anatomy class, my neuroanatomy class I am 7 lectures behind and I have a midterm in 2 day, my psychology class I am like 4 units behind. The only class that I\u2019m not behind on is organic chemistry but I probably just failed the exam because I didn\u2019t study enough despite thinking I knew it. It seems I am also playing catch between anatomy and organic, and I am neglecting my other 2 classes. I am overwhelmed.", "author": "denver_rose", "created": 1602106558, "retrieved": 1632950920, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g84hymx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j6zz2z/i_cant_keep_up/g84hymx/", "text": "I switched to a different major and being in college during this pandemic, my concentration, motivation, and drive to succeed have basically dwindled.

It\u2019s difficult to follow lectures and stay motivated, and it\u2019s also difficult for me to do all of the practice problems they throw when I have 4-5 other classes to worry about.
