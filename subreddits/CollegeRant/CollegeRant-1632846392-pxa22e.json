  "text": "I\u2019m 19F and a sophomore in college. This is my first year on campus and I have made a good amount of friends that I hang out with and I have joined clubs as well. But sometimes when I\u2019m not hanging out with friends, I feel very bored because all I do is do homework, go to class and go back to my room. \n\nIt took me a while to adjust to being on campus and away from home which is like a 30-45 minute drive but I go home every weekend and I\u2019m fine with that. \n\nWe have homecoming events going on this week but they aren\u2019t really fun. I chose to live on campus so I can be independent but really don\u2019t know how to and am considering just commuting either from home or an off campus apartment due to campus life not being what I expected to be. Covid has something to do with it obviously but my college is almost like a ghost town. Does anyone else feel bored in college? What are ways to overcome it and to also gain more independence?",

      "text": "Dont worry, you are not alone. I am a sophomore transfer student, I thought my school would be an ok fit but I'm regretting my choice. It feels like a remix of high school except you just live on campus. Tried joining a swim club, did 3 days of tryouts, to be cut because they did not have enough space. Now everything is closed, trying out was a waste of my time, now I have to try again in the spring and hope I get in. I did not realize when they said its a party school they meant you either party on weekends or go home. For a campus of almost 30,000 its dead on weekends, and a town that has 5 colleges near it has no attractions other than bars, restaurants and a shitty mall... and farm land. I do the same, wake up, go to class, do homework in my room. I am so bored and at this point might not make any friends this semester. The only fun thing I have done is watch one star wars movie a weekend with a friend from high school, and go for walks every night to kill time. I guess playing video games is fun but I am not making memories that way or socializing. \n\nAt this point I might just transfer again, maybe near a city so I at least have something to explore other than farm land. Or maybe some place warm near a beach, or some place where I can actually join a swim club without being cast out.",

          "text": "I\u2019m going through the same thing man. This is my 3rd year in college and I have only hung out with people 3 times in the past 2 years. Each time to never get spoken to again. I go to a junior college which holds no student events and all the clubs are political and religious organizations that I don\u2019t want to get involved in. I get unlucky with roommates. I had renewed my lease before I meet my only true friend during the past 2 years this summer. We started dating but broke up with me when I had to go back to college because she didn\u2019t want to do long distance(which I can\u2019t be mad about) but now im completely alone again and this shit is just rough. Now I\u2019m also tasked with transferring and deciding what college I want to be lonely at next. Hang in there brother.",

Oh well, if i transfer again hopefully its the right place for me. Sorry about the breakup, i cant imagine how that felt, i have never been in a relationship. Good luck to you my friend!",

      "text": "I've got 4 years of college behind me know and all I can say is: some people love college as it is and others like (perhaps) you and me sort of have to live for the future. \n\nIt took me a little while to realize but because it was always clear I would go to college one day, all decisions I made had to align with it. In college, all my decisions have to align with graduating. I'm not going to lie I don't feel like I have a life. I can't plan for anything, vacations aren't possible because I never know what workload I will have to shoulder during breaks and I gave up any hobby I can't do spontaneously. I gave up all team/competitive sports and decided against many things because I never know when I'll have classes next semester. I don't want to start something just to find out I have to quit 2 months later because of my new schedule. \n\nMy teen years were boring and the three years it took me to get my bachelor's were boring as well. I only have one year left until I get my master's and I just want to be free from this crushing uncertainty mixed with everyday dullness. Still, I'm glad I'll be done by 23 so I'll still have some good years left. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me going is having come too far to quit and the decently paying job I'll get. However, as I see friends who stayed home earn decent money while being able to live in the moment I get incredibly jealous. Nobody and nothing can ever give me my teens+early 20s back and I can only hope this will all be worth it in the end.",

          "text": ">vacations aren\u2019t possible \n\nThis is a personal source of annoyance for me as well. Both me and my boyfriend hate people and he really hates kids, so we used to vacation in the \u201coff season\u201d to avoid crowds. When I started school again (dropped out years ago and then went back after coming into some money), that was all out the window. Because, until this semester (where I only have one class to finish), every time we tried to plan something I would have a big project or paper due. Plus, I have a job as well and my PTO is limited, so doing stuff has been hard and I, admittedly, hate it sometimes.",
