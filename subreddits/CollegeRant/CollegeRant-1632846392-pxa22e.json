This is my first year on campus and I have made a good amount of friends that I hang out with and I have joined clubs as well. But sometimes when I\u2019m not hanging out with friends, I feel very bored because all I do is do homework, go to class and go back to my room. \n\nIt took me a while to adjust to being on campus and away from home which is like a 30-45 minute drive but I go home every weekend and I\u2019m fine with that. \n\nWe have homecoming events going on this week but they aren\u2019t really fun. I chose to live on campus so I can be independent but really don\u2019t know how to and am considering just commuting either from home or an off campus apartment due to campus life not being what I expected to be. Covid has something to do with it obviously but my college is almost like a ghost town. Does anyone else feel bored in college? What are ways to overcome it and to also gain more independence?", "author": "jcks234", "created": 1632846392, "retrieved": 1632948372, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"heo9k9s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxa22e/is_college_supposed_to_be_this_boring/heo9k9s/", "text": "Dont worry, you are not alone. I am a sophomore transfer student, I thought my school would be an ok fit but I'm regretting my choice. It feels like a remix of high school except you just live on campus. Tried joining a swim club, did 3 days of tryouts, to be cut because they did not have enough space. Now everything is closed, trying out was a waste of my time, now I have to try again in the spring and hope I get in. I did not realize when they said its a party school they meant you either party on weekends or go home. For a campus of almost 30,000 its dead on weekends, and a town that has 5 colleges near it has no attractions other than bars, restaurants and a shitty mall... and farm land. I do the same, wake up, go to class, do homework in my room. I am so bored and at this point might not make any friends this semester. The only fun thing I have done is watch one star wars movie a weekend with a friend from high school, and go for walks every night to kill time. I guess playing video games is fun but I am not making memories that way or socializing. \n\nAt this point I might just transfer again, maybe near a city so I at least have something to explore other than farm land. Or maybe some place warm near a beach, or some place where I can actually join a swim club without being cast out.", "author": "Reaper_gaming_afk", "created": 1632881531, "upvotes": 1}, "henbcc7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxa22e/is_college_supposed_to_be_this_boring/henbcc7/", "text": "honestly idk \ud83d\ude2d im 19 as well and unfortunately my college experience so far has been an extension of high school: go to class, go home, do work, sleep, repeat. i havent been able to find clubs that interest me and i\u2019m starting to feel that i wont have an \u201cexciting\u201d life until after i graduate but even then thats a maybe. if i had a car i\u2019d prob try to find stuff in my city that interests me but since i dont im stuck waiting for something interesting to happen on campus", "author": "RainbowChocolate_", "created": 1632865603, "upvotes": 1}, "hen0ey8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxa22e/is_college_supposed_to_be_this_boring/hen0ey8/", "text": "I've got 4 years of college behind me know and all I can say is: some people love college as it is and others like (perhaps) you and me sort of have to live for the future. \n\nIt took me a little while to realize but because it was always clear I would go to college one day, all decisions I made had to align with it. In college, all my decisions have to align with graduating. I'm not going to lie I don't feel like I have a life. I can't plan for anything, vacations aren't possible because I never know what workload I will have to shoulder during breaks and I gave up any hobby I can't do spontaneously. I gave up all team/competitive sports and decided against many things because I never know when I'll have classes next semester. I don't want to start something just to find out I have to quit 2 months later because of my new schedule. \n\nMy teen years were boring and the three years it took me to get my bachelor's were boring as well. I only have one year left until I get my master's and I just want to be free from this crushing uncertainty mixed with everyday dullness. Still, I'm glad I'll be done by 23 so I'll still have some good years left. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me going is having come too far to quit and the decently paying job I'll get. However, as I see friends who stayed home earn decent money while being able to live in the moment I get incredibly jealous. Nobody and nothing can ever give me my teens+early 20s back and I can only hope this will all be worth it in the end.", "author": "ClockLeft", "created": 1632860925, "upvotes": 6}, "hem60ka": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pxa22e/is_college_supposed_to_be_this_boring/hem60ka/", "text": "It depends on who you are.
