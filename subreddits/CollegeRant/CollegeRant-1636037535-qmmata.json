You then use them to get food and outfits for your bunny. It\u2019s really cute! I\u2019d look at study apps and see if one catches your eye. I like using reward systems, too. If I get more of this rough draft done, then I can have a snack. Definitely requires some self-discipline, but it\u2019s worth it!",

And most importantly, what steps do I need to take in order to earn these achievements? You can get through this, and you really should because there is so much to gain from this educational stage in your life. Get excited about your classes. Allow what you learn to change the way you think. Allow yourself to grow, and allow yourself to rest.",

You don't have to finish everything in one day. Work step by step. Answer one question. Answer another. Take a break. Read one paragraph. Watch one video. Take a break. Answer three more questions. Take a shower or eat dinner or whatever. Piece by piece. Just do it. And start as early as you can. Start by making a weekly plan. On the first day of your week, go through your course schedule and figure out what you need to do. Make a checklist, and check off each item that you complete. Try to complete as much as you can as soon as you can. That way, you'll finish early, and you'll have the rest of the week to slack off.",

I just think \u201cI have to take this course anyway, I don\u2019t want to have to take it again, might as well get it done.\u201d I take breaks too, but I always remember that I HAVE to take these courses to obtain my degree and be successful so let\u2019s just get it done. \n\nIt also is very helpful to get work done as soon as you can so you aren\u2019t stuck doing it last second. If I have free time and I can do my assignments, I make myself do it because I know that if I start them close to the due date then I\u2019ll just stress myself out. \n\nAlso what I like to do is count how many assignments I need to get done in each course. I write it down so I can see it on paper the total number of assignments and as I get them done, I change the number. It\u2019s kind of rewarding to see the number go down.",
