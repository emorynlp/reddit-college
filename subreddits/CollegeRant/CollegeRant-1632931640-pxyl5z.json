  "title:": "Why do the hardest subjects have the worst teachers?",
  "text": "This is all purely based off my experience. If you've had a hard class but a great teacher, I envy you. Ever since high school, with the exception of one single teacher out of *many*, my worst subjects have had terrible teachers, which make those subjects even worse for me as a result.\n\nI am terrible with science but I'm busting my ass to understand and do better. I got an 87% on my first chemistry exam, which I almost cried tears of joy for. But it was all *me*. I've had to teach myself everything with the textbook because my teacher makes everything confusing and doesnt even understand the material herself (today she was going through a slide going into a little bit more detail on our chapter, and skipped ot because she said she didn't know what it was...*and she's the fucking teacher*) My teacher is an absolute joke who has no business in education. She moves SO fast in her slideshows, I have asked her multiple times to go a little slower, and she gets annoyed with me. I ask questions because I'm literally fighting to understand the material, but she gets annoyed and condescending. When answering questions, she just points at the answer the slide and expects me to fucking magically understand instead of explaining anything. She has a master's degree in fucking biology and acts like she can teach chemistry when she clearly fucking cant. I burned out in the middle of class today and bit my tongue so hard to keep myself from crying that it started bleeding.\n\nI've already ranted about my biology teacher before so I wont get into it. I got a 76% on the exam, which was quite a bit above the class average of 64%. A single student getting a bad grade is usually their own issue, but a whole class doing poorly is a direct reflection on how well the teacher taught. And he just goes on the same way like he's teaching perfectly and WE'RE the ones who are messed up.\n\nI need to understand science. I need it for my degree, and these foundational classes will almost certainly dictate my performance and understanding in my higher lever science classes coming up. \n\nFuck these teachers that think they have what it takes to teach a difficult/complex/information dense subject. If you cannot teach material or answer questions directly, clearly, effectively, and confidently, do the whole class a favor and fucking resign so you don't mess up their academic future.\n\nFuck, dude.",

      "text": "I feel your pain. I\u2019m in a limited access science program and one of my professors is just like this. Their PowerPoints are the worst ones I have ever seen in my life. So many mistakes and contradictions. During lecture, they always go off on a tangent and are overall disorganized. Reading the book doesn\u2019t help because they write the test and it\u2019s based off what they think they discussed. The only grades for the class are 2 exams and a final. I took my first exam today and got a 65. I actually cried during the exam because it was so overwhelming. I know at least 60% of the class has a similar grade (some even lower!) I just keep thinking they should not be a teacher and it just sucks teaching yourself (especially for how much it costs) and giving your all x100 to get a shitty results. \n\nOn a positive note, kudos to you for doing well on those exams. I hope you treated yourself afterwards because you deserve it. I truly wish you the best with the classes this semester",
