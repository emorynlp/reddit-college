I was so depressed and lonely, and now that I\u2019m in in person school I feel extremely overwhelmed. I want to take advantage of every single social opportunity I can, and I feel so incredibly burnt out from last year that I don\u2019t even want to think about school. Even so it\u2019s soooo hard to make friends. I feel like somethings wrong with me. I\u2019m trying to stay afloat in my classes but I just cant. Everything is so hard and I have no attention span anymore, and I\u2019m also having major imposter syndrome, and I feel like all of my classmates are 100000x smarter than me. I\u2019m so sick of crying all the time and feeling so stressed, I just have zero motivation and self confidence now and don\u2019t even know how to approach this.\n\n\nTLDR: after doing online school last year I\u2019m so burnt out and don\u2019t even know how to handle anything anymore", "author": "Alwaystrying2better", "created": 1631516408, "retrieved": 1632948560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcp29ux": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pnad0h/zero_motivation/hcp29ux/", "text": "Be kind to yourself.
