  "text": "Just last month I finished my first professional year of pharmacy school and my god it was rough. 8 classes worth 20 credit hours for a whole year. 28 total exams in my spring semester to which every week there\u2019s an exam. Also being that it was online there were problems like some the homework was poorly constructed, bad planning for our on-campus labs in microbiology and one of the professors had a fit in the last few weeks and was being rude and snotty to the class. In the end I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over since I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the hardest year of the program. Anyways that\u2019s the halfway mark, only three more years left for a PharmD\u2026....",
