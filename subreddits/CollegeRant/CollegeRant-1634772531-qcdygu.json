  "title:": "Being a History Major with a lot of STEM major friends sucks \ud83d\ude29",
  "text": "So I\u2019m a history major with a film minor. It\u2019s my third year and most of friends (85% of them) are STEM majors (Chem, Bio, Pre Med, and Pre Dent). All of them are very busy and in turn I get busy too with the amount of reading and writing load I have as well as project in the film department. My close friend group that I actively hang out with is a with a Pre Nursing/EMT major, lab Technician, and a Health Communication with Pre Med. So most of the time I study with them all I\u2019m mostly reading or writing something or doing a project but they are studying deeply and they are memorizing and doing all that. I don\u2019t mind it at all. \n\nHowever my tougher situations is when I have write 9-11 page essays because I\u2019m reaching my upper class status and I\u2019m taking harder and more specific upperdiv classses for my major. That\u2019s all good however most of the time I always hear them complain or grumble because of an assignment and I usually shut my mouth because I know it\u2019s hard and I can\u2019t say anything about it because I probably couldn\u2019t do it. However sometimes I go off because I have so much reading or writing to do that I can\u2019t even breath and so I complain that I can\u2019t think anymore or I state that I got a bad grade on a quiz even though I studied and a lot of the time it comes down then telling me to try harder because it\u2019s easy, to not complain because they have harder classes (which I understand) or they just make fun about it. \ud83d\ude29 it just sometimes makes me feel like I should try harder but I already am. I want to but like I know that STEM is harder but like sometimes I just wished that they would just let me complain or grumble over a hard thing. Sure it may not be hard for them but it\u2019s a lot of work. \n\nTLTR: As a history major and a film minor, I wish I could grumble and complain about hard assignments and be able to talk about it without feeling like I can\u2019t because \u201cSTEM is harder\u201d. STEM is harder than History and I know that but sometimes it would be nice to express something when you are exhausted instead of feeling like you can\u2019t. \n\nMORAL of the Story is if your STEM major please be nice to liberal arts and FINE ARTS majors because it may not be easy for them either and maybe you wouldn\u2019t be able to do the stuff that we do. Learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve about STEM and there are other jobs too!",

      "text": "People, in general, shouldn't be comparing their issues with your issues at all. Everyone goes through different experiences and hardships (whether in school, skillsets or in life) and form different solutions and skills as a result of this. While the Pre-Meds have a hard time memorizing various terms, the Art majors could have a hard time expressing geninue creativity. One person may find it easier to be creative then memorize, but the same can be said for another person who finds memorization easier then creativity. \n\nNgl, your friends sound a lil toxic for downgrading your issue as something simple to do. Their not really open-minded on the fact that not everyone is a natural talent in a stem major, nor is everyone a natural talent in liberal arts. If it was supposedly so easy for them, why not take an easy route in a liberal arts major and succeed with straight As? Why are they bitching about how hard their work is when they can take the easy route and cause less suffering on themselves (excluding pricy college and all that good jazz)? \n\nAlso OP, don't downgrade your work cause your friends are taking hard STEM classes. You sharping and writing dem papers for YOUR OWN success speaks volumes on how much time and commitment you make. You don't need your friend's validation on whether your work is \"worthy/hard\" enough for their time. \n\nLol i went on a tangent mb.",

I'll finish this year (it was only 2 years) but I have no idea what to do next. I would already be able to work at a company in programming with my degree but would I want to? I liked physics in the past but idk about that, and currently I'm really fascinated by different cultures around the world, geography, history, geopolitics etc. I'd really want to travel. But honestly idk if I would like it as a study or if it should remain a hobby. And I don't hate programming but the current college made me hate it. It would seem too monotonous if it'll be the same as in college. Absolutely unbearable. But honestly my family also makes it harder for me to decide, since they think that I should only go to programming and that I'll like it later. Feels as if I'm forced to go to some predestined path. To be fair it was my idea in the first place but now it just feels like I can't just change my mind and that my first choice is my destiny for life. And because of my family I feel like I rather become contrarian and just want to say to my family that I'll do the opposite of what they want. Also, I have the exact same problem with gender identity as well. And I can't really choose something without my family, because honestly I'm just not that great of making my own decisions. It's hard to make an informed decision of my own.",

                      "text": "Long rambling reply incoming, I apologize in advance lol\n\nOh I see. It's definitely a difficult situation, feeling pressure and uncertainty because of family expectations. It's maybe not a common or popular opinion, but I think finding your own \"destiny\" is sort of an impossible ideal people strive for. Doing what will make you happy and comfortable is also important. Every person in my family is a STEM person (engineer, IT, biology, medical field, etc) and I'm over here currently getting an ESL education license. Pretty much all my friends are STEM too. Its actually pretty amusing. \n\nI used to be a STEM major, decided a career in STEM wasn't something I was particularly interested in, so chose to keep it more as a hobby/personal interest and switch majors to something that will allow me to live in various countries while working because I really love traveling and learning about other cultures and languages. Do I always feel this was the most logical or perfect decision? Definitely not, but it serves my purpose now, so that's good enough for me. If I decide I don't like it someday, I'll see what I have to do to transition into a different field. I think people assume their stuck in only 1 career based on their major. But especially here, that's not the case at all. Going back to school or gaining certifications is an option here. \n\nI wish I knew more about DUT and France's education system, so I'm not sure how easy these things are there, but I'm sure there are options. Finishing your current schooling would allow you to get a job that likely would pay decently, which then opens up other opportunities for more education/etc later (tho I'm assuming tuition in France is generally more affordable then the US?). I definitely felt trapped in a career/major and felt I was making a huge mistake, but I've learned that it's really not that serious. If you decide something isn't for you, there are options to change careers/fields/etc if you look for them. I know someone that graduated with an education major and not works in IT. And even someone that was 1 semester from graduating with an engineering degree that dropped out to join the circus (not even an exaggeration, he literally joined a circus).\n\nI'm sorry that it sounds you're struggling with feeling stuck and unsure. It's a stressful thing. But you're doing your best! Becoming more confident in your abilities to make your own decisions takes a lot of practice (I really had to work on it a lot, and I still am). Sometimes you just have to decide even if you're not sure of all the facts, just do your best to be informed and ask for help if you need other perspectives. There are so many people who can and will help if you ask. And also, as far as gender identity goes, that is a very personal thing that only you can decide what feels right for you. There are definitely communities you can find and join to learn more and research, but that is something only you can figure out. I've gone through similar things myself, and it can be confusing and a little lonely, but its empowering finding identities that fit you. I support you in whatever identity you feel fits you though, you're always allowed to continue exploring and change your mind if you find something you feel fits better later too! Wishing you all the luck, if you ever need to chat, my inbox is open and there are also a lot of others that are willing to help and support you as well.",

Over half of the class failed the first assignment despite us going over it for weeks in lecture and tutorial. We went over types of sources and types of arguments every week. It was just a simple analysis of an article like max a page and a half but the feedback the TA gave was they did not adopt a historical lens and their claims had no evidence or didn\u2019t culminate into an overall argument. A historical lens and skills takes time and effort to develop and anyone who doubts that hasn\u2019t taken higher level history courses which are significantly harder than lower levels because the expectation is that your skills have grown.",

College is hard for nearly everyone (who tries), regardless of the degree type. Everyone should respect other's hard work. If your friends don't, even when they see you working hard, then they need to be talked to or dropped. Signed, someone with two STEM degrees.",

I won\u2019t say that ALL stem majors are like this, but a certain percentage of them can be like that. \n\nWe are all unique individuals. We need people in STEM, but we also need people in the liberal arts. It\u2019s like saying, we need doctors and engineers bc they\u2019re important people, but we also need grocery stockers and restaurant service workers and truck drivers. And to be honest, this world would be pretty boring if everyone went into the STEM field and this world would not function with just professions in the STEM field existing. Next time you have a stem major degrading you and complaining about how their major is way harder, just say that they chose to major in it so that\u2019s what they get. \n\nSTEM is a tough field/major. I went in as a STEM major but got weeded out early in my sophomore year but I learned that it happened for a reason and I was never meant to pursue a purpose in the STEM field bc it would be something that wouldn\u2019t make me happy. I wish the STEM majors who are cocky would realize that it doesn\u2019t make them any better than everyone else.",

They want me to intervene somehow. They can perform well with science and math but get absolutely spanked when they have to write and make extended arguments.
