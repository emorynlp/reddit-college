  "text": "In my intro to business class sometimes my professor has us break into \u201cbreakout groups\u201d to conduct an in-class activity (NOT for a grade). My main reason for not liking it is that we already read about the material beforehand so the activity feels redundant. I don\u2019t feel like I learn anything from the activity and to me it feels like a waste of time. I prefer straight up lectures and reading. Plus being the naturally quiet person I am I don\u2019t enjoy these activities. How do you guys feel about group in class activities? And do you feel like you learned something from it?",

      "text": "I\u2019m like you in the way that I prefer lectures and reading. One benefit from in person activities like the ones you\u2019re describing is that you get practice talking about concepts. Writing about concepts in a paper is different from having to a discussion. Conversations can help you realize that there are gaps in your knowledge, things you find particularly exciting, or can show you a more eloquent way of saying something. \n\nAdditionally, think about these as networking opportunities with both your peers and professors. I did particularly well in a discussion-based class my first year of undergrad and the professor later asked me to be his research assistant because I could concisely explain concepts both in person and on paper.",
