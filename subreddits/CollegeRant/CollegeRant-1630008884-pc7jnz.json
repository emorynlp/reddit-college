Isn't the point of reading to learn something? If I can get all of that information by skimming (which I personally can't) why even bother assigning seven articles and a chapter each week? If there's so much material that it is impossible to actually read it, surely there is a better way to summarize main points.\n\nIdk I'm a senior and this is my first time having professors tell us that it's \"impossible\" to throuroughly read everything they assign. I get reading efficiently for things like academic journal articles I guess, but this is like the meat of the material we cover. We're really just supposed to skim for information?
