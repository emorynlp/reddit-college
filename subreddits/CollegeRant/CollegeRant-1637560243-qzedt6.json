Writing is not easy. \n\nMaybe just give it a free write for the first draft to write down what comes to mind when you think about this subject that you absolute adore. And then review and edit that as the foundation/groundwork. \n\nGood luck.",

      "text": "I do this! One time I had a completed math worksheet and all I had to do was take a picture and submit it and I couldn't so I was just like sobbing and shaking in my car lol! Never even submit it. I did this with some writing assignments (topics I loved) and actually submit them after the semester ended. Email your professor and they might give you an encouraging response. Then, get your ass into your college's writing center!! I have never been to mine, but I know I should go. Social stuff motivates me. I get real unproductive when I feel like I'm writing to a void and the only audience is the paper. Sit down with a writing center guide and just figure out the outline and write the beginning together. Then once you get the ball rolling, you can stay in that room and keep writing in the presence of someone who has some interest. \n\nI swear though, if prompts were posts and essays were long ass comments, then I would have finished my 10 page paper by now.\n\nYeah you're not alone! Not a dumbass. Not sure I'd say mental burnout. I think it is hard to gather the focus to do something when the sense of urgency is diminished.",
