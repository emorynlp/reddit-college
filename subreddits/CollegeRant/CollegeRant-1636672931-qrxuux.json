  "text": "I study in a country that still hasn\u2019t opened up colleges because of COVID. It\u2019s been over two years of meeting 11:59 deadlines and scrambling to push over 2,500 words every other week. I\u2019m so exhausted. Being back home is painful. I never go out. Im pretty sure I have a sunlight deficiency. I have no friends, and my personality has permanently been altered significantly. I used to have hope. I used to have interests. But my college amped up the coursework because of the accelerated semesters and the online mode. I have no time for hobbies. I have no time for anything other than staring at a screen all day and churning out the same bullshit that no one cares about. Aren\u2019t these supposed to be the most impactful years of my youth? I spent my highschool years traumatized and mentally ill. The one thing that kept me going was getting out of my hometown but here I am, crying in my childhood bedroom at age 20 just like I did when I was 15. \n\ntl;dr: online school sucks. im genuinely at the edge.",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat. At this point i have done twice as much online school as in person. The pandemic started in the first semester of my first year, so I had just a tiny taste of the good life just to have it ripped away from me. My university is slow in reopening because of the community and location, so I have to sit at home and watch more and more of my friends return to in person at their universities. Sucks",
