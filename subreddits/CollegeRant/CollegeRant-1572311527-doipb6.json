I also know that most professors are awesome and this isn't geared toward them. I just saw this happen today and had to get it off my chest because it makes me angry.\n\n\nWe were taking our midterm today when a student finished and asked professor (P) if they could take the first part that they missed last week because they were unable to come to class. While this student obviously should have brought this up privately in an email or office hours, I don't think they knew any better (probably a freshman and the first time in college). Our professor snapped at this student in front of the whole class while most of us were still taking the midterm.\n\n\nP told the student that now was not the time or place to make such a request (understandable) and then proceeded to berate the (obviously nervous) kid about how \"you should never have such ridiculous expectations\" and \"the rules can't be bent for anyone, what did you think was going to happen, is the whole class supposed to be on board with this...\" Finally, the professor angrily  threw a pen toward the student at a desk, causing everyone in the class to stop the midterm. P yelled at the student to get out of  sight, so the student left (after picking the pen up and handing it to the professor, seriously, that's how nice this student is)\n\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, another student asked for a little bit of clarification that we had already gone over, but again, students get nervous during exams so it wasn't that unreasonable. The professor was clearly annoyed and rolled their eyes, and the student basically apologized for asking the question in the first place.\n\n\nLike I said, I get it. Everyone is stressed out right now because of midterms, even professors. But I really hope that the student who got yelled at in class gets some form of apology. Sure, the student has probably learned their lesson about being more professional and accountable for their absences, but it could have been taught in a better way. Our professor could have easily told the student  to send an email or that they could talk during office hours, but instead the student probably doesn't want to come to class again. \n\n\nMaybe I'm just being overly sensitive or I really don't like confrontation, but the whole thing seemed over the top. Yes, the expectations are higher in college than in high school, but this sort of reaction was uncalled for.", "author": "collegegirl2494", "created": 1572311527, "retrieved": 1632951544, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"f5p632n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/doipb6/dear_college_professors_please_have_some_patience/f5p632n/", "text": "That is a fair bit past a reasonable snap.
