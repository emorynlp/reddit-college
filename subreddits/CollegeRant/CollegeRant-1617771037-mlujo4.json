I allocate approximately 10-12 hours daily to coursework, even when all of my assignments are finished, so that the next ass-load of material won't be as hard to swallow. So even when I do all of my assigned tasks for the day, I still will always have something to do. I'm basically at the point where I am realizing that I will never experience a life without work for the rest of my life and its honestly kind of bull shit. Why should I spend 12 hours a day 5 days a week studying my ass off in order to just have a regular-paced day on Saturday's? It doesn't even seem worth it. It feels like there is no incentive to being a proactive student anymore. Way too much material to take in way too quickly, there is zero downtime especially if you get involved with extracurriculars.", "author": null, "created": 1617771037, "retrieved": 1632843345, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gtnluge": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mlujo4/if_you_are_someone_who_takes_longer_to_grasp/gtnluge/", "text": "Thank you u/mynamejeff10 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also am a very slow learner. However, i am intelligent. I will do everything in my power to work smart and beat the system so i will need less time to study ( i also am a massive procastinator). I used to be a student like you and now i pass doing the bare minimum. It is a mixed feeling; on the one hand i am proud that i can pass without doing th\u00e0t much, on the other hand i feel like a bad student. So i highly suggest to not flip the swith fully around because it isn't better, find the middle road.\nAnyhow some tips:\n- can you pick courses from a list? Then make sure to read through all the lists and compare how much work it is. Don't pick the course that sounds interesting but has 10 tasks and an exam. It will backfire. Pick the course that is perhaps taught on a lower level, has no group projects (unless you enjoy it), has no weekly tasks but only an exam to study for so you can fully focus on the learning material. You can also do it the other way around if you prefer doing tasks instead of exams.\n- capitalize on the shit you're good at. I'm good at writing essays, so i pick courses that are graded 50% for writing an essay. My number one tip: put a personal note in your essays. Professors are humans and dont wanna read scientific shitty papers all day. It will be refreshing for them to read something personal. How are you affected by the topic? It also shows interest in the topic and some level of knowledge about it (even if that isn't the case, fake it till you make it). I also recommand preparing an essay plan when writing essays.\n- don't waste time that you don't have on making summaries. You can get them online for free. And sometimes, i find it worth paying for them. Always try to make a summary if you can, but stop waisting time and working overdrive when you can't.\n- attend all your classes and try to take notes or immediately exchange notes with your friends after class if you weren't able to take notes yourself.\n-  Pay attention to details. I study on the other side of the country and i have a distinct accent. My professor had the same accent. We both are smokers so during breaks me and some other students would make small talk with him while smoking, and he immediately liked me because we are from the same area. It was an oral exam and i barely passed, he gave me an extra point because he has a soft spot for me. Having a good relationship with your professors can play in your advance for sure (ofcourse not crossing any personal boundaries).\n\nSoooo yeah. YOU DESERVE TO LIVE. So do your best, work the system, capitalize on your talents so you have more time to enjoy yourself, because everyone deserves that.\n\nEDIT: oh yeah, you discovered the magic of college: THERE WILL ALWAYS BE WORK TO DO, IT NEVER ENDS. You just need to know where to draw the line\nPs sorry for the bad english, it is not my first language", "author": "churchisforbrunettes", "created": 1617812226, "upvotes": 7}, "gtof5bi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mlujo4/if_you_are_someone_who_takes_longer_to_grasp/gtof5bi/", "text": "If you agree with the title premise then go farm beets or some shit", "author": "KarmaInFlow", "created": 1617796489, "upvotes": -9}}}
