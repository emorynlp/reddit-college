  "text": "I live in the dorms at my university and the guy next to me is WAY too loud. Day in and day out it sounds like he\u2019s being murdered. Last Monday he was at it at 7:30 in the MORNING smh. I don\u2019t even think he has classes based on how often I\u2019m hearing him. He\u2019s loud enough that the whole floor can hear him, even worse though that I\u2019m in the next room over. As a matter of fact I can hear him cussing and screaming as I\u2019m writing this.\n\nThis guys laugh is so weird\n\nUpdate: my Roomate got mad and told the RA on him. The RA knocked on his door and the guy apologized. Afterwards he kept his voice down but now it\u2019s an hour later and he\u2019s back to his normal volume.",
