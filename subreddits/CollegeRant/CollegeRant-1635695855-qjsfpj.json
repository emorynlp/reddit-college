  "text": "I fucking can\u2019t take it man. I work 20-30 hours a week, go to school full time, maintain a 3.98 gpa, finished a minor and my major while trying to get enough credits to graduate (transferred in got fucked with my credit transfers) and I overall fucking don\u2019t sleep, barely can stomach food or even remain still without wanting to fucking throw my face through a wall. \n\nThese teachers literally, shit you not, have not taught. One teacher expedites teaching through other professors videos or random Ted talks and DRAMATIZED REALITY FUCKING TV SHOWS LIKE REALLY?! \n\nI ask my group mates when we can work, meet up etc and you know what I get? \nHere\u2019s a few responses: \n\u201cNah I\u2019m going to rolling loud for the week sorry\u201d \n\u201cNah I\u2019m having a pro scout look at me today sorry\u201d\n\u201c*ignores my text* did you know the vax is ______ (insert conspiracy theory here)\u201d\n\nOHH ANDDDD my fucking professor is making us essentially beta test his barely functional and useless group app and made it a core part of a grade despite none of my group mates doing the work. Both groups are leaving it up to me to do the work and I can\u2019t fucking do it. I take high does of anxiety meds and they don\u2019t even work anymore. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss for words. I am defeated. I am not going to advocate for this shit school anymore under the fallacy that \u201cnot all the students are lazy\u201d when in reality 95% of these fucks are.\n\nBro what the actual fuck. I can never catch a fucking break, 3 semesters in a row of this shit.",

      "text": "I study american culture & literature. We got a new prof who used to be a research assistant before. He is teaching us our Realism and Research classes. He gave us a long research paper assignment for each class, even though we are taking Research this semester. I don\u2019t know how to write a research paper the way he wants me to because we didnt get there yet in our research class. \n\nOn top of that, in our realism class he is making students present the chapters every week. He just sits there and adds nothing to our chapters, the chapters he is supposed to lecture us on. I don\u2019t understand shit from what my classmates present because I have ADHD and my countrys mother tongue is not English but the department is. So they all have accents and stutter a lot, which makes it more difficult for me to follow. I am going to fail this class horribly.\n\nWe also haven\u2019t heard what our other lecturers wants us to do for our other 5 classes we\u2019re taking. They will also all give more assignments.",

I also separately e-mailed him telling him I was concerned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do two research papers in one semester as i\u2019m also learning how to write them. He said I can write it as I learn it in class, which limits my time to do these assignments. I will not have enough time to write two research papers when i\u2019m already at week 7 out of 14 of the semester and we are still studying how the MLA format works / what to use italics etc. for, and haven\u2019t even touched the subject of how to write research papers. He is young and a new prof, and his inexperience is going to fail more than half of the class.",

The chosen group leaders are saddled with a little extra work, but they're told they can use the professor as a professional reference if their groups are successful.\n\nThe group leaders are given extra power over what happens concerning their groups, and are encouraged to report any and everything to the professor if there's problem. Literally, if you can prove that someone in your group isn't responding to messages and isn't contributing at all to the project, you can have them removed from the group.\n\nIt sound worse than it is, depending on the group you're in. This particular professor is really good, if a little pushy, so the main worry is the group leaders. I'm preferring it so far over the regular groups where half the team just never shows up.",
