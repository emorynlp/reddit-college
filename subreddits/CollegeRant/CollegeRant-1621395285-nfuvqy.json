Most of my classes were live online, but one class was solely online (with no zoom meetings) and I had no idea when homework was due or when my class started or ended. My estimated gpa is a 2.3 this first semester of college, but in reality it\u2019s gonna be a 2.2 because of a final I tried my hardest at but barely passed... I continuously showed my progress to my family in order for them to see how hard I was trying, but I slacked off in areas that were crucial in some cases... I\u2019m trying to get a 3.1-3.3 GPA by the end of my senior year of college and I\u2019m scared of not being able to go to graduate classes for Psychology... What should I do? Because I got a B and a B+ in Korean and psychology respectively, (87 and 80 in order) but because of finals I went from a 78 to a 73 in math, and a 73 to a possible 69 or 70... and another class to which I had a 66... I want to get a great gpa by the end of my 4 years of college and I\u2019m so scared... I feel like a failure and a burden to everyone around me...", "author": "NumerousMinute7555", "created": 1621395285, "retrieved": 1632842358, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gynl2yc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nfuvqy/need_advice_as_a_college_freshman_whose_finished/gynl2yc/", "text": "Thank you u/NumerousMinute7555 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
