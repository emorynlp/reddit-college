  "text": "Hello everyone,\nI have a project in my business management class and need some help. The consumer group I\u2019m targeting is college students and I\u2019m trying to learn the biggest issues college students face. \nSo please help a friend out and just rant about anything that has bothered you with your college experience. It can be any issues about college from walking around campus to hard classes/professor. \nI really appreciate any input I could get back!",
