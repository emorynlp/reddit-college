  "title:": "Being made to travel abroad during my finals week, where I wont have WiFi (Yup). May have to withdraw from the semester",
  "text": "Big family events have been planned a week before my family usually makes the trip abroad to visit. My parents had asked me earlier in the semester if it would work with my schedule and I let them know that it would not. I thought we had came to the consensus that I would have to travel separate from them so there would be no issues. Nope. Last week they bought the plane tickets for the entire family to travel at the same time, despite my schedule. I guess they just expect me to do my final exams in a different country? It wont be possible\n\nWhere we live there is the rural countryside. WiFi is rare. To do my final exams there I would need to take a bus three towns over to the nearest large town and find a internet caf\u00e9. The problem is that the big family events would both take place during my finals week, and each one can last for over a day. Not only that, but the state is currently very dangerous so that complicates things. I burrowed an internet hotspot from my university (for a separate reason) but since it runs on cell service, it seems it wont work in a different country. \n\nIts unlikely that my professors would allow me to take my final exams early, nor would that be wise if I could because the week before is reserved for review & study, so I wouldn't do good on them. I also have the task of explaining my (white American) professors and advisors my problem. I would need to be explicit to explain them the socio/cultural nuance of the situation (a big one is to make it clear that I'm not going to the fun, touristy, vacation part of the country but rather the dirt roads, tin roofs, yee-haw part so they don't think I'm just going on a vacation on my finals week). \n\nPart of me thinks this is for the best? I'm not doing so great this semester, hell I originally planned to take this one off. The frustration is still real nonetheless. My parents have been rushing me to graduate (even though I'm at the start of my third year) so this would make them more frustrated with me. They just don't get college.\n\n**TL;DR:** Despite prior warning of my academic calendar, my parents bought tickets to travel abroad for everyone. We would arrive at the start of my finals week. Both the week before and the finals week itself are being made busy bc of major family events, which makes studying and working difficult. WiFi is very hard to come by where we are going, so I probably wont even be able to do my finals anyway. May be forced to withdraw from the semester. Frustrated in my parent's lack of acknowledgement or understanding of my academics.",

      "text": "What the hell? Why would they buy you a ticket if you told them it wasn't going to work out? Is there any way you can stay home? The semester is almost over and if you withdraw you're basically throwing all of the hard work you've done down the drain. Not a good idea to do that... I say you take the bus 3 towns over and get those finals done. I'm sure your family will understand and even if they don't you have to lookout for yourself. Good luck.",

They seem to be under the impression that the only time I use for my classes are when I'm actually in class/lecture for example. That's why it was easy for them to expect me to do finals during a busy week in another country. Also they don't want me traveling alone lol",

      "text": "Let them know as soon as possible that you either need to change the date or simply not go. Dont set yourself back for a trip that will be over in a few weeks when the semester lasts months. Every semester you complete means you're that much closer to graduating and being done with your school. No offense but your family needs to plan better and they need to understand that sometimes you have to put yourself over family. Family that cares wouldn't come in between you and important plans. Family that cares wouldn't make you throw away a whole semester of college. Sometimes, you have to stand up for yourself and say no.",

          "text": "I agree, but this is the thing about having to explain nuance. I pretty much can't refuse to not go, this is likely the last year I will see some family members, and this trip is something we don't really have a choice in (especially with how expensive the tickets were). It's not that they don't care it's that they don't know any better (I explained in another comment).\nI'm not as upset as I would normally be about throwing away the semester because I'm not doing good at all rn. I was originally going to take this one off because my GPA suffers with fully online school. I've pretty much accepted throwing away this semester with \"well at least my GPA won't plummet again\" I will still try my hardest to finish don't get me wrong, but I'm prepared for the possibility that I won't be able to.",

If you go on the trip as planned, you will ask your professors for help (take exams early, etc) but you will likely fail the semester. Or you can go later, change the tickets, and have a better shot at passing. This is assuming they're paying for your education and plane tickets, and that you are indifferent. They can pick which thing they'd prefer happen.",

Withdrawing is more of a last ditch resort to saving my GPA, especially in the face of the problem detailed in my post.",
