  "text": "Over the past 18 months I struggled heavily with an eating disorder. During that time I decided to drop a couple classes because I was too driven by my mental illness to care about school. Now as an individual that has recovered and is in a much better place, I can confidently say I made some haste decisions without realizing their weight.\nI am currently a senior and just recently met with my academic advisor to go over scheduling classes and she informed me that a few classes I need to graduate are not usually offered in the spring, so I may have to wait until the summer semester is over to graduate. It is safe to say I did not take that news well. I know that it was my fault for not looking into things at the time and assuming it wouldn\u2019t be an issue (but I guess that what\u2019s happens when you quite literally are unable to think rationally). I wholeheartedly wish I could go back in time and tell myself of the consequences of these actions before I made any of those decisions. This has been difficult given the wave of embarrassment I feel thinking about how I will be graduating after all my friends. Also, it hurts even more given the fact that I was so excited to graduate and move on with my life, and this just feels like another setback to my already shitty couple of months. And now I\u2019m nervously counting down the days until I see my parents and have to tell them the news. I just feel like a bit of a disappointment and don\u2019t want them to be unhappy with me. Overall, just feeling a bit lost, sad, and overwhelmed. \n\nAnyways, I just needed to vent and get it off my chest. If you stuck with me long enough to finish this ramble, thanks.",
