Luckily, I am able to walk with my class because my university offers early participation in commencement; however, I am only permitted to participate in graduation if there are no more than 8 credit hours remaining.\n\nBecause I am only 6 credits behind, I will earn my degree after taking the 8 credits. The issue is, I need 12 credits in order to complete my second major. This leaves one class that will keep me from finishing my second major. Do colleges make exceptions for these situations? If not, is it possible for me to finish my second major after I receive my degree? \n\nMost importantly, is it worth continuing classes in my second major if I can\u2019t complete it? Or should I pick up a second minor instead? Thank you for your help, I am stressed to no end.\n\nTL;DR I will be one class short of completing my second major when I receive my degree.", "author": "kat3rt0t", "created": 1630047262, "retrieved": 1632841548, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"haj0bej": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pci5bv/my_college_wont_allow_me_to_take_one_last_class/haj0bej/", "text": "Thank you u/kat3rt0t for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
