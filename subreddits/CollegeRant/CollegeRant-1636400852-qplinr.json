  "text": "I walked to my class feeling a little uneasy but I didn\u2019t wanna skip, so I went anyways. Sat down and instantly felt extremely nauseous, went to the bathroom and coughed and gagged for a bit. Went back to class, grabbed my bookbag and left. Anyone else ever done this? Feel kinda stupid and still pretty nauseous lmao",
