He usually plays videogames almost all day everyday. Sometimes he'll still be in the middle of his gaming session when I needed the computer.  I don't want to ask my parants for another computer (they'll probably say no to me and I don't really have any money to buy another one (I never had a job). \n\nLuckily, he would usually give it to me when I ask, however he'll often ask \"how long would you need it for?\" when I was using it if he needs it for games. I would say \"I don't know\", but then he would demand me to estimate (it gets annoying).\n\nLuckily, he's getting a new computer and I would be keeping a computer to myself.", "author": "chenthehen", "created": 1593553406, "retrieved": 1632951541, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"fybdhvw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hiwzsp/anybody_having_problem_in_which_little_sibling/fybdhvw/", "text": "By college age you really need your own computer", "author": "aspie_giraffe", "created": 1594949388, "upvotes": 2}, "fwmckm9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hiwzsp/anybody_having_problem_in_which_little_sibling/fwmckm9/", "text": "Never really had an issue with my computer being shared in college yet but apparently every girl I've been with is a different story", "author": "trunks111", "created": 1593634567, "upvotes": 2}}}
