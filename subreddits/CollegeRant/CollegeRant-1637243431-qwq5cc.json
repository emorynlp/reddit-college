  "text": "I have this cultural anthropology class where the teacher is just down right terrible in teaching this class.This class is online so in order for me to reach out with him and have a discussion on topics is absolutely 0 to none because this guy \n1. doesn\u2019t answer questions during lectures so if you have multiple questions and you forget that\u2019s one you\n2. takes attendance way to seriously as if he doesn\u2019t see you for 1 freaking second on zoom and dips for the rest of lecture \n3.SLOW AND FREAKING BORING IN HIS EXPLANATIONS,IM TWO TEST IN AND STILLL HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL IM DOING\n4.Claims the info on the test will be based on the reasons when most is on the powerpoints\n\nim like down right failing this class and it sucks cause i\u2019m interested in the development of humans but honestly i hope i can no credit this class cause i really don\u2019t want to hear from this guy again,he\u2019s terrible.With the \u201cerr\u201d every fucking 2 seconds.\n\ni schedule a meeting with my study buddy today so wish me luck for the next one..i guess",
