  "text": "I get it. Theres a lot of people that dont like online classes ; think that it doesnt equate to what they paid for / learning. But here me out. \n\nI really like online classes. I work partially full time sometimes part time week by week. Being able to do my online classes with a employer who doesnt care about my education is beneficial to me keeping my job. Additionally, I actually enjoy not having to live near or on campus. The overpriced rent, the people who dont know how to drive and the constant drama or students in class that would interrupt a lecture over something quite trivial. In my experience online classes was a overall benefit to myself. It is important however to note that there is a large swath of people who prefer in person classes and that is okay. But as i suspect there are many people like me that have to work for a living to pay for aspects of college without any family help. That I am internally a introvert and just hate some of the aspects that come with loud overcrowding on main campus during Greek life events. While prices should be less for online tutition there are two types of college students. \n\n- Those who have the means and financial capital to do what they want \n- Those who have to work constantly to pay for everything while taking loans out. \n\nI hope to god most colleges keep online classes in some capacity for 20-30% of all courses. It is financially disastrous for those of us that had to start off with nothing. \n\nTl:Dr - online classes help college students who are more poor and introverted and some people need to respect that.",

It obviously depends on one's major, but in the major I had, there was a LOT of filler and garbage that wasted time in class and it was so liberating to cut the shit and get my time back. I had some classes I finished in two weeks. I really enjoyed getting to meet, befriend, and network with people in my classes in person but I think if I had a choice to do every online class as I described, I would have jumped on it in an instant.",

I attended classes in my room, the middle of campus, and even at the airport. As long as you have your phone you are good. My professors gave us tons of resources, both free and paid, that really helpd out with classes and were fun to explore that we would not have been given if we were in person or not hybrid.  My favorites were the subscription to an archaeology magazine and the anatomically correct skeletons (that we got to keep) that the biology department blew their budget on lol.",
