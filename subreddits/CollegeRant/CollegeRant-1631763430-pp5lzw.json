I have a question for all of yall. How do yall deal with your messy roommates.\n\nI need to clarify my situation before I proceed. I live on Campus in Huntsville in a 4 person suite. We all share a living area and kitchen, two people share a bathroom, and each person has their own bedroom. Now that that's out of the way let me proceed in my rant. \n\nMy side roomate: My roommates are disgusting. I mean for starters my room is near a student who suffers from some sort of ASD. I never asked him indirectly because I don't want to assume, but I have enough information to come to a conclusion. Let me make this straight. I have nothing against him or others like him, however his habits can be a bit too much to handle. For starters every time he says something he laughs after wards and always wants to interrupt everyone so he can get his point out there ffor everyone. I can be talking about something to someone else and he always wants to but in and say \"Something Something Something (Laugh).\" Again I understand he has issues, but there has got to be a limit. I mean I have 2 classes with him and every professor has yelled at him because they tried to be patient with him, but that didn't work out since he always wants to interrupt during class to get his point out thinking he's smarter than everyone. I mean he's gifted, but come one you can't act like you're smarter than everyone you know. What's even worse is the bathroom. I have told him numerous times that he needs to throw the empty toilet paper roll in the trash, but ibstead of doing that he throws it on the foor of the bathroom and proceeds to act like he did it by accident. I'm not an idiot. Second he grabs my towels to clean up his mess. I have small towels at the side of my sink so I can clean my face after shaving. What he did one time was he grabbed one of my towel to clean his mouthwash that he spilled on the floor and neatly put it right back before I could see him. When I went to use my towel I suddenly threw it on the floor because it was soaking wet and covered in stains. I knew he did it because when I turned to look at him he suddenly put his head down like if I was going to yell at him and I simple said \"You better leave before I lose my temper.\" He left immediately. Now another thing I have to mention before I move on is that he for some reason talks so loud on the phone screaming and laughing over everything. He even wakes up at 2 in the morning to play his PC and talks so loudly into his headset that I literally banged the wall to tell him to be quiet. He still does it and I reported him to the RA. The issue is that since he is technically a special needs person they can't just make him leave his room, but they may end up moving me entirely out of the suite. I still other things to say before I go.\n\nThe others: I rarely encounter the other two roommates and they have also complained about my roommate. However, that doesn't excuse them from my rant. For starters theu never clean up after themselves. Their daily food consumption is simply grab something fro. the fridge, chug it in the microwave, make a mess after, and go back to their rooms. They have not once cleaned the kitchen nor have they cleaned the living room. Hell they don't even clean their own bathroom. I've seen them thrown used towels on the floor near their toilet and they will still use those same towels after to dry themselves. I have not only cleaned the kitchen and living area, but also my own bathroom because my roomate doesn't know how to. I don't do the other two's bathroom because they can suffer themselves. I am the only one in the suite that has cleaning supplies. Nobody else has anything. Not even a broom. Know this is partially due to me being a housekeeper as a side job, but nonetheless even if I wasn't a house keeper I would still bring items to clean my room. The other two share a trash can that has not been emptied since a month ago. The trask is literally piled of nothing but fast food and microwavable food. I mean come on. That's simple etiquette and they can't even do that.\n\nCleaning and fridge: This paragraph won't be that long, but they get mad when I clean because apparently I make too much noise. Oh I'm sorry that I am cleaning the suite instead of waking up playing video games or watching pron at nights out loud. The fridge we all share is full of nothing, but expired food that they store in their. I have to thrown it away just so I can store my meals since I want my food to not be contaminated\n\nDecorations: This is mostly my own doing. I want to decorate the living area, but I can't. The others store stuff they don't want instead of storing them in something called a closet which everyone has. Chairs, clothes, and other stupid items. I have no purpose to decorate anything because I know they would mess with it and my money would go to waste. I have to keep my 53 inch tv in my room because they almost broke it one time. I have to keep everything in my room because they will touch it.\n\nConclusion: I have talked to my housing office and they are looking for a single suite room for me, and if not then I will have to wait until the next semester to wait for a room to open since I ha e to stay on campus for a year because of a contract I signed. Has anyone else had an expierence like mine. If so what did yall do to survive. Help me I will literally throw hands next time something like this happens. I just want to live in peace. It's outrageous that I was the least organized person in my house. I would've thought everybody would've been mad at me. Instead I am mad at everybody for something I'm known for. At least my room is clean and mold free.", "author": "Str8EdgeB_tchBobbyAJ", "created": 1631763430, "retrieved": 1632948529, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hd5f944": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp5lzw/messy_roommates_rant/hd5f944/", "text": "i had a BAD case of messy roommates. food on the floor, they would have LOUD sex and I once stepped on a USED condom in our kitchen\u2026 \n\nUnderwear and disgusting things always on the floor of the bathroom and never cleaned up after their cats. pubes in the bathtub always.
