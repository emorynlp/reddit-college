If it is, make sure you try to figure out what went wrong asap and find other resources to use other than the textbook (I SUCK at studying from a textbook. ). If it isn't, try to get ahead on learning what's coming up so you can be ahead and have more time to figure stuff out. The most important thing is to yes, spend  a second mourning your chance at a good grade. Eat something you like. Then just say \"fuck that shit. What quiz?\" And pretend it didn't even happen. Lol repress the memory of even taking that test. Dwelling on doing poorly ruins your confidence. Starting something as if it's a clean slate helps you get the motivation to still try. Bad grade? Fuck that shit. Missed an assignment? Fuck that shit. Fuck any bad vibes here and focus on making the good ones lol good luck", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1611960175, "upvotes": 3}, "gla5ho4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l7udwg/advice_for_a_failure/gla5ho4/", "text": "It's totally valid to feel anxious after making mistakes.  We all screw up, so we've all been there at some point.  I've been there plenty of times myself...if it makes you feel any better, I'm pretty sure I set some sort of record by getting a 2% on a quiz in an upper level chem class, but I still got through it, graduated, and moved on to grad school.  The best advice I can give is to take break and do some kind of positive self-care like a hot shower, curling up with a good book, or a good meal, then go back and try to plan out how you want to study for your exams with fresh eyes.  \n\nHang in there!", "author": "LadyWolfshadow", "created": 1611950350, "upvotes": 7}, "gl9igat": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l7udwg/advice_for_a_failure/gl9igat/", "text": "I know how you feel.
