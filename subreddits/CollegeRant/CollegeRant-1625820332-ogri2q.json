  "text": "I am in a STEM field and I took a short break between my BS and my MS. My BS was very cut and dry. My masters feels uncomfortably personal. I\u2019m having to submit assignments where I describe times in my life where I felt outcasted, or hardships that I have overcome. My life has not been easy, and I don\u2019t like bringing up memories that cause pain. Despite weather I am truthful in my response or not, the questions bring forward traumatic memories. I think the prompts are too personal, and my professors are not entitled to hearing my story.",

They also feel like it's inappropriate to have students write about deeply personal things and they just make shit up. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI'd advise you to do the same, just make sure you don't cross a line, like claiming sexual abuse, miscarriage, loss of a child, etc. Just keep it bland-ish and focus on making sure the story demonstrates how \"you\" learned from that situation (like learning how to get along with crabby people thanks to a horrible boss in a job you couldn't quit, for example) and you'll be fine.",
