My BS was very cut and dry. My masters feels uncomfortably personal. I\u2019m having to submit assignments where I describe times in my life where I felt outcasted, or hardships that I have overcome. My life has not been easy, and I don\u2019t like bringing up memories that cause pain. Despite weather I am truthful in my response or not, the questions bring forward traumatic memories. I think the prompts are too personal, and my professors are not entitled to hearing my story.", "author": "Entire-Leader-7080", "created": 1625820332, "retrieved": 1632841794, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 174, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h4kl2d7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ogri2q/assignments_are_getting_too_personal/h4kl2d7/", "text": "Thank you u/Entire-Leader-7080 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
