College has not been the best experience for me. I don\u2019t have any real college friends. I was in an awful organization my first two years of college. I haven\u2019t had the best experiences with another organization I was involved in. I don\u2019t even fit in with students in this other organization I\u2019m only involved in because of scholarships. I don\u2019t connect with college students. I don\u2019t see the full value of a college education. College feels like a waste of time for me. \n\nFor the last year, I\u2019ve been so unmotivated in my school work. I still feel unmotivated. I don\u2019t know why exactly. Part of it is probably covid related. Another part of it is possibly because of anxiety/depression.\n\nI feel like I connect more with older people who aren\u2019t in college for whatever reason. I would like to have college friends, but it seems that no one wants to hang with me. No one makes any effort to want to be with me.\n\nI got a lot more on my mind, but I don\u2019t even know what else to say.\n\nTL;DR - I\u2019m starting my fourth year of college, and I\u2019m dreading it because I\u2019m not enjoying college life. I feel like I don\u2019t belong in college because I don\u2019t connect with college students along with possibly anxiety/depression.", "author": "robertbchatham", "created": 1628574018, "retrieved": 1632949126, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h8fy12i": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p1j1eh/im_done_with_college_life/h8fy12i/", "text": "Same, just trying to finish my degree now.

I struggled a lot with my mental health every year, as a result I lost the motivation to go to clubs, join organizations, meet friends, or even study. It\u2019s really hard, I know. \n\nIf your school offers counseling, I\u2019d suggest starting there. My school didn\u2019t have the best services as they\u2019re a smaller, private school, but they had people I could talk to when I needed it. There\u2019s no harm in just checking it out.\n\nI just wanna say, I\u2019m proud of you for getting this far. You\u2019re in your fourth year already! That\u2019s an accomplishment in and of itself, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I wish you all the best, I\u2019m sorry if my words don\u2019t help too much/or sound cliche. I really relate to what you\u2019re saying and it would definitely help for you to open up to someone like a counselor or family member, or trusted friend.", "author": "liminal_fangs", "created": 1628619864, "upvotes": 6}, "h8dw1ab": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p1j1eh/im_done_with_college_life/h8dw1ab/", "text": "I can\u2019t help you with this cuz I\u2019m going through the same shit.
