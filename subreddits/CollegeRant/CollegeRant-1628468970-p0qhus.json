Yeah, it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s a freshman class. Was going to try to start on it today, but guess what, of course Word doesn\u2019t work and says my account isn\u2019t activated. Guess I have to email about that tomorrow along with all of the other shit I have to do. Felt like depressed shit all day (the whole summer, really) and the one time I try to do something to make things easier for myself, (get an early start on an easy assignment) of course it doesn\u2019t work out. Lmao whatever, probably not going to do it when this class should have been the easiest fucking A, but of course my shitty problems get in the way.
