It's such a waste of time and resources. This isn't a lottery, many non-top colleges have reasonable admissions rates. Quality over quantity is better.\n\nPeople are supposed to narrow the college search to colleges they would actually attend. You can estimate the financial aid/ scholarships beforehand. You can visit the schools. There's a ton of information online. This tells me the student probably applied to a bunch of \"safety\" schools, the schools with high admit rates and easy applications. The most admirable thing in this scenario is the dedication it takes to complete these. I think literally any average student could achieve this feat with there being 4000+ colleges in the US. \n\nTL:DR Come across too many articles boasting the number of acceptances people get instead of like actual goals or competitiveness of programs", "author": "odgoodli", "created": 1611760435, "retrieved": 1632950219, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 296, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gldtgnm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l66i3x/youre_not_a_genius_for_getting_accepted_to_like_a/gldtgnm/", "text": "I applied to one school I knew I was going to unless something crazy happened and a handful that offered free applications as a backup", "author": "computing-depressed", "created": 1612026195, "upvotes": 1}, "gl2vdsn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l66i3x/youre_not_a_genius_for_getting_accepted_to_like_a/gl2vdsn/", "text": "I will say some schools sent me preferred applications that waived the application fee and I did those", "author": "nickthatknack", "created": 1611837000, "upvotes": 1}, "gl27q2e": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l66i3x/youre_not_a_genius_for_getting_accepted_to_like_a/gl27q2e/", "text": "I applied and got accepted to a bunch only because they were on common app and free.
