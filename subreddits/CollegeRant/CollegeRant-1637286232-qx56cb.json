  "text": "So apparently my school cancels Tuesday classes thanksgiving week and does a Thursday schedule instead. I didn\u2019t know this and purchased tickets home because I don\u2019t have Tuesday classes. One of my profs just said to not feel well that day",

          "text": "I think she means that on Tuesday they\u2019re going to follow Thursday\u2019s classes instead. She\u2019s not having classes ON thanksgiving, instead her university is holding Thursday classes ON Tuesday. I agree it still makes no sense. My school actually does it too for Monday holidays. That Wednesday, we have Monday\u2019s classes instead of Wednesday\u2019s. It\u2019s confusing and stupid since it could mess with people\u2019s work schedules!!",
