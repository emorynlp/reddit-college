  "text": "Seriously. The workload has been insane this semester, and the online class procrastination is *real.* Don\u2019t even get me started with seasonal depression kicking in.. \nAnybody else lacking motivation to the point where you save everything for the very last minute? I feel like I\u2019m playing a nonstop game of catching up but this has become the norm for me. Contrarily, ever since the switch to online classes, my grades are better than they have ever been. \n\nTime for another study marathon... \n\nTL;DR: Motivation has been nonexistent since the switch to online classes and I\u2019ve become really good at cramming everything in at the last possible minute, while still somehow maintaining good grades",

      "text": "Fucking hell, I felt every word you wrote. I guess that\u2019s what it is; I\u2019ve had no motivation whatsoever since midterms. I\u2019ve literally left the studying for some really important exams for the last minute\u2014like turning them in 20 minutes before the due date. \n\nI can\u2019t get over how insane the workload is now. I have both in person and online classes, and the online sections add so much more work. My math class has 8 exams this semester.. 8.. each one worth 100 points, plus the final and the midterm, so 10 total. How do you even justify that as a professor? And I\u2019m somehow supposed to find the motivation to do it. Fuck all of it. \n\nAlso, yeah, my grades are weirdly spectacular in online classes. I\u2019ve become a pro at cramming.",
