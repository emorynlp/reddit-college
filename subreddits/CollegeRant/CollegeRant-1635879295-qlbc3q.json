  "text": "Seriously. The workload has been insane this semester, and the online class procrastination is *real.* Don\u2019t even get me started with seasonal depression kicking in.. \nAnybody else lacking motivation to the point where you save everything for the very last minute? I feel like I\u2019m playing a nonstop game of catching up but this has become the norm for me. Contrarily, ever since the switch to online classes, my grades are better than they have ever been. \n\nTime for another study marathon... \n\nTL;DR: Motivation has been nonexistent since the switch to online classes and I\u2019ve become really good at cramming everything in at the last possible minute, while still somehow maintaining good grades",
