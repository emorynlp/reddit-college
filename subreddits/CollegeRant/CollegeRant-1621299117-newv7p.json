If you have good vibes to spare, I'll take 'em.", "text": "I'm less than a month from turning 30. I have various mental health issues. I'm a high school dropout, two-time college dropout, saved from being a full-on NEET because I'm still in school. My grades are all the bad letters. I've never had a clear direction for college, a career, my skills, my development as a person, life in general, nothing. It's been that way since the day I became a legal adult. I have joke answers for the \"where do you see yourself in five/ten years\" question because I don't have any real ones.\n\nRecently, a relative tipped me off about studying library science. I worked as a library volunteer for a short time many years ago and loved it. I'd never considered it as a career even though so many things about it were an ideal work situation for me.\n\nThere is a library tech certification program at my community college. It's the only time I've felt there is a real direction for my education. For something about college to feel *right* like this is an alien experience.\n\nI've never had a single academic achievement to my name and I don't think I can do this one either. Every stab at something new feels like a parody of the last time I tried, got overwhelmed, and failed. But I will still try. Unlike everything else, this feels like the right thing to do.\n\nTL;DR Old millennial faildaughter is going to pursue library science. I've never been able to do anything and I'm afraid this will be another failure.
