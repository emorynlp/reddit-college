      "text": "When I was in my general physics class I had a professor who would teach us 1+1 and call that the \"foundations\" and then give us J/K on the exam. \n\nThe class was really difficult because he would provide us questions to solve in the lecture but then during the exam we would have extra or missing variables that we were never taught so I never got a good grade no matter how hard I tried. \n\nOne time a student went to the professor crying because she wanted to at least know what she did wrong so she can improve. The profressor got uncomfortable and didn't give her any feedback. Instead he changed her grade from a 20something to a 90. Woman got pissed off because it wasn't right for him to do that and it wasn't fair to the class. She reported him to the dean of students.\n\nThe dean didn't really do much but after that I heard the professor made the class tolerable the next semester. Im glad because he was the only professor for physics 2 and that is probably why he got away with the crap he did. Literally it was a community college class and my transfer advisor at the time said is easier at the local university than our community college.\n\nI never took physics 2 but I substituted it for organic chemistry 2 and lab so I lucked out. Its sad how my orgo class is easier than taking physics",

      "text": "On the back end of things, based on the stories I\u2019ve heard, most complaints fizzle out as there either isn\u2019t enough of an issue to warrant intervention or the complaint itself is just bogus. It\u2019s usually someone who didn\u2019t read the syllabus, never came to class, etc. or someone who doesn\u2019t think the rules should apply to them. There have, though, been legitimate complaints, but the most I\u2019ve ever known to happen is some kind of \u201cmandatory\u201d training.\n\nThe most interesting one I know about was when a colleague of mine wouldn\u2019t accept a late paper (it had been assigned for weeks; they knew about it well in advance and had even been given extra time to work on it, I believe). The student went to the Dean of Students Office (not really sure why as they have nothing to do with Academic Affairs), and one of the associate deans in that office called our chair and said \u201cWe need to discuss one of your faculty members\u2019 behavior in the classroom.\u201d The student apparently lied and said she was not given the resources to do the assignment. When pressed, she said the link wasn\u2019t available for turning in the paper. It wouldn\u2019t be when you tried doing it late!\n\nThe chair told the associate dean that since the student didn\u2019t speak to my colleague first about the issue, she wasn\u2019t going to talk to her, at which point the associate dean hung up on her. Then, the student then tried to retaliate by reporting my colleague to another random office for something asinine (it didn\u2019t go anywhere). At that point, she finally quit throwing a fit, but geez...it\u2019s people like that that tend to ruin the process for any legitimate complaints that are made.",

You can't get rid of someone if there is no replacement available. And tenured profs are untouchable. At best, you can give a strongly worded suggestion, and that can be ignored with little consequence.\n\nAn unhappy student will go away in a year.

      "text": "I\u2019ve got two that ended differently.\n\nI reported what can only be described as retaliation from an athletic coach for when I anonymously reported concerns for covid on my campus (system was through the school and not the athletic department). Coach started a witch hunt in the team to find out who it was. They were about to blame some other person so I fessed up, tried talking to the coach with two other athletic staff members, and they just tore into me telling me I\u2019d get the entire department shut down for going outside of it, school was trying to dismantle athletics, etc etc. \n\nReported it with a professor I trusted and nothing happened. However, considering this coach has said/done egregious things before, my complaint is another piece of that paper trail to hopefully help some poor soul later. I ended up quitting the team in the end.\n\nSecond one happened with a professor. People have complained about her before but nothing was ever done. However, because there was already a paper trail and professionally-worded emails from students (as well as criticism in course evaluations that held water), she was one foot out the door. A few classmates and I helped each other word our complaint emails about assignments that did not pertain to the class being mandatory (she had us research space/astronomy phenomenon in a creative non fiction class and present on them?), as well as her feedback that was essentially her preaching her religion (evangelical, and her comments to mostly LGBTQ students made this clear that she did not agree with their \u2018lifestyles\u2019 and should consider praying to Jesus). \n\nOnce the semester was over, we realized that our collaboration was the final nail in the coffin. She was allowed to teach for the spring semester to finish out her year, then she was not renewed. Kind enough lady, but was not doing her job and was alienating students in the process. \n\nMy advice is always report it and join that paper trail. Whether you\u2019re the first one brave enough to say anything and start that trail( and, from experience, it feels empowering to at least speak up), or you\u2019re the final report that gives them the boot, do it. Professionally, of course, otherwise nobody will take you seriously. Good luck, everyone!",

      "text": "Lmao alright I\u2019m going to type this one out on my pc later : in short - not worth it\n\nAlright so\n\nBack in my second to last semester of college, we had this kind of \"young entrepreneurs\" type of group assignment. You could start your own start-up, with the prerequisite that it should work, (financially and physically, like a product of sorts) Alright I thought, nice opportunity!. Oh dear child was I wrong.\n\nI was assigned leader of this group of 6 people, and we got 2 extra people from \"business administration\" to \"help\" us with the finance part. Now I won't say what my project was, but it had something to do with recovering lost energy in a thermal application. I'll be honest with you guys, the project/product itself was a nightmare. We only got 20 minutes, no joke, to come up with this \"project\" and finalize our ideas in those 20 minutes, I mean you had to choose that day/hour/moment. Dead giveaway but alright.\n\nAs the project progressed throughout the semester, I got kinda scared that it wouldn't work and I asked my teacher, who I had some words with in the past, but never was I bad mannered or did was I rude.\"hey man, what if it doesn't work, like it's too theoretical?\" \"it should work mr potatosalads133, no excuses\". I asked if I could change the course/project in itself, no dice. Shit I thought. I went to see my stepdad who is an engineer and I asked him \"hey man, could you just take a look at it, I'm afraid it's shit.\"\n\nHe looked at the project, spend like 3 days of his own vacation time to run some sort of simulation/mathematic calculation, well well it was shit! In theory it would work, but not in the real world, well lesson learned I thought.\n\nI ask the prof at the 3rd to last course day, \"hey man, it won't work, does it matter\" his exact words: \"just finish the project\".\n\nThe day comes that we as a group, but individually have to present the project in front of a jury/all fucking engineers, and what would you know! They didn't buy it. I was told beforehand to 100% to lie, and be confident in our project.\n\nWell the results come in and I have like a 3/20 on the final/score.\nThe prof comes back to me with a fucking different opinion and says to me \"well you should have accepted it didn't work and be honest\". I said that's not what you said throughout the project !!!!\" No answer back.\n\u00a0I didn't buy that. I wrote up everything, wrote like a whole report with 40 pages, like written text and statements from other peers who said the same thing I said, the project should work and if it didn't you should just lie about it.\n\nI forward this to the head of my board and he flips his shit. Ombudsman and all that, in the end I had to testify in front of like a literal lawyer of the school and he said in the beginning quite ironically \"this student has written a report that would rule everything prof x has said invalid, but you have to understand potatosalad133 that if you do this, it will take a while for you to get your answer/\"right way\" so to speak.\n\nI just took the L and said fuck it I will retake the entire project on my own. I submitted something sooooo obviously plain and ordinary, purely out of spite. I got a 10/20 and moved on. But let this be a lesson to everyone out there, if the \"rules\" aren't written in blood/ink, whatever, then those rules don't exist.\n\nI would have cost a lot of money to go to trial, and in the end I had to keep my head low and avoid colliding with the whole department. Fuck that course and fuck you prof",

      "text": "At the college I transferred from, there was a very old and very African biology professor.  I only mention his African origin because with his soft voice from age and thick accent, it was impossible to know what he was saying if you did not sit in the front row.  Since this is an after story and not a why I\u2019ll sum it up as a combination of grading assignments unfairly, age, and unfortunately depression from the death of his wife was our reason for complaint to the Dean. \n\nBehind the scenes he was told he would no longer teach the class, but he did not seem to understand that.  For one week his class was cancelled for rescheduling so the Monday section had no class, but Wednesday section was not told this and showed up to the room where he was there waiting.  He proceded to do his usual thing, but a colleague of his who knew of the situation passed by noticed him \u201cteaching\u201d and quietly escorted from his room.  I commend that professor, he didn\u2019t make a big scene and was very gentle.  We were told we could leave, the 10 of us were confused since \u201cclass\u201d had just started.  We found out later through emails we had a new professor who would teach the class and after that restructuring week had class and lab as normal, but at least understanding this time.  Since we were half way through the semester, we were exempt from a final and grades were counted from the week the new professor took over.  \n\nOverall, good response from the university (rare, right?) they were slow to act to begin with, but handled it nicely.   I know that professor is still there, but no longer teaches but still has a lab and continues his research.  Poor fellow, I wish the best to him.",

Long story short, these group members were being super rude and disrespectful, shooting down my ideas, interrupting me, calling me incompetent, and threatening to kick me out of their group because they felt I wasn't of an adequate intellect. I had never tried so hard to contribute in my life to be met with so much resistance and blatant disrespect.\n\nI didn't typically complain when issues arose, especially in group work, because we are told to fix those issues among ourselves. I decided this time that my group's behavior was an active detriment to my education, and it needed to be addressed. I reached out to my professor and he told me that being a woman in any workplace would require me to endure situations like this and not be surprised when men act this way and face no consequences. He also said I should be more mindful of my attitude and avoid \"bitchy tendencies\" (his words, verbatim). I didn't even bring gender into the conversation, he did. I didn't feel it was relevant at the time.\n\nI was shocked. Now I felt that my grade was in danger since I expressed my concerns. I wouldn't have taken it further up the chain if it weren't for this interaction. So, I decided to contact Title IX. I took note of everything the group members and professor said to me, and I sent it over to the coordinator, asking her if this was even a relevant case for this office. She quickly assured me it was and called me in for a meeting just hours after contacting her. After discussing the issues in detail, she seemed to understand and support my frustration, and said she would talk to the professor immediately.\n\nIt ended up being a supreme waste of time. She knew the professor personally and dismissed my entire case after speaking to him. She said I should have communicated more effectively with my group members, and because I didn't do my part, there was nothing she could do. She didn't show me any evidence that I hadn't communicated and refused me any detail about her conversation with the professor. \n\nBack to square one it was, and I went back to my professor to make sure my grade was passing for the semester. Luckily, it was. So that part was okay, but the situation wasn't resolved. Those guys left feeling like what they did to me was right. After the fact, one of them sent me a very long, rude email saying that I needed to \"improve myself professionally and probably personally\" or I would never land a job in the real professional world.\n\nSo, I swore I'd never report anything ever again. That really sucked. I hope other students have fared better.",
