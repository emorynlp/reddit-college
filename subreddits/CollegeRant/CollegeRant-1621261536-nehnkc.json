I had no intentions on doing an update, but now that I have my final grade, I thought    it'd be nice lol. \n\nFor those that didn't see the original post, I basically posted how I hated my major (Chem major) and how I was failing Organic Chem II and didn't want to fail because I needed a break. If you want to read the original post I'll like link it or something. \n\nAnways, apparently I wrote that post a month ago, but it felt way longer. When I wrote that post, I had just failed my 2nd exam and in order to pass the class I needed to pass the next exam with at minimum a 70 and pass the final exam with a high 70 (the final exam replaced the lowest exam) I thought I could do it, so I studied for the next exam and ended up getting a 50 something? It felt like everytime I studied for the exam I just ended up doing worse than when I didn't. \n\nSo yeah, I ended up failing that exam and like two more quizzes. I didn't give up though and I refused to withdraw, so I kept going. Now at this point, there's only the final left and I had to make a high 70 in order to pass. It felt beyond impossible honestly. The exam covered everything from orgo I and orgo II. I barely passed orgo I, so of course I don't really remember anything from it. So I tried my best to relearn everything from both semesters for the remaining 2 weeks I had left until the exam. It was the most stressful and miserable two weeks of my life, but in the end I happily passed with a C!\n\nAt the time I wrote that post I'm sure I thought I wouldn't pass. I kept trying my best though and praying that I would succeed in the end and here I am! This is truly the happiest I've been in a long time. \n\nAnyways, I still hate my major and there is no changing that lol. On the bright side, next school year is my last year and I very excited to be finished with college! \n\n(Btw, for anyone that's failing any class and you feel like you won't be able to pass.... keep going! Don't give up and don't let those negative thoughts get to you! You can do this!)", "author": "Svlee00", "created": 1621261536, "retrieved": 1632842372, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyg5bgt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nehnkc/orgo_ii_rant_i_hate_my_major/gyg5bgt/", "text": "Thank you u/Svlee00 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
