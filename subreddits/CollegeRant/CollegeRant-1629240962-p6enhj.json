I\u2019d pick staying on campus and wearing masks indoors any day over having to stay in my house, especially because I have an unhealthy home life. Not to mention that before Delta, most schools opened up for vaccinated people not to wear masks anymore (and reinstated full class sizes), and once people get a booster shot to protect from Delta the same rules will go back into play.

I am happy I got some classes in person in the beginning, it\u2019s a 5 year endeavor for me. For the past 5 semesters, 2 summers included, it\u2019s been online for me. Sounds depressing but eventually you just get used to it. Or you don\u2019t & you drop out. But I did get used to it. Thing I\u2019m most upset about is colleges not making up their damn mind. \n\nIf it\u2019s all online cool, lmk. Nothing would have changed. If it\u2019s in person, cool, glad to be back in reality. But what I\u2019m getting from my university is like \u201c we might??? Be in person. We don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s like come on lol. Make a decision. People are moving across states & borders and spending stupid money on your hunch. I understand there\u2019s limitations because of covid & we\u2019re trying to get back to normal. But man, it\u2019s frustrating as a student to be going through this. I\u2019ve already been in person, online live lecture, and asynchronous through all of this. I seriously do not care.
