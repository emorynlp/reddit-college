  "text": " \n\nI don't really have much to say, it's just my own personal opinion/rant about how I feel. College just feels like it's a huge fucking scam and majority of the time it just feels like a sick way to get impressionable late teens/early adults to forever pull money out of their asses because they didn't have the money when they were working dead-end minimum wage jobs. It's ridiculous how much you waste in college for like fucking four useless classes you don't need that isn't going to help you with your majors. There's only like 1-2 classes for your major while the rest are just fillers and they'll preach that it's mandatory. If I wanted to take a class for culture, I would take a class for culture. And don't even get me started on the BS prices new books cost. It's batshit insane that they're around 130$ while the rented ones are for 110$. Even more BS when you're already paying for a class but then you gotta fucking pay for that class again because it's on a website that will only let you use it if you pay. I had to pay for a website and the lowest price was 70$ and that was just to use it for that one semester. I have another class and it's on one website and I have to take that class like 3-4 times and pay to use it every time my subscription ends. I'm starting to really regret going to college.",

Just do my work, no worries that I\u2019m gonna be dropped from my major or can\u2019t get into a class because there are 50000 students at my school or can\u2019t pay for a textbook.

      "text": "I\u2019m an English instructor at college and I feel the same way about the books and software packages. I just want to be able to teach my subject in the way I want to teach it, but book companies and textbook distributors figured out a long time ago they were being shoved out by Amazon and they fought back HARD. \n\nI need the textbook I teach from because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to be a college professor and writing your own textbooks or using open source ones, when all of those texts should still have a knowledge debt to the sources that informed them. The legal requirements on the textbook publishers make them cite their sources quite well, and they honestly put together English texts better than I would ever think to with a team of one, so the book itself is indispensable. So, I can\u2019t neglect to include the book. That\u2019s a necessity. Do I want to charge a ridiculous price for it? No. But I don\u2019t think students who are only planning on taking their English core classes should have to pay 130 dollars for a book. When I look at the book my students use, I think that book should be worth about 40 to 50 bucks, and has as least that much knowledge in it. However, the textbook companies get around that now by charging a ridiculous price for a paper copy, a reduced price for a digital copy that can be used once, and a software pack that only comes with a new copy that is required for all the homework (and at my institution, I have no option to not include that extra work...I\u2019ve asked).\n\nBut yeah, the textbook companies got tired about people using Amazon to buy used books, so they just started using ebooks. One time access. Software packages with all the problems and answers that they\u2019ve spent a ton of money developing for each textbook, one-time use codes with expirations, deals with colleges for book discounts as long as so many classes teach the same book, etc etc. And the instructors? We basically have no say in this. Some of us do, but not the vast majority.\n\nNow, I disagree with your assessment of a class like mine, composition or literature, or other classes like history, algebra, sociology, etc not being necessary. A lot of what people think college is supposed to be is not what college is supposed to be. It\u2019s not supposed to be a funnel to a specific job that only offers off-the-job training. It\u2019s supposed to be a place where students come and voluntary gain a broad scope of in-depth knowledge in various subjects that will serve any type of job or career path you choose within an area. Unfortunately, a lot of people have come to feel like higher education shouldn\u2019t be \u201chigher\u201d at all, but rather \u201cfurther\u201d, just offering additional, specialized education in a field like computer sciences or business. Honestly, I think that misses the point of education. I think if you want to just take classes that deal specifically with a particular area that is completely focused on learning a skill that will bring you money, go learn A/C repair at a community college or something. You\u2019ll end up making more than I do and you won\u2019t have to hear about \u201cculture\u201d. But the education itself is meant to be a bit higher. It\u2019s a lot of classes that deal with \u201cwhy\u201d rather than \u201cwhat\u201d, looking at the inner workings of things and talking about them, figuring out how to dig deeper and access more truth. And those skills help, just not in as direct a way. Wax on, wax off, you know?\n\nBut, I\u2019ll definitely agree with you on the books and websites. But blame the textbook companies. We don\u2019t want to charge that much as instructors, we receive no cut of it, and the software packages are often forced on us by the college who got some deal from the publisher for cheaper books if we do so, and then we have to use a product we don\u2019t even want and it isn\u2019t optional. We just want to teach.",

          "text": "If you think college isn't meant to funnel you into a career, then you necessarily misunderstand the needs of the majority of college students. If your university's student population is heavy in students from wealthy families, then perhaps many of the students can branch beyond the \"oh god just let me graduate and get a job so i can survive in this economy\" (this is US-centric here, idk abt other countries), but for the majority of us (in the US)? College is just a way to force us into debt so we can be wage slaves at our potentially higher paying jobs, which we want so that we can attempt to raise our quality of life while usually avoiding manual labor.\n\nEducation is for jobs. We go into debt in college so that we can hopefully eat later.\n\nAlso, I'm personally not against global/social/all these \"unnecessary\" courses, though I do think that they should be \"recommended\" rather than necessary unless they're a realistic \"oh yeah this makes a fuckton of sense\" prerequisite for a course in one's major. I benefitted highly from my course in critical race theory, and I can imagine lots of people would benefit from courses in language, especially those going into STEM given all of the reporting on everything involved. I'm incredibly glad for my speech course, and I'm in Computer Science and focusing on bioinformatics, molecular biology, and statistics (language arts and social sciences nerd here, actually, haha).\n\nMy point is, though, that even though there are people who have the money that gaining the benefits of these other courses (or even minoring or majoring in these subjects, which can be very useful for a lot of careers or side gigs and all sorts of things--again, language arts nerd, disability advocate who used to consider law, and as a child wanted to be a novelist but now would rather publish free things online) wouldn't negatively impact them even if it's part of the reason 4-year universities often consist of 4+ year semesters (let's face it, lots of programs now cause many students to take 4+ years, even without course failing or major switching which are both 1000% valid), lots of students just need to get in and get out.\n\nAnd of course thematic sequences, \"hey you won't be able to pass this unless you've gained x y z skills from this other course\" would also change timing. But having the time from what courses might otherwise not be as worthwhile for a given student be freed might allow more time for a student who needs the money immediately to work or intern or get involved in research.\n\nAcademia and education can't be thought of as the same anymore; (at least in the US) we can't afford to think of them the same way.",

              "text": "I've spent every semester possible, including summer, as a full time student. Without failing, it will take me 4\u00bd-5 years for what is a 4 year degree in early childhood. I graduated with my AAT from a 2 year school which was thankfully covered for the most part by our state's scholarship program. However, I will say that during those 2 years, I found it really hard to believe that I needed a full on, in depth class on physics taught by someone who once worked for NASA for my degree. I do understand that I need knowledge in all subject areas as I am going to be a teacher. \n\nI transferred over to a private university after receiving my AAT when I was told that I would have to take even more gen eds. The reason being was because they're a private school. So here I am, finally finished with all my gen eds (including old and new testament classes because I transferred to a religious uni) in my 3-3\u00bd years of higher education. There were other classes the transferred school required me to do because it was their policy which had nothing to do with my degree or they were classes that we're similar to ones I've already taken. I've even been questioned by instructors as to why I'm taking their class when I'm already knowledgeable about the topic. \n\nAt this point, I just wanna be done. I want out. I have one semester left of classes and will student teach in the fall. By no means do I consider myself a know it all as I still have a lot to learn. For teaching, all that learning comes from the hands on experience in a classroom. I've been subbing for two years and prior to that, I did 2\u00bd years in child care with ages 2-12. At this point, I'm over the textbooks and the 3 hour classes. Stick me in a classroom with students, give me feedback, and allow me to learn.",

              "text": "I just have trouble doing that. Since such a huge portion of my class and a lot of the purpose is to figure out how to identify fake news and assess credibility, it feels false for me to throw together a bunch of materials that I\u2019ve hand selected rather than give them a selection from a larger selection of other materials that have cited their research throughly and in a well-designed way. If I make my own materials, I give the illusion that the way I am teaching the class isn\u2019t one option of many approaches to English Comp and Lit ideology, but the only option and the preferred ideology. Basically, I prefer for them to see it as I am approaching Skyrim as a mage in a world full of random quest options I can choose between, deciding how I play, rather than like a linear game like a Half-Life game that forces the player to believe there\u2019s only one path to take. Sorry if the game metaphor doesn\u2019t work for you. I have more of you tell me what kind of metaphors work best for you.",
