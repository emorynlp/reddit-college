College just feels like it's a huge fucking scam and majority of the time it just feels like a sick way to get impressionable late teens/early adults to forever pull money out of their asses because they didn't have the money when they were working dead-end minimum wage jobs. It's ridiculous how much you waste in college for like fucking four useless classes you don't need that isn't going to help you with your majors. There's only like 1-2 classes for your major while the rest are just fillers and they'll preach that it's mandatory. If I wanted to take a class for culture, I would take a class for culture. And don't even get me started on the BS prices new books cost. It's batshit insane that they're around 130$ while the rented ones are for 110$. Even more BS when you're already paying for a class but then you gotta fucking pay for that class again because it's on a website that will only let you use it if you pay. I had to pay for a website and the lowest price was 70$ and that was just to use it for that one semester. I have another class and it's on one website and I have to take that class like 3-4 times and pay to use it every time my subscription ends.

I just want to be able to teach my subject in the way I want to teach it, but book companies and textbook distributors figured out a long time ago they were being shoved out by Amazon and they fought back HARD. \n\nI need the textbook I teach from because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to be a college professor and writing your own textbooks or using open source ones, when all of those texts should still have a knowledge debt to the sources that informed them. The legal requirements on the textbook publishers make them cite their sources quite well, and they honestly put together English texts better than I would ever think to with a team of one, so the book itself is indispensable. So, I can\u2019t neglect to include the book. That\u2019s a necessity. Do I want to charge a ridiculous price for it? No. But I don\u2019t think students who are only planning on taking their English core classes should have to pay 130 dollars for a book. When I look at the book my students use, I think that book should be worth about 40 to 50 bucks, and has as least that much knowledge in it. However, the textbook companies get around that now by charging a ridiculous price for a paper copy, a reduced price for a digital copy that can be used once, and a software pack that only comes with a new copy that is required for all the homework (and at my institution, I have no option to not include that extra work...I\u2019ve asked).\n\nBut yeah, the textbook companies got tired about people using Amazon to buy used books, so they just started using ebooks. One time access. Software packages with all the problems and answers that they\u2019ve spent a ton of money developing for each textbook, one-time use codes with expirations, deals with colleges for book discounts as long as so many classes teach the same book, etc etc. And the instructors? We basically have no say in this. Some of us do, but not the vast majority.\n\nNow, I disagree with your assessment of a class like mine, composition or literature, or other classes like history, algebra, sociology, etc not being necessary. A lot of what people think college is supposed to be is not what college is supposed to be. It\u2019s not supposed to be a funnel to a specific job that only offers off-the-job training. It\u2019s supposed to be a place where students come and voluntary gain a broad scope of in-depth knowledge in various subjects that will serve any type of job or career path you choose within an area. Unfortunately, a lot of people have come to feel like higher education shouldn\u2019t be \u201chigher\u201d at all, but rather \u201cfurther\u201d, just offering additional, specialized education in a field like computer sciences or business. Honestly, I think that misses the point of education. I think if you want to just take classes that deal specifically with a particular area that is completely focused on learning a skill that will bring you money, go learn A/C repair at a community college or something. You\u2019ll end up making more than I do and you won\u2019t have to hear about \u201cculture\u201d. But the education itself is meant to be a bit higher. It\u2019s a lot of classes that deal with \u201cwhy\u201d rather than \u201cwhat\u201d, looking at the inner workings of things and talking about them, figuring out how to dig deeper and access more truth. And those skills help, just not in as direct a way. Wax on, wax off, you know?\n\nBut, I\u2019ll definitely agree with you on the books and websites. But blame the textbook companies. We don\u2019t want to charge that much as instructors, we receive no cut of it, and the software packages are often forced on us by the college who got some deal from the publisher for cheaper books if we do so, and then we have to use a product we don\u2019t even want and it isn\u2019t optional.
