Forcing me to sit in a class that I couldn't give any less shits about listening to a monotone professor read off of some powerpoint slides. When I was online I could skip, or minimize the zoom or do some other more productive shit. Now it's in-person and I have to sit in the class and pretend like a little goody-two shoes that I give a shit when I don't. Have to spend money to commute and on top of all that shit, you got the pandemic. Great. Fucking great. Schedule ruined. Everything ruined. I could workout during a online class, now I gotta sit on my ass and stare. I could do homework or do my passion, but no now I gotta sit and stare.
