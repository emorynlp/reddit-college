I ended up failing two of my classes.I feel like a failure .", "text": "I feel upset at my self. I feel like complete garbage. Now this puts me in a situation. \n\nPer my last post on here. \nI had the opportunity to redo a couple of assignments for two of my classes.the one class I had a 67% and I only needed a 70% . My professor allowed me to re turn in part of a project for a higher grade. \nI\u2019m looking to see if she graded it. I email her to double check , she said that again everything was wrong and it wasn\u2019t right. Which frustrates me that I changed everything and listened to  her comments. \n\nNow the one class everyone is telling me to appeal. \nMy one class my professor waited to the last minute to grade everything. Not only that he gives me a 2/100 out of most of the assignments. Like seriously?! He emails me telling me that I can still redo everything. The problem is 2 things. \n1) this particular class is online based and application class that requires a specific software that has a license through the school. Once that license expires it\u2019s kinda done. I email my professor and literally he doesn\u2019t even read my message. Go to help desk online they fix it. I\u2019m still having issues with it . So now I can\u2019t even redo my work \n2) this professor is my advisor. At first he told me to turn in anything and he\u2019ll pass me. Which I didn\u2019t believe because outside of online classes. I KNOW he is a hard grader. So him even telling me that I did not believe it. Now I did all of my work in a timely manner. Still didn\u2019t grade it. He waited til Saturday to grade everything. And fails me still . This is like 20+ assignments. He didn\u2019t even give me a 50/100 A 2/100 . Then his comments weren\u2019t even helpful . Like this is wrong or this isn\u2019t correct. Obviously I know , like what is the issue \ud83d\ude44\n\nNot to sound like a conspiracy therorist but I believe he failed me to prove a point that I should\u2019ve dropped the class. I\u2019m set to graduate next spring and I feel like this holds me back. I have to do a lot of work. I\u2019m nervous because I have to graduate next spring. I feel like complete shit. This isn\u2019t me . This semester was the toughest semester for me.", "author": "shygirlsclub", "created": 1621879667, "retrieved": 1632842322, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"gzarsd4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nk48of/i_couldnt_do_it_i_ended_up_failing_two_of_my/gzarsd4/", "text": "Thank you u/shygirlsclub for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tbh you should be able to appeal, but the system is set up and rigged where they just rather not deal with it. \n\nThis isn't you but rather unprofessional work from people who just got a job. \n\nCollege is a way to filter out non graduates like me haha so they find someone easy to train and teach. The stuff you learn may or may not be useful but what is important is the life lessons and experiences you learned which will help you much more to adapt and overcome obstacles in life.
