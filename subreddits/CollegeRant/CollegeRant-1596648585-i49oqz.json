Why does all of a sudden stating common knowledge make you some sort of genius? I've noticed that a lot of college kids seem to always think they're above their peers because of anything, always trying to look special compared to their peers. What is wrong with these kids? I've had enough of it, it's unbelievably annoying. This kid in my internship constantly has to brag about about where he attends school and how he's the only legal intern. He acts like Andy from The Office. Cool, I didn't know this internship was LinkedIn, but please carry on. It doesn't stop there either, my cousin does this too, thinks she's too good to hear any advice and her Facebook bio literally says 'The only right person is me.' I knew this all existed, but do these kids not get enough attention at home or what?", "author": "NoChannel1", "created": 1596648585, "retrieved": 1632842950, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 119, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g3evb86": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i49oqz/tired_of_the_constant_humble_bragging_among_some/g3evb86/", "text": "At least in my experience when I was a first year, a lot of these kids come from shitty public schools where they were the cream of the crop and then they show up to college thinking that they're literally Einstein or some shit.
