  "text": "I\u2019m a college freshman at a community college, and I though things would be relatively easy for the first part of the first semester. I\u2019m majoring in Bio in order to find a major I can enjoy in the future, and two classes are really throwing me off, Algebra and Chemistry. No matter how much studying I do, I always seem to bomb tests, and I fear I might flunk out. This might be my only chance at a good career or good life, and these two classes might just be the end of it. It feels shameful saying I couldn\u2019t even get past the first semester of college, and I\u2019d hate to be regulated to flipping burgers for the rest of my life. I just don\u2019t know what to do.",

I know, putting pride before your future is silly, but everyone on campus for some reason thinks I\u2019m super smart, and I don\u2019t want people to see me there and joke about me being dumb. I had around a 29 on my ACT, but I\u2019m now kind of thinking it might of been a fluke.",

      "text": "Hi OP! I\u2019m a Bio major in my 3rd year at uni. My classmates/friends always told me I\u2019m smart one. I would always be at the math lab getting help for cal or in the tutoring center for o Chem. No one will think anything less of you for it. I\u2019m sure if you aren\u2019t getting it they aren\u2019t either. Go to office hours. You are in college to learn and learning isn\u2019t always linear for everyone.\n\nAlso just as some advice, you can\u2019t study for math and Chem the same way you would history. Practice problems are the best way for Chem and Math. Do as many as you can. Even if you only get part of it right, at least is a part you know. For my math classes and Chem class, most of my professors graded to see if you know the process. Even if the final answer is wrong, it maybe 1 or 2 points but majority of the points are still given if the process is correct. Look at your syllabus see what the objectives are (mostly for Chem) go to that chap in the textbook and see what the obj for the text book is. Focus on those parts. Best of luck! \n\nI took a break from school after graduating because of family issues. I always wanted to go back to school but didn\u2019t until 2017. I did much better this time around. Hang in there you aren\u2019t stupid, just learning :)",

      "text": "A few things here. I started my degree as a Bio major because I didn't know what I wanted. I loved learning about biology and chemistry but kept flunking math and hated the advanced chem classes. I kept pushing and pushing and reaching out for help but I just found I didn't have the passion to develop a drive to do it, ya know? I messed up two quarters and now my GPA is trashed. I switched to an archaeology major and have completely fallen in love with it, though, so my GPA will likely improve, but not above a 3.2 or so. I say all this because I want you to know it's okay to not know exactly what you want. Bio is not the only chance at a good career. It is a very competitive field and if you are not enjoying your coursework and/or you find yourself stressing and freaking out over it, it may be time to find a new major. Speak with your professors and your adviser. I highly recommend career counseling and even therapy, especially to address the negative feelings associated with academic distress. \n\nI'm not saying your case is the same as mine. If you absolutely love bio and want it to be your major, then carry on! Seek out resources and don't be afraid to ask for help. However, again, if you don't enjoy it, don't limit yourself. There are amazing jobs in many fields that will earn you a great life. You want to do something you enjoy, not something that just makes money or \"feels smart\" or something. I got really caught up on feeling like I had to \"prove\" i was intelligent by majoring in a STEM field. You're not stupid. I've learned that I'm not stupid. We all just have different strengths and need to follow our passions. If you don't know what your passion is yet, that's okay. There's always a chance to change back later. Don't get hung up on doing things perfectly or going into the \"right\" field. Make mistakes, learn from them, use your resources, and evaluate what you truly want. If you don't know what you want, let yourself explore and find it. Work on your elective classes and do some self discovery. It's not the end of the world! If possible, take a quarter off as well. It did wonders for me and I feel a lot better. Therapy is helpful even if you feel like you don't need it. You can let off steam, discuss academic goals, and address situations as they arise. Having support is very important, especially in STEM fields. Even in Archaeology, I find that the science bits of it are very stressful. My professors have been amazing support. If they truly love what they teach and see that you're eager, they will help! And if they don't, reach out to student services. \n\nFeel free to chat with me if you're still struggling. I've been there, done that, and, again, you're not stupid. I promise. You just have to find your way and it may take some time, so please don't get discouraged. You can do it! Especially if it's something you love.",
