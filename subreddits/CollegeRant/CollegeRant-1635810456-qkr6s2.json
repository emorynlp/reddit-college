  "text": " I am currently in my first year in a University and I hate it so much. Yeah it is nice to have freedom from your parents but I honestly kind of miss being at home. I may sound spoiled but I miss having privacy, not worrying my roommate is asleep, my own bathroom, and my car!! So, I am considering of transferring back to my home town and going to a community college. If I do so, I'd have access to my car and be able to work as well. But I don't know if I would later regret this in the future. Help or advice?!?!",

      "text": "This choice does have some consequences that you need to weigh. Working while going to community college would likely be cheaper than living on campus. In addition, the support and privacy obtained by being at home is also pretty nice. However, depending on what your degree is and what your goals are for the future, going to a larger college may be the best choice.\n\nFor example, I want to go into engineering, and to do that I need to, at the very least, get a four year degree. Connections will also be important and although I can\u2019t say I love dorm life, I can put up with it for the benefits I\u2019ll (hopefully) get in a few years.\n\nI recommend seeing if the lack of privacy and having to share a bathroom is worth moving from a bigger college to a smaller college at home. Weigh your options and make a decision. Either choice you make, as long as it is informed it is a good decision.",

My community college has this program that is a guaranteed entry into that university with some requirements. So hopefully that plan works out. So i am not really worried about my major, more of if i want to give up the freedom I have and the \u201ccollege experience\u201d Although college really hasn\u2019t been fun, and ofc i do have friends it\u2019s just not the same with those at home",

      "text": "Hey!!! Don't worry you're not alone! I'm a freshman in college as well and I am in the same boat. For me I just ended up choosing one of the worst roommates possible, and now I have no choice but to deal with it for the rest of the semester. I definitely understand where you're coming from but in my opinions I wouldn't let this thing get in the way. There are definitely other options you could consider while staying at the same school. If it is possible contact the residential life office at your school and inquire about switching out to a single dorm? Or if there are an empty dorms that you can move in for the time being. That will at least help with the privacy and roommate aspect. Or if a huge part of it is because of your current roommate then maybe switch out to a different room with a different roommate (like a friend?). That's what I plan on doing! If you ever need to rant feel free to reach out! Hopefully everything works out! :)",

I met my roommate online through social media and we realized we lived pretty close and we decided to room together since we seemed to get along pretty well. She\u2019s a decent roommate, but a part of me wonders if I should have just gone with a random roommate because she is slowly starting to get on my nerves.",
