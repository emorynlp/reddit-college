The thing we have all been using since we were 4. It's teaching us things like \"How to share a Google Doc\" or \"How can you check your email when you are away from your desk?\". It is very clear this was made for Boomers, as the bottom of the pages have input from other teachers, things like \"With Google Drive, I don't have to use a flash drive anymore!\". We are required to get some kind of Google certificate (as though that's necessary to get a job or be a good teacher). I hate doing these assignments because I just get angry. We had a discussion post of Canvas, we were supposed to explain what website a teacher would use to learn how to make a playlist on Youtube. The options were like... a google educator forum or a google help forum or google search. I'm sitting there thinking \"The instructions are right there on Youtube and honestly I haven't met anyone who doesn't know how to do that in my entire life. If they can't figure that out, should they even be teaching?\" The teacher is so sweet, but the only thing I have learned that I didn't know coming in was that Google Fundamentals (the lesson thing we are taking) exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnrelated, but my speech teacher pulled up a table of generational differences and pointed to the millennials and said \"I don't think we have anybody who isn't a millennial. Do we?\" I raised my hand and I said \"All of us.\".

I'm not holier than thou, it hasn't even been a year since I started to work on having this better mindset. But even if you don't read, at least typing it out helps to continue reinforcing it for me.\n\nThese things used to frustrate me a lot too (and still a work in progress) until I started to really look into other people's POVs and project my own POV less.\n\n\"It baffles me how someone could not know this or not care enough to know it!\"\n\nThis applies to ALL of us. Everyone has something that they should be aware of but aren't. And for a long time you might not even know because you won't face a person/issue that makes you realize that about yourself. Or hey, maybe you do, and that's a result of your life experiences and the way your brain is wired that not everyone shares. \n\nMy 21 yo friend asked us what a blowjob is after seeing it mentioned in a TikTok. It wasn't just the terminology that was the issue, he didn't even know that oral existed. A few years ago I would've asked him how he could not know this. Even though sex ed was shit at school, I mean, who doesn't know this right?? But I considered that he grew up (and still lives) in a conservative household where being an only child he was very sheltered. Not even allowed to play video games. Sex was a very shameful topic in his household to the point where he feels guilty and bad about himself at the thought of googling what sex is like. In our social circle if someone made a dirty joke he would express how he feels uncomfortable. So despite the fact that he has the world of sex ed on his phone and has access to talking to people, he's trapped in his mindset. Me and my friend are slowly and slowly trying to show him that this is all okay and normal and he's making slow progress. We have never once gave him the impression that there is something wrong with him for not knowing the bare minimum of sex. \n\nAnd this is applied to strangers too. We never know.\n\nTo realize that what is very important to us or what we _think_ is something everyone should know isn't always, and it can be pretty subjective.\n\nSomeone actually judged me once for using the navigation to get to a restuarant in a nearby city. This guy is someone who goes out every single weekend to explore different cities and he's pretty much memorized the directions of everything that's within a 100 mile radius of us. Good for him. But I don't leave the city often, so it's pretty reasonable that I don't know how to get places. And so, I also don't care to memorize streets outside my city. Is it a good life skill to have? Yeah sure. But is there something wrong with you if you don't have that life skill? No.\n\nMy coworker is a boomer and asked if I've heard a song by a particular singer. I said no and that I don't know who that is. He's like \"wow your generation is very disconnected.\" I asked him if he's heard of Dua Lipa, he said no, and I told him that me and him are no different.\n\nInstead of justifying why I don't know something I try to put it into perspective for the other person. It shuts them down and forces them to think about this.\n\nTo him I was _disconnected_ for not knowing who that reciter is. That's how convinced he was that it's something that should be common knowledge.\n\nAnd we do the same thing. We're the same in many respects. Google drive is so basic to us and necessary in OUR lives that we project this onto others and judge them if this doesn't apply to them. Yeah, even Google lol. My mom used to get all her information from social media, asking friends etc. until I kept bugging and taught her to use Google, and now she uses it. She just never thought it was necessary given that she was getting all the info she needed elsewhere, and she didn't think Google would be much different. But what she learned is that Google provides you with ACCURATE sources and the more she started using it the more she started realizing how much false information she's been fed from her social circles (who also don't use Google lol), whereas before she would believe something just because someone said it. If I hadn't introduced it to her she might've continued life not using Google. Not because she's a socially unaware or \"dumb\" person.\n\n> I haven't met anyone who doesn't know how to do that in my entire life. If they can't figure that out, should they even be teaching?\n\nNot necessarily relevant I hope you can realize. My mom didn't know what google was and she succeeded in teaching me and my brother the Arabic language growing up. I remember in 3rd and 4th grade not a single teacher utilized google or youtube in our classroom. Even in COMPUTER class, the entire year was spent learning how to type without looking, playing games etc. We had a PowerPoint presentation once but all we had to do was write about ourselves and make cool colors and transitions. So yeah, I can see why older people managed to not use google their whole lives. Or even younger ones.\n\nAnd yeah, it's very likely that you have never come across someone who can't do that. If you haven't noticed or studied, this is a biological and psychological phenomena, we tend to surround ourselves with people who are like us. My ENTIRE social circle of people my age is pre-healthcare or pre-psych. We take the same classes, same clubs, and the majority of my coworkers are also students going into healthcare. When I meet friends of friends they fall into the same category. Every once in a while I'll meet a liberal arts person or freelancer, etc. I have no friends that are poor. No friends that are college dropouts. I don't even have any friends that have divorced parents. This is something I like about my job that nothing else can give me; I work in an underserved health clinic so I get better insight into other walks of life and life perspectives.\n\nI have such a limited worldview, and so do you. Once we start realizing this we start to get more empathetic and understanding rather than frustrated.", "author": "__shadowwalker__", "created": 1632204451, "upvotes": 5}, "hdnss56": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps0cip/genz_not_boomers/hdnss56/", "text": "I was ask why you're complaining about the easy credits until I remembered you're paying thousands of dollars to learn stuff you already know that you could teach yourself for completely free even if you didn't\n\nSo you're pretty much being forced to waste your time and money that you could have spent learning something that you don't know that could actually go towards your degree\n\nThere's really no way to sugarcoat that even if the professor is really nice to you :/", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1632184893, "upvotes": 20}, "hdmq2ys": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps0cip/genz_not_boomers/hdmq2ys/", "text": "Damnn.
