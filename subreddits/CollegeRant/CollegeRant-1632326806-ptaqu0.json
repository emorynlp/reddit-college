  "text": "Engineering has a higher drop out rate than most other majors, and it isn\u2019t because engineering students are more lazy. In most schools, the engineering school is separate and student who get in are better than average yet switch majors at a higher rate. Engineering majors literally have to take more classes than any other major. Pretending engineering isn\u2019t harder is just ignorant.",

I assume you wanted to move out because you thought it would be easier to make friends living in the dorms, which probably is true. But you need to spend your time interacting with people in real life. \n\nReddit is like your security blanket or your teddy bear. It\u2019s OK to do a couple of these bullshit spam posts each day but you need to prioritize socializing in the real world. You can and you will make friends if you put in the effort. Did you contact the counseling center about the socialization group? I really think you should.\n\nNow get out there and fucking talk to someone and don\u2019t come back here until you have spoken to five real live people. NOW GO DO IT.",

He\u2019s also confused about changing majors vs. flunking out and calls it all flunking out or dropping out. He has a narrative he\u2019s pushing for some reason. Like \u201cengineering majors literally have to take more classes than any other major\u201d isn\u2019t true if all students need the same number of credits to graduate. It\u2019s just not true!!\n\nHere\u2019s an article with some stats about changing majors - most students do! It\u2019s more normal to change than it is to stick with what you start with at age 18. It\u2019s a few years old but I don\u2019t imagine this years batch of new students is any different than a few years ago. \n\nhttps://borderzine.com/2013/03/college-students-tend-to-change-majors-when-they-find-the-one-they-really-love/",
