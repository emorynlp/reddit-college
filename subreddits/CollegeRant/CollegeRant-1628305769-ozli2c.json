  "text": "What the hell... I failed the class because my final worth 50% of my grade, and I bombed that shit so hard. My GPA that I worked hard for, my admission for my major, and my career, it all went down the toilet.\n\nIf my family ever finds out about this, the consequences are too dire to face for me. This has been one of the worst moments in my college career. I just got out of therapy for my mental health, too and now this event has triggered my suicidal tendencies again which I worked so hard to eliminate. I really don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nEDIT: Hi guys, sorry for ghosting everyone. I fell into a deep depression episode that made me go offline for a while. As it turns out, I ended up with a C in the class instead of an F. I honestly don\u2019t know what happened, but thank you guys so much for your support.",

      "text": "I withdrew from 4 classes within two semesters. This happened because I went through significant trauma and mental illness. Withdrawing or failing a class feels like the world is crashing against you. However, at some point your mental health matters more than a temporary grade. \n\nYour career is not ruined. If I can still get a masters after withdrawing from 4 classes, you can still be successful after failing 1 class. \n\nThroughout college you learn effective study habits for yourself. You\u2019ll get their eventually. Seeing that you posted this on Reddit, we both know you take pride in your work. You can do it.",

I\u2019m college I failed my first class and it also triggered suicidal tendencies because my mom is an intense Hispanic woman. Remember that colleges can\u2019t give out your grades to parents. As long as you keep your scholarships they won\u2019t ever know. If they ask to see your grades, remember you can \u201cinspect element\u201d on your computer and change that grade and your gpa. Also remember that schools offer grade forgiveness so if you take that same class you can replace it in the grade book with the new grade",

      "text": "Hey, I've failed a class fall of 2019 before and so did my best friend I believe in 2018.\n\nIn both circumstances I failed a class in my major and was able to re-take it but my best friend failed a class that was a pre-requisite to the major so she wasnt able to get into a few colleges because it was a pre-req to the program. Heres what happened to both of us, we BOTH made it into our programs. It took my best friend a year longer to get into a program but she made it into one and literally is at the same speed as me.\n\nIts not the end of the world here even though it feels like it is. So I failed a pharmacology class and almost failed my foundations class. It defintively dropped my GPA by a lot. Transfered in with a 3.8, built up a new GPA at my college to a 3.5 and dropped to a 2.8 after the class fail. I would drive home in a mental fog absent minded from all of the anxiety and I can relate to you and empathize regarding it being the worst moments in my college career too.\n\nheres things that I learned that may be helpful to you in your situation\n\n1. GPA's can recover\n2. this will likely cause you some mental trauma as you have stated, please seek out therapy because failing a class is in fact a very traumatic thing.\n3. Dont worry about the speed of your degree or keeping up with others in your program, focus on yourself.\n4. Now that the semester is over with even after the fail, take some time to yourself for mental healing. Go to therapy, focus on healing until your next semester. The stress still lingers with you even after classes are finished.\n5. Learn to forgive yourself and try not to be hard on youself for this. I was and it isnt worth being hard on yourself for it.\n6. This is a minor set back that you can overcome if you choose to.\n7. Even if this class managed to be a pre-req that was required to get into your major, there are other colleges and programs even if you get denied from one college, theres other colleges. Take some time to yourself first then look around. My friend got denied from 3 colleges because she failed a human anatomy class (supposed to get C+ and up to pass and since she got below that, she got denied entry into her program 3 times and was sucessful the 4th time) she kept trying for a few colleges and managed to make it into one!\n8. If this is a class that wasn't necessarily a pre-req requirement, look up your colleges program requirements and you may be able to take it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really do wish you well, I'm not trying to be preachy here or anything - but I wished I could have had somebody to relate to when I failed a class. Like I said its a set back and not the end of the world even though it feels like it is. I believe in you <3",
