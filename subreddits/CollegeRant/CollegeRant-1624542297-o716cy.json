  "text": "So rn, im planning on transferring from my community college (will be a sophmore in the fall and CS major) to a uni, but im stuck between twp unis. They are both located 1to 1.5 hr away from from house. Uni A is in a big city with more people and is abet accredited in CS. Uni b is in a small town with less people, many of which fall into one race, with an OK cs program but no abet accreditation (Im getting a d.major option tho). Im leaning towards uni A rn, just bc i like the diversity and abet accreditation (im not racist, but i prefer diversity). I feel that im making a decision on impulse and emotion and not logic. All advice and comments are welcomed and thanked by op.\n\nTLDR: deciding between two unis to transfer to, basing my decision off student body, TIA",

              "text": "I\u2019ve gone to three different schools I\u2019m a senior now attending a top 40 school atm upcoming senior. Attention and personalization doesn\u2019t matter when it isn\u2019t quality. I had the same mentality when I went with a smaller school first time around. Now I go to a larger school yes it\u2019s less attention but much higher quality. The price however is significant.  You could consider transferring as a Junior? Better options maybe \u2026",
