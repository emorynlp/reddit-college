They are both located 1to 1.5 hr away from from house. Uni A is in a big city with more people and is abet accredited in CS. Uni b is in a small town with less people, many of which fall into one race, with an OK cs program but no abet accreditation (Im getting a d.major option tho). Im leaning towards uni A rn, just bc i like the diversity and abet accreditation (im not racist, but i prefer diversity). I feel that im making a decision on impulse and emotion and not logic. All advice and comments are welcomed and thanked by op.\n\nTLDR: deciding between two unis to transfer to, basing my decision off student body, TIA", "author": "acleb524", "created": 1624542297, "retrieved": 1632949653, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h2zu4b5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o716cy/transferring_connundrum/h2zu4b5/", "text": "I don\u2019t see the issue here\u2026 Uni A is larger, you like the diversity, it\u2019s accredited.
