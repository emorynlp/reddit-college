I guarantee you by middle school most of them were not relying on the teacher. I went to school in Mexico, for us it was 7th grade. The math teacher may demonstrate an easy problem, then he'd give us harder ones for homework and a super hard one for the exam. Our literature teacher would expect us to be prepared so she could cold call us to answer questions about the assigned readings. I moved to the US for high school.
