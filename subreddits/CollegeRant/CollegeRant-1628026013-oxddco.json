I\u2019m going into the dorms for the first time as a junior. My school is a commuter college, so I don\u2019t have a lot of friends (read: none) so I had no one to link up with for roommates. I just saw my assigned roommates that I move in with tomorrow. It appears that all three of them know each other (two have the same last name and the other is an \u201cassociated person\u201d on outlook email). I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m overthinking a lot; stuff like am I gonna be the fourth wheel, am I gonna be a loner, will they be loud and obnoxious, etc. I did just send them all a group email seeing if they wanted to make a Snapchat or GroupMe group chat, but that was before I realized the third person also probably knows them. Now I feel kinda stupid and like I\u2019m butting in on their group. \n\nI guess my question is what would you do in this situation? How would you go about handling this? I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll gang up on me if I raise any issues. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTl;Dr my new roommates that I move in with tomorrow all seem to know each other, and I\u2019m scared to ruin the dynamic.

Odds are they'll welcome the addition if you just talk to them like a normal person. If you end up being the 4th wheel you can make other friends (that's one if the easier parts of college) and you really only have to be there to sleep if you don't like hanging out with them (even that ends up being optional if your friends are nice enough).\n\nWorse comes to worst just move rooms, I'm sure your housing dept will understand. But give yourself a chance to feel out the vibe and get to know them, they're probably worried how a random will affect the dynamic as well.", "author": "JohnLeRoy9600", "created": 1628047839, "upvotes": 17}}}
