  "title:": "My roommate is filing a police report on me over a missing plastic bowl.",
  "text": " If you'd like to take a peak at my older posts, my roommates and I have never quite gotten along. Between telling me I'm less because I'm only a biology major, never letting me turn the AC off even when it's snowing, and calling me a disgusting human for biting my nails -- a nervous tic, telling me to not speak to them because they knew I wasn't going to vibe with them from day 1, it was never very good.\n\nI moved out of our on campus apartment last week because I'm graduating this semester and obviously won't be returning for the spring. While moving out, I may have accidentally taken one of my roommate's plastic bowls because we have the same ones. They are 79 cents from target.\n\nI didn't know that I may have accidentally snagged one (I still don't know if I even did), but my roommates texted me saying I stole property from them and they will be filing a police report and suing me here soon unless I paid them. Normally I'd be like \"sure whatever\" and front the 79 cents. But instead, they venmo requested me six dollars. I said fuck that, and they can have fun trying to file a police report and suing me over a plastic bowl. I blocked their numbers and went on with my day. I then got another venmo request this morning from the other roommate saying \"you stole our shit + interest\" for TEN DOLLARS.\n\nI...what? I never thought this would be how my undergrad years ended lol, being sued over a 79 cent plastic bowl from target.\n\nHappy finals week!",

Oh buddy, where to begin with that.  That's a criminal offense.
