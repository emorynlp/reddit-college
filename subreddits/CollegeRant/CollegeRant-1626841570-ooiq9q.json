I KNEW as a teenager and in my earlier 20\u2019s that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I KNEW I needed to trial and error my way around life to understand what my true interests, strengths, weaknesses, passions, and goals are. I had the self-awareness to know at 16 when everyone else was applying for universities that I didn\u2019t belong there.

Far more affordable, I could just take one class per semester if I wanted to (and often did-hence the 6 years to get a 2 year degree). I had a chance to learn how to manage my anxiety and self-confidence issues with fewer consequences. For instance, I did wind up on academic probation because my heart just wasn\u2019t into college.

I am still in way too much debt from my AS degrees and my first year at Penn State, but I know that I still saved a SHITLOAD of money.  And, since I did so well at my first year of Penn State, I was able to get enough scholarships to cover my entire tuition for my second year here.\n\nThere is no way I would have been able to keep a 4.0 if I had started at Penn State right out tha gate.  Going to CC first felt like so much less pressure, and like I was able to acquire the skills I needed to be a successful student, and they had so many resources to push students to do well.\n\nAs a side note, in my experience (I got an AS in biology and AS in chemistry simultaneously), I don't think classes at my four-year are any harder..  In fact, it is  common that professors who teach at my CC also teach the exact same course in the exact same way at a local university (I am looking at you, calculus based physics classes that made me want to die).", "author": "ThereIsNo14thStreet", "created": 1626843404, "upvotes": 83}, "h5ysf7c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ooiq9q/people_who_go_to_community_college/h5ysf7c/", "text": "People always have an opinion no matter what.
