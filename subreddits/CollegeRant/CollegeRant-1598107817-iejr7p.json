As an introvert, I never really opened myself much or only explored on relationships I actually see benefits in and everything else is just noise.\n\nAfter a few weeks, my classmates started noticing that I have freelance work (dont even know how they knew). Then started bullying me, saying things like I\u2019m privileged but acting like I\u2019m poor or like the majority.\n\nUsually I wouldn\u2019t care about things like that, they dont know my life story whatever. Who pays for what. But now every time I do my work, it triggers all of the things I\u2019ve heard about me and all the tweets, videos, etc they mentioned me in. Clearly bullying and clearly affecting my productivity. \n\nTbh, I would\u2019ve complained but their the types of students that has power within the school\u2019s administration and I dont wanna mess with my scholarship. Man, this really be affecting me and I don\u2019t know why.", "author": "pegasurus", "created": 1598107817, "retrieved": 1632843329, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 77, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g2thkqw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iejr7p/i_get_bullied_for_working_lmao/g2thkqw/", "text": "agreed 100% keep pushing thru buddy! we got this :)", "author": "pegasurus", "created": 1598374717, "upvotes": 1}, "g2r48nw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iejr7p/i_get_bullied_for_working_lmao/g2r48nw/", "text": "Geez, that sounds horrid and I am so sorry.
