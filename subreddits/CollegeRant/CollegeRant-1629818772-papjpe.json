The first physics class I took last semester was nearly the death of me. I was lucky to scrape by with a low low C, and that class was responsible for lower grades in two other classes as well.\n\nNow I'm back for the second semester of this course, with the same professor since he's the only one teaching, and I'm already so hopeless.\n\nThis guy throws loads of information that doesn't connect. His voice is so boring, like he doesn't even want to be there, and that makes it hard to focus at 9am. 50 minutes feel like an eternity, and I'm drained from the overload of information for the rest of the day. The weekly homework takes at least 5 hours, and we're left to fend for ourselves in terms of how to solve the problems (again, none of the information connects). I spent so much time studying for this class last semester to no avail. I don't know what I don't know, so how can I go to tutoring when they're not allowed to help me with homework? Not that it would matter, considering every single problem is distinctly different from the previous.\n\nI hate this. I don't know how to succeed. Its like if a bio professor told you bacteria and agar plates exist (just cause they do), then expected you to grow bacterial cultures on your own. I'm not Newton. I can't be.\n\nI can't drop this course, and if I fail I'll most certainly graduate late (yes, this course can set me back a whole semester). I'm taking other super important courses this semester as well, and I can't stand to see another C or B where I know I could've gotten an A if I had the time and mental strength. I guess I have to teach myself, but i feel so hopeless after each lecture.
