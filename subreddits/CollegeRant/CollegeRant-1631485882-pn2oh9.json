  "text": "I had chemistry in high school. It was a terrible year due to my mental health, being hospitalized for it, and as a result, having to do chemistry homework with no instruction, only my textbook. It was the only class I ever failed. I think that now, I attribute anything chemistry related to that time period and I\u2019ve convinced myself I\u2019m a complete dumbass with science, so I\u2019m having an extremely hard time in my college chemistry 101 class.\n\nI\u2019m taking detailed notes and reviewing them constantly. I\u2019m sitting in the front row of the class to minimize distraction and engage with the instructor more. I ask questions instead of telling myself I\u2019ll just understand later. I\u2019m really trying. \n\nChapter 1 was all math\u2014 my second worst subject. Scientific notation, unit conversion, stuff like that. I still don\u2019t really get any of it and I\u2019m not able to do any of it without my notes, since I forget everything otherwise. But I have more confidence to learn it.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve started chapter 2 and actually gotten into elements and atoms and all of that, I\u2019m fucking losing it. I bite my tongue to keep myself grounded and keep from breaking down and crying, and I leave class with a swollen tongue. I try to ask questions, but my throat refuses to cooperate and let me say anything. I can\u2019t remember any of it after class. I\u2019ll look at my notes and it\u2019s like someone else took them.\n\nThe worst part is that I feel like I *can\u2019t* give up. My dream job, the main thing in my life I\u2019m fighting for, is to be a dietitian. I am so fascinated by nutrition and dietetics, and I want to help people who are struggling with dietary issues that I\u2019ve had, too. I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else with my life. But I have to take 4 chemistry courses to get there\u2014 intro (since I failed in high school), general chemistry, organic chemistry, and then principles of biochemistry.\n\nThe date to drop classes without financial penalty is on Tuesday. I need to make a decision in less than 48 hours whether I\u2019ll push harder toward the future I\u2019ve been dreaming of for years or drop it all and find something else to do that I\u2019ll be nowhere near as passionate about.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTL;DR - I suck at chemistry but need 4 chem classes on the way to reach my dream job. I don\u2019t know if I should keep fighting or give up.\n\nEdit for anyone that cares: I decided to try and stay with it. I know dropping out again is only going to bring me more pain and regret, so I want to see what happens if I dont give up.",

I think dropping it will feel like giving up and you may start to spiral. If you have a therapist, I strongly recommend trying to get an appointment before this deadline to discuss it with them. You are a strong student who works hard. You\u2019ll get there. Your brain will learn to shift gears and understand it. Tutors exist, your teacher sounds helpful, you sound like you\u2019re working hard. If you can do much as pass the class, do it.",

      "text": "There is absolutely nothing wrong with dropping a class you don't feel prepared for. It will allow you to focus on your other classes. Then next semester you can lighten your work load again by not taking so many clases. That will allow you to concentrate on the hardest one, this one. You'll just need extra time to study it and really break it down, and there is nothing wrong with that",
