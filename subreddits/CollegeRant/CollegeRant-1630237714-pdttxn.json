I took Statics fall of 2020, signed up for a professor with okay ratings on RateMyProfessor. No big deal. Surprise! 2 weeks before classes start, I get a new professor. He had just come out of retirement and seemed nice enough. Wrong, worst professor I\u2019ve ever had. He stumbled over his words, has really bad handwriting, can only teach out of the textbook, and always messed up his calculations. First class I ever failed (I got a different professor in the spring and ended with an A). \n\nI then take Solids summer of 2021, signed up for a really good professor that everyone likes. Again! 1 month before my class starts, his name shows up on my schedule. Didn\u2019t go to class once, self-studied and got a B (online so it wasn\u2019t terrible). \n\nAnd now, fall of 2021. I have to take Fluid Mechanics and I sign up for a professor who has been teaching the class for a few years, not bad. And guess who shows up on my class schedule again, 2 weeks before classes start. Things are back in-person and I\u2019m at my wits end, I swear he\u2019s out to get me.", "author": "uta34755", "created": 1630237714, "retrieved": 1632950941, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hav0nmi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdttxn/got_the_same_professor_three_times_for_three/hav0nmi/", "text": "talk to your advisor, this is definitely an extenuating circumstance", "author": "LeeroyDagnasty", "created": 1630277842, "upvotes": 2}, "hat2b3s": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pdttxn/got_the_same_professor_three_times_for_three/hat2b3s/", "text": "Are you able to switch sections?", "author": "SnapKpic", "created": 1630247656, "upvotes": 17}}}
