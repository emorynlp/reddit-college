As much as I loved the guys I lived with they frustrated me sooo much because of these issues. I decided that I'm going to be proactive about it and channel my frustration into something productive. Because of all this, I spent the last 2 months building a roommate app from scratch. It's not much that I feel like it's pretty good so far. There is still some testing I have to do so I'm not launching it just yet. I'm going to launch it this Sunday. I'll add a link in the description on Sunday and create another post describing the app in more detail.\n\nI'll answer any questions you guys may have below.\n\nTL;DR - I had cruddy roommates for years, built an app to split chores and bills, releasing the app here on Sunday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: \\*3 Days Remaining\\* Hey everyone, app testing is running smoothly. The team and I haven't run into any major bugs and everything in the app seems to be working great. We still have a bunch of the app to still go through but it looks like we're still on track to release this Sunday at 8 AM Eastern Standard Time.\n\nUpdate: \\*2 Days Remaining\\* Good news everyone! The bug fixes are going smoothly, we're also in the process of adding a few suggestions a few of you guys PM'd us. We're still on track to get it all done by Sunday 9 AM\n\nUpdate: \\*1 Day Remaining\\* Great news everyone! We just have a few minor bugs remaining and we've successfully added all the features.
