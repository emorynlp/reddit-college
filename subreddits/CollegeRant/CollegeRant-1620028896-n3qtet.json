  "text": "I got the major I loved due to high marks scored in my 12th grade. As I entered the first week of college I was motivated and willing to give my 100%. And I did. But the teaching quality declined, professors were just reading off the reference books and failing to answer doubts by students, usual reply was \"message me and I'll get back\" which they never did. Most classes were cancelled and instead they piled us with 50 pages of assignment twice per semester plus practical journals for every subject. I kept up but I was lost for words because I wanted/expected more. Subjects weren't even fully covered, we couldn't report teachers anonymously, and if we did with our name on it our grades will surely suffer. Is there any solution to solve this problem? Help is appreciated from the bottom of my heart.",

You may not be able to get your top picks, but it will help avoid the absolutely shitty ones. I would also talk to your program director about this and maybe see if there are other ways to get involved in your major that are more exciting/fulfilling.",

      "text": "If you can, gather a group of students together to go to their direct supervisor. Thats what I did with a few others when our professor did a very similar move to that. He stopped having lectures, the quality was crap, kept saying he would do stuff and he wouldn't. We got together, sent an email to his supervisor and it seemed to kick him into gear, at least for a bit. He still missed deadlines and other stuff, but it was better than before.",
