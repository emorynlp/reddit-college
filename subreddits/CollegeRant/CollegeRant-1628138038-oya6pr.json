{"sid": "oya6pr", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oya6pr/i_think_i_played_myself/", "title:": "I think I played myself.", "text": "Hi Reddit.\n\nI'm currently 27, about to go into what is effectively my junior year of college. I dropped out once in 2012 and again in 2014, and in the process I made a lot of zeros that I can't get removed from my record because I was a dumbass manbaby who was too lazy to drop my failing courses. I made a lot of mistakes, did some growing, and eventually decided to go back to school. I've been climbing my way back to decent academic standing since 2017.\n\nI finished community college in 2019. I didn't think I'd get decent job opportunities with an associate's degree, so I proceeded to apply to the same four year institution I dropped out of in 2012. I had initially planned on majoring in computer science or physics (but was leaning hard towards comp sci), but my academic advisor tried to steer me into majoring in literature because I'd graduate faster that way (I had a lot of lit credits from community college) and because I would supposedly still be able to get a programming job as a comp sci minor. I, in my everlasting arrogance, assumed she thought I was incapable of a science major, so I told her I wanted to major in physics. Insecurity is a sonuvabitch.\n\nNow I wouldn't say that I hate physics; I actually find it mildly interesting! I like documentaries about physics, and I like popular science books; hell, sometimes I even like solving physics problems - I LIKE math! I've finished all the background maths and chemistry courses, and so far I've taken three Physics courses (which I enjoyed). I don't mind studying it, and the textbooks I've encountered so far, while very challenging, do not intimidate me.\n\nI HATE research. I do not like reading physics papers, and I presumably will not like writing them either. I've been participating in (read: smiling and observing) one of our university's research groups for the past year. They study plasma and nanomaterials and pulsed laser deposition and it's all way over my head; I have only the faintest grasp of what it is they're actually doing. It's dry. And boring. And I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. Over the summer, my physics mentor (lets call him Mr X) has tried really hard to get me involved more with their research group; so I've been spending some of my spare time in the lab and I've been trying to read some papers at home. Mr. X has generally been nice to me, but I really don't find the work they're doing interesting. GRANTED what they're doing is important, and awesome, and I hope it changes the world, but I ain't about it.\n\nEarlier this year though, I somehow got a college job doing, of all things, programming! I LOVE programming! It is at times incredibly frustrating, but it's very rewarding and there are TANGIBLE(virtual) results to my labor. This job is amazing. I love my coworkers, the work is interesting (EVEN when it's way over my head), and the pay is on par or better than any job I've ever had. I'm not quitting this job unless I get fired/let go, and I plan on keeping this job until I graduate... which probably wont be for another two years because not all of my community college credits transferred to the science track here.\n\nMaybe I'm just impatient or na\u00efve, but I was kind of hoping that by starting in 2020 I'd be able to finish my bachelor's by 2022. The physics track I'm on right now is for students planning to go off to grad school, but I think I've definitely written that off at this point (the very thought makes me shudder). There are other physics tracks that would allow me to graduate slightly sooner (and maybe even take more comp sci courses along the way!), but before I can change tracks I still need to have a slightly uncomfortable conversation with Mr X. More importantly, I'm beginning to think that a bachelor's degree in physics is probably not the most employable thing in the world; a lot of what I've read has indicated that if I were to continue down the physics track I should either stay in academia indefinitely or complete a master's degree and look for a job in industry. Again, I want OUT, I don't want to go to grad school.\n\nI want to get out of school, and do the things I really care about again! I want to play guitar, learn Japanese, and make video games! And my time is just shrinking every day! But I'm so terrified that I'll be stuck in food service for the rest of my life without this degree, and I lack a lot of soft skills. This is why I've latched onto this programming job so hard. The skills I'm learning in this job are practical and applicable to a career path that I think I actually LIKE.\n\nBut I cannot manage working 20 hours a week, being a full time student, and participating in a physics lab I no longer care about along with all of life's other responsibilities. If I'm being honest with myself, I NEED to switch majors to comp sci if I want to retain my sanity and self respect, but that will delay my graduation by a semester (roughly\\~13 credit hours by my estimate). THAT'S TIME AND MONEY.\n\nBut what if I'm just running away from a challenge? What if, get to the point in comp sci that it gets too difficult, and I decide to quit that as well. Part of me wants to continue along with Physics just so that I can say \"There! I did it! I completed a challenge\", but I know that's asinine because it's not what I want to spend my life doing.\n\nI'm also going to have to swallow my pride and tell Mr X (did I mention he's a super cool guy who has been really enthusiastic and supportive about getting me involved in the physics program?) that I want to switch majors. In all likelihood he probably wont care that much (after all, what's one undergrad worth in such a grueling field?), but I still feel like shit about it, like I've led him on or something.\n\nIt's my fault for not expressing my interests strongly enough at MULTIPLE stages when I had the opportunity AND obligation to do so. Not just when I re-enrolled at this institution, but at every stage in which Mr X asked me what my interests were, what I'd like to specialize in, and why I wanted to do physics. I just kinda decided to coast and go with the flow; but now the flow is about to go over a waterfall.\n\nI'm so tired. I just want this to end. Summer semester is killing me right now and I've got just over two weeks before the Fall semester to stop being such a fucking wimp and sort all this shit out. I'm so sick of being behind most of my peers who graduated half a decade ago.\n\n/rant\n\ntl;dr\n\nI've been in school too long, and should probably change majors but I'm not looking forward to the uncomfortable conversations and delayed graduation that entails.", "author": "AlkaidsAlmanac", "created": 1628138038, "retrieved": 1632841671, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 24, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h7rnt1q": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oya6pr/i_think_i_played_myself/h7rnt1q/", "text": "Thank you u/AlkaidsAlmanac for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it doesn\u2019t seem like you have the clearest path for how to get there. \n\nWith a physics major a lot of people do go into academia and research, but as you\u2019ve said above, that path is not for you. However that\u2019s not to say that a physics major is worthless for jobs outside of the academic realm. The analytical skills (plus mathematical/computational skills) you gain as a physics major are very applicable and very valuable in many jobs outside of physics. I know my fair share of physics majors who work in business/finance and computer science after their bachelors!\n\nIf I were you I would consider finishing your major as physics. Perhaps the worst thing you could do now is to change it and spend even more time in school. You could drop your research related activities and spend more time getting programming experience at your job or though other means. Talk with your advisors/mentors about what such a path would look like for you. You might be surprised by how supportive they will be (Mr X sounds like he\u2019s a nice person in general). Also think about looking at linkedin and such, see where physics majors from your school have ended up working at. This could give you some ideas about where your physics major could take you. \n\nIn the end though only you know what\u2019s right for you.
