  "text": "I was walking to the dining hall and saw a table of people snickering at me, don\u2019t know them too well but now I just don\u2019t want to leave my room. Maybe I did something? I\u2019m not sure, all I can think of is quitting a club or not responding to my texts or something, but now I\u2019m rethinking all of my life decisions up till this point. Honestly, this feels just like high school again, and I don\u2019t wanna deal with that bullshit",

      "text": "Ah, the good 'ol high school vibes we all thought we would escape until we didn't! Who knew ppl could still be immature bitches even tho we're all adults now?\n\nThis is not uncommon it happens to so many ppl, it even happened to me! There are some out there who just don't get over their high school behavior and bring it with them all the way to uni. It sucks and these mfs suck!\n\nBut c'mon now you can't let yourself get down bc a table full of bitches is jealous that they're not you! You must realize that you're in a better spot than them because the only way they get off is by degrading other ppl's self-esteem. You can't control what these ppl say, but you can control your response. Don't rethink life because it's not worth hanging onto what other ppl may or may not think about you. You've got your own life now while they're still stuck in the past, so you go ahead and move into the future. Look, I get it too, it was hard for me to adjust when I started out and I was always a lonely person with no friends. But college presents a lot of opportunities to you and one of them is the opportunity to leave all of that shit behind and never think twice about it. You do that by doing you, go join more clubs, make friends, awesome friends, and never give these bitches a second thought bc that's what they want.\n\nAnd also do well in school bc lemme tell you it's always a good flex on these fuckers when you're the smartest person in the room.",
