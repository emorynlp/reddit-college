  "text": "Added TLDR at the bottom & pros and cons list for those that want concise ver. :)\n\nSo, I thought I was being wise by taking initiative and taking an algebra course over the summer before my freshman year begins. They told me that if I failed the course, I'd have to switch out of my major. I thought \"no biggie, I got this in the bag! It's just algebra!\" WOW my duMBA-- anyways, I was getting 88% and above on quizzes, 100% on assignments, and I understood the material very well.\n\nThe final is worth 50% of our grade, and we need a 75% in the class to be considered \"passing\" the class. With quarantine and all, studying at home has definitely affected my mental health, and my house isn't really work-friendly. My house is very noisy and my parents stress me out so much, and I have severe test anxiety when it comes to math because I suck at it. During the test I kept thinking about how this class is in the way of me and continuing in my major. Even the proctor reached out to me after the test and let me know that I looked very stressed out and she wanted to check on me.\n\nI failed the final, which resulted in me failing the class. It really was a matter of poor test taking skills rather than poor math skills, nonetheless, I must face the consequences.\n\nTurns out, not only do i have to switch majors (I'm a bio major) but I have to completely switch out of the college of natural and agricultural science and into the college of humanities and social science. I thought \"okay...not what I wanted, but I'll make it work! How about majoring in psychology since that's an available major?\" Nope. I can't major in *anything* relating to math. Matter of fact, they're not letting me take a *single* math class again. I literally can't do anything STEM related at this college because I failed this class. REALLY? OOWEJDOJW IM PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND YOU WONT LET ME GO BE STUPID IN MATH? PLEASE???\n\nI want to go into med school, and I need to meet math prerequisites, which I can't fulfill at this university anymore. I'm thinking about trying to transfer to a better university, but until transfer applications are due, I'm not sure whether I should go to a cc and transfer to a better university, *or* if i should stay at my current university and stick with my undeclared humanities major while taking random courses that are interesting, then transferring to a better university once the applications are due.\n\nJust a note, the university I'd love to transfer to is a really amazing yet selective university (a private uni, not UC) and I've had my eye on it for so long. I don't know if attending a CC would lower my chances of admittance over transferring from a 4 year public university. Do you think that private uni's would prefer a student coming from another uni over a cc?\n\nAdditionally, if I do transfer, should i mention this whole ordeal? Would mentioning this situation paint me in a bad light? I was thinking that maybe I should make my transfer app focusing more on how I have many interests, such as violin, philosophy, compsci, and medicine, and how my current uni doesn't really allow students explore all their passions and avocations.\n\nSo sorry for this block of text. I appreciate any advice I can get because I'm seriously in a tough spot right now and I feel quite stupid. If you were in my situation, what would you do? I was thinking about transferring out of this uni before this situation happened because I truly stand by my earlier statement, that it's hard to explore your interests here (simple example of that is that I wanted to take a foreign language and they told me it wouldn't give me any credit no matter how good I got at the language, and that they highly discourage me from taking a language. This was when I was a bio major.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR** I failed a math class/workshop so I can't take any more math or science classes at all, got kicked out of my major and forced to be in humanities. I want to transfer but idk if i should transfer from my current uni to the selective school i have in mind or from a cc to the selective school. If I stay at my current uni, I have to stick to humanities and that means I might have to transfer as a humanities major too, but I have more research opportunities and internships. If I go to a CC, I can take any class I want and go back into STEM, but research opportunities are limited. Also, should I mention this fail situation on my transfer app although it doesn't show on my transcript?\n\n# Going to a CC and then transferring elsewhere\n\n*Pros*\n\n* cheaper\n* allows me to go back into stem\n* fresh opportunity and no record of \"being bad at math\"at the CC\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Possibly no research opportunities\n* Don't think it's possible to transfer after a year, and I reallly want to transfer ASAP!\n* Less resources\n* Less \"prestigious\" but idc although admission officers might think it looks better to come from a 4 year uni\n\n# Staying at my current uni and transferring elsewhere\n\n# Pros\n\n* Lots of research opportunities and resources (although now that I'm a humanities major, I'm lacking a lot of support suddenly lol)\n* Might be able to transfer after a year\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Can't do anything STEM related at current uni besides internships or research\n* Stuck in humanities\n* If I transfer to a different school, I will still have to be a humanities major (I can dabble in stem courses though, just not major in stem)\n\n***What do you think? :,) ALSO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY STARTED FALL SEMESTER SO I CAN'T ENROLL IN THEM, AND MY SCHOOL HAS NOT STARTED YET, AND I NEED CREDITS TO TRANSFER ASAP BUT I ALSO WANT TO DROP OUT OF THIS SCHOOL IDK WHAT TO DO. I can't just sit around all fall semester if i want to transfer soon. aak.***\n\nedit: Just bc we got some ppl who think i'm making this up for whatever reason..adding this for ya'll :( chass = college of humanities and social science. they stand by this policy hardcore. sounds unbelievable? ikr, i can't believe it either.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4dsj8ez0u5p51.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=671d40fc43f827085e9917c4f63e2ff7c7bc1acf",

Since it looks like you are currently stuck in your school, I'd advise you to take as much GE courses as you can, and you can start major requirements in your CC starting next term.\n\nI think your school is being absurd with their math policies and banning a student from STEM just because they failed their first ever course in college is just harsh and unreasonable. If I were you I would have ditched that school without a doubt because that messed up policy is already telling me loads on how crappy your school would be at supporting students who are facing hardships in studies/life/etc.\n\nCCs don't have as much research opportunities as regular colleges but you can get some if you try hard enough to find some.",

It's cheaper, if in the U.S you might qualify for Pell grants and it's free if you don't drop out or anything.\n\nTherapy helped me get it together. And finding out I have adhd brought a lot together and explained why I'd struggle and avoid/self sabotage. It couldn't hurt to explore if you are stressed out for other reasons.\n\nEta: it's not med school but same school accepted me into a clinical grad program. Point being, there are other options.

First one was my previous bio advisor, and basically she said that if I were to continue as a bio major, I'd be far too behind in math which means I wouldn't graduate on time (my uni focuses on graduation rates rather than helping improve students yay) and that goes for all of the stem majors, therefore I have to be kicked out of my college and into the humanities college. I had a meeting with the second advisor this morning, she was for my undeclared humanities major. She was so cold with me and told me to figure my classes out myself and that I can't major in psychology because it includes some math. She told me that the algebra class/workshop was a chance to catch up with everyone else in math and that it's unrealistic of me to want to do anything relating to math when I did bad in algebra. I told her it was a case of bad anxiety, she said I didn't pass the class regardless. Have you ever heard of a college literally not allowing you to pursue anything STEM related just because you sucked at one workshop...it\u2019s not even a program in hs or something, it\u2019s college...I\u2019m paying tuition for this... :/",

You're going to fail and that'll look bad for our university's graduation rates.\"\n\nIf you still don't believe me, I can pm you the site regarding this workshop or a subreddit of someone talking ab failing this workshop.\n\nI was very disheartened by the fact that I wont take any more math classes because I myself don't understand why they wouldn't provide more support for someone who did bad in math rather than stripping them away from their major and forcing them into something they have no interest in.\n\nThankfully, this workshop doesn't go on my transcript because, well, it's a workshop, so it just looks like I've switched to an undeclared humanities major.

                                      "text": "Is there an Access Center of Office of Equal Opportunity at your school that provides accommodations for students with test anxiety? At my university, they consider test anxiety to be serious enough of a condition that it can even be considered a disability and the instructors must accommodate you for that (with accommodations such as double time for exams, a private room with reduced distractions, etc). I have accommodations for my exams so that I can do my best in a situation where I am not under extra pressure from my condition. Anyway, I think private unis prefer you to be from a more \"well known\" college but that doesn't mean that no student from a community college gets into a private school. Just do your best, don't wear yourself out, and apply to your dream school after you complete your 4 yr degree. In my experience, I've never heard of a student transferring from a CC without completing an AA degree. I think if you only complete one year and then transfer, it makes it more difficult to place you in classes at the 4 yr college because they don't really have straightforward equivalency charts that tell you which class counts for what. This is also extremely important if you are transferring from a school that works of a quarter system to a semester system or vice-versa. I think it would be best for you to go to a CC and get your AA before transferring to a 4 yr college. And no need to apologize for questions! I'm happy I can help.",

I'll try to talk to the dean though! Hm...it's preferred to have an associates by the time you transfer huh? lowkey thinking ab taking 7 courses each semester rn lol i'm going to wreck myself.
