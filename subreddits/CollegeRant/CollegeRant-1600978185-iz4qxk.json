They told me that if I failed the course, I'd have to switch out of my major. I thought \"no biggie, I got this in the bag! It's just algebra!\" WOW my duMBA-- anyways, I was getting 88% and above on quizzes, 100% on assignments, and I understood the material very well.\n\nThe final is worth 50% of our grade, and we need a 75% in the class to be considered \"passing\" the class. With quarantine and all, studying at home has definitely affected my mental health, and my house isn't really work-friendly. My house is very noisy and my parents stress me out so much, and I have severe test anxiety when it comes to math because I suck at it. During the test I kept thinking about how this class is in the way of me and continuing in my major. Even the proctor reached out to me after the test and let me know that I looked very stressed out and she wanted to check on me.\n\nI failed the final, which resulted in me failing the class. It really was a matter of poor test taking skills rather than poor math skills, nonetheless, I must face the consequences.\n\nTurns out, not only do i have to switch majors (I'm a bio major) but I have to completely switch out of the college of natural and agricultural science and into the college of humanities and social science. I thought \"okay...not what I wanted, but I'll make it work! How about majoring in psychology since that's an available major?\" Nope. I can't major in *anything* relating to math. Matter of fact, they're not letting me take a *single* math class again. I literally can't do anything STEM related at this college because I failed this class. REALLY? OOWEJDOJW IM PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND YOU WONT LET ME GO BE STUPID IN MATH? PLEASE???\n\nI want to go into med school, and I need to meet math prerequisites, which I can't fulfill at this university anymore. I'm thinking about trying to transfer to a better university, but until transfer applications are due, I'm not sure whether I should go to a cc and transfer to a better university, *or* if i should stay at my current university and stick with my undeclared humanities major while taking random courses that are interesting, then transferring to a better university once the applications are due.\n\nJust a note, the university I'd love to transfer to is a really amazing yet selective university (a private uni, not UC) and I've had my eye on it for so long. I don't know if attending a CC would lower my chances of admittance over transferring from a 4 year public university. Do you think that private uni's would prefer a student coming from another uni over a cc?\n\nAdditionally, if I do transfer, should i mention this whole ordeal? Would mentioning this situation paint me in a bad light? I was thinking that maybe I should make my transfer app focusing more on how I have many interests, such as violin, philosophy, compsci, and medicine, and how my current uni doesn't really allow students explore all their passions and avocations.\n\nSo sorry for this block of text. I appreciate any advice I can get because I'm seriously in a tough spot right now and I feel quite stupid. If you were in my situation, what would you do? I was thinking about transferring out of this uni before this situation happened because I truly stand by my earlier statement, that it's hard to explore your interests here (simple example of that is that I wanted to take a foreign language and they told me it wouldn't give me any credit no matter how good I got at the language, and that they highly discourage me from taking a language. This was when I was a bio major.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR** I failed a math class/workshop so I can't take any more math or science classes at all, got kicked out of my major and forced to be in humanities. I want to transfer but idk if i should transfer from my current uni to the selective school i have in mind or from a cc to the selective school. If I stay at my current uni, I have to stick to humanities and that means I might have to transfer as a humanities major too, but I have more research opportunities and internships. If I go to a CC, I can take any class I want and go back into STEM, but research opportunities are limited. Also, should I mention this fail situation on my transfer app although it doesn't show on my transcript?\n\n# Going to a CC and then transferring elsewhere\n\n*Pros*\n\n* cheaper\n* allows me to go back into stem\n* fresh opportunity and no record of \"being bad at math\"at the CC\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Possibly no research opportunities\n* Don't think it's possible to transfer after a year, and I reallly want to transfer ASAP!\n* Less resources\n* Less \"prestigious\" but idc although admission officers might think it looks better to come from a 4 year uni\n\n# Staying at my current uni and transferring elsewhere\n\n# Pros\n\n* Lots of research opportunities and resources (although now that I'm a humanities major, I'm lacking a lot of support suddenly lol)\n* Might be able to transfer after a year\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Can't do anything STEM related at current uni besides internships or research\n* Stuck in humanities\n* If I transfer to a different school, I will still have to be a humanities major (I can dabble in stem courses though, just not major in stem)\n\n***What do you think? :,) ALSO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY STARTED FALL SEMESTER SO I CAN'T ENROLL IN THEM, AND MY SCHOOL HAS NOT STARTED YET, AND I NEED CREDITS TO TRANSFER ASAP BUT I ALSO WANT TO DROP OUT OF THIS SCHOOL IDK WHAT TO DO. I can't just sit around all fall semester if i want to transfer soon. aak.***\n\nedit: Just bc we got some ppl who think i'm making this up for whatever reason..adding this for ya'll :( chass = college of humanities and social science. they stand by this policy hardcore. sounds unbelievable? ikr, i can't believe it either.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4dsj8ez0u5p51.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=671d40fc43f827085e9917c4f63e2ff7c7bc1acf", "author": "dumbeggbaby", "created": 1600978185, "retrieved": 1632950904, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g6lb9r1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iz4qxk/huge_oopsiedropping_out_of_my_college_fr/g6lb9r1/", "text": "Guys what do I do this semester lmao I wanna drop out but I also need credits to transfer asap..every semester counts.
