I had two groups projects this week. For the first one, we were tasked with giving a presentation. We met the day before to discuss how we wanted to split everything and agreed to meet later that night to finalize everything. What did I do? I was so tired I fell asleep and missed the meeting. At least for this one, no harm no foul since I finished my parts of the project beforehand and the presentation went well.\n\nThis second group project was worse though. We met a few days ago and agreed on how to split everything and agreed to reconvene two days later to finalize our submission and fix as needed. I checked my phone before at the time we usually meet and saw nothing, so I assumed we weren't meeting. I forgot that we agreed to move it to an hour later. Come to find out, they went ahead and fixed everything without me. I just feel bad that I forgot, since it's so unlike me. I'm just angry and disappointed in myself. I already apologized and asked if there's anything I can do, but at this point I just have to accept that this was a loss in my book. :(", "author": "Scooby-Doo_69", "created": 1632452562, "retrieved": 1632948420, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"heaytah": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/puayw9/fucked_up_two_group_project_this_week/heaytah/", "text": "You fricked up ONE group project, not TWO.", "author": "Comprehensive-Ad3963", "created": 1632627688, "upvotes": 1}}}
