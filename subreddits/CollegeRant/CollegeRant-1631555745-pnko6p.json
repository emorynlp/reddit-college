He showed us some examples of software and what other people in classes have done to help peer edit. He said that he didn't care what software, website, etc. you used, as long as you do it, and it's easily accessible. \n\nLikewise, he then left a comment after it was graded telling me that he doesn't like when people use Google Docs, or links to the document or essay. \n\nWhy not tell your students that, before giving them a lower grade. I am not someone to overly obsess about grades, but wanted to rant as this just seems stupid.", "author": "KlingonShit", "created": 1631555745, "retrieved": 1632948559, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcqb0z7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pnko6p/teachers_who_tell_you_they_dont_care_how_you_do/hcqb0z7/", "text": "Links can be an issue when people aren\u2019t granted access; I\u2019ve had trouble with this in the past when students have tried sending me links that won\u2019t work and then won\u2019t grant me access when requested.
