  "text": "I have an English teacher who wanted us to peer edit as the course is online. He showed us some examples of software and what other people in classes have done to help peer edit. He said that he didn't care what software, website, etc. you used, as long as you do it, and it's easily accessible. \n\nLikewise, he then left a comment after it was graded telling me that he doesn't like when people use Google Docs, or links to the document or essay. \n\nWhy not tell your students that, before giving them a lower grade. I am not someone to overly obsess about grades, but wanted to rant as this just seems stupid.",

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the reason, but it could be an explanation.",
