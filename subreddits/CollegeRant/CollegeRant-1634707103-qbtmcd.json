  "title:": "Someone died in a flight accident last night and im broken",
  "text": "Context I guess: I go to a school with a great aviation program and this was the first fatal accident in 15 years.\n\nLast night I received a message in one of my group chats that someone from our school crashed their plane. I honest to god thought he was making a fucked up joke or something....I honestly wish it was that...Anyhow, come to find out this was not some joke when he posted a news article in the chat. i froze in my seat. I absolutely could not believe it. people were losing it in the group chat, someone started to to make count on who's in the air and who was on the ground. i just sat there frozen, staring at my phone. it was like flares were going off, \"my friends are all accounted for!\", \"Same here!\", \"still making through my list but i'll give an update when i can.\" i myself started to make a list in my head on who I knew could fly or were flying, then it hit me. \"jesus i hope its not one of my co-workers, i know 4 of them are aviation majors.\" and that's all i could type....my mind just went all burry and i didn't know what was happening. couldn't sleep till 2 am thinking about it, eating me up inside...\n\nfast forward to the morning, the family released the name of the victim....a name i didn't recognized, but his hometown rang a bell for me. not my hometown but a friend's hometown. i messaged her telling her what happened and told her where the student was from and she replied saying \"yeah i knew him, he was one of my high school classmates\". This absolutely broke me. i just don't get it, i don't understand, felt like some slammed a hammer to my head and heart. campus was just so quiet, eerie, bleak, grim....sad. i just want this month to be over, i can't deal with this shit anymore, i just want thanksgiving break already.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Someone from my university died in their flight last night. come to find out the victim was a classmate of one of my friends back in their hometown and that broke me both mentally and physically. I'm so done with this month...",

      "text": "I don't want to sound like an ass but I gotta be honest: your reaction is very interesting. You feel so much intense emotions for a person you don't know at all. Why exactly? Some might say it's empathy and all but there are limitations to that.\n\nIf I were to guess, it's the pre-knowing stress that built up. You spent the whole time wondering if it was someone you know that you worried so much. Eventually, you find out it's a stranger but that stress still needed to go somewhere, so you just let it out right there. If the victim was identified early or you found out about the accident a day later, you probably wouldn't feel the same way.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to sound like a jerk. I'm just stating an observation that I thought was really interesting.",

          "text": "No you totally don't sound like an ass and you bring up a point. Part of it is definitely rooted in the fact that of unknowning who the victim was before the name was officially announced. Part of it also could be because the student was out of state and it could be hard for them to get here because im also an out of state student and I couldn't image what my mom would be going through trying to get here \n\nI guess i should add the context of: \"i really want this month to be over\", alot of other things were going on this month so to me it just feels like this broke my back in the sense.\n\nThough i do want to ask you and a couple of other people in this thread if they don't mind on to why this can't be all empathy? Someone can't be too much of an empathic person? Or do you mean by something else. Sorry if this sounds confusing, let me know if it does and I'll try to clear up as much as i can.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some sentences cause im bad at typing lmaoo",

              "text": "Good question and I didn't clarify about that part. \n\nNow, empathy isn't a sort of level or bar that goes up and down. It's more like a set of conditions that, when fulfilled, makes you feel in certain amounts. The more conditions fulfilled, the stronger the feeling. We often feel more empathy towards people that we relate to than those we don't, even though both people could've been part of our lives the same amount. Like, preferring one friend over the other because you share backgrounds.\n\nI brought this up because from your text, it didn't seem like you had much at all in common with the person. Yet, you felt sad about it in an extreme way (though, you mentioned that this was a difficult month in particular so that should also be taken into account). That's why I dismissed empathy as the cause because it can be very difficult to feel sad for someone who you share little in common, even if you understand how much they suffer. There are limitations to empathy and human emotion in general, otherwise we'd all be crying over all the wars and killings every single day.\n\nHope that clarifies :)",

      "text": "I went to your school for the same program that the student was in. Heard the news, felt bad but tried not to worry about things I didn't (and still don't) know. I was relieved to know that the name wasn't one I was familiar with, but seeing the photos that were released yesterday morning put me back at square one. The whole aviation community has been rocked by the news. To lose a fellow aviator and a fellow Sioux is a rough feeling, even without knowing them. This might sound clich\u00e9, but please reach out to student resources if you need assistance. They're not useless. You can only vent your feelings so much if you limit it to people you know.\n\nAlso, I'm aware that there are many, many rumors going around. I will ask you to please not buy into them until the state and the FAA release their preliminary report via the NTSB. Rumors are rumors and nothing more. I've lost acquaintances due to accidents and this is a part of the process. It's best not to worry yourself over unconfirmed factors, you'll end up beating yourself up and putting yourself down, even if you don't intend to.\n\nTake care of yourself and try keep your head in the game.",

          "text": "Thanks for the message\n\nI know for the school they had a session for everyone to come for about two hours for consuling, healing and discussion on the situation. They did release an email to the aviation students about the intial initial situation, which is how my friend got that into. There was also a vigil for him with the fraternity he was apart of. I remember there being a news reporter there asking questions with some people who were able to speak on the situation. Someone brought up the possibility that this crash was intentional since there was a phone call made before his crash. That could be rumors or factual with no major information or context. Like you said, im waiting to see what the preliminary report says about the situation. I think this also brings a much bigger picture and brings light on the topics of mental health and especially with pilots.",
