I just didn't find any opportunity (internships and careers) within my major, didn't like what I was studying (MIS, reading about wires, charts, and networks), administration drive me up a wall, and I couldn't afford tuiton. I found no use to continue throwing money at a dark hole. \n\nBefore I dropped out I was a business major with an accounting concentration. After taking 2 accounting classes, I just didn't like it. It was stale, tedious and had a heavy work load. I was also in my 3rd year at the time, and couldn't switch to another major, so I decided to stick with business but choose another concentration-managrment of information systems and hated it.  I Didn't know what I was learning, what was going on, or understanding any of the concepts, but I decided to stick through with it since I was nearing my final year. Plus the major doesn't necessarily reflect my career. \n\nWith accounting, I did enjoy learning the language of business. I could care less about wires and networks with management of information systems. \n\nI couldn't get any internships in information systems, but I did get internships in marketing. While marketing wasn't my ideal choice of career or major, I thought that perhaps the experience would get me somewhere. It didn't.\n\nI feel that if I had stuck with accounting, I would have gotten experience and less worry towards a career.\n\nI know my concentration doesn't bind me to that specific field, but I just couldn't land anything even though I had 3\u00b1 years experience in other fields  through unpaid internships, (don't recommend doing) \n\n I do regret choosing my concentration, had I stuck with accounting or switched to finance, I would have probably had opportunity or applied the skills elsewhere.\n\nThis semester, I went back to school at a community college as an engineering major and I'm really anxious about this major. Imposter syndrome and FOMO has kicked in. I don't want to be in the same position I was in the last time. I just don't know what to do.", "author": "TheFriendlyAmoeba", "created": 1609092836, "retrieved": 1632950965, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gh9lpio": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kl8beh/rant_nervous_and_anxious_about_starting_new/gh9lpio/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1609136423, "upvotes": 1}, "gh7j0um": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kl8beh/rant_nervous_and_anxious_about_starting_new/gh7j0um/", "text": "Community college is a great way to go back to school. Cheaper tuition and more flexible class schedules. That being said: What do you want to do? \n\nThis is the most important thing. You regret not studying accounting or finance, yet want to study as an engineering major. You gotta make up your mind about what you want to study, otherwise you will definitely end up in the same situation you were before.", "author": "RainyFL", "created": 1609095519, "upvotes": 11}}}
