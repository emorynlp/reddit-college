  "text": "I'm 18 and a freshman in college and I'm failing all my classes now. Most of the classes I'm taking are gen ed but what's funny is that I'm taking a remedial math class because I failed my TSI test after I studied and worked my ass off to get a satisfying grade and yet, I still didn't pass just by a point or 2. Primarily, I'm taking the same math class but with a different teacher, mind you that the remedial math class that I don't get credit for still costs money so that's more money down the drain for me. Aside from that, I'm enrolling in business administration and I'm currently taking a class for that major but it's a self paste class so I'm not learning anything because we don't have an actual class where the teacher teaches the essentials to us. Hell I'm taking this class and I don't even know what my teacher looks like. It's pointless that I have to go on quizlet just to lookup the answers and complete my assignments that way. But overall, why do we have to take gen ed classes if we already learned them in highschool? If I'm majoring in business then why do I need to take history? Because they're doing it to milk us for our money. In the UK, you only go to college for your major and nothing else. This is bullshit and a waste of time and money.",

I took remedial algebra as well over the summer and used Brian Logan and Organic Chemistry Tutor for help.\n\nI understand your frustration. I\u2019m on YouTube for the 3rd time tonight trying to understand a chemistry concept my prof didn\u2019t explain well. The way I keep going is by just telling myself it is what it is, and try to do the best I can. Good luck to you. You can do it.",

      "text": "I get that its frustrating to have to take a class that doesnt directly help you get your degree but, if you didnt take it you would be lost in the next level of math and either do poorly or fail, and you would end up having to retake it anyway. So thats 2 classes either way (remedial + regular, regular + regular) but the difference is with the first option you dont have a bad grade on your transcript.\n\n>Hell I'm taking this class and I don't even know what my teacher looks like.

Yeah, youre going to be expected to teach yourself material sometimes. The bulk of learning in any class is going to be on your own. A professors job isnt to spoon feed you the material but to guide you through the content and answer clarifiying questions. This is all entirely normal. It would be impossible for a professor to personally ensure every person understands every concept. So you learn it on your own, when you have a specific question then they help you",

Learn a trade. Find an industry you enjoy. \n\nI'm not disagreeing that the American college system can be a scam, but you're under the impression that college during COVID is how it's always been. It's not. This isn't normal. It won't be this way forever. \n\nSeriously though business majors bitching about having to lean to be decent human beings through humanities courses is why America is falling apart at the seams.",

Im pretty sure that a single mom of three struggling to afford her childs insulin is a hell of a lot more stressed than I am about my chem test\n\n>College doesn\u2019t guarantee a job\n\nRight. Good thing colleges dont claim that. They release data about how many graduates find gainful employment soon after graduation \n\nAnd memorization is a very small component of tests for me at least. Memorization is important, theres all sorts of situations where it helps to remember certain things. Every test Ive had, other than math, has questions that require you to actually understand the processess that are happening. I dont know if this is regional or what, theres a lot of shitty things about college but it is not a scam lol. You know exactly what youre getting (a degree) and pay the stated price. If you went to a school that was particularly overpriced or had bad professors, thats one thing, but very few colleges are actually scams",
