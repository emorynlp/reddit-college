  "text": "I live in a double and the people who live next to my side of the room NEVER turn off their alarm in the morning. It usually goes off around 6:30 or 7 am depending on the day and stays ringing for 30mins to an hour. They\u2019re also in a double so I don\u2019t understand if they BOTH manage to sleep through it or??? I\u2019m a relatively light sleeper and the constant ringing is just enough to keep me awake. I\u2019ve tried leaving notes and even contacted the RA but it usually stops for a few days before starting up again \ud83d\ude43 Why the fuck do I have to plan my sleep schedule every day around someone else\u2019s alarm? It\u2019s so frustrating and I\u2019m losing my mind lol. It\u2019s 8:17 am rn and I\u2019ve been up since 6:30 and I have an exam in 2 hours! Thanks guys! <3",

Can\u2019t hear it right next to the truck outside, but it vibrated through the ground and echoed through my whole house.  I went outside at 3 am the next time and said please turn of your radio when you start your car.  He was defensive but I just said thanks!  It never happened again.",

You can still hear things close to you, but they do a great job at blocking out more distant noise. I use them regularly and wake up fine to my own alarm but can sleep through garbage trucks, yard work, and thunderstorms.",

It won't drown out the noise completely but it will dampen it.
