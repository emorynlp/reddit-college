I had to take it online because my school is still online until next year. \n\nI should\u2019ve dropped it the first week. \n\nThe professor I have, for lack of a better word, is a douche. \n\nBut first a little background. \n\nI actually took a class with this guy last spring and I was the only English major since it was a Gen Ed. Gen Ed or not I still needed it for my major. I was probably his least favorite student. \n\nHe was strict, and one time he embarrassed me in front of the whole class, but then the pandemic happened and we went online and he was strict, but he got to be pretty more lenient. \n\nI figured this time would be different. Most professors who are online know we don\u2019t want this so they have stayed lenient or curved their grades. \n\nBoy was I wrong! \n\nI think it\u2019s easier just to list what\u2019s happened this semester rather than describe it:\n- you already know about the English major comment. \n- he did discussion boards and wanted us to post once a day for four days straight and reply once a day. He\u2019s probably the only professor I have that does that. My other professors, so long as you post once by a certain day and then reply twice, you\u2019re fine. \n- I didn\u2019t know that because he\u2019s the only professor who does that and my grade kept suffering. He didn\u2019t tell me until halfway through the semester since I would always post on the last day. \n- he almost reported me for plagiarism because I made a typo with citing a quote on the discussion board and he rigged it so you couldn\u2019t go back and change it. \n- he wouldn\u2019t give a girl with a concussion an extension on her midterm because he gave us two extra weeks (ie he delayed it) and \u201che doesn\u2019t accept late work.\u201d Even though her doctor told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to look at a screen or she\u2019d make it worse. Idk what grade she got but if I was her, I would\u2019ve reported him. \n- he made us do group posts and didn\u2019t change it to anybody could post. \n- He wouldn\u2019t let us skip a final discussion board because all but one person voted.\n- he\u2019s making us do a 9AM zoom call next week. If we can\u2019t attend or choose not to (and to him, being unable to is the same as choosing not to), we have to send him a 3 page paper with one critical source about a passage we read. \n\nThankfully I only have three more weeks.
