I reviewed the topics that are included in the quiz's title. After finishing the quiz, it left me frustrated. Why? BECAUSE NONE OF THE EXPECTED TOPICS WERE IN THE QUIZ ITEMS. The quiz items were all about the preview lessons - Good right? NO! The quiz's title clearly stated the topics that the students should be reviewing. It is understandable to add items from the previous lessons but not including items from the new lessons is just a JOKE and an INSULT to those putting the effort to review.\n\nI at least passed the test.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nWhat should I do from now on?", "author": "AltairSetsuna989", "created": 1631774111, "retrieved": 1632841041, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"hd1tex1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp7zxh/none_of_the_expected_topics_were_covered_by_the/hd1tex1/", "text": "Thank you u/AltairSetsuna989 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had this happen in my speech class. She asked questions that were not covered at all in the reading for that week. She used a lot of vocabulary that was also not included in the chapters. I am currently procrastinating on my sociology exam because a lot of students on rate my professor said he included material that was not covered in the reading. I don\u2019t understand why they do this \ud83e\udd2c\nI would email the professor and tell them every single question that does not relate to the materials provided for the week.
