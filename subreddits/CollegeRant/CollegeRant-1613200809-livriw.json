Those things happen regardless whether you go to or finish college or not.  College is easier in the end than being stuck in a job that you despise, with miserable people who also despise their jobs.  In the end, having a college degree will help you land better jobs, in your profession or not.  You will find higher paying jobs in your profession or not.  It gives you a heck of a lot more options and possibilities than someone without a degree.  I think you may just need a change in perspective and attitude, it makes things easier.

You'll be at square 1 regardless of a bachelor's degree anyways, and job searches are a complete bitch unless you have recommendations/offers lined up.\n\nI was failing classes during my junior year to the point I'd decided to cut my classes down to 4/semester to 3. then to 2. Did fine at 2, so I went back up to 3 and failed another course and broke down mentally. Whatever identity crisis that was plaguing me for those 5+ years I'd been in uni caught up with me in full scale to the point I just went AWOL from uni.   \n\n\nI didn't take any classes for months and eventually got my shit together to at the very least man up to get an associates degree just to show for SOMETHING. I could pad my resume with relevant courses I'd taken from university anyways. Who the hell is going to care about the irrelevant forced History/Government classes you took when applying to a job? It's just there to suck out more money from you.

And the thing is, if you're good at what you do, whatever it is you want to do, you'll have a portfolio made by the time you're out of college.
