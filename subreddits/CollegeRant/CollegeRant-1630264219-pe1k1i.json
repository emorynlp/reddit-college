  "text": "The textbooks I need to buy are ridiculously overpriced and I know that I\u2019m only going to use them for that one semester, like wtf, wtf. College really is a scam. \n\nDoes anyone know where I can read college textbooks for free and pdf download them or something. Something like the z library which I adore but again why the fuck do some of these books come with an access code for another site that\u2019s not canvas so even if I wanted to pirated it online I still need to buy that access code.",

      "text": "The modern textbook publishing industry is a scam. For those of us professors who can, we try to avoid using newest editions and sites like Pearson or Cengage. Sometimes, that\u2019s not possible or feasible for one reason or another, but it\u2019s no less frustrating. :(\n\nGood luck with everything!",
