  "text": "So I'm on the 4th year of getting my bachelor's in robotics and feeling really tired (even though I don't actually work that hard and other people deserve a break a lot more than me). I really liked some of the earlier parts of the course, like math, electronics, low level programming, but I'm not interested in the major itself. I thought it'd grow on me but it didn't. For my final project I'm gonna need to do mostly high level stuff (computer vision, video processing) and implementation on the hardware. I decided on the general theme of my project before I learned that I hate neural networks after having to work with them for a semester (maybe I'm mistaken and I should learn to love them and power through this?). I want to change the topic of my final project but there's less than 8 months left and I don't feel confident in my abilities to do anything at all, so coming up with something new and changing the topic seems risky. At least the current stuff is somewhat familiar. \n\nOn the bigger scale I don't feel competent enough to enter any sort of work force, and thinking of grad school makes me sick (though it's more about still being dependent on my parents than the school itself). The only thing I'm still able to focus on regarding my studies is EE/electronics but it is barely touched upon this semester so it's mostly a distraction, and I'm not even good enough at it to pursue it professionally after the uni. \n\nHas anyone here been/is in a similar situation? Also, how do you stop dreading getting a job and making an absolute fool of yourself because after college you're at best *familiar* with what you were supposed(?) to get a good grasp of?\n\nTL;DR: General feelings of dissatisfaction with my major and my final project theme. Not feeling ready to enter the work force even though the school is almost over.",
