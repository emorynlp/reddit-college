During this time, I had many breakdowns (who doesn't?) and watched a lot of my friends and peers also struggle. Immature roommates, professors that are hard asses, so on and so on. I've watched people sink thousands into two years of a degree and then decide it wasn't right for them and just drop out one day. I've seen others who picked a major, such as music, not knowing that the only real career path they could take was pursuing a Ph.D. in becoming a professor. (This is what they've expressed to me, not my assumptions). So instead of signing up for the traditional 4 year degree, they suddenly realize by year 3 that they will need a masters and then a ph.d. And suddenly, you're looking at almost an extra decade of student life and no career in sight based on a decision you made when you were 17 years old.\n\nI think Community college should be a must for people perusing undergrad studies. In community college, you can try things out and if you lose money, it's pennies compared to the thousands you might have lost for the same quality of education at a 4 year. In addition, I  feel that people who've went to community college and come to a 4 year as a transfer student seem more mature, seem more ready to take on the workload and deal with stres in a more mature way. Quite frankly, I think students who've went to community college are benefiting way more and making the most out of their education vs. the 18 year old freshmen who has to learn several life transitions ontop of coursework.", "author": "Fiery_Tigress", "created": 1615645152, "retrieved": 1632842746, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 324, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gqstgzy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m4763x/unpopular_opinion_at_least_to_my_parents/gqstgzy/", "text": "Thank you u/Fiery_Tigress for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The classes are in the evening so I can work all day or have all day to work on homework. Sure I'm not getting the college experience but I don't miss it because I'm getting to gain experience in my field during the day. My bff went to a uni all four years and she had so many problems with roommates and living that it was a nightmare each time cause she would be basically forced to live with people she didn't get along. She also spent way more money than I did for pretty much the same experience (she didn't really do much other than work and class). The community college also has smaller class sizes that I feel like you're bound to make a connection with at least one person or small group that is in the same field or major as you. You're also more likely to have more one-on-one time with instructors who are also more accessible. The same thing with satellite campuses. Class sizes are way smaller and you're pretty much going to know who is in your classes and walk away knowing the instructor's first name.

So they KNOW you're at least gonna show up for a year so they make it the most expensive, then you take 2 years of gen eds and end up not fully realizing that you're not gonna like your major until you're exclusively doing classes related to your major and realize you hate it. By then it's been 2 years down the drain. I know this doesn't apply to everyone but it happened to literally all of my friends as well as my family. Meanwhile I changed my major 3 times in comm college and was behind as fuck but I at least went to university knowing what I wanted to do and not having to pay more to live in a dorm.
