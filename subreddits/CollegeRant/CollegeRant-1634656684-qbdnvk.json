  "text": "I couldn't study much for the exam I'm about to take in like an hour (I'm on a 5 min break so this is rushed) because I have had so many exams to do this week, assignments, and a part 2 take-home exam that required me to spend more time on that and less studying. I was also absent for a week due to the death of a family member so there's also stuff that's on this exam I haven't learned. Ugh. It's too much. I'm hoping one bad grade won't screw me over but what's with all these assignments that are suddenly being assigned?  My classes used to be just exams and quizzes and now I have to skip classes so I can get my Assignments done AND study. wish me luck. Please.    \n\nTL;DR: I'm screwed because I haven't been able to study for my back to back exams because I've been given lots of assignments and take home exams (part 2  types). I've had to skip classes and please wish me luck lol.",
