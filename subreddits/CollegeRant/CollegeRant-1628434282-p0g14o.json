I\u2019m a bio major, pre-veterinary.\n\nI\u2019ve had a busy summer and have been juggling a few responsibilities, really not much of a break. My anxiety\u2019s sky high already (something I\u2019ve struggled with my whole life, nothing much I can do about it) and although I usually look forward to going back to school, it\u2019s going to be stressful.\n\nI failed o-chem I sophomore year due to a deep mental health spiral \u2014 not uncommon, I\u2019ve had several major episodes of depression  these past three years of school and I just manage to pull myself out somehow without telling much to anybody. I had to retake it junior year and passed both ochem I and II. My parents have no clue, they think I passed the first time around. It\u2019s better if they just don\u2019t find out, I don\u2019t want to disappoint them any more than I think I have. I\u2019ve been beating myself up for this forever. \n\nNow, because of my academic fuck-up, I\u2019m taking biochem alongside physics I (vet schools require a whole year..fun), a thesis class, and advanced human anatomy (closest thing to animal anatomy) this fall, along with the labs. I also have a chem minor so after biochem I have to take another chem course like advanced biochem, p-chem, etc. things I\u2019m definitely not smart enough for.\n\nIf I fail any of those courses I won\u2019t be able to graduate on time. My family is eagerly awaiting my graudation in spring and they actually think I\u2019m smart and capable enough to get accepted into vet school the first time around. It\u2019s really nice of them to have so much faith in me but I really don\u2019t know if I can do it.\n\nI really wish I could talk to someone. I\u2019m too afraid to tell my parents because they may think I\u2019m incapable of any kind of stress at all. I just don\u2019t know how to face this semester in particular. I don\u2019t want any blunt words about just doing it or sucking it up. I try to mention how my anxiety affects me every day and my parents just accept it\u2019s just my personality and that if I\u2019ve made it this far with a 3.5 cumulative GPA and dean\u2019s lists most semesters then Im completely, totally okay. They ramp up my accomplishments so much to people they talk to and it hurts. I\u2019m not good enough.\n\nTL;DR: anxiety\u2019s been bad this whole summer and my fall semester is jam packed due to my failure sophomore year. I\u2019m applying to vet school and don\u2019t have much hope in myself and really want to reach out for help but don\u2019t know how and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fail or go into another episode of depression again.", "author": "liminal_fangs", "created": 1628434282, "retrieved": 1632841656, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h86akxz": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p0g14o/just_worried/h86akxz/", "text": "Thank you u/liminal_fangs for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Find someone at your school to talk to. Most places have counsellors to talk to, if you aren't sure - reach out to the health center on campus. Perhaps they can refer you to someone to prescribe anti-anxiety meds.\n2. Vet schools don't care if you have a minor - really they don't. Take the classes you need and don't worry about anything other than biochemistry\n3. It's not unusual to take more than four years for college.  I don't know your family, but most parents are understanding.  You can tell them you got behind or had to retake a class because your GPA wasn't great in Organic.\n4. Are you applying to Vet school now? I know the cycle opened earlier this summer. Applications are stressful, this is part of the reason so many people do a gap year.  It would also help you get more animal experience and get your mental health in a better place.  If you think undergrad is hard, Vet school will be 3X harder.  Don't be afraid to talk to Vet school admissions about this - they can tell you where your application is weak. If you want to do a gap year or take a 5th year in undergrad you can use this information to explain it to your family.\n5. Do you have a pre-vet advisor? Maybe they can provide some wisdom too.\n6. You are good enough - it's OK to take more time - especially if you will be in a better place mentally.", "author": "BiochemBeer", "created": 1628455282, "upvotes": 6}, "h87d8ab": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p0g14o/just_worried/h87d8ab/", "text": "Ya know, so many people graduate late colleges have started tracking their six year graduation rate. Better to make sure you graduate one semester late, than try and push beyond what your mental health can manage. Please be careful. Graduating on time with a crippling breakdown isn\u2019t great prep for grad school. \n\nAlso, consider talking to your parents. This is something they\u2019d like to support you through in 99% of cases. Above all they want you happy and healthy, it sounds like you\u2019re neither, but think it\u2019s what they want.

Same major, failed the same course (hell, failed it thrice), feeling like I won't get into vet school, in senior year (though I was supposed to graduate this year)-- I would say you could vent to me, but I can be flakey and you may need someone consistent. \n\nI'm here to tell you it's okay though. Uni has been hard for everyone, especially with COVID running amok. Take a deep breathe, and try to face this as head on as you can. Don't overload yourself with plans, decisions, and fuck ups. Take it one day at a time.\n\nMake a plan. O-Chem and physics will be hard together--Promise yourself that:\n- as *SOON* as ou get on campus that you'll make an appointment with counselling services to work on methods to mitigate your anxiety. And that when you feel stressed you'll talk it out with them and give yourself ample breaks\n\n- You'll go to the office hours to ask questions or just go over what you know and what you do and don't know\n\n- You'll attend study sessions and tutoring lessons to keep you on top of things.\n\nDid you already apply for vet school or are you applying for the next cycle? If not, maybe you should consider a gap year your get yourself together--I mean, that's what I'm planning to do, but in the end do you, you know? If you did, do you have a professor that's a veterinarian (or was)? \nMaybe reach out to them and ask for advice or mentorship.\n\nAs for telling people you'll be graduating late?--Truthfully for me it was hard. I cried, I was scared, I thought my parents would convince me to switch, or that they would be mad, or compare me to my friends and family who graduated hs with me.\n\nBut they were much more compassionate that I expected. When I approached them with my issues, and the prospects of graduating late they were disappointed, but they appreciated me being honest. If your parents aren't as compassionate, don't worry about it.\n\nRemember that everyone's journey will be different. Also, you're fellow pre-vet students know the deal. If you're close with some of your major-mates, maybe ask if anyone would be interested in a vent or friendship circle.", "author": "NoodleEmpress", "created": 1628444085, "upvotes": 11}, "h86ufx3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p0g14o/just_worried/h86ufx3/", "text": "I honestly think it sounds like you\u2019ve done really well despite the setbacks you\u2019ve endured!

Your mental health and wellbeing are more important in the long run than what you family views as your success or lack of. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s going to have to live with your decisions for the rest of time, so be good to yourself and give yourself a break if you need it.", "author": "Crochitting", "created": 1628443614, "upvotes": 21}}}
