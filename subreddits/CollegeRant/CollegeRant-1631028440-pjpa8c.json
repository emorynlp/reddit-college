  "text": "Ok sorry if you disagree with me so don't attack me but I just need to vent. AHHHHHH!!!! I HATE teachers that answer your questions with another question what the hell is wrong with these people??? I get it if they are trying to make you think but when it's a simple question that I need to know the answer to like what units do we use for this specific thing? Then they tell me.. well with the info I have given you you should be able to figure it out. Well no!!! I cannot figure it out because I've been looking at all of the damn homeworks and papers and online stuff you have given me and googled everything and I cannot get a clear answer anywhere and since you are grading my work I want to know what you want from me!!! Can you just give me one clear answer because that is why I am asking you a freaking question!!! \n\nOk I'm done now thank you for letting me vent.\n\nTl;Dr I hate it when teachers don't answer a question clearly and instead respond with a question.",

          "text": "Yep-- I've taught students and I've done the \"answer a question with a question\" thing but the key is to ask questions that the student knows the answer to and that will lead them to the answer to the question they have. The point is to guide them in the right direction so they can learn what questions to ask themselves the next time they get stuck in the same situation.\n\nHonestly, though, as a teacher if all we're doing is teaching students to regurgitate information then we're not really doing our job. Like when I was teaching piano I had so many kids that just wanted me to show them how a piece went so they could copy it and then they'd get all whiny when I made them learn how to actually read the music. Years later when they were way ahead of their peers they didn't complain though.",

That's usually an issue that a lot of professors have. Most of them don't actually have a pedagogical or teaching degree, which is why they suck at teaching and do these dumb things.",
