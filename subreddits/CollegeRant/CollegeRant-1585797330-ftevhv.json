There are so many \"little\" quizzes and tests that you only have a few hours to complete after the lecture is posted, the professors seem to be \"empowered\" or something by prerecorded lectures and have been posting multiple lectures for one day (and quizzes after each one) or one lecture that goes waay over the amount of time they would actually lecture in person.\n\nIf that isn't bad enough all my professors are extremely disorganized, i understand that this is a transition for them too but its kind of ridiculous to expect us to be able to navigate their mess. Tons of emails so important stuff gets lost, some of my professors have posted the entire quarters worth of work online at once but not specified whats for week 1, 2, 3, etc. they expect us to have the textbooks NOW but the book store is closed, most people aren't even on campus anymore, and places like amazon are prioritizing shipping essential items and taking longer with others. Also because of the strike, some of my TAs are withholding grades and not doing section, or section has been broken up into sub groups for a certain time (like Wednesday section at 4pm is now group A 4pm, group B 4:15pm, etc) so you have to remember what sub group youre in.\n\nI dont know, just wanted to vent. Is anyone else dealing with this? Im so confused with whats due when, what sections i need to go to, what is supplemental and whats required, etc. Ive emailed a few professors and TAs but theyre vague or just flat out say theyre not sure yet (but the assignment is still due) You would think theyd go easier on us, or does UCSB just not give a shit?", "author": "SheriffSpooky", "created": 1585797330, "retrieved": 1632843265, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fmgdj3f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ftevhv/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_profs_are/fmgdj3f/", "text": "I'm in community college and so far it hasn't actually been that much different for me, maybe slightly more work but still not too much and very manageable.
