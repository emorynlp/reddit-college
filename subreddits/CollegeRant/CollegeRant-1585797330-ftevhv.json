  "title:": "Does anyone else feel like their profs are assigning way more work online?",
  "text": "My quarter just started Monday and i'm already behind. There are so many \"little\" quizzes and tests that you only have a few hours to complete after the lecture is posted, the professors seem to be \"empowered\" or something by prerecorded lectures and have been posting multiple lectures for one day (and quizzes after each one) or one lecture that goes waay over the amount of time they would actually lecture in person.\n\nIf that isn't bad enough all my professors are extremely disorganized, i understand that this is a transition for them too but its kind of ridiculous to expect us to be able to navigate their mess. Tons of emails so important stuff gets lost, some of my professors have posted the entire quarters worth of work online at once but not specified whats for week 1, 2, 3, etc. they expect us to have the textbooks NOW but the book store is closed, most people aren't even on campus anymore, and places like amazon are prioritizing shipping essential items and taking longer with others. Also because of the strike, some of my TAs are withholding grades and not doing section, or section has been broken up into sub groups for a certain time (like Wednesday section at 4pm is now group A 4pm, group B 4:15pm, etc) so you have to remember what sub group youre in.\n\nI dont know, just wanted to vent. Is anyone else dealing with this? Im so confused with whats due when, what sections i need to go to, what is supplemental and whats required, etc. Ive emailed a few professors and TAs but theyre vague or just flat out say theyre not sure yet (but the assignment is still due) You would think theyd go easier on us, or does UCSB just not give a shit?",

      "text": "I'm in community college and so far it hasn't actually been that much different for me, maybe slightly more work but still not too much and very manageable. In general everything's still manageable despite being online. So far my professors haven't been posting any other lectures except for the one that replaces the class that's supposed to be posted. So far none of my professors have been going over the time limit for their lectures. \n\nI also already have the textbooks that I need. So far everything's very organized for me. \n\nI can't believe how lucky I am so far. Maybe community colleges are better than four years as of right now? \n\nBut, still I understand why you're complaining and feeling overwhelmed about everything.",

In fact, one of my profs just posted \"I'm expecting a much higher standard on the final since you're doing it at home\".

It\u2019s very hard to do anything academic with screaming going on around you. This isn\u2019t a vacation and, especially at a higher level, students aren\u2019t going to choose to just not care about their grades any more. All the little quizzes are an unnecessary stress. I understand some professors are passionate and don\u2019t just want to give their students a \u201cfree pass\u201d, and I\u2019m not suggesting that, but this is an exceptional time where people at best have to grapple with extreme anxiety regarding their at risk loved ones (or themselves) or at worst have unstable/toxic living conditions. Just trust your students to actually do the reading and listen to the lectures, the almost micromanaging is nerve wracking, especially if it\u2019s coming from 4 or 5 professors at once.",
