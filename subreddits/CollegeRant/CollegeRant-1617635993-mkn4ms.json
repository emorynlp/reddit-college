And you're a pianist? (I am a piano major) so you have to memorize rep for juries/performances. Painful...\n\nThey work us so hard that spending the whole day in the music building straight from 8am-8pm or later everyday is normal... I'm sure someone told you this already but please NEVER forget what brought you to music in the first place. Unfortunately, Music Ed wasn't my passion so it felt like pure shit and I left the degree... But the students who choose music are VERY resilient people. Be able to see through all the stressful academic bs and mental testing they'll force you through and make the experience your own. You can get through this!\n\n It will feel SO good completing semesters from hell like this one, and you'll be even stronger for the next semester. I believe in you!
