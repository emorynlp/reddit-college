  "text": "I went to talk to my RA about changing rooms today. I just don\u2019t know if I should or not. My roommate is very messy and I have OCD so I always come back to our room stressed and I am the only one that cleans. She also has her girlfriend over everyday and she stays the night often. She uses my stuff without asking anymore. + I go home every weekend and come back to the dorm trashed. Should I change rooms or is this just normal? I am in the library late every night studying because I can\u2019t study in my own room bc her and her girlfriend are so loud. Also can\u2019t take a shower half the time in our dorm bc her girlfriend showers EVERY DAY in our dorm. I keep sending signals that I\u2019m pissed without the awkward tension. Should I just move rooms this weekend?",
