I\u2019m just...extremely terrified of everything going on right now.\n\nI\u2019m worried about my friends, I\u2019m worried about my school and if everything will be safe, I\u2019m worried about my fellow students and if the people in the city will be safe, and more. It\u2019s just a horrible experience right now, I\u2019m horrified to see how this affects me and the rest of the students academically. \n\nIf you\u2019re in South Louisiana during this time, please stay safe. Please evacuate if you haven\u2019t already...I pray that everything will be alright for us.\n\nEdit: Just an update, Laura hit pretty hard this morning at 1 AM. From what I understand, my Uni is in severe condition. One building is completely gone, the roof has been ripped off of one the dorm buildings, another building was deroofed, and the whole campus is in shambles. Please keep us in your thoughts, it seems my worst fears came true.

As a fellow college student amid Corona, I can relate to you partly--it took so much for me to get here. I can only imagine how it is for you, going through all that and then getting evacuated must be awful. Times like this I can only wrap my head around the fact that I can only live in the present and let the rest of the worries melt away.
