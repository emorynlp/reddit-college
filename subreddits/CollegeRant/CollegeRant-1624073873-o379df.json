      "text": "You just answered yourself \"Life is a struggle\". I'm not fresh out of high school like most traditional college students are.  I am in my late twenties. I  went straight into the work force as a mechanic for automation, factories, etc. learning a skill after high school.  I decided  to go to college after seeing that I wanted to be an engineer and working with them first hand at my company. When it came time for exams or tests I easily noticed the cringe and sighs from classmates when the amount of content that was going to be on it ranged from chapter a to chapter z. 18 year old me would have done the same but me know understands this is what it is and real world \"unfair life\" moments are worse and oh boy surprising of all kinds can be \"fun\". Life isn't easy. \n\nWorking in a full time job where there are deadlines,  quotas to be met, lazy coworkers, calling out coworkers, back stabbing coworkers, horrible and incompetent managers/ bosses, surprise \"forced\" overtime, numbers over quality performance environments, etc. , having a test with broad ranges of topics covered without the prof not telling you 100% what is on it isn't so bad. If anything its a good way to get students into the mindset of a \"challenging\" or not \"fair\" work mindset for when they graduate, they can't say \"wow I didn't know the real world was like this\". But this is me now thinking like this, I don't know how old you are but 18 year old me would have thought exactly the same as what your subject line states.",

In the humanities it's not uncommon to assign readings and expect the students to distill the important points on their own.  It's not a skill that everyone is born with, so some definitely struggle in the intro classes.  However, those classes provide opportunities to practice how to read and process information, which prepares students for reading assignments in upper-level classes.",
