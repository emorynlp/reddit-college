I\ufe0f deleted tik tok and im basically always doing something.\n\nPartying is pretty easy to manage since most people start going out at 11pm\u2026 So you do work up until then. Also I\ufe0f force myself to be up by 10am the latest the next day.\n\nNot the healthiest solution, but that\u2019s one way to do it",
