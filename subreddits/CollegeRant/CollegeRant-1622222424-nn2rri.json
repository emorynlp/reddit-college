I don't know what to do.", "text": "Apologies in advance - this may seem a little all over the place.\n\nFor context, I (21F) graduated high school in 2018. I did really well in school and always wanted to go to college, but my family is poor and always has been, so I wasn't sure if college was in the cards for me.\n\nThe plan at the time of my graduation was to take a gap year or two so I could learn how to drive and get a full-time job. That is... until I realized how debilitating my anxiety is. \n\nI hadn't learned how to drive yet because, for some reason, even *thinking* about being behind the wheel would cause me to panic. But the longer I waited, the worse it got, and the harder it was to even schedule driving lessons. So, long story short, now I'm 21 and still can't drive.\n\nAnd, super conveniently, I have a similar fear with working. I've had a couple different jobs, but have ultimately left all of them because of the toll they had on my mental health. We're talking sobbing, hyperventilating, and full-on panic attacks before work every. single. day. \n\nEvery second I spent outside of work, I was worrying about having to go back into work. I'd panic as the minutes passed by, my free time slipping away second by second.\n\nSo now I'm 21, don't have a job, don't drive, and my whole life consists of my fiance, my mom, my brother, and my therapist.\n\nWith the encouragement of said therapist, and after a year of unsuccessfully trying to manage my anxiety around driving and work, I finally decided to go to college. I've known I wanted to go, and it would provide me with a way to step outside my comfort zone and grow while still doing something that I'm passionate about (learning). Maybe it could even give me the needed push to finally learn how to drive, or provide an opportunity for employment that I don't hate.\n\nI've applied to my local community college, I've filled out the FAFSA, and I know financial aid is supposed to cover my costs 100% for my first two years... but I'm stuck.\n\nI can't drive right now. I can't work right now. What if I never can? How do I navigate that? \n\nOr what if I CAN work, but it has to be the exact right fit - how do I find that perfect fit when I quite literally cannot afford to figure it out by trial and error?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know my interests. They're just not usually profitable unless you go for a Master's or higher - and I'm not even interested in most of the suggested career paths in these areas, at least not right now, although I realize that's subject to change.\n\nI know a lot of people might think that maybe college just isn't good choice for me, but learning truly is my passion. The classroom tends to be where I'm most comfortable. It's the only way I can see out of my current stagnation. The thought of going back to school finally has me excited about my future!\n\nBut the weight of the possibility of failure is heavy on my mind. I don't doubt I'll do well in school, I just worry about how to pay for schooling after my first two years... and all the stuff that comes after I graduate.\n\nI don't even know how to properly prepare for my future. Advisors want you to pick a career and work backwards to figure out your course map. Students and teachers tell you not to worry too much about it because you'll figure it out as you go.\n\nBut truly, how do you navigate a situation where you don't know what your end goal is AND you don't have the resources required to be able to figure that out organically?\n\nTL;DR: I'm 21 and starting college late as a low-income student with severe anxiety. I know my interests, I know what I want to learn, I just don't know if I can pay for school or even make it in the traditional workforce. I'm lost and overwhelmed and don't know what to do.\n\nI don't quite know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a sense that things will turn out okay? Or confirmation that I'm not the only one who feels overwhelmed by this whole system? Resources? Anything, really.\n\nIf you made it all the way to the end, thank you.", "author": "celestialcynic", "created": 1622222424, "retrieved": 1632950388, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 175, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzwy1pl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nn2rri/i_feel_so_unprepared_and_im_terrified_of_failure/gzwy1pl/", "text": "If you're most comfortable with a school environment, perhaps you should consider a career in teaching.", "author": "SadWolverine24", "created": 1622325754, "upvotes": 1}, "gzw0dtu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nn2rri/i_feel_so_unprepared_and_im_terrified_of_failure/gzw0dtu/", "text": "It might help to switch your question from \u201cWhat do I want to *be*?\u201d to \u201cWhat do I want to *do*?\u201d Lots of people work jobs in fields they aren\u2019t super passionate about, but they love their job because they\u2019re well-suited to their *job role and responsibilities*. Keep your eyes and mind open to what this might mean for you. When you\u2019re working, consider what parts of the jobs you love and don\u2019t care for.

When you have bad anxiety, one of your go-to coping mechanisms is to plan ahead, so I realize this is a *big* ask for you. Open your mind and your eyes to opportunities that open around you. Almost no one goes into college knowing their life plan. If along the way, you consider practicality in your decision-making, as well as following what interests you, you can avoid a lot of college financial pitfalls.

It's not as bad as your mind is making it out to be! Also, you're mentioning a lot of worries about the future. Well, you won't know how that'll turn out until you just continue to live your life and time passes on. So, might as well just try something! You said you know what you like...you can look up possible careers based on those areas and just keep them in the back of your mind. Maybe shadow/volunteer instead of working while doing classes or during breaks. It's okay not to know what you want to do. People sometimes never know what they want to do and just work a bunch of different jobs. That's okay. You'll be okay.\n\nI also feel failure...it's one of my biggest fears.

I became a college professor. I feel most comfortable in the classroom, always have, young people make me angry, so college seemed to be the only place I wanted to be to work. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t have crippling anxiety. Quote the opposite, in fact. My wife is jealous of how chill I am in nearly every situation (however I am known to rant and get irritated from time to time). But, anxiety never affects my day to day. I never worry that things won\u2019t just always be okay.\n\nHowever, I could tell that I wouldn\u2019t be happy doing any job I thought about. I have worked many jobs on the way to teaching college. Most of them I worked in the understanding that they were stepping stones that would take me there. Mowing lawns, working at a bookstore, waiting tables, working at a distribution center, etc. I didn\u2019t like any of these jobs, but I knew they were temporary. Now, I\u2019m where I want to be.\n\nCurrently, I am off of work. Have been for three weeks. I have about 17 weeks of intense work in the fall and spring, one or two easy classes to teach in the two summer semesters, and the rest of the time off. I make my own classes, lessons, syllabus...I teach them what I think is most important to learn in each subject.\n\nLike you, I always loved school. I never wanted to leave.

Not only does it look good to employers, but it\u2019s an opportunity for you to learn new skills, push you outside of your comfort zone, and explore a potential career path. It\u2019s easier to go from college to internship to job than college to a full time job. I would definitely recommend getting an internship before you graduate!

I do think that it\u2019s also often time peer pressure which is forcing us somehow to finish things super-fast while in reality we do have enough time to complete them.\n\nI\u2019ve also struggled my whole life with social anxiety and mental health, but when I saw other girls in my age working perfectly fine (even though they had their issues or worse) I somehow swapped my mindset and live by the motto \u201ethe only way out is through\u201c. I do have to admit that this kind of mindset implementation doesn\u2019t work overnight - you just have to do you. Time won\u2019t stop and as you grow older, you will find that there is no use sometimes to worry about something, as life is life and you can\u2019t avoid every confrontation and uncomfortable settings.\n\nLife\u2019s pretty short so I\u2019m happy you\u2019re seeing a therapist and really hope you\u2019ll get on track by feeling less overwhelmed and more yourself.

There are so many forms to fill out and application steps to go through, it can almost seem like it\u2019s not worth it at first, but given time I\u2019m sure you will find a job that does not cause you too much anxiety.
