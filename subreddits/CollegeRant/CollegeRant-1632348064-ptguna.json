  "text": "I know people are going to say they're there so you can become a wElL rOuNdEd PeRsON or whatever, but isn't that what the past 12 years of school was for???? I think that general ed classes are good for people who still aren't 100% sure what they want to do yet and want to keep exploring, but WHY are they required for everyone regardless of their major???\n\nI am a music performance major. I am 100% sure I will not change my mind on going into a music career. I've known for years that this is what I want to do and I do not see myself doing anything else. So WHY do I need to take algebra or history to get my MUSIC degree???? I feel like I'm not really learning anything in those classes tbh, rather just going through the motions to pass them so I can, you know, graduate in time.\n\nSo far the three general ed courses I've taken are algebra, writing, and US history. I did manage to pass these classes, but that's not really the point. It's that I feel like these are just wasted energy that could go towards my major instead. Last year when I took algebra, I remember spending HOURS doing the homework on ConnectMath, only to end up with a low score. And I'm not even bad at math. I've done well in math in the past. The class was just very difficult. Why did I need to spend that amount of time and energy into a class that had nothing to do with my major whatsoever???? When all that time could've gone towards practicing orchestra music or my jury repertoire???? But nooo, I HAD to study for that algebra test because I HAD to take the class in case all that stress would make me love it so much that I'd want to switch my major to it. (I don't hate math, by the way, I actually like it when it's not so stressful, just not so much that I want to major in it.)\n\nAnd my writing class, that's another class that required too much of my time. (I also have to take another semester of it sometime in the next 2 1/2 years because I'm required to take it for 2 semesters, yayyy \ud83d\ude43) We had 5 papers assigned to us throughout the semester. I drained so much of my energy on each one. Why the heck do I have to know APA or MLA format or whatever???? When is this ever going to be important for my future career in performance????\n\nAnd let me rant about US history. No matter what, I cannot get interested in history. I know history majors are probably going to downvote for me for this, but it's just personally not my cup of tea. And it never has been. Even if I wasn't 100% sure I'd stay in music, I know that I'd never go into history. It's just not my thing. Yet, I NEED to take that class in order to graduate. I feel like I spent way too much time and energy on each of the assignments (they each took a couple hours on average) but I had to because that's the only way I could pass. And frankly I'm not here to do history, I'm here to do music.\n\nI know the reasons for these classes is to expand our horizons, but why require them??? Honestly, taking a class that has nothing to do with my major just because I have to will only make me more apathetic to it. I feel like these classes should be available to anyone who wants to take it out of interest, or to explore ideas of what they want to do. I shouldn't HAVE to take a US history class to graduate with a degree in something that has zilch to do with history whatsoever.\n\nTL;DR: General ed courses are in my opinion a waste of time and energy that could instead go into honing my craft and focusing on my major.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a *hard* pill to swallow, but the vast majority of music majors (I\u2019m a junior composition major at a pseudo-conservatory who\u2019s going to pursue a masters\u2019 in a separate field so I have vaguely steady income) aren\u2019t going to have any semblance of a successful career in music. The field is so oversaturated with extremely skilled musicians to the point that traditional jobs requiring specialization (orchestral career, chamber musician, soloist) are effectively impossible to acquire. If you aren\u2019t capable of basic communication and arithmetic - two things VITAL for a freelancer - then career prospects are even more grim. You\u2019ve got to have more than just \u201cplay music good\u201d under your belt for successful networking. \n\nIf high schools weren\u2019t so bad at successfully educating their students, then I could understand the desire for specialization. Unfortunately, a significant amount of undergrad students aren\u2019t even able to write basic essay or perform even the most simple of critical thought.\n\nGen eds are also a respite from the constant bombardment of classical music that gets thrown at a typical BM. Each semester, I\u2019m usually in 6-7 classes and 5-6 ensembles; there absolutely needed to be moments throughout the week when I could focus on something other than those things - otherwise, burnout or injury would be imminent.",

These general education classes are often required by public institutions so that they can secure federal (and state?) funding.  I attend a state school and I know that's why we require it.  The state's constitution states (haha) that every college student attending a public institution must have a class on either the US or state constitution.

      "text": "Gen Ed courses are extremely important. The purpose of college is to give you a wider outlook on life and give you an education. I want to say that probably the most important general education classes are your mathematics and writing classes. They are intense because they need to be. You need the rigorous background for not only the subject matter that will help you in future classes and life in general, but for the experience they give you in taking difficult classes. \n\nIn the algebra class I teach, many of the problems are taken from real-world scenarios like which phone plan should you choose to save money and how much materials do you need to buy in order to properly complete some sort of common project. It\u2019s really, really important for students to know these things for the real world and if it\u2019s their only math class, it has to cover many things to prepare them for basically any major. Yes, you will use mathematics in music (I used to be a musician too.) not only actually playing music but in the background of things (sorting out bills, budgeting, etc.)\n\nYou might think that K12 prepares you for this, and assuming you\u2019re from the US (given by US History), you are sadly mistaken. It\u2019s lucky that your K12 experience prepared you for the collegiate level but we vastly underfund our K12 schools and overwork our amazing K12 teachers. It\u2019s to the point that many, many students were not given the privilege of being prepared to study at the university level. These Gen Ed classes not only help them get a bit up to speed but also truly give them an environment where they can decide what they want to pursue. It\u2019s very helpful for them.\n\nFinally, I wanted to say that if you are in your first or second year, you most likely will change your major. Statistically, most students change their major I think it was 3-4 times before sticking with one? I know I had changed my major 2 times in undergrad before landing on mathematics and most of my friends ended up doing something way different than they thought they would. It\u2019s extremely important to be exposed to tons of different subjects at specifically the university level to *really* understand what they are about. \n\nI hope this helps and good luck on your university journey!",

HS was easy, many people graduate without barely doing much. In college nobody hold your hand and you will have consequences if you don't do something - this is to prepare you as a good employee (most people i worked with who only finished HS were not as reliable as those who had college level education). \n\nCollege if for people who want to learn. Who choose that they wanna learn specific stuff. For adults not whining babies who cry over the fact that they have to do homework.

Many freshman don't have basic writing skills, and if I make the class too challenging, those students are left behind because they never learned it the first time. Plus, no one reads and few people are comfortable with argumentation, so making a writing course more challenging turns out to be difficult. There's a remedial element sure, because colleges want know that students have at least the basic skill set.",

And the frustration is real with how much time general ed classes take away from focusing on practicing and being a music major, especially performance. There are simply not enough hours in a day to do it all at times. Rant about it, get the frustration out! \n\nHere\u2019s some helpful hints:\n\nThe writing classes, and all the writing do will have practical applications. You will have to learn APA or MLA for later classes, and while it\u2019s a pain yo write so many papers now, hopefully it will make the process easier when you have to write papers for your music classes you care about. \n\nHistory \u2014 got nothing other than it\u2019s a class to help practice time management. \n\nMath \u2014 same as above.\n\nAs for all these classes, if you ever plan to go yo grad school for a another or different degree, these general es courses will help count toward meeting qualifications.\n\nThe tough thing about these courses, no one can make you like them. They exist just to check some boxes, and as a result, are not always inspiring for students. But, as a performance major, use these classes as practice for the real world, where you will have to balance music with some other job, other life demands, etc. that\u2019s the best I got for you. Keep ranting when you need to. The good news is the gen Ed classes do end, so hang in there.",

Economics is also a required course for Mechanical Engineering, but other than that- I chose the rest.

It means along with mastering your specific field in upper level courses, they want to make sure that you have basic lower level critical thinking, reading, writing, math, and science skills over a broad variety of subjects. Employers and grad school programs count on that as well. Otherwise you just study music on your own with private instructors, online courses, and it would mean the same thing. You could be just as great a musician. But if you want the degree, you have to do the basic work a degree requires.",

I only have one gen ed course left to take and not once have I used the information I learned in those classes in my music career.\n\nEdit: didnt register that you weren\u2019t calling yourself a music major, oops",

You might want to do some soul searching; philosophy classes make enrollment in part because they are gen ed.\n\nBeyond that, your arguments as so narrow and persumptuous. Example, all art (music included) is political or historical by nature. It is a story. Just because you don't learn it in a music history class dosn't mean it does not exist. In fact, a music major limiting their scope of knowledge to only music history is an injustice to literally every story and culture that professor could not cover in a 15 week course.\n\nYes, there are professionals who can make sure a room is speced right for sound. Better hope you can trust them though if you have zero understanding of how their field works. That kind of ignorance is just waiting to be scammed.\n\nAlso, limiting your knowledge to a simple mathmatical formula is disabling your ability to think critically and solve problems for yourself the moment reality throws a situation your way you wren't given a formula for.\n\nCan one pass muster by taking only courses for their major? Sure. Will that be what helps them become a master at what they do? Not at all. To do that you need to be able to adapt, which requires experiece in multiple disciplines.",

They help students develop a multitude of skills and knowledge so they are ready and prepared to enter society with more wisdom and ability to contribute, influence, and better our communities. They help facilitate critical thinking and understanding of the world and how it and others in it operate. \n\nThat is the difference between a trade school and college. College is more then learning about the one subject you are majoring/interested in as it is giving you the tool kit for life and living in a society, not just your job. Trade school is there to gain the skill and experience of one particular talent/skill someone has. It's to prepare you to do that one job. \n\nAdditionally, GEs are a good way for new students to learn what they want to major in. Many students enter college not knowing what they want to do or what major they wanted. It was thanks to GEs that I discovered my interest in Communication. \n\nPlus, GEs allow you to learn, period. College is a place for learning. Why not learn more!\n\nEdit: spelling, grammer",

People stressing out about GE's is ridiculous because it's just supposed to supplement one's actual interest...\"  \nI would go so far to say that forcing these GE's (graded of course) causes a lot of **resentment** towards the course subjects.",

However, based off if my personal experience most students want the easiest quickest way to a degree. Making GEs just participation means that many if not most will likely not take it seriously and therefore would make them pointless and a waste of time, not to mention defeats the purpose completely. I feel like there could be a way to let it not affect you overall GPA and that would be beneficial and help lower the stress. However, it would likely come at a cost, maybe it means more work (assignments) in the end to ensure adequate deserving participation credit. Nothing in life is free or easy and college is no exception by design as it is there to set you up for lifes shenanigans.",
