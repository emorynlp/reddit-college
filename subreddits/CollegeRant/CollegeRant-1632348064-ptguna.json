I think that general ed classes are good for people who still aren't 100% sure what they want to do yet and want to keep exploring, but WHY are they required for everyone regardless of their major???\n\nI am a music performance major. I am 100% sure I will not change my mind on going into a music career. I've known for years that this is what I want to do and I do not see myself doing anything else. So WHY do I need to take algebra or history to get my MUSIC degree???? I feel like I'm not really learning anything in those classes tbh, rather just going through the motions to pass them so I can, you know, graduate in time.\n\nSo far the three general ed courses I've taken are algebra, writing, and US history. I did manage to pass these classes, but that's not really the point. It's that I feel like these are just wasted energy that could go towards my major instead. Last year when I took algebra, I remember spending HOURS doing the homework on ConnectMath, only to end up with a low score. And I'm not even bad at math. I've done well in math in the past. The class was just very difficult. Why did I need to spend that amount of time and energy into a class that had nothing to do with my major whatsoever???? When all that time could've gone towards practicing orchestra music or my jury repertoire???? But nooo, I HAD to study for that algebra test because I HAD to take the class in case all that stress would make me love it so much that I'd want to switch my major to it. (I don't hate math, by the way, I actually like it when it's not so stressful, just not so much that I want to major in it.)\n\nAnd my writing class, that's another class that required too much of my time. (I also have to take another semester of it sometime in the next 2 1/2 years because I'm required to take it for 2 semesters, yayyy \ud83d\ude43) We had 5 papers assigned to us throughout the semester. I drained so much of my energy on each one. Why the heck do I have to know APA or MLA format or whatever???? When is this ever going to be important for my future career in performance????\n\nAnd let me rant about US history. No matter what, I cannot get interested in history. I know history majors are probably going to downvote for me for this, but it's just personally not my cup of tea. And it never has been. Even if I wasn't 100% sure I'd stay in music, I know that I'd never go into history. It's just not my thing. Yet, I NEED to take that class in order to graduate. I feel like I spent way too much time and energy on each of the assignments (they each took a couple hours on average) but I had to because that's the only way I could pass. And frankly I'm not here to do history, I'm here to do music.\n\nI know the reasons for these classes is to expand our horizons, but why require them??? Honestly, taking a class that has nothing to do with my major just because I have to will only make me more apathetic to it. I feel like these classes should be available to anyone who wants to take it out of interest, or to explore ideas of what they want to do. I shouldn't HAVE to take a US history class to graduate with a degree in something that has zilch to do with history whatsoever.\n\nTL;DR: General ed courses are in my opinion a waste of time and energy that could instead go into honing my craft and focusing on my major.", "author": "DanielaThePialinist", "created": 1632348064, "retrieved": 1632950849, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"heia1cf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ptguna/what_is_the_point_of_general_ed_classes/heia1cf/", "text": "Gen ed classes are there to milk you for more cash, as colleges are businesses.

The purpose of college is to give you a wider outlook on life and give you an education. I want to say that probably the most important general education classes are your mathematics and writing classes. They are intense because they need to be. You need the rigorous background for not only the subject matter that will help you in future classes and life in general, but for the experience they give you in taking difficult classes. \n\nIn the algebra class I teach, many of the problems are taken from real-world scenarios like which phone plan should you choose to save money and how much materials do you need to buy in order to properly complete some sort of common project. It\u2019s really, really important for students to know these things for the real world and if it\u2019s their only math class, it has to cover many things to prepare them for basically any major. Yes, you will use mathematics in music (I used to be a musician too.) not only actually playing music but in the background of things (sorting out bills, budgeting, etc.)\n\nYou might think that K12 prepares you for this, and assuming you\u2019re from the US (given by US History), you are sadly mistaken. It\u2019s lucky that your K12 experience prepared you for the collegiate level but we vastly underfund our K12 schools and overwork our amazing K12 teachers. It\u2019s to the point that many, many students were not given the privilege of being prepared to study at the university level. These Gen Ed classes not only help them get a bit up to speed but also truly give them an environment where they can decide what they want to pursue. It\u2019s very helpful for them.\n\nFinally, I wanted to say that if you are in your first or second year, you most likely will change your major. Statistically, most students change their major I think it was 3-4 times before sticking with one? I know I had changed my major 2 times in undergrad before landing on mathematics and most of my friends ended up doing something way different than they thought they would.
