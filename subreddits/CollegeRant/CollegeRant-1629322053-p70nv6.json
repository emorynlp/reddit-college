I have really enjoyed it but no particular field/company/career path has stood out to me yet. People keep asking me at work/family events/school what I plan on doing after I graduate\u2026. and idk about you guys but that question sends such a wave of anxiety through my body. I\u2019ve been in school so long that the idea of having to pick a career so soon seems foreign to me. I know I want to pursue a career in engineering after I graduate but I still have no idea what I really want to do or what kind of engineering work I am interested in. Nothing I have done so far made me feel passionate about it. I\u2019m currently doing work as a manufacturing intern so I just say that i\u2019m interested in this but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s the path I actually wanna take.\n\nDoes anyone else in engineering feel lost in finding a desirable career path/ struggled with this and found their calling? Or feel the same anxiety about answering that post-college question? \n\nWould love to hear some stories to give me some hope that I will find some job or career path I love after I get my degree\n\nTL;DR: stressed engineering student anxious about finding a career path I like after college", "author": "danman9898", "created": 1629322053, "retrieved": 1632841608, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 40, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h9gf5gq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p70nv6/answering_the_dreaded_what_do_you_want_to_do/h9gf5gq/", "text": "Thank you u/danman9898 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
