  "title:": "Answering the dreaded \u201cWhat Do You Want to do After College\u201d Question",
  "text": "Hey guys, \n\nFor some background I am a 22F about to start my senior year in mechanical engineering. I have really enjoyed it but no particular field/company/career path has stood out to me yet. People keep asking me at work/family events/school what I plan on doing after I graduate\u2026. and idk about you guys but that question sends such a wave of anxiety through my body. I\u2019ve been in school so long that the idea of having to pick a career so soon seems foreign to me. I know I want to pursue a career in engineering after I graduate but I still have no idea what I really want to do or what kind of engineering work I am interested in. Nothing I have done so far made me feel passionate about it. I\u2019m currently doing work as a manufacturing intern so I just say that i\u2019m interested in this but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s the path I actually wanna take.\n\nDoes anyone else in engineering feel lost in finding a desirable career path/ struggled with this and found their calling? Or feel the same anxiety about answering that post-college question? \n\nWould love to hear some stories to give me some hope that I will find some job or career path I love after I get my degree\n\nTL;DR: stressed engineering student anxious about finding a career path I like after college",
