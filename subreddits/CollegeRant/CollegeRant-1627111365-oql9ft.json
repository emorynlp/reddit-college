I'm not trying to justify my actions or anything. But this is why I'd prefer it right now if i worked alone. Ah there's just too much baggage. Well I know im not the only one with baggage. I'm insecure, and I'm constantly beating myself up. I've been having a difficulty being interested in things and I don't want to find comfort in my work.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\non the side i hate lying to my friend, im in a discord vc right now with him and I've been trying to sound ok, but in reality im not ok. well ever since he brought up how my group didn't like working with me. I want to sound happy and bubbly but its difficult. i suck at lying as well. ive been keeping my mic on so he heard me typing, i tried telling him that i was just typing about a meme or this fan thing i saw but i know i didnt sound convincing.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nHmm it is of no surprise to me that I am difficult to work with. Work ethic is important yes. But i hate having to give the whole of my soul just to please my group. it's madness. really. I wish i could just have the option of doing things alone. It's better I'm alone because in the end i'll just be a burden to other people. I know that well enough. I wish i just had a choice in all this. if given a group feedback im sure they wouldn't let me have my internship because of this. surely this would disappoint my mother....oh well what can i do. so frustrating.........\n\nLastly i'll come out with it.\n\nWell to my groupmates I've probably appeared lazy and also a crammer. Anything they'd say about me right now is true. Honestly i wish they'd get mad at me. For some reason i wish someone would then I'd actually start doing something.\n\nI'd probably even appreciate it if some random person here in reddit just gave some angry remark. Anything to get me to move.\n\nI hope no one interprets this as self pity because it's not it's really just what i feel.\n\nIn the end i know there are steps that i have to take in order to avoid this. but the gap between what i have to do and what I want is really big and at times confusing. Maybe if i gave it a shot a being a good groupmate there couldve been a chance i would be friends with them....", "author": "Poopybeans227", "created": 1627111365, "retrieved": 1632841727, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"h6ccz78": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oql9ft/i_am_being_a_burden_to_my_groupmates/h6ccz78/", "text": "Thank you u/Poopybeans227 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
