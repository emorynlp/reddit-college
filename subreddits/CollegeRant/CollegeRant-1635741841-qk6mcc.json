  "text": "So, I am entering my last full month of college before graduating in December and am so happy to be out of here. I made the right decision to graduate in 3.5 years, and it feels crazy to be 21 with a bachelor's degree and starting a full time job in a few months. But, looking back on college it was a big disappointment for me. I have some takeaways that I want to rant about.\n\nI came into college thinking it was going to be a life changing experience, expecting to make lifelong friends and thoroughly enjoy it. High school was lonely, as I never felt comfortable trying to make friends because everyone is so fake, and I expected this to change in college, but it is all the same. I have been here for 3.5 years and have not made a single legitimate friend. Zero. It is what it is. I have many acquaintances who I see day to day and say hello to, but then we just move on to the next thing and forget about it. That's the reality. I've actually been very involved on campus in a number of different groups, so I have met so many different people, but have made no truly strong relationships. I also attend a large power 5 school with 30k+ people, so there are so many different types of people you can meet. I feel that, after college, if I were to move to the other side of the US, no one would care. No one would remember me or reach out. It's a weird feeling, but it's the truth, and there are probably many others out there who feel the same way. I just feel like I have not gained anything besides a degree after all this time. And college really does go by fast. \n\nI feel that, from an educational standpoint, college is just a process. In my classes, there is such few work that needs to be done compared to high school. You attend class a few times a week and take away nothing from it. I feel that I could have succeeded in my higher level classes as a high school freshman. At this point, classes are just a waste of time and don't truly teach you important skills and concepts. The whole concept of getting an education is not even a thing anymore. Schools just want to 'process' you through the system and show you off to big time employers to improve the University's status. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but that's the way I see it. \n\nSo, I am very optimistic about what is to come after college. Still disappointed though because I feel robbed, as I wanted to get more out of these past few years. \n\nAnyone else feel the same way?",

I\u2019m also graduating this December after 3.5 years (I went to a community college then transferred to a large school, 60,000+ people) and I\u2019m leaving feeling hardly any more knowledgeable in my major than when I started. Made no friends. A lot of professors are just here to do their own research and don\u2019t actually care about teaching. Had to teach myself a lot too when we were fully remote for Covid. I think this is a completely valid experience, I\u2019m not sure why our society is obsessed with your college years being the peak of your life I\u2019m soo excited to get out of here.",
