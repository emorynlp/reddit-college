They\u2019re not requiring mask or vaccine cards. All students are being encouraged to attend. Covid is up 400% on campus. They barely offered any online classes this term. Also they raised tuition last term. I\u2019m super frustrated because on Tuesday when we go back to class. I\u2019m expected to sit side-by-side with like 40 other people. I don\u2019t even leave my apartment unless I\u2019m going to class. This is the worst school i\u2019ve ever attended. They definitely don\u2019t care about students at all.", "author": "ebonyfootgoddess69", "created": 1630600320, "retrieved": 1632841175, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hbc126f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgldy0/my_school_its_basically_hosting_a_super_spreader/hbc126f/", "text": "Thank you u/ebonyfootgoddess69 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
