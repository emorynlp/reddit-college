I\u2019m in a class in which the school added me into a bit late because I had waitlisted for it, so when I was finally able to join I saw I had a missed assignment. I emailed the professor about whether I\u2019d still be able to turn it in, or if there was something else she\u2019d like me to do. She emailed me saying I could still turn it in for partial credit, and while it sorta sucked I couldn\u2019t get full points since the time I was put into the class was out of my hands, I said thank you and thought it wasn\u2019t worth bothering to ask for full credit.\n\nAnyways, afterwards things have been alright so far in the class and we\u2019ve got this group project and a peer of mine emailed first asking on how we should communicate and I emailed her back on the very same day that we could talk through iMessage. We\u2019ve been communicating for four days now on our group project when today my professor emails me directly that I haven\u2019t been in contact with my peer according to an email she sent to her. I responded politely to the professor that we have been in communication and it may be a misunderstanding since it was another peer of ours that has not been messaging.\n\nMy professor responded immediately, however, she said I was lying and that I am insulting her intelligence by saying what I did!? She then said I\u2019m already behind because I joined the class late, but I\u2019ve been completing the assignments and doing just fine as far as I am aware. Then, just minutes later, she sends a class e-mail saying something along the lines that there are students who think just because they\u2019re not in an actual class they are underestimating her and that they shouldn\u2019t think they can \u201cget away\u201d with things. The timing seems extremely as though this was directed to me. I\u2019m appalled that a professor has such a bad attitude towards her students. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had a problem with her and I want to escalate this. What should I do?\n\n\n**Edit:** To make it worse, the initial email my classmate sent had let the professor know I was the only teammate she was in communication with. She used my name, and then named the other student that we couldn\u2019t get in contact with. I asked my classmate if she could clarify and let the professor know that it wasn\u2019t me, and she said she did. It\u2019s been over 5 hours and the professor hasn\u2019t even contacted me to apologize either.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** So I haven\u2019t sent an email to my professor yet about her response, as I thought I\u2019d still give her some time to read my group member\u2019s email that cleared the misunderstanding. She had received the email during business hours, and has had half of today to apologize about calling me a liar. I\u2019ll be sending an email out today to the department chair.\n\n\n**Edit 3:** Sent my email to the department chair. Thanks to everyone. I\u2019m still in shock about her response and think it was extremely unprofessional. Honestly I didn\u2019t expect an explicit \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d message, but at least something from her behalf about saying her previous email was a misunderstanding would\u2019ve been polite. It was so uncalled for to accuse me of lying, and I made sure to provide concrete evidence as well as mention how being called a liar made me feel. Thanks again for the help everyone, it means a lot as a freshman just finally beginning her university experience.", "author": "rcollegethrowaway15", "created": 1601674617, "retrieved": 1632842876, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 172, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g7iq9ou": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j43k46/college_professor_accused_me_of_lying_then/g7iq9ou/", "text": "If you can figure out who the department chair is (if you have one), email them before the dean.
