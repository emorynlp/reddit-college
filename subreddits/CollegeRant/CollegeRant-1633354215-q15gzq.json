Maybe pick up a hobby, like exercising, art, reading, knitting etc. Go to cool stores and shops around the town. Friends will enrich your experience but if you aren\u2019t in need of friends that\u2019s fine.",

      "text": "It is ok not to know what you want to major in. I tried pre engineering and now I'm in Building and Construction tech major and am still unsure if this is what I want to do. I am a sophomore first year on campus as well. I feel the same way, except I definitely feel lonely and don't like it. I am also constantly bored and wish there was more to do around my campus. I tried joining a swim club to be cut after 3 days of tryouts and told to try again next semester. I wanted to join something else but everything is closed apparently. I am a transfer student so transferring is not ideal but I might do it again so if i don't make friends at least I can go off campus and do stuff. I def recommend joining clubs, or maybe look into transferring if you do not like your school.",
