You have a bunch of teachers sending recordings at different hours. Covid-19 emails flooding through. \n\nTeachers setting up meetings online already. That aren\u2019t even at the normal class time. Like .... this is already too much. I already had a nervous breakdown today because I have two test on Thursday. Back to back .... \n\nThe library is closed (as it should be) ... every time I want to study I get distracted or just want to sleep. Honestly if teachers just want to give us extra credit assignments to do I\u2019d gladly do it by the due date. But having a specific time to meet online .... what if I over sleep ! \n\nI just want to breathe !
