It is so hard to not procrastinate and manage your time properly, but when you do it it\u2019s so rewarding. \n\nGUYS APRIL IS ALMOST OVER AND THEN ONLY TWO WEEKS LEFT OF MAY. WE CAN DO THIS!!!!!!",

              "text": "Like I said, my job is really nice because the kids nap for 2 hours a day so I allot those two hours a day for homework. I also at the beginning of the week look at all my assignments and allot certain days for certain assignments to make sure I can get them all done throughout the week. For example, I do all of my math homework one Mondays and on Tuesdays I do all of my discussion boards. On Wednesday I usually have to write a paper for my psych class so on and so forth. Then I usually make sure I have little to no homework on Saturday to give my brain a rest. Having scheduled days for certain assignments makes sure that I\u2019m not overwhelmed or overworked on any given day. Did any of that help?",
