They're not difficult, they seem to be upper high school level, but doing 140 questions in two days doesn't seem very appealing to me. I was planning to drop the class, especially since I have some undiagnosed mental health problems (can't get a therapist at the moment so I have to live with it for a few months), but I accidentally slipped it to my dad and now he's telling me I'm just bad at planning stuff and time management, and got into a brief argument about dropping the class for a new professor until I just shut up and left.\n\nI fucking missed both of my first assignments for math and English (math because there were 7 total papers to do front and back, English because I was so focused on math and work and not fucking up my mental health that I forgot the assignment even existed) and that argument just pushed it to the last straw. I know I should email my English professor about missing assignment, I know I should email my math teacher to see what to do about it, but I just want to cry right now.\n\nFor context I'm a freshman, this is my first quarter. People dropped the class before, but for some reason I'm still not sure if it's just me being undisciplined or if this actually is too much work for me", "author": "Monthly_Vent", "created": 1632614884, "retrieved": 1632948403, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hec3bnu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pvinn0/one_week_in_and_ive_already_had_my_first_college/hec3bnu/", "text": "Email your professors. The biggest mistake students make is missing the first assignment, feeling shame, getting themselves into a spiral of unfinished work, failing to drop courses when there is still time to do so, and then going to professors at the end of the term to see what can be done. Talk to them now, and discuss how to get back on track. One thing to keep in mind: sometimes dropping a course IS good time management, if it means being able to complete all your other courses successfully. College is a marathon, not a sprint, so figure out how many courses you can successfully manage and get the grades you want in, and base your term on that. Too many students overload themselves.", "author": "Felixir-the-Cat", "created": 1632656572, "upvotes": 3}, "heaebko": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pvinn0/one_week_in_and_ive_already_had_my_first_college/heaebko/", "text": "Check if your campus has a disability center.
