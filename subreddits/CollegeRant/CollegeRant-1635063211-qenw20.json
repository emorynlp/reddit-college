  "title:": "My roomate goes to bed extremely early",
  "text": "Basically I\u2019m living with someone who\u2019s not one of my friends this year, and my roommate goes to bed extremely early 10-10:30. I\u2019m an horrible case of a night owl and typically I do not go to bed until 3:30-4am. My body never lets me get more than 6 hours of sleep so it works well for my 10am classes, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly frustrating having to deal with my roommate sleeping. Tonight I was playing a game (Saturday night 1:30am) and he sighed extreme loud obviously irritated with me and I felt really bad but I can\u2019t really help it. I try to maintain a respectful volume while talking to my friends online but it doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for him. \n\nTLDR: roommate goes to be 5 hours before I even consider sleeping",

You are the one that doesn\u2019t go to sleep at a normal or reasonable hour, so you should be more respectful of the roommate sleeping. Play your games at a reasonable hour and the roommate won\u2019t have a reason to be upset with getting woken up.",

      "text": "I was a night owl in college but it is possible to adjust your sleep schedule with some effort. It may be better to try and adjust your schedule to 12am so that if you do wake up your roommate by accident, that it isnt in the middle of their REM sleep. \n \nI recently went from sleeping 2am-9am to 10pm-6am and it was quite the adjustment. I also stopped drinking coffee and that helped tremendously.",

You say you can't really help it but you can... At least try to game eariler and stop at around 11 or something. His sleep is more of a priority than your games.",
