My name is Alexa and I am a current UX Design student.\u00a0 I am looking for some help from any college students or graduates out there. My team and I are working on a solution for a start-up that will help college students quickly find the classes that match their needs and schedules. If you have 2-3 minutes to answer this short survey, we would love to hear from you.
