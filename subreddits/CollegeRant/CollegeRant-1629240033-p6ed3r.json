  "text": "This is the first calc I\u2019m seeing and Idk what to do the damn teacher just focuses on the theory and doesn\u2019t teach us how to apply that theory or even do exercises and then in the quizzes he makes us do exercises we haven\u2019t even practiced idk what to do idk how to study for the big exam tomorrow because I have no clue on how to do the exercises. Should I just drop the subject and see it next semester with a different teacher",

I had a math teacher that did pretty much the exact same thing in summer semester. Absolutely horrific time on hw.\n\nTutoring might help too. Good luck with whatever you choose.",
