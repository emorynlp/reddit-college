Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m super excited to see and learn new things, but I feel overwhelmed with all of the decisions I\u2019m going to be having to make. \n\nI have stories I want to share (these stories are going to be told through animated series\u2019, books, comics, video games, etc.) and so I am \u201cgoing to college for English and art\u201d but I have NO idea what I want to do for my actual JOB. I am worried that I will figure out what I like doing after college and have to go back and I know that\u2019s a common thing that people do, but I am going to SERIOUSLY struggle to financially get through this semester, let alone get through all four years or even go back! (My parents/family can\u2019t really help much). \n\nIm also scared of having to fend for myself obviously so misc tips and tricks are super appreciated!!", "author": "WishUponAStarInAJar", "created": 1597621654, "retrieved": 1632951296, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g21mw2g": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ib37n9/i_dont_feel_ready/g21mw2g/", "text": "no one feels ready for life, which is the funny part.
