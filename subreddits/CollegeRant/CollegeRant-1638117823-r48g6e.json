  "text": "I got a D in my chem class (the passing grade is a C), but I didn't withdraw because I didn't see the point when I'd have to retake it next semester. Unfortunately, that means I have to get straight As in everything else and can only afford myself a single A-. If I can maintain these grades, I can finish the semester with a 3.5, make the dean's list, and finish my first semester strong.\n\nThe problem is that this is causing me far more stress than I can handle. I used to cry in middle school when I got anything below 100, and after sobbing when I realized that the highest grade I can get in my Chem Lab is an A-, I realized I'm right back in the unhealthy mindset. I finally started allowing myself to make mistakes without falling apart over them in the last few years of high school, and now I'm back in the hole. \n\nI tell my mom and my advisor about this, and they all say that it's okay not to make the dean's list my very first semester and that freshman year is just for gaining my footing, and they're right !! That's the whole problem: I can't stop setting expectations and standards for myself that literally, no one else has for me, and then I break down when I don't meet my expectations. I overwork and stress myself out over things that everyone else couldn't care less about.\n\nIDK where this rant is going anymore, and I'm done venting, but yea I'm tired of setting myself up and not knowing how to lower my standards",

      "text": "In school it's easy to stress over the small things. Just keep your sights on the things that matter; focus on majoring in what you enjoy and do well enough to stay on the path towards your ideal career. Take pride in getting closer to that everyday. In 6 years, absolutely no one is going to care if you didn't make the Dean's List one semester, let alone two or three semesters. No one is going to care about that one test you messed up. They are just going to see your GPA, your major, and possibly what school you attended, that's it.  \n\n\nYou should only stress out about things that are going to affect your future. Getting perfect grades ain't one of them. Once your GPA is a 3.5 or above SO MANY OTHER THINGS MATTER MORE like work connections, resumes, interview skills, etc. I've never met any recruiters who care about GPA difference above 3.5.",

      "text": "You might benefit from finding a therapist to help you work through some of your unhealthy behaviors. And because you have been doing this since middle school, I don't think these are behaviors and tendencies that you can just organically get rid of, at least not easily, and a professional could probably be helpful for you. You're gonna burn yourself out FAST if you keep that up.",
