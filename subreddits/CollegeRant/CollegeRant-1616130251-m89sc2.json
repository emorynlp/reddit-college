So social media, YouTube, random nonsense we might do, etc. I try to cut back on work as much as I can safely afford, and center getting my work done as much as possible. I try to eat healthy, exercise, do school, and socialize as efficiently as I can. Then I make sure I have time to unwind at the end of the day, I try to get 2 or 3 hours... hope some of my tricks for myself are useful to you! Good luck!", "author": "blazikenxoxo", "created": 1616131132, "upvotes": 5}}}
