  "text": "just a college rant\n\nHonestly i\u2019m not doing well. classes sucks. work sucks. everything just kinda sucks rn. my school had taken away spring break it is just 20 weeks of just classes no type of break or anything to give us a rest. i honestly wish i took a year off because i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019ll be able to pass this semester i just can\u2019t keep handling everything. online classes are the worst and i\u2019ve reached out to my teacher and tried to talk to them about how i\u2019m not doing well and how everything is beginning to get overwhelming and they have either ignored me or told me i need to try harder.  i am honestly starting to feel like the school just doesn\u2019t care about us or our mental health it\u2019s like we are just a big joke to them.",

One is basically giving us exams that don't relate to the lessons we are taught and then waiting to tell us this until after we have already failed, and the other decided to make the due date for a massive project the next day just because he was upset that one person took out their phone in class",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling like this... for me it\u2019s best to just streamline my life as much as possible, cut out everything that doesn\u2019t either serve a considerable purpose or bring a consider amount of joy. So social media, YouTube, random nonsense we might do, etc. I try to cut back on work as much as I can safely afford, and center getting my work done as much as possible. I try to eat healthy, exercise, do school, and socialize as efficiently as I can. Then I make sure I have time to unwind at the end of the day, I try to get 2 or 3 hours... hope some of my tricks for myself are useful to you! Good luck!",
