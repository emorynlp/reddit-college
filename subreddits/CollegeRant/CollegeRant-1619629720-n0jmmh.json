If anything, these classes might end up being more challenging and run by worse professors who don't really care if you are also taking several other credit hours.\n\nAfter severely struggling with my humanities courses this semester (I might end up having to use pass/fail for both of them), I talked to some upperclassmen who basically told me everything I just told you. Humanities classes can be some of the most difficult courses required on a major due to unrealistic workloads, shitty professors who take themselves and their course way too seriously, and students who set up the false expectations of thinking that they could pretty much just get an A by showing up.\n\nNow they key word here is some, not all. A lot of these classes actually are chill and keep their workloads pretty low and their course work pretty simple, but sometimes you only find them if you\n\n* Check the professor's rating on RateMyProfessor, if they have one before you enroll in a class (or at least before the deadline to withdraw from a class without financial penalty)\n* Talk to upperclassmen in your field to see what classes they ended up picking and which ones they loved or hated.\n* Don't be afraid to just withdraw from the class if the workload proves to be too much for you", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1619629720, "retrieved": 1632843537, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"gw6yqa3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n0jmmh/if_youre_taking_humanities_courses_as_a/gw6yqa3/", "text": "Thank you u/sunnirays for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
