  "text": "It seems like it comes naturally to most other people. I see couples holding hands all the time. Large groups of people hanging out. I\u2019ve been joining clubs, working out, attending lectures, etc and haven\u2019t figured out what a good way is to meet girls or make friends. I don\u2019t wanna be a virgin loser when I graduate",

      "text": "The worst thing you can do is actively seek out a girlfriend. Let me explain. We can tell when a guy is speaking to us with the intention of getting in our pants and its a turn off (unless shes also looking for a hookup but generally not). Treat and talk to women like youd talk to a guy. If, *if*, you have chemistry with a woman you befriended then try to take it to the next level, but other than that, treat them as friends. You make friends by talking to people. How many people do you approach and speak to per day? How many people do you ask to study together or go to some event? Whoever you sit next to in class, at the dining hall, wherever, just make small chat. Ask questions. Talk about yourself but ask questions more. Make plans for the future.",

          "text": "The thing is I barely talk to guys either, honestly the most I talk is to my roommates and even then it\u2019s usually just \u201chi\u201d or \u201chow\u2019s it going\u201d. I don\u2019t know what to say besides that. I eat alone for almost every meal and sit alone in lectures. I don\u2019t really approach anyone because I think it would just be really awkward and go terribly. I have no idea how to make small talk. My social skills are probably the worst out of anyone. I mostly just feel like it\u2019s hopeless",
