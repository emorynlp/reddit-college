I have not been diagnosed with epilepsy and this is the first seizure I'm aware of having. I am afraid it is going to happen again because I'm experiencing seriously weird sensations similar to what I felt before I had the seizure, so I am avoiding the textbook. I told my teacher this, and that I was undiagnosed, and she was entirely unhelpful. She sent me a link to the disability resource center, but for me to take advantage of anything there, I would need to be diagnosed with epilepsy, which I told her I was not. I saw a doctor a few days ago and I'm trying to schedule an appointment with a neurologist, but I live hours away from medical care and cannot easily get in to see one. My doctor also told me not to drive, so my mom has to take me to see the neurologist in her spare time. The class is online, and the only source of teaching is the textbook, which I cannot read. I don't want a bad grade in this class, but I honestly don't know what to do to solve this issue. It's really frustrating that I'm paying tuition for this abysmal fucking online course. My teacher does nothing for this class except grade our weekly discussion post. I want to call her out on it. I also want to report her to the school but I doubt the school would give a shit. Sorry about the rant, if anyone has experienced a similar situation and/or has advice for me I would love to hear it.", "author": "grriid", "created": 1626286003, "retrieved": 1632949550, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h5b011q": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oka07t/any_advice/h5b011q/", "text": "You drop.

I also have epilepsy and it can be very scary, especially the first few times. I also know how difficult it is to get in to see a neurologist. But once you\u2019ve gotten set on a treatment plan, things get a lot better. Many kinds of epilepsy are controlled well with medication. I\u2019ve been on medication for 10 years now without any major side effects or disruption to my life. For now, try to get as much sleep as possible, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and take it easy when you can.\n\nI\u2019m not in any way a medical doctor, but it sounds like you may have epilepsy triggered by reading (https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/r/reading-epilepsy.html and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9712004/). From my understanding, this wouldn\u2019t have much to do with reading this textbook in particular, but rather the act of reading in general. You might be best served by taking a medical withdrawal in the class for now until you\u2019re able to complete the coursework. These are typically non-punitive and won\u2019t affect your transcript.\n\nAs for your complaints about your professor, I have less sympathy in all honesty. I\u2019m not sure what exactly you would \u201creport her\u201d for. Reading and discussion assignments are a very common and reasonable expectation for college coursework. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong so far as I can tell- you do, in fact, need medical documentation if you\u2019re unable to complete the coursework. She can\u2019t create an entirely new course without any reading or online components in the middle of the class for you specifically. While you can\u2019t see a neurologist yet, you should reach out to the doctor you saw a few days ago for a note as soon as possible and inquire about a medical withdrawal.", "author": "archilochus4875", "created": 1626296479, "upvotes": 2}}}
