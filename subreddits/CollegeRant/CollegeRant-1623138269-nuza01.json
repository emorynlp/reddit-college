The university then randomly emails everyone saying everything is in person for fall, and this completely fucks over how I was planning fall. The hell?! Why tf would u randomly switch a online class to in person?! I can\u2019t even take it now, I\u2019m not driving 3 hours to take a dahm 2 credit matlab class the hell. I get that they want in person really bad, but randomly making ALL the online classes in person fucks over a ton of students. I hope they change their mind soon\ud83d\ude44", "author": "ttyltyler", "created": 1623138269, "retrieved": 1632949730, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h1236xu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuza01/fucking_campus_decided_to_randomly_make_all_fall/h1236xu/", "text": "In my state, students (and their parents) have been contacting the board of regents and asking for in-person classes.
