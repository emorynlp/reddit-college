  "text": "I was gonna take a online matlab class at another college for fall, because I\u2019d take too long to commute there. The university then randomly emails everyone saying everything is in person for fall, and this completely fucks over how I was planning fall. The hell?! Why tf would u randomly switch a online class to in person?! I can\u2019t even take it now, I\u2019m not driving 3 hours to take a dahm 2 credit matlab class the hell. I get that they want in person really bad, but randomly making ALL the online classes in person fucks over a ton of students. I hope they change their mind soon\ud83d\ude44",

              "text": "I totally get that.  It's a situation without a good solution, unfortunately.  When the fall schedule was due, the school probably didn't know if they could do in-person classes (due to state restrictions, public health protocols, etc.), so they had to schedule online classes.  Now that they're allowed to do in-person classes, they have to focus on the majority of students who want to be in-person and who might transfer to a different school if in-person classes aren't available.  The only way to make everyone happy would be to create a duplicate of each course so one could be in-person and the other online, but no school is going to have the money for the additional instructors that would require.\n\nI'm sympathetic to your frustration.  Online classes eliminated my commute as well.",
