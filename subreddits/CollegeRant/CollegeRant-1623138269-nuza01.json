The university then randomly emails everyone saying everything is in person for fall, and this completely fucks over how I was planning fall. The hell?! Why tf would u randomly switch a online class to in person?! I can\u2019t even take it now, I\u2019m not driving 3 hours to take a dahm 2 credit matlab class the hell. I get that they want in person really bad, but randomly making ALL the online classes in person fucks over a ton of students. I hope they change their mind soon\ud83d\ude44", "author": "ttyltyler", "created": 1623138269, "retrieved": 1632842257, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"h10af4x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuza01/fucking_campus_decided_to_randomly_make_all_fall/h10af4x/", "text": "Thank you u/ttyltyler for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
