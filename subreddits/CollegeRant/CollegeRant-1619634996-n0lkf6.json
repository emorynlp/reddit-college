This class has caused me so much stress that my hair is falling out. Here's a rundown of how the class works:\n\nOnline lectures where the professor projects his typed notes onto the screen and reads off of them nearly word for word. These notes are essentially just the book paraphrased. There is also one midterm and one final exam that make up most of our grade. \n\nThe midterm was rough. I failed and upon reaching out to my classmates, realized that everyone who I spoke with failed with the exception of one who got 1% above failing. The professor refused to tell us the average on the exam and refused to curve. I asked for clarification on his grading on one specific question and he pretty much told me everything was technically correct, but I had forgotten to check one of eight things so I got nearly 3/4ths of the points taken off. On top of being a hard grader, he gives us the hardest problems from the book for our homework. My tutor is even unable to help me with some of the problems and he has a graduate degree in the subject. The professor also does not have office hours, instead he asks that we send him emails to ask questions. The catch is he doesn't respond to every email. Even when he does help, half of his answers are just stating that something is easy so we should do that part on our own. The class has shrunk greatly in size from the start of the semester due to people withdrawing. \n\nI have reached out to my dean to raise my concerns about the professor. They said they will speak with him and get back me, but I don't feel like they will do anything.", "author": "GreenEqualiTea", "created": 1619634996, "retrieved": 1632842720, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 373, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gw7bexx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n0lkf6/why_are_professors_allowed_to_be_so_bad_at_their/gw7bexx/", "text": "Thank you u/GreenEqualiTea for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At my school, you just need a masters in order to be an adjunct. Meanwhile to be any other teacher, you need to go through countless background checks, a certified program, get fingerprints, spend so many hours observing, pass the praxis, student teach, get a degree, sometimes get a masters, etc. etc. \n\nAnd on top of that there\u2019s a ton more rules you have to follow because teachers tend to be held to a higher standard: some teachers can get fired just for dressing \u201cprovocatively\u201d ie in a pencil skirt and a blouse, whereas another teacher no joke got fired because she said she was depressed. \n\nOn top of that, colleges are more willing to cover up when a professor does something wrong. Or a student doesn\u2019t report them because they\u2019re older or it doesn\u2019t seem necessary. There was a professor I had who wouldn\u2019t give a girl an extension on her midterm because he doesn\u2019t accept late work; said girl had a concussion and her doctor told her not to look at a screen or she\u2019d make it worse. If this was grammar school, he\u2019d get written up. In college, she didn\u2019t feel like reporting him. \n\nNot only all that I just mentioned but professors hold your entire life in their hand. If you have a bad teacher in high school, your parent could complain or you could just go to summer school.

Good teaching is not rewarded. Literally, the only way that teaching is rewarded is through feel-good rewards like \"teacher of the year\" but these are meaningless and don't help our career at all. \n\nThe only thing that motivates us to be good teachers is knowing that we have helped students grow and improve. In other words, intrinsic motivation derived from positive relationships with our students. Typically, young faculty put a lot of energy into teaching even though they aren't rewarded for it because they are optimists and believe students have good motivations and a sincere dedication to learning. That naivety wears off slowly, as one gets to know students and their deceptions, and once the well of optimism has run dry, there is no reason to put more than the absolute minimum into teaching.", "author": "TheProfessorsCat", "created": 1619719098, "upvotes": 2}, "gwb83yl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n0lkf6/why_are_professors_allowed_to_be_so_bad_at_their/gwb83yl/", "text": "I understand, man.\n\nI had a precalculus professor in community college - WORST.

Appeal at every point you can. \n\nThen, set up a zoom meeting with the Dean, and invite everyone else from your class. Get them all in on the meeting and let him know that all of you are going to formally appeal every assessment from this professor while you are in the unit. \n\nInvestigate which options are available to you outside the university (in my country there is a government authority over universities you can appeal to once you have exhausted all internal university options).\n\nGo to the university publication, and indicate there is a student movement against the poor teaching in the department and refer them to the dean to comment. \n\nAt the start of the next online lecture, let the professor know you will be recording him for the purposes of reviewing his teaching and marking as per the assessment. \n\nThe kind of professor you describe is exercising a criminal abuse of his power. He is an ass and he needs to have the students use his people power to push back. Other opportunities:\n\n1. Contact the industry associations he belongs to and complain about his unprofesionalism. make sure all complaints have a variety of signatures on them.\n2. Contact the student guild/union and find out what services may be available to you. \n3.
