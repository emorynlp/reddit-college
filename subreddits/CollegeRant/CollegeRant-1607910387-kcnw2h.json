  "title:": "Congratulations on This Semester!",
  "text": "So, most of you have finished this semester or are close to finishing! Covid-19 has challenged the strength of so many people, including college students. Covid-19 has made the format of learning more difficult, forced students to teach themselves, limited the ability to make social and professional connections, and has introduced some questionable professors. I know this semester (and year) has not been easy for anyone, so I just want to say congratulations. Even if you did not achieve the goals you wanted and/or received the grades you desired, feel honored that you made it to the end of the semester. College is rarely easy, especially during such a chaotic situation. I know that I am only a stranger to many of you, but I am so proud. \n\n\n\nTLDR; Congratulations to all of the college students!",
