I don\u2019t understand why society has normalized making people take out thousands of dollars worth of student loans, and going into debt, and then forcing them into a tiny bedroom like sardines. It\u2019s honestly so disgusting. You would think with the amount of money people pay for tuition would guarantee their own living area. I understand that it\u2019s about greed and money for the schools, but I absolutely hate and am disgusted how people have just accepted it and now considered it as \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018part of the college experience.\u2019 Just because it\u2019s tradition doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right.
