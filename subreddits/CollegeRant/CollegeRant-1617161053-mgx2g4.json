  "text": "Professors are so disconnected with reality. \n\nI am one of the few lucky people who managed to get a job during a recession and global pandemic. I got this job because I don\u2019t plan on being on EBT for forever and I cannot afford the basic necessities, nevertheless university, without an income. \n\nThis year, I\u2019ve held off buying groceries and skipped meals because I couldn\u2019t afford it. My insurance refused to cover my medications so I\u2019ve been trying to save up enough to afford my monthly dose. I spent all of my summer earnings paying for textbooks and class fees for the fall, and all of my fall earnings attempting to pay my spring tuition. \n\nMy professor was so flabbergasted that I work 40 hours a week while being a full time student. I told them I was struggling in my major because of all of the requirements and I couldn\u2019t lessen my class schedule because my scholarship requires a certain number of credit hours a semester. \n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating to be working just for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of attending university, and have the university act as though students are absurd for working. If universities wanted students to focus on their studies, they should give out more scholarships (preferably ones that don\u2019t require 15+ credits a semester), and work on reducing tuition. Until then, I will continue to work because otherwise I cannot attend nor afford school.",

I am still trying to figure out how I did it because soon, i will have to do it again. My program is completely online, I AM TEACHING MYSELF THIS TRASH! \n\nOnce the professor sets up the course for the semester, which THEY DID NOT EVEN DESIGN BECAUSE ITS DESIGNED BY THE DEPARTMENT, it\u2019s pretty much automatic.  Some do not return emails, and when they do, you wish you never reached out because the condescension makes you want to find out where they live and send a boiled rabbit, insteadI write scathing evaluations. They never want to explain or guide you in anything. You tell them you are not understanding the concept of the subject matter and they ask you to get back to them when you have a specific question!!!!\n\nWhat???? You mean to tell me you have a whole entire PhD, you have been studying the discipline for decades, probably wasting the college\u2019s air teaching or instructing for a good amount of time, and you have no idea what i am not grasping??? You need to be guided??? The professor is supposed to be able to extrapolate from the information  I give what my problem is likely to be due to experience and education. I shouldn\u2019t have to do paint by numbers for them.\n\nThe professor should be able to make the explanation for my problem RELATABLE TO THE CHANGING SANDS OF  MARS!\n\nThese deadlines are ridiculous, we have new units every week on Monday, that we are teaching ourselves, with \u201cdiscussion posts\u201d being the new \u201cessay\u201d (they need to just call it an essay, because it\u2019s not a discussion) due on Thursday, responses, quizzes, and official papers due on Sunday??? One class has 2 discussions, We\u2019d and Fri and the rest on Sun, for Statistical Methods, which she didn\u2019t teach, she just \u201cassigned\u201d work!",

      "text": "Another prof here - the four year college degree was designed for hyper privileged students who had parental support OR for students who could work a full time summer job to pay for all upcoming expenses.\n\nThose two modes no longer fit the majority of the student body, and we are aware of that. However, one day our \u201cworks 20-40 hours per week\u201d student is going to compete against the \u201ccould study full time student\u201d on standardized tests (think MCAT and GRE) and we need our working student to perform as well as the privileged student. The profs at the working-student-population school can\u2019t make their courses any less rigorous than the profs at the privileged-student school. You should always expect 2-3 hours per credit per week of studying regardless of which school you go to.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Take less courses per semester. You don\u2019t need to finish in four years and for many of you, it will be better to take slightly longer and get better grades. \n\nIs that what you want to hear? Is it fair? Probably not, but again, we profs need to make sure you can compete with the other students when you go head to head in applications and tests.",

On top of that he decided to make assignments due at 5pm! Some people don't even get home from work that early! His response to not just letting us have the week to get work done was that \"it's an accelerated class so youre responsible for keeping up\". So many students dropped the class because if they had known they literally would be unable to turn in work on time due to their work schedules, they wouldn't have picked his class in the first place. We had 2 assignments due on the first freakin day",

      "text": "Professor here. I get where you are coming from 100%. This is a societal issue, and it was not like this for previous generations. A lot of professors don't understand this, because it does not make sense for what things were like years ago. I'm not defending your professor's behavior, but it might help to know why it happens. Be frustrated with the professor, sure. But this might also be an opportunity to educate. They need to know how much things have changed. All of us need to realize the current state of things, and not accept it. It will take political activism to improve things.\n\nHere is what I tell to students though, because I know that being just a full time student is not reasonable for many of them. You don't have to take as many classes at once. Graduating one or two semesters late may be very worth it in the long term. It's better than barely graduating at all. Things have changed. The four-year full time student expectation is just not reasonable for a lot of people now. I know sometimes there are scholarship and other restrictions that don't let that happen. But it's worth considering for those that have the ability to pace themselves.\n\nAlso, the generational differences affect us too. I'll never make as much money as my professors did. And I've worked much, much harder to get to where I am than they had to in their time (not that they didn't work very hard). Competition is high, and compensation is low. Some of the older professors really just don't get what it is like now. All of this is a related societal issue. It sucks.",

It\u2019s hard enough trying to complete a major that is very time consuming and exhausting, but balancing a job on top of that is impossible. \n\nIt\u2019s just so draining. The class divide basically forces poor students to work harder to the point of hospitalization just to afford school, while wealthy students can dedicate their time to unpaid internships and building up their resume and experiences.",

The pandemic made my uni open up the education degree to online and have an on campus and totally online version of the degree, otherwise I would have had to beg my job to allow me to take half days and work strange hours to accomplish my degree. Legitimately the only reason myself or the other adults with jobs/kids are able to graduate is because of the pandemic.",

Once i got to the fleet i spent the majority of my time cleaning. It wasn't unusual to spend 8 hours a day in port cleaning, its all we did. If I wasn't cleaning i was doing maintence. Due to navy beuracracy, a two hour maintence job would be stretched into a 6 hour maintence job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there is duty. Duty is when you spend 24 hours on the boat every 3 days, then work a full work day the day after. So if you have duty Monday, you'll have duty again on Thursday, then Sunday, and so forth repeating every 3 days till the day you step off the boat. On your duty day you will stand 12 hours of watch. Watch is when you take readings on the same gauges every hour and write down there value, they never change. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cleaning, the maintence, and the duty results in a average work week of 100 hours, for 6 years. This is just in port, out to sea your working 18 hours days, every day, till you pull back into port, at which point you go back to standing duty and cleaning. I cannot overstate how bad standing duty is, its like a guillotine that is constantly hanging over your head. Want to party Saturday night? Cant because you have to be up at 4 am to be on the boat by 6 am to stand Sunday duty, then when your duty day is done you have to work a full work day Monday. You would go out friday night but your tired from Thursday dudy and the fact that you only got 4 hours of sleep on your duty day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll these problems are things that cannot be made better by your chain of command, only worse. i could write a book on how toxic the leadership i had was. Your captain will run you into the ground just so he can be promoted. I had a captain that I heard say \"who cares if they kill themselves, the navy will send me a new one\". People just don't give a shit about you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo yourself a favor and go airforce, or coast guard. I have buddies in all the branches and those two seem to be the best in terms of quality of life and work/life balance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF what I wrote didn't dissuade you from joining the navy, at least go officer. Its still awful, but you get paid 3x what enlisted do and you get a small amount of respect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note, while it was awful while I was in, I'm no longer in the navy and am semi-retired at the age of 27. Was it worth it? No, but I cant look over the fact that i would not be where I am in life had i not joined the navy, so take that for what it is.",

I know those aren't ideal but i think it's much better than skipping meals! I hope this helps at least a little bit as I'm not sure what to do about everything else...I just end up taking out loans because I can't handle the pressure of working full time during school or I'd fail (and i needed impressive grades for PA school). I commend you for your efforts though!",

I used to attend one of those schools that markets towards \"working adults\" and it was literally paying $1200 to write a forum post once a week and get an A. Felt like a complete diploma mill so I transferred. Now I'm in real university and I'm surprised at how professors are so stubborn on so many things like exam time conflicts... and professors have started using Cengage/McGrawhill to teach the entire course and barely respond to emails. Have you applied for Medicaid? In most states you are still eligible for EBT if you work part time. And food banks give out food for free, you can hit up multiple ones. Lots of my friends have their medications covered by Medicaid.",
