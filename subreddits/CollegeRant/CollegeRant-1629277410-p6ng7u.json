Im pretty confident in my short term memory as i study hard and long hour repetitively, BUT my long term memory is so bad. As im entering my second year, im studying more advance stuff but im so fucked right now because i can barely remember 60% of the core subjects that i have learned on first year. Now i have a HARD time redo-ing the exam/practice question which i aced before, i wonder how the hell i did it back then\u2026  \n\n\nAs for some minor subjects like IT etc\u2026i literally forgot 90% of the stuff but i wont be using it for my further study so this is fine(i guess?)\n\nis it just me or people actually encounter this problem too?", "author": "Catanddogg", "created": 1629277410, "retrieved": 1632841613, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h9e1ttm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6ng7u/is_it_normal_to_forget_what_you_have_learned_past/h9e1ttm/", "text": "Thank you u/Catanddogg for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I probably remember a fraction of the stuff I remember from most of my classes just last semester. That\u2019s totally fine for an elective like psych, but not so great in calc I when I need to take calc II this semester. That\u2019s honestly a very frustrating part about school. Unless it\u2019s a class actually relating to your major, a lot of the other classes are just there to give you a more rounded education and structure. After that semester though, it seems like it was simply a memory test in the moment. People who can study and memorize best short-term get rewarded the most. I busted my butt in a few classes to get my GPA back up after tanking it my first year and I straight up put 3-4x the effort and time into a history class and got a B while easily getting an A in an ethics class. The only difference was that we had to only memorize and repeat for ethics. I remember alot more from that history class, but in the system I actually did worse.", "author": "XxNHLxX", "created": 1629301598, "upvotes": 4}, "h9eljyi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p6ng7u/is_it_normal_to_forget_what_you_have_learned_past/h9eljyi/", "text": "Im only at the end of my Second Semester, but If i Had to Take my First Semester Finals again id probably wouldnt pass as good as i did.
