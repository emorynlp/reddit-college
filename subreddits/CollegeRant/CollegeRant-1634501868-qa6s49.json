I have no good excuse, no job, no relationship, no taking care of family, no sport, like literally no excuse I just waste time all day. I don\u2019t even know who to talk to about it I want to just come out sobbing to my parents or advisors or professors  about the hole I dug myself in but because I have no excuse I feel everyone will call me an idiot (which I am). This is just kind of a rant because I deserve to be humiliated and don\u2019t deserve the privilege of college that\u2019s all fucking hate myself.",

I have no idea why and there is no reason behind it, I just don\u2019t do the work. I totally feel you. Dm if you want to chat\n\nAlso my advice to you would be to not feel obligated to go to college. I understand your thinking behind college. It is true that college could help to get a better job, but there are also so many other ways to get there. \n\nI would recommend you find some hobbies do some research see what you like and what jobs correlate to that. There are so many jobs out there where all you need is like a one year training program and you can have a starting salary that a four year or two year college grad would have.",

      "text": "It sounds like maybe you don\u2019t really want to be in college. Maybe it is because you don\u2019t know what you want to do maybe it is because as you indicated in the comments your old high school is paying for your community college associate degree. No matter what the reason until you decide for yourself that you want to be there, things won\u2019t change. Maybe look at Union trades, they pay you while your in training you get paid a living wage that increases steadily until you journey out and then you get raises based on the collective bargaining of your union representatives during contract renegotiation. There are lots of options depending on what you think you might like, Carpenter, Piledriver, Millwright, Plumber, Electrician, if you want to drive big equipment join the Operators, don\u2019t know what to do join the laborers union and get exposed to a little of everything. \n\nCollege is not the only option for good pay and in the trades there is lots of room to make really good money especially if you join one of the unions. Maybe you really like it and stay there for the rest of your life maybe it is the break you need to figure out what you really want to do all while making enough money to fully support yourself. It is at least something to consider. I hope things get better for you.",

If you've had these symptoms since you were a child (forgetfulness, laziness, messy) it's time to do some research and see a doctor. Medication and treatment saved my life. This post resonated with me so much.\n\nNot trying to be an armchair therapist, and obligatory self-diagnosis can be dangerous, but sometimes it's NOT a \"lack of motivation\" or \"you're just not trying hard enough\" or \"just use some folders dude\". It's an extremely misunderstood disorder (it's not little kids bouncing off walls and squirrels) and I really think you should look into it.",
