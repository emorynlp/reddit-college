What I did was check the extra credit assignments first. Most of the times profs accidentally make the extra credit x/10. If it says x/10 or another number, that means the extra credit is being registered in the system as if it was a mandatory assignment to your grade. Talk to your prof to remove the /10 or out of whatever number and only add the number of points that are extra. When I contacted my prof about this, she changed it for me and my grade increased. I hope I am making sense.", "author": "Oro-Lavanda", "created": 1617151690, "upvotes": 35}}}
