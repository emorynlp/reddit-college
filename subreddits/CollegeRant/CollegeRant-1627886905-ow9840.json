Send help", "text": "It\u2019s your Music Business/Passion career OP again. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\nI\u2019m currently enrolled as fully paid scholar in Bachelor in Education Studies in a constituent of probably one of the most prestigious universities here in my country. Not my choice due to not making the cut off in the entrance exams by a small margin so I had to appeal resulting in me being admitted into one of the lesser known ones which only has 3 programs and I had no choice but to choose something even I had no interest in it.\n\nNot doing good so far. Getting Cs and already dropped 12 credits worth because of health issues related to stress, not interested in the major itself and online classes are not helping at all.\n\nThe good thing is I\u2019m able to transfer next year to the main university as a Music major with full scholarship provided that I maintain good academic standing.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing me more distress is the huge possibility of me leaving for the US to live and study there instead of the university I mentioned above. I can\u2019t study out of state due to family and financial reasons so I\u2019m stuck between two universities that I would most like to go to. It would also be hard to find scholarships.\n\nUniversity A is a private university with a tuition of 40k annually. Provided that I can a decent scholarship, I would try to go for Aviation though I don\u2019t have interest in it but I would choose this over any other program (excluding Music). Also, I believe it pays well which a lot of people focus on I guess. Music Business is still on my mind but I\u2019ll only consider it if I get somehow get a really good or full scholarship.\n\nUniversity B is a public university with a tuition of 6k annually and I\u2019m guaranteed some scholarships. The only major I\u2019m interested in is unfortunately still a music major specifically BM in Music Production and Technology.\n\nIt sucks that I can\u2019t find interest even a little, in any other programs apart from these two.\n\nI don\u2019t what to do.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t refuse to leave since my papers are already been taken care of.", "author": "JirohSalonga", "created": 1627886905, "retrieved": 1632949163, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
