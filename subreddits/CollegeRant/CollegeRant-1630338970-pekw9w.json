  "text": "Y'all I can't take this no more \ud83d\ude2d I fucking hate my course, it's a useless ass course. I know I shouldn't be a dumbass and drop out now (also my mum would murder me herself before I even send those slips) but I really can't. Why the fuck is it so stressful IM ALREADY GAINING WEIGHT... it's an art associate degree btw LOL\n\n\nI'm doing this just so I have some sort of certification if not I'd have nothing. Actually, I don't have a dream job. My \"dream\" job would be having a successful business but if I fail I'd have nothing to fall back on. This degree is just a safety net and sure as hell ain't a sturdy one \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n\nI totally agree we shouldn't spend our time doing something we don't want, yet I've spent my entire life in school, and not once had I wanted to be in it. I just want to ride motorbikes and learn the guitar and dress up lol\n\n\nI really try to not think about school, my current GPA is like 1.7 or something lol \ud83d\ude2d thankfully gpa doesn't really matter for my course I believe (I guess???) what's funny is that I've never failed any module but I've never aced any too. On average I get B and C equally yet one D is enough to plummet my entire GPA. Does attendance affect GPA? If so... still 1.7 is hella low lol I don't skip that many\ud83d\ude2d no but really what factors in a GPA score\n\n\nTo add on college is so expensive and for what also I don't think I've gained anything except depression so that's nice \ud83d\ude42",

Yeah it's my fault for switching majors but fuck, I've been in school for more than 4 years. It'll probably take me 6 years to get my fucking bachelor's, and this is after I was the military for five years at age 18.\n\nAnyway, if it's any consolation you can do it! You're almost there! At this point it wouldn't make sense to quit because you're so close. The longer you're out of school the harder it'll be to go back. Keep pushing!",
