Why the fuck is it so stressful IM ALREADY GAINING WEIGHT... it's an art associate degree btw LOL\n\n\nI'm doing this just so I have some sort of certification if not I'd have nothing.

On average I get B and C equally yet one D is enough to plummet my entire GPA. Does attendance affect GPA? If so... still 1.7 is hella low lol I don't skip that many\ud83d\ude2d no but really what factors in a GPA score\n\n\nTo add on college is so expensive and for what also I don't think I've gained anything except depression so that's nice \ud83d\ude42", "author": "okbokchoy", "created": 1630338970, "retrieved": 1632950356, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 192, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hb1jja8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pekw9w/i_want_to_drop_outttt_but_im_in_my_fucking_final/hb1jja8/", "text": "Stick it out, without neglecting your mental health...get the degree, any degree, and then build experience in what you'd actually like to do and then do it as a job when you graduate.\n\nTry to find areas you like where CS can be applied, if possible to help you survive the remaining time.", "author": "vsujeesh", "created": 1630407536, "upvotes": 1}, "hb0q78k": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pekw9w/i_want_to_drop_outttt_but_im_in_my_fucking_final/hb0q78k/", "text": "Its taking me 8 years to get my bachelors.
