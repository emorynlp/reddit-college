I have to write one article every two weeks. I'm an English major and I was sooo desperate for internships, so I was really glad to get two at the same time. The first internship was ok, but they didn't even publish all of my posts. Anyway...\n\nThis second internship is so dumb. I literally write Buzzfeed type articles but for some stupid college website. At first it was ok, but now they keep giving me the same topic every time. I wrote three posts about 80 (topics) for X demographic and it's so soul sucking. I'm grateful I have two weeks to write. It's not hard, but the topics are just sooo superficial. The articles I'm writing aren't even related to college! Like why am I writing about shit for sisters and grandmas and whatever else?? And I feel like nobody even reads that stuff anyways\u2026 like I\u2019m basically rewriting articles other people wrote to hopefully get more clicks.\n\nI wrote one article like a month ago, and I got a message saying I had to edit it TODAY. Like you couldn't tell me this a month ago when you edited it? When I told my friend about this who is also an English major (she actually got paid for her internship) she was like \"why are you letting them take advantage of you? They aren't paying you for this.\" I don't have a choice. I had to take the internship so I could graduate, and I struggled to get one. I'm honestly so angry, because I have a feeling a lot of writing jobs will be writing stupid shit all the time. ughhhh.", "author": "sunglassesraven", "created": 1630451829, "retrieved": 1632948977, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {}}
