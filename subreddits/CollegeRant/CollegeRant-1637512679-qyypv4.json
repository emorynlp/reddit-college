  "text": "I am going through my finals right now. I have 8 math modules to do(each take 2-3 hours to finish), a final exam, and two essays. I also am also working 55 hours at Target in the next two weeks.\n\nI\u2019m literally panicking right now. I don\u2019t know how I can do my all of my coursework + studying so that I could get a decent grade while I\u2019m also going to be working 6-8 hour closing shifts near almost every day of the week. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nEdit: since they have filled me for every day except Thanksgiving, I have no Thanksgiving break and can\u2019t go on vacation with my family as I\u2019ll be working. I guess I\u2019ll be able to do my HW in the meantime at least(or, the time where I won\u2019t be slaving away at work)\u2026",

I stupidly decided to put off the math modules as they were all due at the end of the semester, so here I am now\u2026to be fair I wasn\u2019t expecting my job to be giving me 30+ hour work weeks when I told the explicitly that I can only work 12-20 hours a week.

I'm in the same situation since work has me working doubles last few weeks since we are so hopelessly behind at my restaurant. I literally worked 25 hours between Thursday and Friday including working till 5 am Friday morning sleeping next to a dryer in a dorm I snuck into and then going back for my 9-5 shift and then being told to work the 7-1 shift. I'm quitting and going to another place, at least I am getting Thurs thru Sun off next week. Don't allow them to screw u like this I understand that you probably need the money but they are taking advantage of u fr",

If they don't comply, wait for them to fire you (yes, being taken off the schedule without notice counts), and then file for unemployment on the grounds of constructive dismissal.",
