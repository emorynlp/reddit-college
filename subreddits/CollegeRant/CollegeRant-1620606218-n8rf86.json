I guess it depends on what you define as cheating, I don't cheat on exams but I use chegg all the time to check my answers for various assignments and sometimes to get answers and learn from them. I do think that if you're cheating and not learning anything it's a waste of your time and money. I also think it's a waste of energy to link school performance to your pride/ego. To me the more important focus is how much value you're personally getting out of your performance in school.\n\nI would never discourage someone from being in college for depending on cheating, at the end of the day credits are credits and grades are grades in my opinion but I know personally I hated school when I've done that.

Honestly, I don't blame the cheaters. You realize how college and degrees are directly tied to someone's ability to well... NOT DIE? \n\nYou see.. a soccer competition, for example, is recreational. Although people get upset about not winning a trophy, it's not like their life depends on getting that trophy. I'm willing to shame cheaters in such competitions but not in college where someone's life DOES depend on the \"prize\". \n\nThink about the consequences for getting a bad grade. Failing a class leads to dropping out which leads to most likely being subjected to debt from loans that person will have a hard time paying back since they dont even have a degree to get a decent job. Why should that sort of pressure be attached to anyone's learning??\n\nEven if they pass, the harsh competitive environment in the job market just makes degrees the bare minimum. Everyone will do whatever the fuck it takes to get a job that pays well so they dont have to worry about becoming a homeless dick sucking heroin addict. They're not going to settle for getting a degree at the bare minimum. They're striving for putting themselves in a position that will provide them the means to survive. \n\nThis is no different than the wild. When it comes to survival, there's no such thing as cheating. You don't see fucking lions laying out ground rules such as avoiding chewing out each other's ballsacks in a deathmatch for the sake of preserving sportsmanship. FUCK NO. They will resort to whatever dirty tricks it takes to be the last one standing and breathing. The only winner of that match is the one who lives.\n\nOf course, I'm not trying to excuse cheating but I dont think theyre the ones to blame.

Math was too easy for me to cheat. Although I know my math knowledge only goes up to pre-calc. That stumped me and since I like math I am going to use Khan academy to try to reach myself it. Anyway that didn't stop me from downloading the professors video and their notes for the class and getting the book so I could go over it all again at my pace. \n\nMy major now I did for terms since they were different even amongst my media & technology professors and I did cheat by asking a friend for help. \n\nYes Being home has royally F'ed me because all I learned for my adhd was school / work based. The goal was to finish all work before going home to give myself that mental break so I could relax at home and leave to get into school/work mode. Although I used my annoyance of being home going against everything I learned and am doing this. I'm going to finish this semester. My next will not have classes from my major. It's basically my makeup semester. I'll use it to go through all my books, I found pdf version of the all. I'm going to go through them and take my time to properly annotate and test things out. So coding/technology/ media information. I want my notes written on paper for every page and uploaded and saved for me on my hard drive. \n\nBeing home has also cut off my access to most of the equipment I had so I'll have to think of ways to use the knowledge with basic equipment since I'll likely be starting with equipment like that. \n\nBut one thing I am greatly upset about is not all my professors record their classes. Not all post it. I a student do not have the right to record. I wish I did because I could've recorded all my classes and nighttime classes. Instead I'll be given an Assignment sometime within the four hour class and eat and sleep cause class ended at 10pm. Wake up and even a note I make myself might not make sense cause it was done so late in the day. \n\nI do think things need to be handled better In college for this to help break down on students cheating. A part of it I think is also because of the rush, there is always a rush. There is always something that slips.
