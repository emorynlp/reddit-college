  "title:": "Orientation leaders (also students) SCREAMING sexual noises and innuendos on the quad during orientation, and trying to get my entering class to LITERALLY CHANT SEXUAL THINGS!!!",
  "text": "I am completely boggled at what happened yesterday afternoon. After a full of day of sitting there listening to faculty talk about how amazing our school is and how smart and lucky we are to be accepted (only 16% undergrad acceptance rate apparently - I didn't know it was so low), things went to hell as soon as we walked out out onto the quad. \n\nThe orientation leaders were getting everyone to chant sexual noises (moans etc) and innuendo out on the quad. I didn't join in on the \"fun.\" I turned around, walked out and drove back to my apartment. I am a non-traditional student in my mid-30s and it felt so weird being in such a sexually charged environment surrounded by kids nearly half my age. Not my cup of tea at all. I am not here for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant note: This is NOT a party school. This is a very nerdy niche professional doctorate-granting research university. I am completely shocked at the difference between the faculty's professionalism, which is also expected of us as students, and the awful behavior of their orientation leaders, who represent our faculty. One of the major reasons I chose this school over others is because, according to my research, it is NOT a party school. Clearly, I was wrong about that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to think at the moment. Classes start on Monday and I'm going to spend the weekend studying, as I should.",

Like I look at the freshmen coming to my school this year and they\u2019re all letting loose, and I don\u2019t feel like doing that, but kudos to them. I go to a pretty academic focused school too.
