  "text": "My dorm originally put 6 people in one dorm when there are plenty of other dorms in the building where no one showed up. Some people have only 2 people in their entire dorm\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019m stuck dealing with a roommate who is sick and refuses to get a COVID test and it\u2019s hard to social distance because there are 4 other people in this apartment(1 moved out because of drama). If my suite mate hadn\u2019t moved out, I would\u2019ve been stuck in my room with a sick roommate who I don\u2019t know whether has COVID or not. I\u2019ve been sleeping in the empty bed, but feel like a lot of the stuff left in my room has been taken hostage and the suite mates whose room I\u2019m sleeping in doesn\u2019t seem to be taking this all too seriously.\n\nThe roommate who is sick is planning to move out this weekend because she\u2019s dropping out of school, but she is putting so many people at risk in the meantime. When we ask her to get a covid test she just says I\u2019ll get one when I go home, which obviously makes no sense. I think she doesn\u2019t want to get tested because her birthday is tomorrow and she wants to go to the club. \n\nI told my RA yet nothing has been done. My University proudly announces they require weekly testing for students, but less than half do so",
