But that doesnt help you now so your best bet is to call the discover customer service line and ask for an estimate for when the money will go through, and if possible if it can be sped up. If it doesnt look like its going to go through on time call the relevant department at your school and basically beg for mercy, show them documentation that the money is approved and youre just waiting for it to be processed. Might work, might not. Worst case scenario youll have to stay at an airbnb or a motel near your school until the money goes through so you can still get to class easily. Let this be a lesson, get shit done ASAP", "author": "taybay462", "created": 1629582740, "upvotes": 3}}}
