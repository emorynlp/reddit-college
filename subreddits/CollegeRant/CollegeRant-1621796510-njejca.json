[facepalm]", "text": "I am a sophomore Computer Science Engineering student out in India ( Sucks already, I know). Our institute makes us scan pdfs of handwritten answer sheets to google forms as part of the examination. we had 2 exams on the same day about 3 hours apart one core (algorithms) and another 0 credit course (environmental science). I wrote both exams (pretty f\\*\\*\\*ing well, I tell you) and the problem is I submitted the algorithms answer sheet to both forms and now that they've compiled final results they tell me about the mistake. Mind you they found out about it weeks ago when my answers were checked. So bottom line, I am now failing in and will have to repeat a course which has absolutely 0 fucking credits and takes up 4 hrs of lecture time every week because of this bs. I fucking hate this brain, can I exchange it for another??", "author": "dropdeaddumbskull", "created": 1621796510, "retrieved": 1632949831, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gzgg2l3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/njejca/submitted_the_wrong_answer_sheet_facepalm/gzgg2l3/", "text": "I feel like the people who check this stuff would know you made a mistake and help you submit the right ones.\n\nCan you appeal/email to anyone in authority? I think that's something you can do to fix the problem. \n\nIf they can't help you that just means they're lazy or don't give a fudge about students. This is either punishment to make you learn your mistake so you don't repeat it at work or they're just hindering your life and being unproductive to society for keeping you back. Seems stupid they hold someone back because they made a mistake when people with jobs make mistakes too. I mean if it's life threatening that's another story.", "author": "executordestroyer", "created": 1621988859, "upvotes": 2}}}
