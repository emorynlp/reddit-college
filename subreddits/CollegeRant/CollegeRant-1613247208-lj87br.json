My liberal arts and GEs weren\u2019t much better: either overeager, self-absorbed loons who would rant about the state of the universe (and heavily imply that covid is a hoax and that they think lockdown is BS) and assign ridiculous amounts of writing that no full time CC student could plausibly be expected to complete in a week, or completely hands off professors who literally just assign reading and an essay a week and fuck off. No office hours, no emails, nothing. It\u2019s fucking bullshit man, and as the son of an English teacher who instructs over 800 high school students a day, it\u2019s incredibly painful to see that this is what education has become. Returning to in-person education once conditions are suitable might temporarily fix things, but I honestly think eliminating the \u201ccampus experience\u201d just ripped open already gaping holes in the higher education system. The corporate Supra-infrastructure has cemented its control over the education system, thanks to our dependence on their services as a result of being online, and now professors are practically encouraged to sit back and let these companies do all the work for them.
