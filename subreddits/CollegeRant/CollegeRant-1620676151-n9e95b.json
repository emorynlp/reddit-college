  "text": "I'm sick of professors putting zero work into their online courses. Powerpoint slides are not a lecture and I hate that so many professors refer to them as that. You can't even record a lecture for each unit and repost it every semester? All I get is powerpoint slides? I'm better off just reading the textbook cover to cover and taking my own notes. And at that point, I'm just teaching myself. Why do I even need to be in a class if everything I need to know can be learned from reading the book?",

Professors imbedding videos in .ppt, and setting the slides to go forward regardless of the video finishing or being paused...  then making students download those 1-3 Gb files. Not only can we not pause, rewind, or take a break  during that 90 minute crap fest. We also cannot use our computer, cast to a screen, or take notes while it's going. I ended up having to buy a 12 foot HDMI so I could add a screen to watch on my TV while note taking. Guess what! That fat file was consuming my (gaming) laptop's horse power and the lag would cause the power point to close. Oh, and test questions would be stuff like \"in lecture 9 I described a person with dementia, what color was his jacket?\". So, if you get bored and want to create a lecture for lecturers on how to not be slugs, I'd be glad to share it.",

The professors themselves aren't necessarily going to magically teach you anything you couldn't have done yourself. Think about it like this, if you had this ability to simply learn on your own, then college would be a breeze. You wouldn't need the structural support nearly as much as you'd just be there to get the degree.\n\nCollege isn't entirely useless, it just doesn't do what you think it's supposed to do IMO. Hence, why I say most people pay to attend college for an expensive social life experience.\n\nObviously, the end goal is to get the degree because employers today create a demand for it. You're paying tuition to basically go through professional corporation training so you can eventually be deemed competent for hire by having credentials.",

          "text": "Stem student here. Even before COVID, all of my stem lectures have always been just powerpoints. It\u2019s actually one of the reasons I got an iPad last year. I got tired of having to print off hundreds of pages every month (I have to take notes by hand or I won\u2019t remember). \n\nBut after COVID, this way of \u201cteaching\u201d was an absolute disaster. Staying focused in class while reading over a PowerPoint was hard enough. But doing it at home with a million distractions was rough & my GPA tanked. I could usually teach myself the material but I could not for the life of me grasp any STEM related material this year.",
