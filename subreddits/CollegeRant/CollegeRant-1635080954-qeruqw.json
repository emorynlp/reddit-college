  "text": "I talked to an advisor for my major and she told me it\u2019s important that I get an internship my senior year. I told her that will be difficult considering I already have to work 20-25 hours/week and go to school full time. I have not had a day off basically since the start of this fall semester. I am very stressed and struggle to get work done. She told me that she understands it is difficult because people who live off campus have to make money. She fucking told me I could consider moving into a dorm. I live in an apartment with my husband, that ain\u2019t gonna work lady. Also, I don\u2019t need any more student loans for super expensive dorming. Ah fuck, guess I\u2019ll die :} \nBy that I mean I will suffer until I graduate.\n\nTL;DR: advisor told me i should get an internship but i don\u2019t have time and i\u2019m stressed",

Poor (literally) guy was living in New York, working at one of the most prestigious investment banks in the world and a bartender at night.  He had a two-hour commute into work.   \n\nOnce he was moved into a full-time paying gig, he made just under $1m a year.  He's bank rolled about $10m a year for the past 25+ years.  We are the same age, but he looks 10-years older.  They certainly work in a high pressure, fast-paced environment.  \n\nMy point, don't discredit something because it's not paying.

My friend is also a psych major and she didn\u2019t have any experience. She applied to 3 local graduate schools and she didn\u2019t get in any of them. Now she\u2019s taking gap year to get experience. You might even want to look into doing another semester or summer classes if it means doing an internship if you plan to go to grad school.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re a senior or not, but get your foot in the door somehow.
