  "title:": "One bad semester ruined me",
  "text": "I always heard from advisors, professors, and other students that one bad semester is okay, and you\u2019ll recover. After having the worst mental health of my life last semester and not getting any grades above a C- I just feel like the rest of my college experience (three semesters) is ruined.\n\nMy GPA dropped seven points. I was next in line for a leadership position in an organization and was passed up because I\u2019m \u201cnot reliable\u201d. I was ousted from another organization. I was kicked out of the honors program. My invitation for a prestigious networking event was rescinded. I lost a scholarship. I had to drop my minor because I wouldn\u2019t finish in time after needing to retake a class for my major. My friends stopped inviting me places because I was always such a downer and don\u2019t care to see me now that we\u2019re back on campus. I lost everything I had to lose and I\u2019m not sure what to do next, because everything I spent the first half of my college career working towards is now gone and I can\u2019t get it back. I just wish I could have a do-over.\n\n\nTL;DR I was removed from all of my extracurriculars and lost most of my friends because my mental health faltered for four months.",
