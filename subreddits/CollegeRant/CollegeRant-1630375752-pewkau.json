After having the worst mental health of my life last semester and not getting any grades above a C- I just feel like the rest of my college experience (three semesters) is ruined.\n\nMy GPA dropped seven points. I was next in line for a leadership position in an organization and was passed up because I\u2019m \u201cnot reliable\u201d. I was ousted from another organization. I was kicked out of the honors program. My invitation for a prestigious networking event was rescinded. I lost a scholarship. I had to drop my minor because I wouldn\u2019t finish in time after needing to retake a class for my major. My friends stopped inviting me places because I was always such a downer and don\u2019t care to see me now that we\u2019re back on campus. I lost everything I had to lose and I\u2019m not sure what to do next, because everything I spent the first half of my college career working towards is now gone and I can\u2019t get it back. I just wish I could have a do-over.\n\n\nTL;DR I was removed from all of my extracurriculars and lost most of my friends because my mental health faltered for four months.", "author": "ThrowAway_BadSem", "created": 1630375752, "retrieved": 1632948984, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"hb34xgp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pewkau/one_bad_semester_ruined_me/hb34xgp/", "text": "Thats unfortunate what happened to you, but at least you still have a shot on graduation, the only reason you went to uni is to get that degree, so finish strong and take mental health breaks if needed.
