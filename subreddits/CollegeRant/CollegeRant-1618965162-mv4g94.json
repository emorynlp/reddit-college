I especially love papers that followed instructions. Maybe your panicked brain helped you do only what was required?\n\nAlso, we're equally as exhausted as our students.",

Once to get an idea of what they're talking about and the second time to grade with the rubric. I use Canvas and turn on \"blind review\" and utilize both the rubric and assignment mark up functions. \n\nReading twice ensures that I don't miss something important and that I don't go into 'copy edit' mode, but instead give substantive feedback. Caveat though, with the exception of two class, the papers I assign are research papers with specific sections/formatting and limit them to 4000-4500 words (because that's the range of my two favorite journals - J. of College Science Teaching & American Biology Teacher). So I'm not often having to wade through 20-30 singe spaced essays with no images like some of the humanities.",

Also, when I get them again as seniors their writing is much less painfully, lol.\n\nTime is very dependent on the course level (freshman v senior) and my mood (how much other stuff I have going on, the weather, etc). Typically a freshman paper, where instructions were mostly followed, and they have a general idea of what they should be doing, ~15min. In general I'm a fairly quick reader and typist so unless there are major problems I can go fairly quickly. I also keep a digital post-it note of common comments in case multiple people make the same/similar mistakes. The Canvas rubric can also save all of your comments in case you need to make the same one (i.e. this is APA 6th edition not APA 7th edition formatting).",
