We\u2019re on campus 2 weeks before classes start, and this week is looking as lonely as my first. I\u2019ve made acquaintances in orientation, however, we don\u2019t hang out outside of that. No one at my school seems \u201ceager\u201d to make friends as everyone says Freshman are in college. My school is very cliquey and everyone already seems \u201ccliqued\u201d up. People will be nice to you but won\u2019t make the space for a friendship to grow through hanging out especially if they already have other friends. I see everyone hanging out in groups, going to parties together, exploring the city, then I'm just in my room. My roommate has their own friends and never invites me out although they continuously ask if I have any friends and I keep saying no\u2026 if I did I wouldn\u2019t be in my room much would I? It also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m shy and 8 hours away from home, but I have been trying to reach out to people, they just aren\u2019t at all receptive. It\u2019s going to suck going through another week of seeing everyone have fun while I\u2019m alone. I\u2019m not sure if anyone can give me advice. I just needed to get this off my chest. I\u2019m at the school I\u2019ve been dreaming about since ninth grade but I\u2019m not sure if it was the right decision.", "author": "mundercover", "created": 1629094267, "retrieved": 1632950771, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 136, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h98z53f": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p5aay7/making_friends_is_hard/h98z53f/", "text": "Thank you all for all the advice!

Everyone is so focused on their own thing. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. You can put yourself out there and be friendly, but that\u2019s really all you can do. You might make one or two really amazing friends out there for life and when that happens you\u2019ll be over the moon. \n\nI met one of my best friends years ago in bio. We got coffees together, grouped up occasionally, and texted. But it wasn\u2019t until maybe a year or 2 years ago when we started talking. We were both so busy trying to get our academics finished and our lives sorted out that we had no time to communicate. But the second we began messaging again we basically started where we left off. \n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands then keep putting yourself out there to meet people. Otherwise don\u2019t stress too much. You\u2019ll find a good friend soon and it\u2019ll be an unexpected surprise.", "author": "TheRestIs_Confetti", "created": 1629135085, "upvotes": 1}, "h96d3fv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p5aay7/making_friends_is_hard/h96d3fv/", "text": "i\u2019m about to go into my second year.

Join and boom that\u2019s a bunch of friends.\n\nTalk to your seat mates first day of class and ask to exchange phone numbers for notes etc. Invite them to study and hangout at the library or something. Ask if they wanna study over dinner at the dining hall.\n\nGo to the dining hall and ask to sit with another person who is alone. It is scary as hell but just start asking them questions and hold a conversation. They might be a new friend. Worst case scenario you just had an awkward dinner which is not that bad.\n\nGo to events on your campus. Guest lectures, IM sports, movies, hall events in your dorm, talk to your dorm neighbors (if you haven\u2019t yet, introduce yourself TODAY. It will be way more awkward for the rest of the year if you never talk to them at the start, trust me I am a senior and did that already). Invite them to dinner, or lunch, or go get ice cream, or to go bowling, or to go explore campus, explore where your classes are. Also if you\u2019re interested, see if your school has a Discord server.\n\nBond over the mutual experience of starting college together. Talk about how your high school was, where they\u2019re from, their major, their dream career, favorite hobbies, clubs, aspirations, style, whatever you want. \n\nLike another commenter said, making friends is scary and it is hard as you have to put yourself out there in uncomfortable situations to do so. But it is so worth it. The payoff massively trumps the cost of being awkward for a temporary amount of time. A social life isn\u2019t just going to happen for you. Advocate for yourself. Really put in the effort or it might be a lonely year which is something you surely don\u2019t want after the last two.\n\nBest of luck. \ud83e\udd17", "author": "GreyStomp", "created": 1629127324, "upvotes": 9}, "h95ziyi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p5aay7/making_friends_is_hard/h95ziyi/", "text": "I know your pain. It sucks watching people be gregarious all around you while you're left wondering why you're left out. Leaving your dorm room door open while you're in it is generally an open invitation to introduce yourself during orientation. You can also grab a good book and read it in a public area like the common room or the quad.

Ask your roommates if you can hangout with them and their friends rather than wait for them to invite you. Because a lot of them are already cliquey, you just have to ask to be invited which can be a bit embarrassing and might hurt your pride but don't let it get to you. It might be hard at first especially, as you said, a lot of them aren't receptive. \n\nAs the other comment says, give it some time. Your efforts will bear fruition. If your college has a facebook page for your class, then just message random people. It usually works at my college.\n\nIf you don't find much luck still by the time semester starts, the other best ways to making friends are classes and clubs. Talk to the person next to you in your lecture hall. Join a club and participate in their social events. These are what I have learnt from my time in college.

I wish I had known at your age (I\u2019m assuming 18 or close) that you don\u2019t need friends to have fun!! Work on yourself, take interest in your classes, go on a walk.
