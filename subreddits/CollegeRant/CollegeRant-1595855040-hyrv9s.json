On the plus side, my school's faculty is pretty helpful and friendly, and the cost for this (inferior) education is about 30k, so it isn't all too bad. I just can't shake off the feelings of unease, disgust and discomfort I feel in this place. \n\nAm heading into sophomore year of a commuter school and I fuuuuckkking hate this college. Competitve, elitistic toxic people and culture all around. Unfortunately, my country only has a handful of colleges, and I can't transfer overseas with this pandemic, so I'll be stuck here for the next 3 years. Thank god the next semester is online, because I've been enjoying my summer break IMMENSELY. \n\nI'm always the one reaching out to make new friends and it's extremely hard to make close friends. Joined clubs, organising event committees but I just can't find new close friends. Thank god for my one childhood friend or I'll be fucking miserable here. Also, the toxic culture keeps revolving around which prestigious internship you've enquired, what brands you are wearing, which I hate. \n\nI just intend to focus on my own career path, get internships and also focus intensely on my hobbies. I have my own goals and I will continue striving forward to fufill them admist my frustration. I'm here to make my financial independence, although my self esteem is eroding every second I spend here.

I don\u2019t think I would say I strongly \u201chate\u201d where I go to school, but my happiness has been on a *very* downward curve since I first got there in August. In turn, I think this has started to cloud any positive thoughts I could be having.\n\nI go to a somewhat reputable university (fairly prestigious in my state & ranked in the 70\u2019s nationally), but my school is most commonly associated with the Pre-Medical track. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from when you started discussing the culture of your university - as some of the Pre-Medical culture at my school can definitely have its moments of isolating students, elitism, & general \u201crudeness.\u201d Thankfully, I switched out of that path & into a BBA degree.\n\nI also feel the same way in regard to being open and attempting to create connections with other people. I don\u2019t think I was as forward or involved as you mentioned, but regardless, I tried. I\u2019m introverted at first, so I felt like it wasn\u2019t working - which I was why I stopped trying to be extroverted Spring semester. Granted, this is not what I should have done and it\u2019s my fault for falling into that mentality. However, I talked to my mom & dad about it, & they suggested that I simply try to begin this semester fresh/with a new perspective. Since I\u2019m already somewhat broken into college, I can truly focus on being a better person/more personable. I know my situation is a little different from yours, but I think I begin to cloud my judgement when I start having the mentality that everyone doesn\u2019t want to speak to me - even though that may not be true. \n\nI think it\u2019s admirable that you have your priories in line for the future. That\u2019s something I am hoping to accomplish more this semester (outside of academics), as I know I cannot keep looking for satisfaction in inconsistent/worldly things.\n\nI hope the next semester goes well for you! I think we just have to be patient & hang in there.", "author": null, "created": 1595872267, "upvotes": 3}, "fzexxkp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hyrv9s/fking_hate_my_college_so_much_but_cant_transfer/fzexxkp/", "text": "That's the con of going to a reputable school. I attend one as well, alot of people seem spoiled and haughty. I've learned to ignore it and focus on myself. Universities are a bubble and they're far from reality. Try and venture off campus into reality and find things to do. Usually your town will have some kind of events calendar online or in the paper, I would also check out the local event centers too if you have one. I had the same issue my first semester and it sucks. It almost feels like high school, but not as cliquey.", "author": "NoChannel1", "created": 1595865310, "upvotes": 15}}}
