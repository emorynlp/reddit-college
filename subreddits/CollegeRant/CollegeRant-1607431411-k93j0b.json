My school gave me 6 weeks to pay 1800$. I just finished spring semester and live on my own and bc of how much I was making was NOT  getting financial aid. So after paying all the bills for the month ur telling me I need to pay all this in just one month basically???? Umm fuck no and how I was treated by the person at the business office, bc that\u2019s where we pay our tuition in person, she didn\u2019t let me see her supervisor or give me her number and email. And I\u2019m not very calm when I\u2019m angry, so when she refused me service I got irate started yelling at everyone of those people, told them exactly what I was going to do and told her she\u2019ll be hearing from me again. Went in to the school grievance office put in  that, then when over head to the head of the business office met with them and told them how I was treated. Then I went to the border of trustees and found out if I want to change payment plans I needed to sit in a meeting and then present it to the border which is only held on specific Thursdays at not always the same time. So, I told him I would also be going over his head... long story short I went all the way to the vice chancellor of finances of the district of the school. She was not happy to hear from me. I had to look up property ownerships of the land the school sat on just to find her number, so when I explained to her everything and that if she checked her email she would also see a written and filed grievance and my attempts to go to the board meetings, she immediately took off the 25$ charge and miraculously the next semester we no long had to pay full tuition in one month. Also the students received information about the faculty now needing to take sensitivity training to handle escalated issues. Again, not proud of this but if u really want to fuck with ur school and get notice then ur going to have to make a lot of noise to do it. And ur going to need to offend some people by going over their head and piss some people off by actually finding their direct number. Students have so much power if we actually rallied behind the ideas we want. Bc I don\u2019t think they are out of line being treated like a student? Oh fuck yea I agree and I have had to remind grown ass adult professors that they aren\u2019t the only adult in the room.

It's why they pool all their money into renovating buildings to make them more modern and state-of-the-art equipment instead of giving it to underfunded departments and students in need.\n\nBack when college was more affordable, it was partially because they received more government funding through taxes of the people in the area. But as taxes got cut and budgets moved around more and more, the burden of paying for school ended up more and more on students.\n\nSo schools decided to appeal more to students who could pay more (not to mention people who had parents who would donate thousands just to help ensure their kid had a slot). Of course, they basically started shutting out the poor kids somewhat because they ended up adding the additional burden of having to pay for fees to help pay off their bills\n\nAlso there's just plain old greed as you pointed out. Like right now you have college administrations lining their pockets with the extra CARES act money that was supposed to be dedicated towards helping students. Also, even pre-CARES ACT, schools have several millions they're sitting on from fundraisers and donors but conveniently couldn't use to help students with full room & board and partial tuition refunds because \"we don't decide how that money is spent\" \n\nSo long story short, the US College System is a burning trash heap. Literally every other developed country has higher education that does not end with most students in the hole by graduation.", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1607435739, "upvotes": 87}}}
