      "text": "college isn\u2019t the only way. find out what you want to do. You can get certifications for some jobs that require <6months worth of classes. like medical assistant, medical coder, dental assistant, pharm tech,  and more. Just research what you really want. I don\u2019t think you should go into debt over something you don\u2019t really think you can do. It\u2019s okay because college isn\u2019t for everyone.",

Its also much easier to move up in a job environment.\n\nTake it one day, one assignment, one class at a time. Thats how I survived 7 years of college. Dont look at the entire length of time. Meeting friends in college helped a lot.",
