  "text": "From the title that might not be so bad but the class is called young children and Technology I don't think there's been a single reading she's provided that was written past the Year 2014. The the reading on doing right now mentions a recent study from **2010** I'm not saying all of the readings have to be from the last year but things have changed so much in the last 10 years it would be nice to have something that didn't come out when I was in high school , (im 26 btw) additionally as you might have noticed it says young children and Technology the kids were focusing on our birth through age 8 why are all of our sources from before these kids were born.",
