  "text": "I just need to rant about this because I\u2019m kinda at a loss. The other night, I made a post on Yik-Yak, which is an app where people post anonymously and people  within a 5 mile radius can view and comment. Someone down the hall from me had left some old food outside their door. I didn\u2019t think it was such a big deal that I needed to talk to the owner of the food, but I thought it was kinda funny so I posted \u201clet\u2019s not leave rotting food in the hall.\u201d I got into a dumb argument with someone in the comments, and I said some pretty sassy things. In my mind, this is all in good fun. The whole point of Yik Yak is to say things anonymously, and I\u2019ve seen way worse posts on there. Well about 30 minutes later the RA gets on the hall chat and tell people to quit beefing on Yik Yak. The owner of the pumpkins started saying how upset she was, and the RAs are now going to have a mandatory meeting with the entire hall about \u201cbullying.\u201d I feel awful. I had no intention of causing drama, and I hate having to pretend I know nothing about this situation because the Yik Yaker is being framed as a bully.",

      "text": "I\u2019d personally just stay away from apps like that in general as if they claim to be \u2018anonymous\u2019 they are just straight up lying to you. Nothing is anonymous on the internet, especially if you\u2019re broadcasting those messages to people less than 5 miles away from you. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that somebody in the same residence hall was also on the app. If you wanna crack jokes with friends on a group chat or something that\u2019s cool but doing the same thing on an \u2018anonymous\u2019 app like yik yak is kinda just like high school gossip, easy to cause drama.",
