So now instead of taking 9 hours of classes to be full time I need to 12 hours of accelerated 6 week course work. All I need to do was take 9 hours of classes to graduate next fall but now I won't get financial aid because my course load is too small and if I take extra classes they won't be considered apart of my degree plan and I'll be dropped from financial aid. I get that universities are bleeding because no one is paying for residency but this is ridiculous. I'm going to have to take 22 hours next semester and that'll be rough.\n\nTLDR: my summer financial aid is screwed because of a scheduling change", "author": "DementedCooki3", "created": 1621138071, "retrieved": 1632842381, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"gyafxrc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ndg348/cost_of_summer_attendance_increase/gyafxrc/", "text": "Thank you u/DementedCooki3 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
