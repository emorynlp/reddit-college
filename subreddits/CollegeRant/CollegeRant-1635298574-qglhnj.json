  "text": "I transferred to an out-of-state college this semester after two years at community college in my home state, and the transition has been kinda rough. I\u2019m not really homesick, but I\u2019m having trouble making friends here. I know the easy solution is just to join clubs but some of these meetings take place at like 9 PM \ud83d\udc80 I\u2019m pretty introverted and don\u2019t have the energy to be walking around campus and socializing that late. Covid also took a toll on my social skills, and being in a new environment with people I don\u2019t feel comfortable around doesn\u2019t help. The experience at this college is just different than I thought it would be. It\u2019s not terrible, but sometimes I\u2019m also not super excited to be here either. \n\nAcademically, Organic Chemistry completely sucks, and I feel like the test grades in my STEM classes define my intelligence. \n\nTL;DR My mental health and social life are not thriving right now at my new school",

      "text": "I really really relate to this. I\u2019m a stem student (but a commuter) and it\u2019s so overwhelming. I haven\u2019t made any friends either bc I can\u2019t go to meetings at 8/9 pm. Unfortunately I do not have any advice as I\u2019m going through the same thing right now, but hopefully it might help to know that you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m thinking about seriously cutting down on my class load next semester though. Sending virtual hugs (if you like hugs)",
