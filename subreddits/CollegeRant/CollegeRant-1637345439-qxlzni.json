  "text": "Given the class is only worth half of what a normal class is, I thought I\u2019d do better on it given how much I\u2019ve been studying, but I guess not. I just, really feel awful, like I tried so much but then so many things happened and it was all just fucking terrible, that I don\u2019t even want to think about it anymore it just gives so much anger. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore, but even so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give up, it\u2019s just disheartening, and seeing everyone else do so well is also disheartening because I feel like an idiot, I don\u2019t want to have to work three times as hard as someone else just to do slightly worse, I don\u2019t want to have to keep on going on this long road where it seems like everyone else is doing better, it just feels tremendously lonely honestly\u2026.",

I want you to know that you aren\u2019t alone feeling this way. I get insecure when I think about people doing better than me in tests and assignment. I do hope things work out for you in the long run.",
