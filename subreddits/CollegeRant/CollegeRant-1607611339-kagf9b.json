Go to the tutoring center and ask about help with study skills and time management. Those two things are the main reasons that students struggle when they start college. Also realize that this semester was not normal at all. When school is normal you can form study groups and go to your professors for help. Don't judge your intelligence by this semester. I'm an A student and even I struggled this semester. Most importantly, be kind to yourself! You are doing something hard in a very strange time.
