  "text": "This is just a rant because I\u2019m really upset but last year was my first year on college. It went rough. My mom finally died from cancer and the rest of the year, along with COVID, was just a mess. It was hard. So fall rolls around and I\u2019m ready to do better this year, but two \u201clittle\u201d road blocks. The week before I intended to register I caught tonsillitis or something that put me down for a week straight, by the time I gotten to registering all the classes were taken up and I didn\u2019t have much of a clue anyways. Oh, and I was on academic probation. Surprise! I got an email at the end of spring term; that I just found tonight. Cool. I talk to my counselor about it, he tells me what to do, what classes and how many credits I need. I luckily get some late start classes and all is good, I\u2019m just waiting on these classes to start. Day before they start? One of them is cancelled. Now, my school has a policy for students on probation. You\u2019re only allowed 13 credits; and you need 12 to be considered a full time student. I had 13, but the day before classes started, while I was sitting looking over my textbooks and syllabi , I get a message; the class is cancelled! And just like that, I go from on the right track off of academic probation, to on my way to a sure dismissal. Even now, as I\u2019m on top of my classes, trying to actually do something in school. I\u2019m at 11 out of 13 credits, and one fucking credit has now sent me, a student ready to make a change, towards dismissal. I\u2019m angry and I\u2019m sad and I feel hopeless; I have a list of unis I want to go to, I had all my classes planned, I\u2019ve been studying more and putting effort into finishing work on time, now it\u2019s all for what? Oh, and I lose my health insurance too! I\u2019m so frustrated; I\u2019m really trying to make a change, I know what I need to do and what I want, now it\u2019s all being fucked over because I was fucking up in my first year and I missed registering for classes when I should\u2019ve done so weeks earlier. I know it\u2019s my fault, it just hurts, I feel like I\u2019ve been kicked in the gut\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll try and repeal and I\u2019ll still try my best in class, I\u2019m just overwhelmed. I fucked up so bad, I\u2019m so upset. I tried. \n\nTldr ; I registered late on aca probation, a class got canceled right before it started, and now I\u2019m headed towards dismissal.",
