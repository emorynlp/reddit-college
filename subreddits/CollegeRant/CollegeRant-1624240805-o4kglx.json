Do  these mindless corporate loving imbeciles talking about anything other  than coding interviews or possible internships at a Big N??\n\nIt  is ridiculously cringe hearing some people worship big tech constantly  and dedicate their lives to working there while putting down those who  don't. These people make it their personality.\n\nI get it they pay well and you're trying to work at a top tier tech company, but **shut the fuck up**.\n\nFor  those wondering that I am just jealous or envious of those who work at  Big N, I am not. I will be happy to hear someone that got into those  companies, but once or twice is enough. Dedicating your life and  personality to it is just over the top cringe.\n\nThese  people have no self-awareness and it is ridiculous how this recent  culture of brain dead big tech worship has taken over the CS scene in  most colleges. Every time I get this vibe from a person I want to puke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Big tech worshipers in CS are ridiculous and have no personality aside from being a corporate lover. These people are either not self-aware or can't understand not everyone wants to work for big tech but they will shove it down your throat regardless.", "author": "VegetableCry0", "created": 1624240805, "retrieved": 1632842187, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h2hr48d": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o4kglx/big_tech_and_cs_majors_rant/h2hr48d/", "text": "Thank you u/VegetableCry0 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
