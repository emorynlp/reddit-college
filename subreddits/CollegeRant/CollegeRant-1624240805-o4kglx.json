  "text": "\"Dude did you know this person got a full time at this big n/faang company\"\n\n\"Dude did you leetcode today to get ready for coding interviews????\"\n\n\"Omg dude I can't wait until I interview this big n/faang company my life would be complete\"\n\n\"Dude they work at a big n/faang company they are so cool asdasdass!!!!\"\n\nLike  seriously, what the fuck is wrong with these types of clout chasers? Do  these mindless corporate loving imbeciles talking about anything other  than coding interviews or possible internships at a Big N??\n\nIt  is ridiculously cringe hearing some people worship big tech constantly  and dedicate their lives to working there while putting down those who  don't. These people make it their personality.\n\nI get it they pay well and you're trying to work at a top tier tech company, but **shut the fuck up**.\n\nFor  those wondering that I am just jealous or envious of those who work at  Big N, I am not. I will be happy to hear someone that got into those  companies, but once or twice is enough. Dedicating your life and  personality to it is just over the top cringe.\n\nThese  people have no self-awareness and it is ridiculous how this recent  culture of brain dead big tech worship has taken over the CS scene in  most colleges. Every time I get this vibe from a person I want to puke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Big tech worshipers in CS are ridiculous and have no personality aside from being a corporate lover. These people are either not self-aware or can't understand not everyone wants to work for big tech but they will shove it down your throat regardless.",

Apple is so fun to work at, we love the Apple cafeteria with its Apple Pay system, we get to change the world at Apple, I *LOVE* my Apple charger (when somebody in the group complained about it).\n\nLike I know the point of the tour was meant to be promote Apple and that I own numerous Apple products myself, but it was so weirdly cult-like that it made me want to avoid interning there.\n\n(To be fair though, I\u2019d happily take an internship there now given current circumstances)",

Like we only take Java I and nothing else so even if we wanted to try for one of those comp sci internships, we wouldn't qualify. I also got told by my internship advisor to expect not to get a cyber sec internship for my first one which I think is absolute bullshit. The remaining choices are basically tech support.\n\nI'm gonna try for the FBI one so if nothing else, it looks good. I want to do cyber forensics.",

I am a returning intern at a Fortune 500 right now and the interview process for me was mostly behavioral instead of technical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoding interviews are more logic based than language based. For interns, most would just like to see how you solve problems in real time and how well you handle pressure. Which I would say is a skill that is harder have but far more useful than memorizing leetcode problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that gave you a peace of mind and good luck!",

After college, I never want to work at a big n again, especially as a fulltime employee, and I don't think people want to either. \n\nThey just want the assurance that having an internship/job guarantees. I want to work in data analytics to reduce our carbon footprint. I got rejected to a pretty well-known environmental laboratory last year, and I now grind to insure I get a job there. I don't give a rats ass about faang after college, it's just a tool to get me further in what I want to do.\n\nI totally get what you're getting at with the cultists in tech, but I feel like that's a loud minority, or the people who think tech is the express lane to being rich.",

You\u2019ll learn. You\u2019ll get an inflated ego. You\u2019ll probably realize how stupid big tech is along the way. The best part is that, after you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll look at your pay, you\u2019ll look at the cost of living and you\u2019ll go \u201coh shit, I fucked up\u201d. \n\nThe best advice I can ever give anyone out there is that big tech is not the best. The best is having the highest take-home without being ripped apart by taxes.\n\nI work with some of the most egotistical, smart and asshole people all because big tech is some holy grail. If you take the time to rip the curtains and see it for what it is, most of the people that work here have zero project ownership, are scared shitless of NDAs, zero creative freedom and are worked like dogs.\n\nFind a startup.
