  "text": "I am about to go into my third year and just realized a few months ago that Im not happy with what ive chosen and that the majors ive chosen to go with instead that might make me happy are the so-called useless majors that won't make me any money. I go to a somewhat expensive university so I dont have any more time to change majors again or think for too long about what i want. I was a Global Communications and Mandarin Chinese major before and now I am a Communications and English double major. Ive studied Mandarin for about eight years and just kind of burnt out. I am constantly stressed and embarrassed whenever I tell anyone what my majors are but I'm not sure what to do at this point. If I switched to a Computer Science or Health Sciences major, that would take another four years to complete and I'm not sure if having a minor in these subjects would be worth anything with my majors. If you guys have any advice, i would really appreciate it. \n\nTL; DR: I am embarassed of my majors and wish I could have something useful but I dont think i have enough time. Looking for advice.",

      "text": "I\u2019d choose cs minor. I actually recommend people not to major in it, but instead to minor, and pair it with something else. I think it\u2019s more powerful that way because in the minor you\u2019ll probably learn how to program. And programming is a tool that\u2019s used all over the place for a variety of reasons. I\u2019ve heard people in business roles do it, scientists do it, engineers do it, developers do it, data analysts do it, etc. Not only that, it\u2019s actually kinda fun. You might find you actually really like it and you can teach yourself a lot given a little guidance in the beginning. I\u2019m a cs major and I kinda wish I had done this instead of declaring.",

      "text": "The best thing to do now is career research. Speak with people in industries you are curious about and see what internships and degrees they got. Communication degrees still give you a lot of options despite being non technical. \n\nIt will take a lot more time and money to invest in another bachelors degree so you\u2019re best bet is to make the most of what you have now. \n\nMarketing, sales, recruiting, business administration, are all jobs you could use a communications degree in and make a very decent salary. If I were in your shoes I would pursue jobs in those industries with the option to eventually do a masters or MBA if you still want to pivot. Some companies will even help you pay for additional schooling down the road.",

      "text": "If grad school is in your periphery that could be something to look into as well. A master's degree could outweigh your undergrad and make you more competitive in the job market either way. Also if you're just looking to get by financially lots of companies hire for TEFL workers that pay enough to get by. It's hard to figure out where to go from here if you don't have a long term goal in mind.",

I had to defend my decision so hard for this major, and now switching out of the major feels embarrassing too bc idk how to make a music degree useful for me.\n\n I don't have any advice that worked bc I'm in the same boat, but just wanted to let you know you do still have time to figure out what you want to do. Please don't stress too much! There is no timeline to life. I hope you can find something that you enjoy and you're proud of.",

I\u2019m going back to University next year. It\u2019s frustrating, but changing my major in a subject I\u2019m passionate about makes all the difference. See if you can do something similar. I was an Elementary Education major that got burnt out and many teachers told me to run away from the job (which is very sad). Good luck to you! It\u2019s a long process but I\u2019ve realized that everyone is really at their own pace. There are 16 year olds, 40 year olds, and kids my age all pursuing their dreams at different points in their life.\n\n\u201cThe speed doesn\u2019t matter, only the direction you are going in\u201d.",

      "text": "For what it's worth, minor in CS is very helpful. Lots of jobs that will take a punt on someone who knows how to code. Other than that just get graduated, and then if you want do an Masters to change your terminal major. 5 years with a BS/BA and MS/MA is better than 6 years with a BS. Most MA/MS programs are not very selective, you'll be fine as long as you have some relevant undergraduate coursework.",

Ive always been told that communications and language majors are more \"supplementary\" degrees so I've just been kind of looking for a second major that I actually enjoy that would be able to carry me over. I found my passion in English but... another person here recommended that I research more careers so Im going to go firstly see my career counselor and see if thats any help.
