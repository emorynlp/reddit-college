I expected my college experience to be better, I'd make a couple friends, choose what major I wanted to pursue, find a job to make some money on the side, and looking back at it now, I realize how DREADFULLY naive I was to think I would enjoy college.\n\n2020 happened, and with it came Covid-19, which forced my college to put us into online classes through Zoom. I already struggle enough to stay focused in a class in-person, and Zoom meetings made this problem worse. This also meant I had no classmates to be around with. I have no friends at all, I am a very shy, antisocial person, and needless to say, being forced to be stuck in my room during classes did not do anything to help me.\n\nI was pressured by my parents to start my own business as a screenprinter. It failed because I lost the patience to put up with it since countless mistakes kept coming up, I barely had any requests coming in, and almost all the money I received had to be spent buying more materials. Plus, I had no passion for this job. This left me completely burned out, and it might have affected my college performance at the end.\n\nThe worst part came with the schoolwork. Having five classes to take, I was doing pretty well with all of them, consistently earning good grades. But towards the end of October, I completely crashed. Family and personal problems started to be an issue, it was impossible for me to stay organized because things kept coming up out of nowhere and took away the time I had, my mental health weakened and demotivated me from doing anything productive, even if it was important, and I struggled to understand parts of my assignments, and with all the stress I had on me, I felt it was easier to not do the assignment at all rather than spend hours trying to study and figure out what to do.\n\nThis reflected BADLY on my grades. I failed all but one of my classes, with the highest grade I made being a C. My GPA tanked, and my college put me into academic suspension. Thankfully, they're willing to give me a second chance, I am allowed to come back this upcoming semester, and I am still allowed to receive financial aid to pay for my education, but this time it is clear that I must improve my GPA and pass all my classes. To this day, though, I barely have the willpower to keep going through with college, and I have to try my best to keep news about failing my semester away from my parents, because I know I will be in for an awful punishment, and they might even force me to change to a major that THEY want me to pursue. I will never be able to become independent from my family this way.\n\n2020 has really made me hate college, and adult life in general. Things were bad in high school, but the problems got a thousand times worse now. I truly wish I could just drop out and leave my parents house at this point.\n\n**tl;dr:** Screw the college life, it just makes you feel worse than when you were a teenager. I truly don't want to keep going with it, and I don't know what to do anymore.

They don\u2019t care about anything except for money. That is why you\u2019re stuck there for four whole years (or more) and why there\u2019s no room for error. They\u2019re banking on you (students) screwing up so that they can make even more money. You, a distant spec in the clusterfuck we call life, are not an equal human. You are a customer. Not a student but, a tool of which you are used to fund a rich lifestyle for someone else. \n\nCollege system needs to be rebuilt where education comes first and where money isn\u2019t superseding the act of learning. And just because you have a doctorate or a masters doesn\u2019t grant you the right to teach. \n\nIt\u2019s increasingly subpar and shitty to raise college prices to some insane standard, have parents force it on their kids and then, have the same god damn college you go to (after the hell beforehand) to let you down in almost every respect. Even more-so, using the pandemic as an excuse to just not do your job. \n\nCrazy thing is that no one is willing to take any form of responsibility. Instead, they all point fingers at each other and expect something out of it. So, when you muster the rare courage to speak up, you\u2019re met with the same stupid people that are using your money and robbing you of your own future. \n\nImagine that.", "author": "majoroofboys", "created": 1610205271, "upvotes": 1}, "ginj5br": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kthbhz/my_first_semester_of_college_made_me_feel_like/ginj5br/", "text": "Gotta ask yourself a few questions: Why are you going to college?
