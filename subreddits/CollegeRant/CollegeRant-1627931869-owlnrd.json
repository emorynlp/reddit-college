She posted announcements for 3 out of 6 tests on BbLearn but otherwise I couldn't find a schedule anywhere. Went to Calendar, nothing. The tests are set to open at certain time of the day and then just disappear without a trace. The past week I went on BbLearn almost everyday and I somehow still manage to missed all three tests, because I couldn't see them anywhere. I sent her an email explaining everything and still she says it was my responsibility to keep up and that the class schedule was posted \"at the beginning of class\". I know I'm not the perfect student but it's really unfair to study everyday and still fail because I wasn't aware of tests to be taken. Is there anywhere to politely explain this to her?
