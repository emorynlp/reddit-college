  "text": "in order to pass this class I have to make 72.19 on my remaining assignments but it's looking impossible \nI spent so much time studying for my exam and I got an 18\nI fail every quiz whether I study or not \nI got a 0 on my first lab and a 33 on my second one \nI didn't fail this current one yet but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do so I may as well have failed it \nI tried getting more sleep but I still feel exhausted all the time, I gave up spending time making potential friends to focus on schoolwork just to still fail everything \ngiving up sleep to study didn't work either \nmy dad gave me the nice laptop I wanted just so I can use it to fail everything \nI can't change my major bc my major change got rejected and I waited \"too long\" to try to apply to a different one \nidk what I'm supposed to do \neverything feels so pointless",

When you go to talk with your prof or TA see if you can make a plan/ask how you could improve your work. They often give study advice or suggestions to aid in your learning. \n\nI don\u2019t know what class your taking (I\u2019m guessing stem related) but go look for tutors often you have paid for them or find grad students who do tutoring if you can afford to. \n\nDon\u2019t give up over a stupid class, Good Luck!!!!",
