I always have all my other work turned in days before the deadline and am always diligent in the class.\n\nI have been refreshing my email every 5 minutes for the past 45 minutes. My grade will drop to a 64 if I have to take the 0. No idea what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Still no reply. I decided to take the day off work in case she opens the exam for me today at a weird time. Wasn't able to sleep last night because of anxiety.

One low grade isn\u2019t going to matter. \n\nSo, hope for the best but know that if it doesn\u2019t pan out the way you hope then there\u2019s options you can take to fix the error.
