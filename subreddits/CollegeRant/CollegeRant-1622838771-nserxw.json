  "text": "I have a 100% (my social life is non existent) in my Biology I class and I completely misread the deadline. I came back from work at 4 and had a panic attack when I saw the quiz was locked. It's a Friday after usual office hours so I doubt she will even read my email. I am feeling so dumb. I always have all my other work turned in days before the deadline and am always diligent in the class.\n\nI have been refreshing my email every 5 minutes for the past 45 minutes. My grade will drop to a 64 if I have to take the 0. No idea what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Still no reply. I decided to take the day off work in case she opens the exam for me today at a weird time. Wasn't able to sleep last night because of anxiety. ",

Most of the time my professor was really understanding and willing to work with me as I was a good student. However, there was the occasional time where they wouldn\u2019t and in those time I tried to think of the worst possible scenario and how that would impact my life. \n\nSo let\u2019s say you get a 64. Depending on your school that may or may not be passing. No matter what you can always take it again and replace the original grade on your transcript if you\u2019re worried about overall gpa. That may seem like the end of the world but you\u2019ve probably already done most of the work so would it really be that hard to add it on to a later semester? And if you\u2019re not worried about your GPA (read: you\u2019re not trying to go to a top law or med school) then who cares? One low grade isn\u2019t going to matter. \n\nSo, hope for the best but know that if it doesn\u2019t pan out the way you hope then there\u2019s options you can take to fix the error.
