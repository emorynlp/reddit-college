  "text": "The campus is still closed, all the classes are virtual, the libraries are also closed.\n\nMy home is never quiet, there is always constant yelling, screaming, banging of things, children running around, etc. It only ever stops at night, but none of my classes are at night.\n\nI've taken tests with my little brother screaming at his video games for hours on end, parents chatting and arguing right next to me as if I wasn't trying  to study.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Not to mention they seem to treat college as some kind of \"hobby\". So they see no problem saying \"Thruway, go to the store and get milk, NOW!\". \"But I'm in the middle of a test/lesson right now\". \"I don't care, you will only get a few points of, right, we need milk now!\".\n\nAnyway, I've failed a bunch of tests like this, and half my classes I ended up having to retake. I have like a 2.0 gpa. I'm tired of this BS>",

I cant partake in the breakout rooms normally or have to run outside or the bathroom for some quiet. Idk how my family hasn't gotten the message yet. Somehow I'm the go-to for all of the household errands and chores. I've even gotten in trouble for not completing chores despite me needing the time for assignments. I try to be patient with my parents because they don't \"get\" college (I'm first gen, they didn't go themselves), but they don't make any effort to understand my situation.\n\nMy GPA has also fallen to around a 2.0. All my mentors and advisors have pointed out my decline in performance since we moved to online. I'm currently withdrawing from this semester in a last ditch effort to save my GPA",
