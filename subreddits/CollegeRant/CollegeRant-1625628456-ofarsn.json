Is another thing on a phone hotspot detected? Does glare and inconsistent lighting necessarily bother them? Do they detect your internet history or is all through honeypotting?\n* Does it track your eyes or your face?

It can absolutely flag the prof and not tell you.\n\n>How does it detect a secondary device? Is another thing on a phone hotspot detected? Does glare and inconsistent lighting necessarily bother them?\n\nAll of the above. \n\n>Do they detect your internet history or is all through honeypotting?\n\nIt doesn't download your history prior to starting the exam if that's what you mean, but it can tell if you tab away or access other sites/programs while using Honorlock.\n\n>Does it track your eyes or your face?\n\nYes, both.\n\n>I suck at staying still but I don't want it to think I'm up to no good just because I'm looking down or I roll my eyes a lot.\n\nFlagging just means your professor will take a look at it. Try to keep your eyes on the screen.\n\n>Does it film you in between taking a 360 of your desk and beginning the test itself?\n\nYes. Would kind of defeat the point otherwise, right? You're on camera the whole time, start to finish.\n\nDon't cheat and you're not going to get in trouble.", "author": null, "created": 1625629885, "upvotes": 5}}}
