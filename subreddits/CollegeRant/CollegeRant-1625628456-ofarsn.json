  "title:": "New to online schooling, lost and confused with questions about Honorlock",
  "text": "About to start, but I'm really scared about Honorlock after hearing it being used across classes whether we want it or not. What I want to know is:\n\n* What are these flags? Do they always let you know when you're being flagged or can they flag you, tell the prof but not you?\n* How does it detect a secondary device? Is another thing on a phone hotspot detected? Does glare and inconsistent lighting necessarily bother them? Do they detect your internet history or is all through honeypotting?\n* Does it track your eyes or your face? I suck at staying still but I don't want it to think I'm up to no good just because I'm looking down or I roll my eyes a lot.\n* Does it film you in between taking a 360 of your desk and beginning the test itself?",

      "text": ">Do they always let you know when you're being flagged or can they flag you, tell the prof but not you?\n\nDepends on how it's set up. It can absolutely flag the prof and not tell you.\n\n>How does it detect a secondary device? Is another thing on a phone hotspot detected? Does glare and inconsistent lighting necessarily bother them?\n\nAll of the above. \n\n>Do they detect your internet history or is all through honeypotting?\n\nIt doesn't download your history prior to starting the exam if that's what you mean, but it can tell if you tab away or access other sites/programs while using Honorlock.\n\n>Does it track your eyes or your face?\n\nYes, both.\n\n>I suck at staying still but I don't want it to think I'm up to no good just because I'm looking down or I roll my eyes a lot.\n\nFlagging just means your professor will take a look at it. Try to keep your eyes on the screen.\n\n>Does it film you in between taking a 360 of your desk and beginning the test itself?\n\nYes. Would kind of defeat the point otherwise, right? You're on camera the whole time, start to finish.\n\nDon't cheat and you're not going to get in trouble.",

              "text": ">Any example of what it flags without telling you?\n\nDepends entirely on how the professor has it set up. It could flag everything without telling you. There's no way to know.\n\n>So it still does that even if a live proctor doesn't interrupt you?\n\nIt can, yes. Again, it depends how it's set up. Only your prof will now how he or she has it configured.\n\n>Are dropped internet connections flags too?\n\nAbsolutely. Depending on your class/school policy, that might be an auto-fail.\n\n>So will it follow along with something like, I don't know, my brother dicking around on his phone? Even if they're not on the same WiFi?\n\nDepends what he's doing. Honorlock hosts or partners with a *bunch* of websites with apparent answers to exams. They're traps. If you're taking a chem exam, and your brother googles \"what is ph of water,\" yeah the odds are good that it will catch that. If he's on Fortnite, you're probably good.",
