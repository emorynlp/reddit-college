  "text": "\nThis really isn\u2019t that big of a deal, because I could always go to the library or something instead of working in my room, but it is annoying so I just want to rant a little haha. So my roommate sleeps an UNGODLY amount. We usually go to bed around the same time (which is relatively early bc I\u2019m a sleepier person), and I know she is often asleep before me because I can hear her start to snore. She snores very loudly, which is annoying, but not her fault and I usually play music to cover it up. It\u2019s really not a big issue. But then, after getting 8-9 hours of sleep at least almost every night, she takes a looong nap in the middle of what feels like every day. And snores very loudly. Like it\u2019s 3 pm and I\u2019m just trying to study for my calc 1 exam in the comfort of my room but I can have no peace :(. I recognize the snoring isn\u2019t her fault but I\u2019m just sitting in the room right now as she\u2019s snoring away thinking of course my roommate who snores is also an incredibly sleepy person. \n\nBut beyond this mildly irritating issue is just that she is so inconsiderate. Our room has a window, and she frequently opens it and leaves it open when it is raining. Four times now I have come back into the room to see her sitting on her bed as rain pours into the room. And because of the setup, the rain hits our bookcases, which I do NOT have money to replace. I always end up getting soaked going back there to shut the windows and using my towels to clean up the puddle that accumulates on the floor. Huge pain. Once she did give me a towel of hers to use, had me spread it out, and left it there for me to clean up. I\u2019m waiting to see how long she lets it sit there before she does it herself (over a week has passed by now). \n\nAnd I genuinely don\u2019t understand her thing with not using headphones to watch TikToks and stuff. I know she has them, but she\u2019ll just play stuff out loud when I\u2019m doing work or trying to sleep. And there are just a lot of annoying habits, like slamming drawers shut or dropping stuff on the ground so that it lands loudly. I\u2019ve resigned myself to taking out the trashing vacuuming, and basically doing every other chore that needs done, because I genuinely don\u2019t think that she even understands that these are things that need to get done. It\u2019s like she\u2019s never had to do chores before. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, but taking over an hour in the shower when there are only two showers on this floor of the dorm? Maybe There is an explanation but no one else takes nearly that long. She is just generally inconsiderate and I don\u2019t know how things could get better because how do you teach someone to notice when it is raining? How to you teach them to put things down gently? Long post I know but I needed the rant.",

Then ask her if anything you do bothers her. If she doesn't acknowledge any of the things you said you should definitely tell the RA or request a room change",
