I'm finishing high school this year and unless some miracle happen, I won't be able to find 200 times my parents' salary just for tuition for 3 years. And this does not even include accommodation. My country's education system is focused on fields I do not study and the most affordable colleges abroad are still freaking expensive. And let's not talk about the scholarships. Thank you i appreciate a 4k discount on my 25k tuitions, it really helps. Also, why is your scholarship available to international students if it \"favors domestic students\"? I can't focus on studying for my finals because I keep on thinking about how I'll have to change field and be stuck in a dead-end job (if I ever get one) in my home country because I'm not well-off enough. Did the price really have to be THIS exorbitant? :/\n\nTL:DR International students have it tough", "author": "made-of-meatballs", "created": 1611503474, "retrieved": 1632950812, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gknbhot": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l41u2n/college_is_so_expensive/gknbhot/", "text": "Start with community college; it\u2019s often more enjoyable with better professors and loads cheaper!", "author": "cbdbun", "created": 1611530429, "upvotes": 23}}}
