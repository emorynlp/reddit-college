  "text": "Good morning, users\n\nFor example, if you took organic chemistry 1 and the professor passed away from Covid, would another chem professor continue where the previous one left off or did the whole course go down the toilet, all that hard work for nothing. well, half of the work and half need to be completed.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "A similar situation happened to me before the pandemic. One of my professors had a \u201cmedical situation\u201d (it was never specified what happened) in the middle of the semester and she stopped teaching her classes. Another professor stepped in and became the new professor of the class. The new professor was in charge of all grading and teaching for the class. If your professor dies, what will probably happen is that another professor will teach the class for the rest of the semester.",
