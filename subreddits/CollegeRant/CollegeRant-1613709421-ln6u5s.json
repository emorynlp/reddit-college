Yes they'll probably bitch at you (and trust me, I understand avoiding things for the sake of not getting bullshit) but if dropping a class is what it takes to keep your head in the game do it. If you need to only do school half time? Do it. It doesn't matter how long it takes to get your degree it just matters that you do it and learn. Especially with your major. They're not paying for you to go to college so they don't get to tell you how to go through your college life.\n\n That being said, if home life is messing you up so much that it's affecting your GPA then I'd go to school half time and get a job and try to move out. No more bullshit or resentment from siblings or having to listen to them complain and tell you to do things that aren't good for your health. No fighting no bullshit no NOTHIN. You know your limits and how you work. Of course this is advice from an internet stranger, but I'm 25 and (hopefully) graduating this May and I may be behind when my mom wanted me to graduate or my friends but idgaf I just want my degree so I can really start moving forward in life by having a good job. What you can't do is let people who OBVIOUSLY don't make good life choices pressure you into doing things that will directly affect YOUR future.", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1613748915, "upvotes": 4}, "go07qdh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ln6u5s/my_parents_expected_me_to_go_to_college/go07qdh/", "text": "Quit caring because, where has that landed you?

It's not too difficult, and you pretty much say \"I dont have the money this year.\" Then you can do that each year until you get back in school.\n\nAs unfortunate as it was for me, I had to move out of my parents house before going back to school. We ended up cutting ties from one another (long story), but living away from them helped me be in charge of my own life and decisions.\n\nFinally, remember: you are going to school FOR YOU and NO ONE ELSE. Your success and disappointments are decided by you alone. You might want to help your family, but even as a doctor you can't fully support every single person in your household. Their journey is theirs and yours is yours. Take a step back, consider what you want, and where you want to go. It's your decision to make. But take this all one step at a time.\n\nIf you don't like your current university, apply to transfer. Explain to the admissions office your situation, and use your story to prove you'll do better. You might get a couple no's, but chances are someone will take a chance on you. Maybe get your associates at a community college first, if you're nervous about being rejected.\n\nBut you will get through this. We aren't actually set on a timeline, but are all facing life together. Breathe, care for yourself, do what you can for your family (if you want), but don't let their expectations drown you.
