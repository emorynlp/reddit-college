  "text": "Dear \\[my university name\\],All of the university in my province are going to have winter 2022 semester in face-to-face since the government lifted pretty much all of restrictions for schools except from mask mandate. In your august 2021 e-mail, the administration of \\[university\\] informed us that looking for an apartment in the city you are situated in because winter semester was going to be face-to-face.\n\nI trusted you. As the idiot I am, I packed my stuff and moved 4 hours from home, alone in one apartment with my cat. I tried convincing myself that I would be just fine if I could go to the gym and walk in the city, even if the fall semester was all online. I find it incredibly hard : there are days I am completely not speaking a single word other that the five words I will exchange when I get to the sport pavillon to get my ticket for the pool. There has not been a single day I did not regret choosing to move to your build-up, concrete, driver-based, noisy city. My life is incredibly lonely.\n\nToday, the news felt that in my department : two classes are given face to face and they are not classes I will actually follow (since I only have three classes left to follow, I am picking the one I want to work in). So here I am, crying because I have never felt as lonely.\n\nI am paying rent for an apartment I hate, to live in a city I hate, without having had a single  meaningful conversation with anyone in my program and it is because of the administration at \\[University\\]. And I have to listen to some of your professor explaining that online classes are the best thing ever when they are bringing me (a definite autistic introvert) into a state of despair I have rarely felt. I am angry, screaming and so sad because I feel like my despair is not hear. Most people in my program live with close ones (partner, children, family, friend...) and I have not talk to someone face to face since the lecture week when I went back home for a week. and I don't know if I can \"hold on\" until the semester is over to socialize more than the exchange I have at the grocery with my cashier.\n\nFuck off with your decision: student population is vaccinated at over 90%. If my former alma mater can give class in face-to-face (ALL OF THEM. IN ALL THEIR PROGRAM), you can fucking do it too. And not just two class out of the 18 you offer in the semester.  \n\n\nA broken studen",
