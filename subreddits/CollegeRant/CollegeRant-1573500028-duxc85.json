      "text": "Don't worry, most stuff in life is a joke. We all perish eventually and nothing matters in the end. Just do what you can and what you want, it can't that bad if life events are just tiny blips in vast human history. Stress less, because school will work out if it didn't matter anyway, like a video game.\n\nYes i'm being nihilistic, it's depressing but peaceful. Just keep living and you will be fine. I hope you can find stress-free enjoyment in your life soon",
