I got a new job and started the semester right, but I don't feel like I'm doing enough. My new job pays good money and it\u2019s flexible with my school, however, I have to pay a huge car note and ration my money for the next two weeks. I don't like to tell my friends my problem is because I feel like they will not understand me. Most of them have well-off parents, I try so hard but I feel like giving up. When I try to put a simile on girls can see right through it. I never had a gf and im still a virgin. I try to \u201cwork on myself\u201d but I don't have the money or time to do it is because I have other things on my plate. I hope something good happens to me for once.", "author": "Visible_Flow_5191", "created": 1630515625, "retrieved": 1632948964, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hb9ddj3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfy3rn/school/hb9ddj3/", "text": "Theres a lot of 21yos that arent in school and dont or barely work.
