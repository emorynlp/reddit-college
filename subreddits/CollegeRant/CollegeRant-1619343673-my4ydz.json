  "text": "I went into college thinking it would be a wonderful experience and that it would inspire me to be creative.\nWrong! College is a fucking circus. \n\nI was diagnosed with depression and I struggle to keep up with some classes causing me to drop them. I was okay with that, but the workload of the rest of the classes was so fucking heavy and I still spend all of weekends perched over my desk working over my new projects and the overdue ones. I am honestly sick and tired. \n\nAbove that the professors don\u2019t even understand. I told one of my professors that I was having a bad week end and my depression was getting worse and she had the AUDACITY to tell me that I don\u2019t sound depressed to her at all and that I should stop using the word depressed even after I gave her a note from my therapist. \n\nBitch please! I feel livid when I give excuses like not having enough time and the prof replies: wElL mAkE tImE. God I feel like im back in fucking elementary. still have a couple of weeks to finish this semester and end this shit show. \n\nFuck college and fuck all those stupid ass professors.",

Like.... accomedations are like a band-aid on a bullet hole of a problem.\n\nDisbaled people still struggle alot in college, even with accommodations. Its the way the exams and assignments are designed. They're definitely not designed with disabled people in mind.\n\nI can get extra time on an exam where I need to read walls of text. That still won't help test my knowledge on the subject, cus my brain dont work like that. Theres other ways to figure out what a student knows on a subject. Colleges and schools just don't care about the other ways.",

They will make/recommend appropriate accommodations based (partially) on those factors. They do have the final say in the cases of specific assignments.",

My professors have salaries and it's not like it's a set 9-5 daily (because that's not how college schedules work). It is their job to teach their students with whatever methods they choose, but grading an exam 3 days later than when they would have been grading it anyway isn't \"too much extra work\" - because it's probably going to take the same amount of time as it would have 3 days earlier. I'm talking about something like turning in all the assignments the last week of the semester. And as I also said, I'm referring to professors who will not care about a single thing. Hence my comment about them being the \"No one have ever gotten an A in my class\". The professors who refuse any discussion or even legit emergencies as an excuse\n\nYour comment doesn't seem to understand that I was saying students with those professors are being screwed. I wasn't saying anywhere professors need to do whatever I want them to. Hopefully this clears it up.",

          "text": "As a college professor who is currently working with advisees on registration, if I had a student do what you did and explain their rationale as clearly as you just did, I\u2019d be applauding you. \n\nI\u2019m the one more often pointing out to students that they should probably space out those STEM classes, and actually the writing-intensive classes, too. I\u2019ve had math-weak students come in with their course preferences, including classes they are retaking. \n\nMe: This course load I s going to kill you, Them: No, I\u2019m going to really focus this time...\n\n*two weeks later*\nThem: I need you to sign my drop slip ASAP",

              "text": "I only take 2 classes at a time. I don't do full-time. It may get me more financial aid, but I'll be overworked and overcommitted. I have Asperger's and dyslexia. I have learned what amount I can handle and not to overcommit myself. I'm not weak in math, thankfully; I have taken 2 calculus courses and passed both on the second try. I enjoy studying math actually. Environmental Engineering will actually be a good discipline for me to major in. I'll just stick to the minimum of 6 credits, though.",

              "text": "This depends on your advisor and your age. I've seen this a lot with younger students but, as an older student, my advisor was like 'take as many credits as you want, just keep your FA in mind'.\n\nWith the mental health thing, I think some departments are starting to move in a direction that keeps in mind mental health. I can say that my classes for the most part have been VERY lenient on grading and work completion the last year (I'm in STEM). I'm betting that OPs school has a department dedicated to mental health and/or disability advocation (of some sort) if they are in the US. It may very much benefit them to seek out accommodations for depression.",
