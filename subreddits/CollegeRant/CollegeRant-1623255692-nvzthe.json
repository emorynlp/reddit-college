Duh, of course that's essential. \n\nBut holy shit, can professors who are NOT English professors stop focusing SO HEAVILY on the mechanics of the paper. 20% off my entire assignment (the first one of the year, at that!) because I don't know the ins-and-outs of this random citation method that no one uses, well enough to get it 100% correct on my first attempt. She included resources with links in the syllabus on how this citation method works and the part of the webpage about in-text citations requires a paid subscription!! I had to go elsewhere to research how to do this type of citation and was lead astray by the trusted Citation Machine. \n\n20% off is an instant B if you did everything else correctly. I put so much time into this stupid assignment and it was very well written, but she didn't comment on ANYthing except the lack of proper in-text citation, and took off full points for it even though I correctly formatted my references at the end of the page. Don't even get me started on how ridiculous it is to require we reference a specific amount of sources and cite them correctly on what should be a fairly casual/informal DISCUSSION BOARD POST.", "author": "Greeneyesablaze", "created": 1623255692, "retrieved": 1632949724, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"h1bu430": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvzthe/psa_professors_who_care_more_about_the_mechanics/h1bu430/", "text": "> Don't even get me started on how ridiculous it is to require we reference a specific amount of sources and cite them correctly on what should be a fairly casual/informal DISCUSSION BOARD POST.\n\nWhy are you focusing so much on the mechanics of how the assignment is submitted rather than the actual learning outcomes being assessed? \n\nA discussion board post is not some random internet forum. It's an assignment. It's coursework being evaluated. And one of the things that your professor has decided is of importance is the ability to properly use citations.
