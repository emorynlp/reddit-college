  "title:": "Are classes really still going to be online this fall?",
  "text": "I signed up for classes about a month ago and all of them had the meeting times but not the location so I was skeptical but hopeful that they would be an in person class because online college the past 1.5 years has killed my soul. I just checked again today and they now say online, all of them. I hope to god they find a way to get at least a few of them in person because I cannot do another semester of online college:(",

      "text": "My school did something pretty funny and gave the professors / departments the option on how to run their courses for the fall, all the \u201clazy\u201d profs made their classes asynchronous 100%, the ones still worried about the virus even though almost all students will be vaccinated come fall have opted for 50% asynchronous and 50% in person, and everyone else is doing classes at full capacity in person. Sucks because I only have major courses left and 2/4 classes so far are asynchronous -__-",
