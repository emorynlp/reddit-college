  "text": "Next fall I transfer to a 4 year from community college. Online and CC have spoiled my ass so much. Open notes, formula sheets, open exams where they let u work with others, etc. I\u2019m just scared I\u2019m gonna get eaten alive when I transfer. I\u2019m in engineering. Without my peers, notes, or formula sheets I probably would have gotten weeded out. I\u2019m just scared for when I have to face my reality.",

We\u2019ve had open notes for online courses (depending on your major)\u2026 plus there\u2019s tons of resources and fun spirit activities you can attend. Just lean in and utilize all the resources available to you, keep in touch with your professors, and actively participate in your classes!! Don\u2019t take on too much I started with 3 classes when I first transferred to a 4 year because I was terrified I couldn\u2019t handle it\u2026 but I did and survived and I believe you will too :)",
