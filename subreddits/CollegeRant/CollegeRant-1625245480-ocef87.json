  "text": "If you ever had to take class quizzes on this website then you know that it is the most stressful, most rage inducing quiz site I have ever been on in my entire life.\n\nFor starters we know how how quizzes and test work. For a regular test/quiz if you get 15/20 questions correct, for an example, then your score would be a 75%. Or like the SAT, there is a max score you can get, if you get a question right then you gain points, if you get a question wrong then you gain zero points. \n\nIn Inquizitive however, you can gain points in a question you got right but for the next question is you get it wrong you lose points that you gained from the previous question. It gives you a second chance to get the question right to gain half the points back. But the enraging thing is I shouldn\u2019t be loosing points like that in the first place. Get question 1 right (+100) get second question wrong (-100) and you\u2019re now back to 0.\n\nIt honestly wouldn\u2019t be that bad if the vast majority of questions weren\u2019t drag and drop that have multiple answers. There can be a drag and drop question that has 10 answers, you can get 9 correct but god forbid you get the last one wrong you will still loose all the points that you could\u2019ve gained. You can\u2019t even get 90% of the points, you just lose everything.",

The minimum required questions threshold thing is also completely pointless, I've literally had quizzes where I had to answer the exact same question like 3 times. WTF?",
