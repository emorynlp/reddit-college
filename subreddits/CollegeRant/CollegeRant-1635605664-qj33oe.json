  "text": "I don't really care if it's a class that is meant to be taken at the same time as another 2 credit class or is just sitting down once a week for an hour and having to submit a few small assignments over the term, but so many of these two credit courses are just the professor cramming a week's worth of material into one day and expecting us to learn the rest on our own time, with a workload equivalent of a normal course.\n\nI'm a full-time student and work nearly full-time on top of that. I want to take my 3 classes that I need to be considered full time. Fuck schools that make all classes 4 credits instead of 5, I wanna take my three classes and be done not add on some other bullshit because you decided one of my required courses shouldn't be 4 credits.",
