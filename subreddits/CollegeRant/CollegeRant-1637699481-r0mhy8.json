  "text": "I\u2019m taking half my classes online and the other half in person. This week I\u2019m off for the two in person classes and one online class. I was supposed to be off for all of them, but this professor decided we would have \u201cextra time\u201d this week, so she didn\u2019t just assign work, she basically doubled the load. \n\nShe sent an email Sunday night telling us all the due dates. She does this thing where you\u2019re only allowed access to quizzes and exams for one day. It makes the class \u201cmore like a real class\u201d and it \u201cstops cheating\u201d, at least according to her. Well, this week that quiz is due Thursday. So my thanksgiving is ruined. \n\nThere\u2019s also a discussion post due this week but the instructions are pretty vague. I emailed her about it immediately on Sunday night and she didn\u2019t reply. She has a part in her syllabus where if she doesn\u2019t reply to an email in 24 hours through the online class portal, we should email her to her faculty email address, so that\u2019s exactly what I did this morning. When I sent the email, her auto reply was on\u2026\n\nIt was a whole paragraph about how she\u2019s tired and how this semester has been difficult for everyone so she believes we all deserve a break. She\u2019s going to be with friends and family, and she\u2019s going to \u201cforget about work for a week.\u201d She said that she won\u2019t be reading her emails until early next week. \n\nThe last sentence is my favorite: \u201cIf you\u2019re a student, expect a response by Wednesday at the earliest.\u201d\n\nHow is this even remotely acceptable? Fuck this. Fuck her. Fuck everything. \n\nTL;DR: Professor doubled the workload during thanksgiving week, assigned a quiz that can only be done on thanksgiving, then she fucked off on vacation for the week.",

If she herself can't be available, that's fine - but she needs to make sure that someone else such as class TAs or another prof in the same subject/dept. is available to help students Mon-Weds if she herself can't be, especially since the assignment was only posted on Sunday. It's imperative for profs to make themselves (or a replacement/liaison/TAs) available to help/iron out issues which may crop up in the immediate day or two after an assignment is posted. \n\nIt's fine that your prof needed time off of work, and it's fine (technically) that she gave you work over Thanksgiving - the crux, which is your reason for going to the Dept. Chair/Head, is that she made a major assignment due with barely any notice, and then wasn't available in the immediate days after posting it to field Qs or problems with the assignment, AND to boot, gave y'all nobody to liase with or get help from, either. \n\nA thought, speaking of someone to liase with/get help from - can you reach out to the class TAs and see if they can convince her to either extend the deadline or reduce how much weight the assignment has? At the end of the day, unless the class is small, it's your TAs doing all of the grading - if all the TAs for your class are on board and they see a LOT of students across all of their sections struggling with this, they may put their heads together & go to the dept chair themselves, or try to themselves find loopholes in the prof's grading demands to make it fairer to students, I've seen this happen before (unofficially, off the books - on the books, this is highly against academic policies for very valid reasons, but that's beside the point here - your prof is being useless, so you have to reach out to your TAs now). \n\nTL, DR: Focus on the fact that your prof was unreachable and there was no liaison, TA, or other professor within the subject/department appointed to whom students could go to for help, and the short notice your prof gave. NOT on how big the assignment was. \n\nYou can mention in a half-sentence aside that the assignment itself was quite large, but focus on the fact  that the size of the assignment was the REASON the short notice was such a problem, rather than on the fact that it was so big; \"had you had proper notice, the assignment would not have been a problem, and if the deadline is extended, that will allow you to get the assignment done properly\" (verbatim).",

Having been chair of my department I know that we typically have little ability to tell faculty how to run their classes unless they're violating a written policy, which is why I don't think it will, or can, accomplish anything tangible",
