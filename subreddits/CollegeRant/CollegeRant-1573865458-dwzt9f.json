I noticed one of them which was marked wrong was actually right. I\u2019ll take what I can get, and if it\u2019s correct, it\u2019s correct. So, I send the prof an email cause I\u2019m not on campus and the prof gets kinda defensive or something, saying \u201cI\u2019m fair, if I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll admit it\u201d then goes on to say \u201cI don\u2019t like hidden agendas \u201c?? I don\u2019t even know how to take that. Up til this point, we were on great terms; it\u2019s my favorite class and I think the professor is great. I have no idea why they got so damn mad at me.
