I have retained a GPA of 4.0 for 5 consecutive semesters and have gotten little to no scholarship opportunities (and not for lack of searching). I usually have to find scholarships from outside sources such as UniGo, and they are usually very niche and require a sob story of an essay. I very rarely see my university offer scholarships for academics, especially to undergraduates.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a hard upbringing besides being raised by a single mother, but I feel like universities don\u2019t need to know about that part of my history. I feel as though college has become like Americas Got Talent: whoever has the best sob story gets the most money!\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to not be recognized for my hard work. I\u2019ve been on my schools Presidents List for 5 semesters and guess what I have to show for it. A. Fucking. Sticker. \nNo scholarships, no opportunities, nothing. Just a sticker and a pat on the back.\nI\u2019m also in the Honor College at my university, which I busted my ass to get in to, and got nothing in return but more work. \n\nI\u2019ve applied for scholarships specifically through my University and department (Liberal Arts and Social Sciences) and my degree, but have gotten nothing. I absolutely despise that I have to write a fucking dissertation on why the donors should give me money. I feel like my academics should speak for themselves to some extent. I have spent hours on several different scholarships sites (that I don\u2019t have to pay for, which it in itself is another infuriating point) hunting for scholarships I qualify for and usually come up with 2 at most. I\u2019m not first generation, I\u2019m not military, I\u2019m not below the poverty line. It\u2019s honestly making me less motivated to try and get a 4.0 and good grades in general because there\u2019s no incentive. There needs to be more scholarships available that are based on academics and not your history. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve been a 4.0 student for several semesters and have seen little to no scholarship opportunities that I qualify for and it\u2019s making me feel unmotivated to have good grades.", "author": "angrylittlekittycat", "created": 1626904664, "retrieved": 1632841737, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"h620m92": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/op01o0/lack_of_scholarships_for_40_honor_college_student/h620m92/", "text": "Thank you u/angrylittlekittycat for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Those unfortunate souls would trade places with you in a heart beat.  \n\nAs for no scholarships, well....welcome to adulting.   It's a hyper-competitive environment.  I started college at 15 back in 1989.  It was HARD to win the scholarships.  My age helped separate me, but once I received the scholarship, I had to work hard to prove my worth.  It went beyond a 4.0.  It was being involved on campus, involved in university government, etc.  My senior year I did not apply for any scholarship because I didn't want to do the extra-curricular work. It's that hard.  I also wanted to focus on my career.  \n\nThere are no handouts.  You have to earn it.  Since not all GPA's are created equal, it comes down to extra-curricular activities.\n\nI assist some of my clients with hiring new college grads (in the finance sector).  That last round we did, we did not consider anyone with a GPA under 3.7.  You also had to have at least two extra-curricular activities in addition to the 3.7+ GPA.
