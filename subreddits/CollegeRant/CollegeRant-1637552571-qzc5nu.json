  "text": "hi, i\u2019m a (18F) having a dilemma with deciding which career path to choose. i\u2019m currently in pre-med majoring in neuroscience, minoring in studio arts. english wasn\u2019t my first language so adjusting to an american university was really difficult, i studied arts most of my education life, in both middle and high school so i didn\u2019t really have much of a STEM background. i went to a few research programs and has done research with a professor before, and really enjoyed it, although i\u2019m still struggling now it\u2019s something i have passion for. \n\nbut, i also have adhd/autism which makes things harder for me and sometimes i check my friends social media of them doing well in art school so, sometimes i wonder if i should just pursue in something that i\u2019m good at.\n\ni don\u2019t have the best gpa in the field i am in right now but i have passion for what i\u2019m doing, i\u2019ve retaken classes before (chem) from a D+ to a A-, maybe i just need another try in some of my classes but i\u2019m not really sure anymore.\n\nmy dilemma is that well should i be majoring in something i\u2019m good at w/ no passion, or something i\u2019m not the best at with passion? \n\ni\u2019m currently in my second year of university so, i feel like i should figure it out sooner than later. \n\npls help lol.",

Stem will be a huge advantage in life if you want to do a different career. Chemistry is ridiculously hard so I'm proud of you for that A-!! You can do it. Stick with stem.",

      "text": "Quick question: have you talked to a career guidance counselor about this? I know they\u2019re usually dogshit, but it\u2019s at least worth a try, especially since you have other factors I can\u2019t comment on, like adhd and autism\n\nIn regards to my own opinion, I think you should stick with stem. As another user said, art is oversaturated, and you\u2019re likely not going to make it that far unless you\u2019re good at mapping out social media algorithms and getting connections, and I\u2019ve been in art communities before. There were so many talented people with extreme potential, and a lot of them have to work full time jobs unrelated to the art field just to keep making art. \n\nPlus, studio art doesn\u2019t need a degree, *especially* after graduation. Usually you rely on a portfolio of your art as a way to show you have experience and skills. A degree is extra credit really, unless you aim to get into something big off the bat\n\nStem you will need a degree to get into the field. Especially something like neuroscience. I can\u2019t say as much about it because I lack experience, but I will say, if you don\u2019t have a degree you\u2019re probably not going to get into the field. Most people who debate against stem or an art major pick stem just because they can actually do something with a stem degree, unlike art where you just need a portfolio. It also gives more options, especially for someone taking on research programs this early on (like dang, even if you retake classes, you\u2019re probably going to get internships by the end of the year unless you don\u2019t do well in the programs). \n\nTake what you will with this comment. I\u2019m starting to fall asleep so I might not reply to anything for a while",
