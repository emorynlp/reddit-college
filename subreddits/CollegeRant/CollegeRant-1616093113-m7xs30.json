  "text": "My college is closing down. We received the news in an email yesterday and  only now have I just started to process it. I don't even if I should  transfer; my major, from what I know, is offered only at this college. I don't even know if my degree has validity if I graduate from here. I  guess right now I only feel upset.",

      "text": "Many universities offer what is called an \"independent major\" or \"interdisciplinary major\", they allow you to declare your own major (and name it) by crafting an academic plan and choosing the specific courses that will compose your major. Typically it requires being approved by an academic advisor but other than that you're set to go. This should expand your options. Consider emailing admissions to inquire more about some universities that offer these options (from my college apps two years ago I recall that Swarthmore and Boston University offered such an option, but it wasn't hard to find in other colleges too). You are entirely valid in feeling upset and you should take the time to process it but don't give up on your academic journey, find a place where you can do what you love and keep going!",

I would suggest reaching out to an advisor and seeing what there advice would be for next steps. Research some schools you're interested in and contact their admissions counselor to see what your options are. If you need any emotional guidance please consider r/therapy on how to move forward with processing such a unexpected life change. I hope that you can land on your feet. \ud83d\udc95",
