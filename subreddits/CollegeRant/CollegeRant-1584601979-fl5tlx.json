It\u2019s just a number, it can\u2019t show improvement, context, strong subjects, etc. I understand it\u2019s easy to calculate and analyze for a large amount of people, but students keep suffering for it. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been in a situation where you\u2019ve had a steady good GPA, and then one devil of a class comes in and that one grade just tanks it. How is that fair? ESPECIALLY in college, how is that fair? Classes are so much more unpredictable in higher education, at least in my experience. You almost never know what it\u2019s going to be like until you\u2019re in the thick of it. No way to gauge how the instructor will be, or how it will be taught, or how heavy the workload will be. And if it\u2019s too much and it doesn\u2019t work out, your tuition is already paid, and you lose money even if you withdraw to save some GPA points. \n\nI like to consider myself a pretty good student, but college has really shaken me up. Lots of mental health struggles, many flights I\u2019ve had to take, a few in the family, and now COVID-19 completely messing with students\u2019 lives. \n\nThere\u2019s a couple classes that I know I will fail by the time grades close this term, and the instructors seem empathetic, but the school probably won\u2019t accept my petition for late withdrawal. I talked to my advisor, who said it was a completely understandable reason to not have done well in the class, but I know the institution won\u2019t let me do anything about it and instead I\u2019ll have to waste tuition money and ruin my GPA. \n\nGuess I have some hard work to do in quarantine next term.", "author": "anon-honeybee", "created": 1584601979, "retrieved": 1632951589, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fkxy8bf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fl5tlx/fk_the_current_gpa_system/fkxy8bf/", "text": "GPA is also very misleading.
