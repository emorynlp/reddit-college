  "text": "Seriously my school hasn\u2019t had a break or holiday in like 2 months and I just failed my first test last week despite grinding out A\u2019s all semester which sadly fucks over my gpa and my scholarship :/ plus a really fucking stupid group project where I\u2019ve literally done all the work and coordination in which my classmates haven\u2019t even showed up to. Dude, this semester needs to fucking end already.",

Too much self-teaching and not enough justification on why I spend so much money to pass a stupid job filter. \n\nA lot of kids are fortunate and have money from their parents but sadly, I don\u2019t. I had to work my entire junior and senior year to pay off college and when Google is teaching me everything, I feel like I\u2019m better off just dropping out. It\u2019s just the social pressure and lack of security that bothers me. Idk if anyone feels the same.",
