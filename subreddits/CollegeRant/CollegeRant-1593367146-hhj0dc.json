  "text": "I understand he's the basic of all psychology, but why can't we just learn everything about him ONCE during the Introduction and than NOT put him in tests every single psychology-related course you take after? No, just  because I have to learn about him over and over and over again doesn't mean I'm gonna memorize all the shit he came up with.\n\nErikson was more throughout in extending Freud's' theories. Erikson is *interesting*. Can't we just be like \"Yeah Freud invented this and that, but Erikson can teach you both his Theory and include more updated steps\"? Can't we  just skip to learning Erikson's theory from the very beginning and shove Freud aside?\n\nIt's the sex thing, isn't it. Freud was all about sex so the academic world holds him in a such a high regard because our professors are a bunch of dirty old f\\*\\*\\*\\* (it's a joke, obviously. I'm just bitter because I've had to learn about that jackass for three years straight in three different classes. You know how you read the same material over and over again but instead of memorizing it it just get so boring you can't read in anymore and just keep skimming through?)",

And more into Victor Frankl\u2019s too\n\nHowever, my dislike for Freud and desire for him to be less well-known is partially because he makes my major look bad, and that\u2019s not fair to him because he clearly did contribute to the field and it\u2019d be mean to \u201cdeny\u201d him. If I were Freud I\u2019d be really hurt, I guess.\n\nI\u2019m also tired of how much he\u2019s mentioned, though.",

Hearing about him in AP Psychology, again in Human Development, and then I\u2019ll hear about him again when I need to take two more Psychology courses sounds like a headache. His theories are so fucking gross too lmao even with a better understanding of them, I\u2019d rather hear Piaget\u2019s or Erikson\u2019s OR ANYONE ELSES theories of development and anything else.",

      "text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, I\u2019ve loved psychology for the last couple of years but since college, I\u2019ve found it to be quite dry (sociology major). Besides that, I don\u2019t love Freud but I don\u2019t exactly like him either. I think most psych classes talk about him bc he\u2019s a \u2018founding father\u2019 of psychology and brought up things no one else did. I agree with his beliefs on a surface level, but nowadays it\u2019s very eccentric. \n   I think Freud is a good building block for many psychologists, like Jung for example. They take what he started with and simply improve/revamp it in their own way. Personally I really like Jung, but I can see why you don\u2019t like Freud. Things like the Oedipus complex make me uncomfortable, but I like that I can apply that to other subjects (like English). Idk, basically it\u2019s fucked up but take the parts of it I like and move along. I believe that you don\u2019t have to completely side with one psychologist/sociologist/whoever, but taking bits and pieces from people gives you a more rounded perspective.",
