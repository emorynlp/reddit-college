No, just  because I have to learn about him over and over and over again doesn't mean I'm gonna memorize all the shit he came up with.\n\nErikson was more throughout in extending Freud's' theories. Erikson is *interesting*. Can't we just be like \"Yeah Freud invented this and that, but Erikson can teach you both his Theory and include more updated steps\"? Can't we  just skip to learning Erikson's theory from the very beginning and shove Freud aside?\n\nIt's the sex thing, isn't it. Freud was all about sex so the academic world holds him in a such a high regard because our professors are a bunch of dirty old f\\*\\*\\*\\* (it's a joke, obviously. I'm just bitter because I've had to learn about that jackass for three years straight in three different classes.

I think most psych classes talk about him bc he\u2019s a \u2018founding father\u2019 of psychology and brought up things no one else did. I agree with his beliefs on a surface level, but nowadays it\u2019s very eccentric. \n   I think Freud is a good building block for many psychologists, like Jung for example. They take what he started with and simply improve/revamp it in their own way. Personally I really like Jung, but I can see why you don\u2019t like Freud. Things like the Oedipus complex make me uncomfortable, but I like that I can apply that to other subjects (like English). Idk, basically it\u2019s fucked up but take the parts of it I like and move along.
