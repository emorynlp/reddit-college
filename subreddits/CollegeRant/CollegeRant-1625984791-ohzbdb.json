I thought the whole point of asynchronous was so that everyone could do it on their own time (I understand there are due dates and that stuff.) What irritates me is the professor requires us to take our quizzes and exams over zoom at certain times, and only gives us one time slot for each. The worst part is she sends an email a few days before the test/exam letting you know what time she decided. Last Thursday I had a quiz at 10 am and this Monday I have a test at 7 pm.
