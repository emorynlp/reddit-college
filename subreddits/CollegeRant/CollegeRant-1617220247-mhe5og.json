      "text": "I didn't get a spring break this year because I'm dual enrolled at two colleges that had different spring break times. Oh well, it's my fault, not covid or the school. \n\nLast year during spring break my teacher posted the last 8 weeks of classes, and I literally spent 1 day doing a week's worth of assignments and quizzes... Boy was that exhausting! but I did finish all 8 weeks during that break.\n\nman did I not know that the following week would end on a Wednesday due to covid hitting and closing the colleges down. \n\nDoing that work ahead of time did allow me to focus on my Chem 2 and A&P classes since the science class basically sucked going online at first. :(",
