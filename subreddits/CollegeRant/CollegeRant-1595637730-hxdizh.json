I don't even feel like I'm going to school anymore, i'm so disconnected from my learning and all of this online stuff has had my GPA tanking. \n\nthe switch to online classes has me terrified, I'm not one of those students who have great personal-skills that allows online schooling to be a breeze. Being in the classroom environment was so helpful for learning topics like Math and Chemistry, being in such an isolated environment in front of a computer is just not the same. Programs like MyMathLab have completely drained me of any excitement I had for online classes, I just can't fucking do this online stuff\n\nWhy should i jeopardize my grades by going online for the next year, when I can take a break and re-enlist when the schooling is back to normal? But then I get called a pussy for just not dealing with it, I just hate this so damn much", "author": "throwaway2394828154", "created": 1595637730, "retrieved": 1632950957, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fzf9l6k": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hxdizh/i_cant_do_college_this_way/fzf9l6k/", "text": "MyMathLab is the scourge of the earth.   \n\n\nMyMathLab: \"Oh what's that student?
