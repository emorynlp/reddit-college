  "text": "Move in day was this weekend so that means that thousands of people out of state came to help move their child in. It just makes me nervous that thousands of people are coming to the university without covid tests and aren\u2019t wearing masks outside. I know that you probably think I\u2019m paranoid but coming into contact with possibly hundreds of people only to live in a dorm with 2 other people doesn\u2019t sound like a promising start to the school year.",
