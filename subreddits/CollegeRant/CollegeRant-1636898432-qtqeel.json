  "text": "\nI did make this post on the college subreddit but it got removed because I\u2019m talking about a damn laptop \ud83d\ude12but anywho  Christmas is coming up my family is asking what do I want and I don\u2019t know. I asked some college students on how they take notes and they said getting a iPad is the best idea which I don\u2019t understand how it is because notes is just as fine  \nHowever, I have a laptop could I take notes on that? I don\u2019t know what apps to use to be able to write notes but I could type it instead. But I need to write my notes for math in college. \n\nI love writing my notes in a notebook but my friends and the college students  told me it\u2019s a bad idea because I\u2019ll loose my stuff? I never loose my work but they said I\u2019ll be spending so much money on notebooks which I understand that part  so they said it\u2019s better to have everything in one compacted device\u2026.i never had a iPad before nor feel comfortable writing notes on it but It feels like I have no choice. But why do people feel so pulled to talk about taking notes on a iPad then a laptop? I mean carrying my iPad, iPhone, AirPods, and laptop seems like so much electronics that I  have to charge. \n\n Is the iPad to take notes and the laptop is to do assignments? \nI don\u2019t want to spend money on a iPad because I spent around 600 for a very good laptop and just to have college students tell me to get iPad because taking notes on there is better?? \nIs writing my notes in google docs a good idea for the laptop?",

      "text": "Lolololol so much money on notebooks - they cost $.25 every summer when school supplies come out.  Your friends are fucking morons.  Sorry but the reasons they are giving you are straight up stupid.  I\u2019d check their GPA before listening to their advice.  Whatever method helps you learn, understand, and demonstrate is the right way.  Using technology doesn\u2019t automatically make something better.  And using an iPad is pointless if you don\u2019t have a keyboard - so that\u2019s the same as a laptop.",

What kind of notebooks they buying??? \ud83d\udc80but I have a convertible laptop that acts as a laptop and iPad so I guess gettin a iPad is out of the question.",

I personally use a laptop and an iPad for grad school notes. I used to use notebooks but they just stack up over the years. I like how an iPad cuts down on the waste and all notes are digital.",

      "text": "I went through the same thing last year. I bought an iPad for all the same reasons- all my notes would be in one spot, and I wouldn't have to carry around multiple notebook. It wasn't for me though, it felt unnatural and technology can always be a little fickle. Returned the iPad and went back to paper notes. \nI will say though that you should definitely not try to take math notes on a laptop. You have to install good add-ons to word and doc, and the really good math equation add+ons  cost money. Plus even with an add-on using you laptop for math is a lot slower than writing on paper.",

And I know there will be one day where a part of my notes will just disappear if if I use technology, I don\u2019t really trust it. I\u2019m fine with carrying maybe 5-8 notebooks because the aren\u2019t really heavy anyways yk? Thank you so much for the reply I think I have made my mind up now!",

I personally enjoy having hard written copies of my notes because I just don't retain the info the same way when I scroll through them on word. If you are worried about losing your notes, scanning them with your phone is a good way to keep a second copy of them.",
