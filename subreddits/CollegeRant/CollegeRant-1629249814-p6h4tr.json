Even the computers that were directly plugged in through Ethernet were downloading at less than a megabyte per second.\n\nHalf the class ended up leaving early because there was no way we were going to get any work done.",

      "text": "I\u2019m already prepared for absolute trash connection in a dorm. Brand new building too and have zero expectations. I just hope I can run games on my PS5 with under 100 ping while wired. Every campus I\u2019ve been to has just terrible WiFi connection to the point even a google search takes a good while to load. Watching a movie may as well have had commercial with the amount of buffering it had. I totally get it being stressed with hundreds of people using it, but you\u2019d think with how much money they make it would be the absolute top of the line stuff throughout the schools.",
