That\u2019s typical, but it reminds me why I\u2019m starting to hate college.\n\nI did the math, if I have to study for three hours for every hour of class like my professor said once, then that means I have to study 5.5 hrs on weekdays and 7.5 hours on weekends. That\u2019s an okay schedule I think\u2026\n\nOr thought\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s just a lot. There\u2019s a lot to do. My stress levels are increasing just at the thought of it.  Now I remember how I became so depressed. School sucks the life out of you when it\u2019s excessive like this.\n\nI hate it so much. I don\u2019t want to look at a screen, or a book, or a math problem for extended amounts of time. I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m so sick of it.\n\nIt sucks. I used to kind of like school but this has just been such a shit time. I\u2019m two semesters away from graduation so I know I don\u2019t have to endure for much longer, but I can\u2019t deny that my soul kind of hurts. Ugh. I hate college so fucking much right now.", "author": "Scarcity-Any", "created": 1629944901, "retrieved": 1632841557, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hadj70n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbqar5/ugh/hadj70n/", "text": "Thank you u/Scarcity-Any for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
