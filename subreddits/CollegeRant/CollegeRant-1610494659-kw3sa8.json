Absolutely nothing. I'm pulling all nighters(NOT because I procrastinated or anything) just to be able to attend classes. What is a sleep schedule?? Circadian rhythm W H O??? social life? Dead. Hah try having friends when ur up only when they are asleep. At this point I'm not even getting access to food - only being able to have 1 proper meal with my family and having to cook for myself (I don't know how to) every other time. I'm fucking living on grilled cheese sandwiches. It's really fucking hard. I had an anxiety attack today because of my dumb fucking landlord and the first day of classes reminding me how fucking hard last term was. I cannot do this. It's killing me that we're paying significantly more than local students for this shit. Fuck my landlord, fuck university. Sorry for being born in the wrong part of the world I guess, can't even fucking do anything about it???\n\nOH and for FUCKS SAKE THE FUCKING VISAS. I don't think anyone gets how fucking soul crushing it is to get all excited about FINALLY getting to campus and then cancelling the whole fucking trip because a bank document needed for the visa is taking too long. And the fucking document shows up within the next half an hour. The plans getting cancelled and then back on and then cancelled. Flights are stinking expensive and getting cancelled left right and centre. Even if you have everything worked out, your flight can STILL FUCKING GET CANCELLED. there's no way out of this shitty fucking country even though you're paying so much for the fucking experience of being outside here.\n\nTry being a first year international student during covid.
