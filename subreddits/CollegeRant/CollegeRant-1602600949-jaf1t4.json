I get it if it's something in the syllabus or something written down somewhere I have easy access to. But half the questions I ask are simple conceptual misunderstandings like what the textbook states versus what the professor states in a lecture. Or I'm just asking for clarification because I wasn't gifted with eidetic memory and can just remember every waking second of my existence. I forget things. You think I like not remembering? You think I like to just ask questions all the time?\n\nGoing full passive-aggressive or throwing out backhanded comments before answering my questions don't help. They just make me not want to ask you for questions in the future, which you constantly probe the Zoom meetings for more class participation but only to grumble when someone actually asks you a question?\n\nProfessors need to just... have a little more compassion. I have only one professor that has been so kind and never angry when she has to repeat herself. But all the others, to all of you who are just... so freaking better than all of us. I can't wait to graduate and never see your faces again! End rant.\n\nTL:DR Professors need to try to be more patient with students who ask them to repeat themselves.", "author": null, "created": 1602600949, "retrieved": 1632950218, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 300, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g8styl3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jaf1t4/professors_need_to_get_over_the_fact_that_they/g8styl3/", "text": "Yep.

The issue is are his assignments were super conceptual. I got shit grades on the first 3 assignments because I thought I understood and it turned out I was confused too. Then on Sunday (the due date) he emailed the entire class of 90 and listed the people who hadn't turned in anything yet. How unprofessional holy shit. I ended up calling him to try to get some clarification. He cleared it up in like one minute. . However he spent the next 10min complaining about how students aren't trying to understand and aren't reading instructions.  Since when did I become your freakin therapist?  Professors don't get that sometimes the way they present things may be unclear or confusing.
