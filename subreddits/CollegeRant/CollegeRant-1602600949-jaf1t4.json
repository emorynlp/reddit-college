  "text": "Look. I get it if it's something in the syllabus or something written down somewhere I have easy access to. But half the questions I ask are simple conceptual misunderstandings like what the textbook states versus what the professor states in a lecture. Or I'm just asking for clarification because I wasn't gifted with eidetic memory and can just remember every waking second of my existence. I forget things. You think I like not remembering? You think I like to just ask questions all the time?\n\nGoing full passive-aggressive or throwing out backhanded comments before answering my questions don't help. They just make me not want to ask you for questions in the future, which you constantly probe the Zoom meetings for more class participation but only to grumble when someone actually asks you a question?\n\nProfessors need to just... have a little more compassion. I have only one professor that has been so kind and never angry when she has to repeat herself. But all the others, to all of you who are just... so freaking better than all of us. I can't wait to graduate and never see your faces again! End rant.\n\nTL:DR Professors need to try to be more patient with students who ask them to repeat themselves.",

Have had a few professors that need to realise that we are ignorant of the material (that's what we are paying $250 a credit hour for).\n\nHad a question about a problem we were doing in a physics class and wanted to know one of the constants for the equation, and this man had the audacity to say \"You have a phone, Google it\". We just learned this equation, and this variable changes based on what material it is. I never asked a question in his class again.",

If it includes writing, I will have details on the assignment. For every test there will be a review that will be similar to the test. It will be on paper. Yes you can make it up. The day you get your test back, if you can figure out what you got wrong and fix it.. you can get your points back. If you want to ask me a question during a test and try to explain your way through it with me throwing subtle hints, I will do so. See.  The real world, especially in Physics, you are working alongside others, bouncing questions and answers off one another, and thoroughly examining data over and over to make sure its correct. I literally don't understand why professors don't use this same approach. As for the questions.. I love them. Let's get them answered. After class.. during class.. etc. Sorry your Physics professor is a dick.",

The issue is are his assignments were super conceptual. I got shit grades on the first 3 assignments because I thought I understood and it turned out I was confused too. Then on Sunday (the due date) he emailed the entire class of 90 and listed the people who hadn't turned in anything yet. How unprofessional holy shit. I ended up calling him to try to get some clarification. He cleared it up in like one minute. . However he spent the next 10min complaining about how students aren't trying to understand and aren't reading instructions.  Since when did I become your freakin therapist?  Professors don't get that sometimes the way they present things may be unclear or confusing. Teaching involves having to explain things in different ways since not every student interprets things the same.",

I \ud83d\udc65 got \ud83c\ude50 shit \ud83d\udca9 grades \ud83d\udcdd on \ud83d\udd1b the first \ud83d\udc46 3 \ud83d\uddb1 assignments \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc67 because I \ud83d\udc41 thought \ud83d\udcad I \ud83d\udc41 understood \ud83d\udcad and it turned \ud83d\ude0d out I \ud83d\udc41 was confused \ud83e\udd14 too. Then on \ud83d\udca6 Sunday \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u26a1\ud83d\ude09 (the due \ud83d\ude48 date \ud83d\udcc6) he \ud83d\udc68 emailed \ud83d\udce7\ud83d\udcec\ud83d\udc8c the entire \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 class \ud83e\udd35\ud83d\udcb0 of 90 \ud83d\udcaf and listed \u270d the people \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc67 who hadn't turned \ud83d\ude0d in anything \ud83d\ude2f yet \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc40. How unprofessional \ud83d\udeab\u274c holy \ud83d\ude4f shit \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc40. I \ud83d\udc41 ended \ud83d\udd1a up \u2b06 calling \ud83d\udcf2 him \ud83d\udc68 to try \ud83d\ude10 to get \ud83c\ude50 some clarification \ud83d\udc41. He \ud83d\udc68 cleared it up \u2b06\u2934\u23eb in like \ud83d\udc96 one \u261d minute \u23f1. . However \ud83d\udd90 he \ud83d\udc68 spent \ud83d\ude35 the next \u27a1 10min complaining \ud83d\udde3 about \ud83d\udca6 how students \ud83d\udd2c aren't trying \ud83d\ude08 to understand \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude2a and aren't reading \ud83d\udcd8 instructions \u26a0. Since \ud83d\udc68 when \ud83c\udf51 did I \ud83d\udc65 become \ud83d\ude0c your \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude80 freakin \ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udc38 therapist \ud83d\udc69? Professors \ud83d\udc4c don't \u274c\ud83d\ude45\ud83d\udc4e get \ud83c\ude50\ud83c\udd70 that sometimes \ud83d\udd52\ud83d\udcc6\u231b the way \u2195 they present \ud83c\udf81 things \ud83d\udd51 may \ud83d\uddd3 be unclear \ud83e\udd14 or confusing \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Teaching \ud83c\udfeb involves \u264e\ud83c\udf90 having to explain \ud83d\udce2 things \ud83d\udcf4 in different \ud83d\ude21 ways \u2195 since \ud83d\udc68 not every \u261d student \ud83d\udcd6\ud83e\udde0 interprets \ud83d\udd25 things \ud83d\udcf4 the same.",
