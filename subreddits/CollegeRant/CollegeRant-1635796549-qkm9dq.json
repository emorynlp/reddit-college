  "title:": "Why are some STEM students some of the most insecure people you'll ever meet??",
  "text": "I'm in school right now in a double-degree program for Sociology and Math (my math major is in stats). I just started dating my bf a couple of months ago and finally got the chance to meet a few of his closest friends. I think it's important to mention the uni I go to is one of Canada's top 3 universities for both math and engineering. It's a really good school for both these programs and I'm proud to be a math student here. Whenever I introduce myself to people and get asked what program I'm in, I usually either say sociology or math and only really go into further detail if the person asks.\n\nOne of the friends of my bf's I met is in engineering at our school (let's call her F). Never met her before so I was excited to see her and get to know her. Within 1 minute of being introduced to each other, she mentioned she was in the engineering program. I said that's really cool, but she didn't stop there. She asked me what I was in school for so I said sociology and before I could even finish telling her my full program, she scoffed. I decided to not finish the sentence and see what she thought of me if I left it at that. We were all drinking together, so what happens next may just be because she was drunk or something. She continued to bring up her program every 5 minutes (my bf and his other friends are all in bio or chem programs, so this particular friend is the only eng kid here) and talk about how hard it is and how the assignments just pile up and up, and of course, no one else understands her burden. She also made not-so-subtle digs at me for being a sociology student. She said how it must be easy to be an arts student because all we do is write essays and have nothing to really worry about. BUT, of course, it's worth it to be an eng student because she'll be raking in dollars once she graduates. It wasn't until another one of my bf's friends asked me what I was doing (he wasn't there when I initially told everyone) and I said I'm in a double-degree for Sociology and Math. I looked over at F and her face dropped lol. This new friend is also in math so he and I carried the group conversation for a bit and talked about the math program at the school. I didn't speak to F much for the rest of the night, but it was interesting to see her attitude change once she knew my full truth. I didn't mention it earlier, but she was practically ranting about how much better she is than arts students because she's an eng student.\n\nMy takeaway from this is the question: why tf are some STEM students so insecure? I didn't say anything to her to provoke her, but the drunker she got the more vocal she became about this superiority complex she has. It was funny and my bf apologized profusely after the fact because he knows F made a horrible impression. I loved his other friends, we got along PERFECTLY. I told him straight up I did not like F because she never made an attempt to get to know me and literally scoffed at me for being an arts student without letting me finish the sentence.\n\nJust wanted to rant for a second about what happened. It rubbed me the wrong way. We all go to the same school and it happens to be an amazing school with a stellar reputation. However, I sometimes hate the students I'm surrounded by. The ego and superiority complex is insane and makes no sense.",

I've never taken any of their classes or talked to anyone about any of those classes, so why am I assuming that the professors in those classes are just handing out As?\n\nThere's also the perceived worthlessness of the degrees, even though \"Arts\" encompasses fields that aren't that hard to make careers out of, like graphic design, especially in the current climate where making money on the internet is easier than it's ever been.",

I feel lucky sometimes because I'm getting an opportunity to learn technical skills in math and develop my problem-solving, while also knowing how to write an essay and conduct research.

      "text": "I think in part it's because of how much failure you experience in many stem courses - in short, they're looking for some sort of validation, even unconsciously is my guess. I started college in engineering before switching to business then a joint degree in business/geology so in a way I've been on both sides of it, and honestly I second guessed every single thing I did my first two years of school. \n\nNow this definitely might not be the case for everyone, but I think the sheer shit you have to trudge through to get through a degree like engineering (or mathematics!) can cause a lot of self-doubt or insecurity, particularly during the first couple of years. It's way more common to fail hw/quizzes/exams or even the course in classes like thermodynamics, calculus II, organic chemistry, etc., especially when taken all at once. Without the validation of \"you're doing well\" via A's and B's, even if you're technically above the class average with a 68%, the constant low/near-failing/failing grades can get to you over time. It beats down on your self-confidence in school and eventually trickles in to the rest of your life. I think this can be even more of an issue when there is a lot of pressure to follow a certain path - whether that be for the $$ at the end of it or a family expectation or whatever. \n\nBy bringing up their major/grades/career path/salary expectations constantly, I think they're trying to get that validation of \"you're doing well\" or \"you're so smart\" or \"you have such a great future ahead of you\" bc they aren't getting it from school like they used to in high school. Somehow a person being impressed by how perceivably difficult their major is makes all of the failure/pain/stress worth it to them in a similar way to how an \"A\" on an exam would. \n\nIt wasn't until I changed majors and started doing well in classes again that I realized that I was actually smart and I could actually be good at college, and eventually I built up better study skills and coping mechanisms and am now studying a combination of what I am good at and what I love. There is a huge difference in who I am now versus my first semester - don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't say I am super confident in, well, anything, but I am definitely more sure of who I am and what really matters to me. From experience I know that a failed exam doesn't mean a failed final grade, but 18-year-old me thought failing my first physics exam meant I was destined to fail. \n\nSorry if this is rambly, I just wanted to share some perspective (and maybe hope for their future?) on your situation! Next time feel free to make a dig at the fact that not only are you doing the \\*hard\\* part of engineering, but you're doing another badass degree on top of that ;)",

          "text": "no worries about rambling haha, I liked reading your take on it. I agree, I feel like their\"insecurity\" is mainly just looking for validation outside of the classroom because the classroom they're in can be unforgiving lol. It's funny tho because my math classes kick my ass most of the time. I'm currently in the 5th year of my program and only have 2 more semesters to finish after this one. My cumulative average in math for the last 5 years is 76%, my sociology average is 89%. Math is definitely harder, but it makes me appreciative of sociology because I feel like I truly excel there. I don't hate the math, but I'm mainly doing the math aspect of my program because I wanna work in population geography and urban development and the math background is insanely beneficial for that. \n\nTo kinda sum up what I'm trying to say is that I feel like STEM can kick your ass in the classroom, especially eng. BUT, I feel like my arts degree has helped me gain back confidence in school and reevaluate how I approach my math classes. I guess kids who do only STEM may not have the chance to do that and just feel like they need to get by and graduate. \n\nI talked to my bf more about his friend after posting this and shared the points you made with him. He agreed almost instantly and said that is probably why she's such an ass to people, especially new people she meets. I was a complete stranger to her and the new bf of one of her closest friends, and the impression she left was terrible. I'm lying if I say this isn't how most eng kids are lol. My bf basically told me her average in most of her classes is under 70% right now, and the class averages are around the same mark. So, it makes sense and I do understand it a bit more I guess. However, I don't think that's any excuse. We're all adults. I'm 22 and my bf is 21, his friends are also all 21. F is old enough to know she's being an ass in her actions but still chooses to be bitchy to new people she meets because she HAS to be better than them. I can understand where she's coming from and still choose to not like her. She has some serious growing up to do and I feel like that's a theme for many other students in her program.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a BS in psychology (but many people don\u2019t consider psychology part of STEM) and one of my closest friends was originally a biology major who switched to neuroscience. I remember her asking my opinion on it a lot and she also talks to me a lot about her insecurities and family struggles and I definitely encouraged her to go for it if that\u2019s what she wants and carve the life she wants for herself and see what happens. She knows I want to become a therapist in the future. Basically what happened a couple of years after she switched is she started making digs toward psychology and even told me she was triggered by some of the research assistant stuff she\u2019s doing being compared to psychology.\n\nI wondered if I was overreacting by being upset about it and wanting to associate with her less, but most of our conversations are spent talking about her and I\u2019m constantly reading up on things and trying to understand the interaction brain and society better.\n\nI try to apply what I read to better help me not only as a professional in the future but also as a friend, daughter, and sister, so for her to make digs but want to use me for emotional support was really upsetting me and I started questioning if I want to be friends with her still.\n\nLike I guess not feeling like an equal in relationships is a dealbreaker for me because who is anyone to make anyone else feel inferior? I feel bad because we can\u2019t always control how we feel about others and we can\u2019t necessarily control the views we heard growing up and undo how these views have shaped us, and we aren\u2019t always aware these views are manifesting in the way we treat others",

      "text": "I agree so much with this and I have put up with STEM majors during my time in college. I don\u2019t know why a lot of them are like this. But yeah, it\u2019s like they have labs to go to and concepts are harder and there\u2019s more studying to do for the harder concepts\u2026but like they signed up for it. And I\u2019ve even got \u201coh you don\u2019t deserve to complain about your homework or your major bc it\u2019s not STEM\u201d and I\u2019m just like, how about we just accept the fact that we are all unique individuals, with different passions and purposes and interests in life. We\u2019re not all meant to be put on this earth to do the exact same thing bc if the whole world majored in like chemistry, society would crash and burn and the world couldn\u2019t function without liberal arts majors and other non-stem majors. I\u2019m not cut out to STEM stuff. I actually started out as a stem major and did if for two years but I couldn\u2019t understand anything, I was falling behind, my grades were suffering. So STEM isn\u2019t supposed to be for everyone and that\u2019s okay. And it needs to be okay for them but when they make those complaints, it doesn\u2019t make them come off as insecure.",

It often starts with strained family relationships, then extends to social outcasting (i.e. bullying), and things like social media and cultural norms establish unrealistic standards that people can't live up to.
