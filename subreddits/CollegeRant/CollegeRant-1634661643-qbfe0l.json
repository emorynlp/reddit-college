  "text": "Sorry if this is all over the place. I really need some advice or help, so bare with me.\n\nIn high school, I was one of the top 15 students in my graduation class of 500+. I was always on top of my studies and never had the urge to go out, have a boyfriend, or consume any drugs/alcohol. I had friends who were similar in that aspect, so I didn\u2019t feel the need to do those things. \n\nCut to me now, a junior in college. I still know the importance of my studies, but the motivation is completely gone. I have a physics exam tonight, and I have been holding off on studying for it for almost 2 weeks. I planned out yesterday to be the day to finally catch up, but what did I do? I decided to take a 30 minute nap that ended up being a full 10 hours of sleep. It\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t wake up from my alarm, I just didn\u2019t want to even though I knew I had to. Every day when I wake up in the morning, I always tell myself that it\u2019ll be a different day and that I\u2019ll have my shot together, but I just end up repeating the same pattern. Also, my room is currently such a mess that there\u2019s barely any space to step around without stepping on clothes or trash or any other random object.\n\nIdk what exactly made me end up like this, but I think it\u2019s the combination of going out every weekend (due to FOMO) and not having the motivation to get up and be productive the next morning. Also, I have never been in a relationship, and I feel like I am at that age where I need some kind of romantic interest. Every guy I deal with seems like they want to get to know me for me, but they end up just wanting to hook up. I know my value and self-worth, so I want someone else to recognize and acknowledge that too. That\u2019s why I get so down when a guy doesn\u2019t see me as something more than just a body.\n\nThe main things that I don\u2019t know how to fix are: \n* using sleep as an escape from responsibilities and reality. I simply don\u2019t know how to force myself to wake up and be productive\n* Getting out of my head about guys not wanting to pursue something more with me and not seeing what I have to offer\n* Getting back on track with my studies like I once was able to back in high school",

      "text": "Sounds like you need to work on surrounding yourself with similarly motivated people who want to do well. Befriending the people in my classes who seemed the most studious is what led me to my long term relatio ship as well. Also I'm sure you feel really overwhelmed, and like you'll never catch back up on the work you missed. Please try to take baby steps getting back into things, as the pressure you put on yourself can make you procrastinate even longer.",

      "text": "Your situation is very similar to my own. Burn out is a horrible thing that really weighs down on us. While I'm still not out of it, some things that help are \n\n(1) Doing something you enjoy every day. Usually long time hobbies but you can also try things you've been wanting to get into for a while. Doing this helps break up the stale everyday routine that we've gotten used to but desperately want to escape.\n\n(2) Clean or organize any space you use. Start small. Clear up some space on your phone, delete old files or tabs on the computer, or organize a nightstand or drawer. By then it'll be easier to work your way up. In our state of burn out, everything feel out of control, so exercising control over small things in our life helps us take the first steps into regaining it over bigger things.\n\nThe same idea goes for being productive. I am currently in the middle of this. Idk how many times I told myself the same thing you did, that \"tmr ill have my shit together\". Get whatever little things done in the day. Sometimes I wont even finish my list of little things I made, but the important thing is to still count them as productive days because telling ourselves it \"wasn't productive/productive enough\" only sinks us deeper into putting things off.",
