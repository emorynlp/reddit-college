But these people have so much control over your life and future. What's more, they've been through all this shit already. They should be people you can confide in who understand the toll it takes. It should not be normal for college students to be killing themselves, but I 100% understand why it is. Having staff that has the attitude of \"if you can't do it, why tf are you here?\" Or \"you knew college was hard before it started\" When you are struggling without any ability to empathize really doesn't help.\n\n Can I just say, those of you struggling with mental health issues, a disability, who have to care for children or an aging parent at home, who have to work full time, that eat a diet of mostly coffee because they don't have time to cook, you are seen and valid. Persoanlly when I told a professor I was struggling with interpreting the questions because of my autism (litteral thinking) she looked disgusted with me and started grading more harshly. It really felt like she didn't want me there anymore.\n\n We romanticize a lifestyle that is just inhumane and I feel our system would work better if we fucking stopped that. It can not be good for long term learning that these students are physically unable to take care of their own bodies outside of class, or take care of their mental health. This is disgusting, not romantic. Im sick of acting like this is the only way, and I'm sick of professors who act as though you should be greatful for the inhumane conditions you are currently living through. \n\nThis is a general vent post, not about any specific professor or all professors. I've had great professors this semster and I'm very thankful for them. It's about an attitude held by the greater society about college and what learning needs to look like, that poisons some professors out of the most basic of empathy or understanding.\n\nTL:DR I wish professor showed more empathy and compassion, instead of further normalizing the idea of the college kid who is supposed to struggle at all hours of the day and kill themselves (both figuratively and litterally) for a piece of paper that symbolize how smart they are or how much they know.", "author": "artquestioj", "created": 1620309447, "retrieved": 1632843503, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"gx5fhxx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n67vdv/anyone_else_fed_up_with_unempathetic_professors/gx5fhxx/", "text": "Thank you u/artquestioj for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
