I had a big anatomy exam due this past Thursday and unlike all my other professors who extended due dates right before the big storm hit (things got bad a few days prior with ice and the roads so we knew it was going to be rough) I didn\u2019t hear anything from my anatomy professor. I got power back late Wednesday night so rushed to cram what I could (I studied prior but all my stuff is online so I couldn\u2019t study or review when the power was out because phones also were barely working and I couldn\u2019t get a webpage to load, I could barely get texts to go out) and took my exam Thursday night right before it was due. I barely passed.\n\n\nHe sends out a message TODAY saying he just got power back (which I kinda question bc he lives an hour away from us in the city) saying he extended the exam due date. The exam that was due last Thursday. The one that we all already did. He knew the storm was coming just like everyone else did and failed to extend the dates prior. This is the same professor who keeps marking right answers wrong on tests. \n\n\nI am so frustrated and fed up it\u2019s just one thing after another with him. He knows that this class is crucial for almost everyone in our class for Nursing pre-requisites and that we get penalized on our Nursing application if we have to retake the class. I haven\u2019t reached out to ask if there\u2019s any way I could get another attempt for the exam because I don\u2019t even know what to say. I\u2019m at a loss for words, I just finally got him to correct the two quiz grades where he marked right answers wrong right before the storm hits and now this.", "author": "trippapotamus", "created": 1613881684, "retrieved": 1632950847, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"go9ff5c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/looyae/this_professor_is_going_to_be_the_death_of_me_i/go9ff5c/", "text": "Contact the professor.

He told me that he left his laptop up at the school thinking he would be driving in the next day for work and then the school was closed. He lives about 45 minutes to an hour from his campus I believe. He won\u2019t be going back to the campus until tomorrow, from what I assume, but at this point he\u2019s very worried he won\u2019t even be able to use his laptop anymore because he heard that a water main busted over some of the faculty offices and his office may be flooded or laptop ruined.\n\nSo, like I said, I\u2019m not sure what other stuff he\u2019s done, but getting surprised by a storm happened to a lot of people lately here in Texas.", "author": "chrisrayn", "created": 1613901053, "upvotes": 11}, "go7hpwi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/looyae/this_professor_is_going_to_be_the_death_of_me_i/go7hpwi/", "text": "Take my advice with a grain of salt if you wish. \n\nI recommend you go straight to the teacher and request a redo on grounds of weather and power outage emergency. I'm sure if this went to the Nursing department, they would agree that access to study materials being blocked by a known storm constitutes a retake. \n\nAt the very least this teacher could've asked everyone to download study material to be accessable in case of a power outage. This seems like poor planning on your teachers part. \n\nHowever, they seem a bit frazzled as well due to losing their power, so I'm sure they're aware that students are frustrated too. If they haven't shown to be a jerk about correcting grades, I think they might be understanding in this case as they already said they wanted to extend the dates.\n\nI get how it can be shady that they only just got back power, but power grids are weird. People can have power while people one neighborhood over can not have power. I wouldn't be surprised if he really didn't get power back until today. Just try asking and see where it goes. The longer you leave it though, the less likely they'll extend or give a retake.", "author": "AngryCat2018", "created": 1613894072, "upvotes": 39}}}
