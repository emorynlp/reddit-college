Emotionally abusive ex for the first half, who was controlling and did not allow me to meet new people or have any sort of a decent social life. The eventual breakup then affected me for a whole semester in year 2.\n\nOn top of that, my chronic illness that was initially well controlled relapsed,  leaving me in daily suffering throughout my 3rd year of college. Also adding to serious financial burden while i tried to find suitable treatment options. I hate myself and my body. Even going to the convenience store was a challenge at times.  \n\nAll the while, my silver lining is my love for what I am learning and my goals to get a scholarship for a postgrad in a related field (healthcare related so insanely expensive without a scholarship). \n\nIronically this keep me sane but also lead to another form of stress. The silver lining slowly eroded as I began stressing over my GPA and my progress. It was an obsession, it became my identity. Every failure felt like my world was shaken to its core.\n\nMy professors believed in me, a bit too much. They expected me produce multiple publish-able works. I felt stifled like rocks kept piling on me endlessly. I was so tired but I couldn\u2019t stop or complain, who would empathise with someone liked by the professors? Whose professors believed I was able to achieve something. \n\u2018Which postgrad programme are u applying to?\u2019, they would ask, \u2018you would do well in research.\u2019 I smiled in reply. My depression spiralled.\n\nMy ability to do my projects was affected by my horrible mental state. Even despite my efforts, my results were borderline. I\u2019m in my final year and I could still lose first class honours if I just get a B+ for my final project. I can\u2019t even afford to breathe in year 4. \n\nI know I can\u2019t complain, my closet friends struggle to pass their classes. But I just feel I can\u2019t breathe. Like I\u2019m drowning and I can\u2019t reach the surface. Like I\u2019m desperate for some hope that I can survive this. I\u2019ve invested so much in college, who am I outside of academia?
