  "title:": "English Professor Condescending and Not Helpful",
  "text": "I am in my first semester of college and I am taking four classes (12 credits). I have never been the best student but I was determined to do well when starting college.\n\nI am taking English 101 as one of my required gen-ed courses, and English has always been one of my worst subjects in school (even though I enjoy writing and learning about literature). I had kind of a late start with ENG-101 because each module was locked in Canvas and I couldn't figure out how to submit assignments. With each of my other classes, this was not a problem. I emailed my English professor the first week of class and he did not respond. Eventually, I figured out how to submit my assignments. The professor has the course set up to where you MUST complete each assignment in sequential order, and if you do not complete an assignment, you are unable to move on to the next until it is done.\n\nWhen I finally submit my first assignment (two weeks late), he messaged me in Canvas with my submission and said \"This is a very belated welcome to class. The other students have started Module 2 this week, and you are just now submitting your first assignment. Please make sure you are submitting your assignments on time.\" This to me did not sound like the friendliest of messages, as I did try to contact him regarding my issue before submitting this assignment.\n\nI did not respond to his message as I thought it may be unnecessary at this point. I received an email from him concerning my grade in the class a couple of weeks ago and I ended up responding to him telling him that I tried to contact him before and did not receive a response. I told him that I was struggling to get caught up because I could not view the assignments until two weeks after the start date, and he informed me that because of this, he would not be grading any of my late work for credit.\n\nI have received zeros on each assignment that is past due and I am so behind that I don't know what else I can do at this point.\n\nDuring one of our classes, we were having a discussion about an excerpt we read for our homework assignment the week before. This discussion was optional to partake in, and if you wanted to answer a question you would have to raise your hand. I was paying attention in class and trying to follow along even though I did not have access to the assignment yet. For one of the questions, the professor called on me even though I did not raise my hand. This was after he and I had a discussion about me falling behind.\n\nHe did not call on anybody else who was not willingly participating. He asked me a question and I was not about to make something up because I obviously was not able to access the assignment. I said I didn't know the answer and he tried asking me again. I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't know,\" and it seemed like he was frustrated with me for not knowing. He then proceeded to say, \"Well you have an exam on this next week so you better figure it out.\"\n\nI cried so hard after class (which I know is stupid but being called out like that makes me feel very dumb). The thing is that I really have tried to catch up and I feel like he is being a little too hard on me. None of my other professors frequently go out of their way to call out a student who doesn't know the answer, but if they do, they do not scrutinize their incapability of answering the question. If they don't know, they will simply explain it or ask another student.\n\nI have been so focused on trying to get caught up in my English class that it is causing me to fall behind in my other classes. I have considered withdrawing from this course, but my school's policy requires you to be passing the course in order to withdraw, or you will receive an automatic F. The last thing I want is to have a failed class on my college transcript as the whole purpose of me going to college was so I could do better than I did in high school and further my education.\n\nMy professor will not unlock my assignments for me (not that he should have to), but I can't help but feel like I am doing the work for no reason since it will remain as a zero.\n\nAt this point, it feels impossible for me to catch up and I am desperately trying not to accept the fact that I am most likely going to fail the course.\n\nI have attended every class meeting except for our last one because the professor specifically informed us not to come to class unprepared. I did not want to be called out again so I spent the time I would have been in class working on my missing assignments.\n\nI have tried so hard to keep up with my assignments in all of my classes this semester and have felt proud of myself up until this point.\n\nI am feeling discouraged and have even considered dropping out of school even though I really would like to at least achieve an Associate's.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on things I can do, that would be very much appreciated.\n\nThank you <3",

      "text": "First, as general advice: next time you have issues speak with your professor in person or with the IT department. There\u2019s no reason to turn in an assignment 2 weeks late. \n\nI suggest you speak with the department head/chair about your issues and possible options. Also if you drop the class and receive an F what happens if you retake it? Does the F get replaced? \n\nI second that you don\u2019t want this one class to bring down all your other grades. Definitely worth dropping this one class because you could end up with an F anyway plus lower grades in the other 3.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t drop out due to this one event. College is a marathon not a sprint. It takes some adjustment so see what your options are regarding your English class and keep working hard on your other courses.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re adamant about staying in the course: If he\u2019s going to grade all your late work as a 0, turn in a blank document for these past assignments until you are caught up and focus on the grade from here on out.\n\nTalk to your advisor and the department head. Although you are just learning these lessons, if there\u2019s a technical issue it is unfortunately your job to contact the IT department or other faculty that can help you.\n\nIf you can replace your F by retaking the course, I would withdraw immediately and retake it next semester with a different teacher. Focus on the grades that you can salvage!",
