It is also really much easier to get someone to care at college.\n\nMost students don\u2019t take advantage of academic dishonesty requirements; that is if another student is claiming your work as their own; report them. Not just to the professor but in the appeal of your mark.\n\nIf all students in these kinds of projects appealed their mark when they had issues the projects would be (and could be) structured much better. \n\nI appreciate your rant, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong.
