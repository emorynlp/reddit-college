I even didn\u2019t struggle with school during the pandemic like a lot of people seemed to have. Right now though, I\u2019m sitting in a coffee shop frantically cramming knowledge into my head for a huge exam tomorrow that I just know I\u2019m gonna fail. I know I shouldn\u2019t have waited until the night before to hit the books hard, but man, I have not been able to kick myself into any sort of groove regarding school since in-person classes started back up. I\u2019ve developed horrible procrastination habits I\u2019ve never dealt with before, have been finding little to no joy in my classes and have fairly regular thoughts about dropping out. I don\u2019t want to perse though since I\u2019m junior standing and halfway done with college anyways, and I have the resources to get myself through college financially, but the pandemic gave me a different outlook that I feel I can\u2019t shake. I\u2019ve come to like the idea of making a living through more alternative means that don\u2019t particularly require a degree and won\u2019t put me in a stupendous of debt like going to a university does. I can\u2019t even picture myself using my degree right out of college since I just want to travel more and make a living working hodgepodge jobs on the road like I was able to do during the pandemic. I don\u2019t know.   \n\nI guess I just needed to rant and connect with others that may be going through the same sort of situation with similar thoughts.
