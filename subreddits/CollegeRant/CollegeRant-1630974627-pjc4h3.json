I still hang around my high school friends, ones that I spent years hanging around to be true friends, only to find that it is so hard to make friends and do things in college.\n\nI don\u2019t party or drink (because alcohol and drugs affected my family life), and I have always been an introvert and socially awkward because I was bullied in school and have a significant fear of rejection (that in which I\u2019m afraid people will say no if I ask them to do something). There are no clubs that I have been able to find that I\u2019m interested in, and the thought of me organizing hangouts with people I barely know scares me. Can anyone, anyone at all give me any advice on making friends? I\u2019ve gotten so upset seeing all of my high school friends go to different colleges and already have cliques that they can hang with. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m lonely in college bc I am an introvert who has a hard time asking to hang out with people bc of social awkwardness. I don\u2019t party/drink, etc. and I can\u2019t find any clubs I\u2019m interested in. I need advice.\n\nMajor: Business (Marketing)", "author": "randomguy2418", "created": 1630974627, "retrieved": 1632948804, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
