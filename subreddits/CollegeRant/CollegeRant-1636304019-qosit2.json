  "title:": "This professor does not care and it frustrates me so much",
  "text": "I'm an accounting major, and part of my degree requires I study some tax. Accounting also requires a licensing exam (which is changing soon but this prof probably doesn't care and I doubt he's adjusted anything in his curriculum to teach that). The textbook he's using makes no sense and does little to dissect or properly explain the content.\n\nI asked him in class to break down a particular question and how it resulted in the answer he gave us and he more or less droned on about how he doesn't have time in this course bc it's only an intro course. But he expects us to have enough knowledge for this intro course to solve complex problems we've never been exposed to before \n\n  \nWhen I took the midterm, I went through every problem we had in the book and reverse engineered the answers to understand the content, but when we took the exam, the questions looked like nothing we covered. My friends did better on that exam GUESSING then I did going through the processes and math trying to answer the problem. \n\nAt the end of the exam he had to curve by 40 points just so that everyone could pass (so i wound up with a B which I'll take, but it's frustrating)  which I'm guessing he does to avoid complaints to the dean (he's tenured so they won't fire him, but I don't imagine he enjoys having to discuss his exam with the dean).  Even if I went to the dean, he is the only professor at the school who teaches this specialization, so souring our relationship with complaints is not the way to go. \n\nHe is so clearly there for grant and research money as well as to pad his retirement but I can't help but wonder how much this will screw with my licensing exam in a few years. Yes I have time, but I'm paying for this class, and I don't want to pay for more prep-classes post graduation to do something he should be doing.",

          "text": "Thank you. I will be using these resources (probably when i finish undergrad). Part of my rant is just that's it's disheartening how little use there is to try for this class when this is something i still need. It is an intro course and i will be avoiding tax (not the specialty i want) as much as I can in terms of courses, but these are still basics i need to know",
