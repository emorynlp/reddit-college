  "text": "I went to two different advisors to get something fixed. They both tell me to go to my department for my major. Then the department tells me to contact the help desk. So I contact the help desk and they tell me to go see my advisor. So I go back to the department and they get in contact with this lady who was supposedly going to get it fixed. But never ever happened. So I just emailed the lady to see what happened. I am tired of this school sending me back and forth. I\u2019ve told them too and they said the advisor should be able to fix it but for some reason they can\u2019t. So incompetent.",
