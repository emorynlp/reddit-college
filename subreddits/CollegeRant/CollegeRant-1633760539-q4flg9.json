  "title:": "Need help convincing my college\u2019s COVID team to change on-campus testing sites",
  "text": "Hello, we have an on campus testing site for COVID-19. That site is located inside the multipurpose room for one of the residence halls, and unvaccinated students, staff and faculty come there regularly to test for COVID. I\u2019m co-president of our college\u2019s Nerd Culture Club which normally meets in that room. \n\nI have a few problems with the testing location:\n\n1) they have several other optimal locations on campus that no one ever uses, that they could have reserved for testing but instead they chose to block off a room that gets used a LOT\n2) they did not provide me a reason and were rather rude with me when myself and the other co-president tried to convince them to move sites\n3) by putting the testing site in a residence hall, they are unnecessarily putting unvaccinated students who live there at risk \n4) and finally, our club considers that room to be effectively (not officially) ours, and we take issue with the fact that no one even emailed us letting us know we needed to change rooms or involved us in the decision-making process as to where testing would take place. Since we are affected by that decision it\u2019s unfair to us not to let us say our piece and be heard but that\u2019s exactly what they did. \n\nAny advice with regards to any other ways I can convince the college\u2019s COVID-19 team?",

      "text": "Question\u2014is there not an online reservation system for rooms? You said it\u2019s unofficially yours, which sounds like \u201cdibs\u201d but not exactly checking out the room. If you\u2019ve checked it out for specific dates and times and the Covid testing site came in without going through the process, I\u2019d be ticked too. But if you don\u2019t reserve the room, I can\u2019t see how anyone is supposed to know it\u2019s \u201cyours\u201d and therefore contact you. Just trying to get some clarification.",

You literally say it\u2019s a multipurpose room. Your club is pretty low on the list of important things to worry about in comparison to your universities attempt at doing the right thing.",
