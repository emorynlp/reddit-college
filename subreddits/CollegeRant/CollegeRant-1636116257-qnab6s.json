  "text": "Wow.  I never knew that I would be in one of the classes. The first thing he  does is talk about how the first exam had B average and second exam  mysteriously has F average. Turns out this man gave the exact same first  exam to the previous year class. It seems almost the entire class of  less than 20 students had the first exam and what they thought would be  is the second exam.\n\nSomehow I  never knew and nobody cared to help me out. I guess making zero friends  and spending my days in a library ended up saving my career and was  worth it after all.\n\nBut is that  allowed? I thought that classes need to have certain grade averages or  curve will be mandatory. I assume almost the entire class now received a  0 on the exam is bad for average class GPA or are those students not  included?\n\nAnd lmfao at how he gave the second exam right after withdrawal/ drop date.",

If the majority of the students don't demonstrate mastery of the course material, IMHO it would be unethical to put your thumb on the scale and pass them anyways. \n\nEspecially if it's because of academic integrity issues that backfired on them. Does he know this is how it went down?",
