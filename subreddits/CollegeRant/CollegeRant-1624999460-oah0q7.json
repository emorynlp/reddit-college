I had sent in my health department records and apparently I needed one vaccination that I had not received in a very long time. Ofc I couldn\u2019t get the vaccine right away since I had my covid shot so I had to wait 2 weeks. But really? At least let students register and be in the system so that they can get the classes they need before they get full. \n\nThe assistant for my department left me out on an email for information on advising for master students. Somehow I was not included in the email so I had to reschedule. Somehow I was left out even though I have been clearly emailing faculty to make sure i\u2019m on the right path lol. \n\nThe  financial aid office is my current trouble. My status says I am an off-campus student even though I secured on campus housing. I emailed them and they said that they had fixed it.  A couple of hours later it still says that i\u2019m off campus. I have tried calling twice and no one has answered my call. i\u2019ll try tomorrow morning (fingers crossed). July 1st is suppose to be the day that I finalize my decisions but how am I suppose to do that when my letter isn\u2019t accurate? \n\nI received an assistantship from my graduate department. I have to go through all the HR bullshit. I cannot log in with my information they emailed me. That\u2019s another thing i have to resolve. \n\nWhat sucks is this summer I have been working full hours as a cashier. I am so so burnt out :(. Not to mention like many seniors, my last year of undergrad was virtual. I hate having to reschedule/call important things when I have a full work load. \n\nTL;DR: Registering and just the process of becoming student is absolute bullshit.
