  "title:": "I want to drop out but my parents will disagree",
  "text": "I'm currently in 3rd year of Computer Science (Indian University) and I hate it. I realised this in my 2nd year, opened up to Mum about it but she won't let me drop out. I've explored CS enough. This is not the the career for me. I've tried programming (actually took some online courses to understand this shit) but I'm really bad at it and I'm unhappy with it. However, I've wasted my parent's money for 3 years of useless college.  I was forced into this stream by my sister and other family friends. I was too dumb in my 12th grade to think for myself. I feel  nostalgic sitting in the classroom and wondering what the hell is going on. Advise would be great. Thanks in advance.",
