Email your teacher with a sorry excuse in hopes that she'll take mercy on you. \nEither that, or start making preparations for your funeral.\n\nJk, haha!! O.k, so here's the plan: either pull an all nighter and sleep in, or sleep now and wake up VERY early in order to complete your assignment. Like, unnaturally early. 8am is awfully soon!! You'd have to get up at 4, or 5. 6 if you're feeling like a risky speed demon. \n\nWhich ever one you choose, damn, I wish you luck! Don't do this to yourself next time!",

I\u2019m hoping to have it turned in by 3am haha lol. I can\u2019t sure in though because I have to make a short presentation on my paper at 8:30 am so fml. I\u2019m definitely sleeping after it\u2019s done \n\nThis is the second time in my entire college career (I\u2019m graduating next semester) doing this and I hate it. I don\u2019t know how people procrastinate this much on the regular",

              "text": "Well I hope everything goes well. I have faith in you, but things can get wonky if you're too tired. Do as much as you can, and if you feel like things are getting foggy and you're exhausted, you don't want to push it. Sleep, and then maybe get up at 7 a.m and add the final touches.\n\nIf you're a night owl, then I think you'll have it done by 3 with no problem. I'm a morning person when it comes to schoolwork, so that's why I'm stressing sleep so much. \n\nBut yes, procrastination is definitely something to avoid, and it's good that you don't do it that often. It's not always intentional, somehow outside circumstances interfere with your plans to complete assignments, and in that way, it's truly not your fault. It's just one of those things. \n\nNow get to typing!! Stay focused and diligent. You've got this!",
