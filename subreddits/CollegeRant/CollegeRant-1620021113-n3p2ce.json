  "text": "Scummiest app of all time\n\nIn Kuwait we have an app for college lectures called \u201cbaims\u201d where you have to pay 600 usd for video lectures about one subject only. So you have to pay 600 usd for every subject you want to study for. On the other hand khan academy literally offers lectures about all subjects FOR FREE\n\nTell me this is not a scam! The problem is that the app is REALLY popular here and everyone uses it",

If there's something I've realised, it's that I can learn virtually everything on YouTube. Also platforms like Coursera allow you to audit the course without paying anything. I never realised the power of YouTube until last year.",
