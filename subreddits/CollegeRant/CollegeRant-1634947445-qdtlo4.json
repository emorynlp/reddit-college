  "title:": "Is it normal to cry over the fact you're going to just barely miss making summa cum laude? Is magna cum laude still something to be proud of? Has anyone else experienced emotional distress after just missing an academic achievement cutoff? [VENT]",
  "text": "**TL;DR:** I'm upset that a shitty teacher's unexplained, impossible expectations are going to drag me down from my 3.9GPA and I don't think I'll be able to get it back up before I graduate. I cried a little bit because I was so damn proud of myself for how well I was doing, and I feel like getting magna over summa makes me a loser. I could really use some emotional support and to hear some stories of people who have gone through similar things.\n\nI'm going to college for social work. I graduated with my undergrad earlier this year and am now in grad school. I graduated cum laude for my undergrad and it was the most amazing feeling. If you told high school me that I'd be recognized for academic achievement, let alone that I'd be alive today, I'd call you fucking crazy.\n\nAs of now, I have a 3.9 GPA which is the minimum to get summa cum laude. This semester I unfortunately have a horrible teacher my class collectively hates. He doesn't communicate his expectations and won't admit his mistakes if a test question marked wrong is actually right (with evidence proving so). I've done the math so far in the semester and if I get As on everything else I'll get a high B. This is still going to pull me down from my 3.9 and because I'm in an accelerated program that graduates next Summer, I don't think I can pull it back up. I cried for a little while when I realized this because I was just... Crushed. I thought that this could be the one time in my life where I succeed at doing something genuinely impressive. Something I could be proud of and others would be impressed by. Something ***I*** did by myself that shows I'm \"worthy\".\n\nAll my life I've been a scapegoat, the \"Meg\" of my family, a target of horrific bullying, a victim. I sucked at school from 6-12 and was a solid C - B student, in that order. I felt I was stupid and at one point considered flat out not going to college. All my life my family has portrayed me as the weak one that would never be able to stand on her own. The idea of getting the highest honor at my school made me so excited. Now knowing I'll only be able to get second best no matter how hard I work through the next few semesters is really getting to me. I was so proud of how well I was doing and while I plan on continuing to work hard I just... Don't know. I'm upset and want a hug.\n\nI'm really posting to ask for stories from other people that have experienced something similar. I need reassurance that magna cum laude isn't something to be upset about. I need emotional support.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "I've spent so much of my life being told I was a good-for-nothing loser and it felt like this could be the one BIG accomplishment I could do. I want to show the people who said I'd never amount to anything because of my illnesses that I'm a graduating member from the class of \"fuck off, I made it\". Even if the people who tormented me and caused me so much hell through the years never see it. It would be proof to myself that they were wrong. That I am worth more. I am capable. I am smart. Seeing myself capable of holding a 3.9 for two semesters made me ecstatic. For the first time I started valuing my mind and thinking \"maybe I am kind of smart\". There's not much I like about myself so this was the one thing I felt I could really be proud of.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSorry for rambling.",

Work ethic matters. Summa or magna don\u2019t matter one bit.\n\nIt is normal to cry about it. You need to let emotion happen. After a while you can move on.",

I can't imagine how hard it must be for you, but it's a noble thing that you've even gone so close to it. There are going to be many other chances in your life where you can achieve great things so don't let this define your self worth!",
