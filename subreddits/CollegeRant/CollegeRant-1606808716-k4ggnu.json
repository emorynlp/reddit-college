I got a 10.5/15 on a paper. But it's everything around it that really just tipped the scale.\n\nMy school, like many, went online during spring break. We said goodbye to our friends, said we'd see them soon, and we haven't seen each other since. It's been all Zoom and quarantine since then. I'm starting to miss people and since I'm a senior and my University is guaranteed online next semester, I'm never going to see some of them again.\n\nSpeaking of people I'll never see again, my estranged uncle died mid semester and the family was a mess over it, so that was cool. He died on the other side of the country and all we got back was his cellphone. And since I'm a digital forensics minor, my family kept insisting that I \"hack into\" his phone to see what he's been up to. I tried telling them it wasn't that simple and there was no way I had time to do it with school but they insisted. So eventually I ended up pawning the job to my professor who was nice enough to just dump all the info we needed into a thumb drive for us.\n\nLike many college kids, I have a job. I work in a grocery store. This whole year has been a shit show for us. People hoarding goods, employees getting quarantined, rule changes every week, etc. Constant stress. No reward whatsoever.\n\nAnd the school work. Fuck the school work. Professors don't even teach anymore. They start zoom calls, brief us for assignments, then shit on the assignments when we turn them in. Absolutely no compassion on their end. They'll take forever to grade papers because \"this semester has been so hectic\" but they won't make things any easier for us.\n\nMy University decided for some reason that instead of making the semester 16 weeks like every other, we could get by with 12 and a half including finals. We not only had to relearn how to take in information, we had to do it under a serious time crunch. Every single class, even the 400 level classes with labs, had to be crammed into the 12 weeks. And some classes were worse. They were only given 6 weeks to cram in the entire class. For some reason, my school insisted on finishing before Thanksgiving. Not sure why, it's not like the internet was gonna disappear in December.\n\nAnd let me cram in one more thing: I heard multiple times from professors \"I know the class average was a 60 but I had 3 hundreds so clearly it wasn't a problem with the lectures.\" Lemme stop you right there- those people cheated. They took advantage of you. You were nice enough to not make us use a lockdown browser, and they decided to Google answers. And don't get me wrong, the rest of us could have googled answers so maybe it's a case of \"the nice guy finishes last\", but don't act naive.\n\nThat all leads us to today's problem. I've taken finals and turned in every assignment. But I'm still getting grades from assignments I turned in a month ago because the professors haven't had time to grade them. This literally feels like I'm in an abusive relationship with my notifications. I look at them hoping for something good and I just keep regretting it. I finally felt like I could relax after finals, but I keep getting grades and feedback on assignments. And these aren't negligible assignments either, these are like 20% of my overall grade a piece. These are assignment that the feedback on would have been appreciated a month ago when I could've done anything about it. Now if I fucked up, it's too late and I just have to deal with it. The hard work and studying I did for finals was worthless because apparently I started fucking up weeks ago and didn't even know it.\n\nI'm fucking struggling. Next semester is my last and I need to get into grad school. This doesn't even feel fair, I tried so fucking hard to raise my GPA for the past 2 years and now my GPA is gonna tank again because I had to go through a semester where actually teaching material wasn't even a top priority for half the professors.\n\nI know I'm not alone. My story may be worse than some, but I'm definitely not in the minority here.", "author": "moseph999", "created": 1606808716, "retrieved": 1632951349, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"geb1vyh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k4ggnu/ive_managed_to_keep_my_head_high_for_the_last_35/geb1vyh/", "text": "Ahahaa I related to ALL of this, my professors have all decided that they\u2019re going to assign each session to a pair of students, who are assigned to prepare a PowerPoint and full lesson plan somehow outside of class (??) and present the material AND lead all discussions while the prof sits there.

I know there's professor evaluations but they don't make much of a difference. They just use it for \"feedback\". As if that fixes anything. The professors should be monitored more so that department heads can see whether or not they're actually doing anything. If the class average is a 60% then obviously something is wrong and it's bullshit that they can just brush it off and blame it on the student. I know these problems existed before the pandemic, but it's only worse now. Idk what that soku would even be, but when students put in little effort/fuck up, we get bad grades. We fail. Our GPA goes down. We have to retake a class which costs more money and pushes back our graduation date. Meanwhile when professors are asked to literally just do their job to a high standard, high being the bare minimum, they do whatever they want and face no consequences besides a bad evaluation that doesn't even make a difference because they're tenured anyway. I'm so sick of it. I've been in school since 2014 on and off. Been in community college and university. Done in person classes and online. And it's literally sickening how many teachers are terrible and I see them walking around carefree next year, still teaching. Even after their class of 30 dropped down to 10 students (not exaggerating) for a 100 class and they've gotten bad reviews from everyone.

I'm really sorry for the loss of your uncle and for all that you had to go through. I hope you heal from it.   \nIt's true that universities haven't been able to keep up to their \"it'll-be-a-smooth-transition-and online-classes-will-be-the-same-as-f2f-classes\" promises and it's for a fact that a lot of the universities are doing the same. \n\nOf course, it's not your fault, you gave your best and that's what matters. The situation is terrible for everyone so don't be so hard on yourself.  I'm sure your grad school will also keep that in mind. From what I've read so far you are a hardworking person and hard work always pays off! Hang in there bud!
