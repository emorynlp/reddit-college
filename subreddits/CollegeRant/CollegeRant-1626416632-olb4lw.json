  "text": "I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to go to college and pursue something I\u2019m interested in, but I hate attending college. I feel mostly culpable for this bc I looked forward to going to college for so long and I think I envisioned something more enjoyable than it actually is and set myself up for disappointment. \n\nFor example, before college I was really excited about the new classes I could take but now I see those classes for the textbooks/homework codes associated with them. I was looking forward to being in a club but now I doubt my ability to make the time commitment. I wanted to look into undergraduate research but there is always this crippling fear that I am too dumb to be of any use(I still apply though so maybe I\u2019ll find something). And I really wanted to study abroad bc we afford to go out of country and I received this stipend to go abroad but now I don\u2019t even know if that stipend will cover enough and I know I will not be able to come up w the money on my own. \n\nMoney has become a major stressor for me and I know I\u2019m not alone in that situation by any means but I hate always being broke. It makes me feel inadequate. And I know I won\u2019t stop being broke for a long time. \n\nAlso my mental health was bad before college but now it is even worse. I tend to dissociate a lot more now and I have this problem with sensory overload that\u2019s been made worse by ever present stench of coolant leaking from the ac units??? I know it\u2019s pretty fussy of me to say it but some of my worse memories of college so far have been me walking back from studying or something, crying with a headache and then smelling that damned coolant. \n\nIn spite of this, I\u2019m still grateful for the opportunity to go. I know that going to college aligns with my goals(I\u2019m studying chem engineering). I\u2019ve made wonderful friends here who definitely make going here easier. But I wish I liked this more. As it stands, I\u2019m my happiest when I leave campus when my mom picks me up or my friends and I go somewhere. (Also I developed this really bad escapism habit as a coping mechanism I guess and it is a major problem but that is another thing altogether).\n\nTL;DR: College is disappointing, my mental health is suffering, but I\u2019m still going to see it through. At least some good has/will come out of it?",
