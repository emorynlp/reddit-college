  "text": "I have been in community college for about 8 years now. I never took college seriously and I withdrew from classes every time it got to hard and I thought I would fail. Time has passes and I need advice on what to do. I care about college now. I have a low gpa still although, I have gotten a B in trig and an A in precal. ( my two most recent classes.) I have a sense of anxiety that my hard work now won't be able to overcome my idiotic past. I want to be an engineer, and I'm thinking it might be better to just get an associates. Then apply to a University. I have been working full time in construction since I turned 18. Any advice is appreciated.",
