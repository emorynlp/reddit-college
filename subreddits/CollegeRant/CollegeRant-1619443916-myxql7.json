      "text": " I used to stress so much over college I'd get physically sick.\n\nI went from super stressing over everything and now....in these last 2 years, I went from not caring to not caring at all. And my family gets mad at me cus they think I'm being lazy. Other people even ask me why I'm so \"not caring\" about it all. This stressful college shit is just one small area of my life, it doesn't matter in grand scheme of things , to me.\n\nThis is only one small part of my life. 5, 10 years from now...i wont even be thinking about college at all. Time doesn't freeze for college lol so let the chips fall where they may. I can at least say that I tried my best, the whole way. And that's all we can give is our best. No need in breaking your back or your spirit for college.\n\nSeriously tho. Just give it your best, and if thats not enough than oh well. Life goes on, and I'm so glad it does. Cus years from now this will be a distant forgotten bad memory.",

OP says he's depressed, maybe college isn't for him and might find meaning in a trade instead of school. Maybe trades school will make him feel meaning in life and won't feel depressed anymore. Who knows? Only OP can tell.\n\nBy the way, find solutions. I had a prof who said to one fucked up guy \"It's typical to find a solution to every problem, but you find a problem to every solution\"\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\n\\#NotResponsibleForYourSensivity\n\nTake care, \"capacity\"",
