And my family gets mad at me cus they think I'm being lazy. Other people even ask me why I'm so \"not caring\" about it all. This stressful college shit is just one small area of my life, it doesn't matter in grand scheme of things , to me.\n\nThis is only one small part of my life. 5, 10 years from now...i wont even be thinking about college at all. Time doesn't freeze for college lol so let the chips fall where they may. I can at least say that I tried my best, the whole way. And that's all we can give is our best. No need in breaking your back or your spirit for college.\n\nSeriously tho. Just give it your best, and if thats not enough than oh well. Life goes on, and I'm so glad it does.
