I\u2019ve complained to compliance and they don\u2019t do anything to him- I went online and read his reviews and apparently it\u2019s a VERY common issue with this teacher in particular. He has failed the majority of his students by what I can tell.\n\nWe can see our class average as well for our overall grade and that\u2019s showing as a 56, and I have a mid-C. My grade also shows as the \u201chigh\u201d in the class so I know no one has a higher grade than mine (but may be equal to). \n\nLike, I don\u2019t get why some teachers are this much of stick in the muds. They have got to realize that nobody likes them and that they are full of shit if they expect perfection on each and every thing and mark off a massive amount of points for small things. What does that accomplish? Literally nothing? What does intentionally creating the hardest test you can accomplish? Literally nothing.\n\nCollege is supposed to be about learning material, not competing to see who can make their course the hardest and most ridiculous.  \n\nAnd we pay for this crap... \n\nI should have just gone to trade school, this is all a waste of time and money and only about luck of the draw with professors, school and curriculum.", "author": "gabbagabbalabba", "created": 1605398025, "retrieved": 1632950758, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 140, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gccz5jg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/juc0on/rant_about_midterm_and_no_one_passing_and/gccz5jg/", "text": "What class?", "author": null, "created": 1605427279, "upvotes": 3}, "gccacer": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/juc0on/rant_about_midterm_and_no_one_passing_and/gccacer/", "text": "The thing that pisses me off about professors who do this, it fucks yo scholarships.

This was separated over two semesters...Accounting & Financial Management 1, and Accounting & Financial Management 2. When I did Accounting & Financial Management 1, I breezed through it, getting in the top 15% of the class. Accounting & Financial Management 2, however, was a different story.\n\nThe lecturer who taught Accounting & Financial Management 2, was a bit of a jerk. He preferred fraternising with Masters and Honours students, and didnt give a shit about undergrad students. He would teach it as though everyone was a Masters student. As a result, he would deliberately fail 70% of the class every semester. Anyone who could avoid doing the subject, would. Eventually, enough complaints were made (and for me, after I failed it three times), that they scrapped it as a compulsory subject, and replaced it with Introduction to Financial Management (Accounting & Financial Management 1 reverted to being Accounting 1).", "author": "ZeroPenguinParty", "created": 1605407882, "upvotes": 22}, "gcb5m3b": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/juc0on/rant_about_midterm_and_no_one_passing_and/gcb5m3b/", "text": "the fact that the highest grade in the class is an E and the professor sees nothing wrong with that is so baffling.
