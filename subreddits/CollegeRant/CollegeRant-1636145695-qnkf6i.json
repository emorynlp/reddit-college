  "text": "I really love how my professors treat homework like I don't have other classes. I do my homework 2-3 days in advanced from the due date, but It's so enjoyable when they assign projects, along with 3 homework assignments due on the same date. I might not have good time management, but for someone who does this for a living and for years I would think that they would have it down by now. It's not fun having to do a single assignment that takes 2 hours, then do the quiz and do 2 more of those then the project. There's only 24 hours in a day, I'm up for about 12 of them, I have things to do outside of classes. I understand homework is there for me to fully learn and understand the topic. But the only thing I'm learning is how to spend my whole day cooped in my room doing a homework assignment that you're not going to grade because it was online and they automatically grade it for you. I pay for the homework and the books so that I can learn, not mindlessly sit there and answer questions repeated over and over again. \n\nTL;DR: I'm tired of sitting at a desk for 6 hours doing 1 class worth of assignments due in 3 days, that I paid for where the professor will just use a program to grade and put into the gradebook.",

      "text": "If you're overwhelmed by your work, break it down into smaller chunks and do a little bit at a time. To avoid burnout, you could do one chunk for one subject, then switch over to a different subject. This is a technique called interleaving, and it's proven to be a very effective strategy not only for completing homework, but also remembering concepts for long periods of time.",

      "text": "One thing you could do to make your classwork more tolerable would be to take interest in the content. Remember, everything you learn is crucial to the betterment of who you are as a person. Do you care about the subjects? Do you want to know about how the concepts work? Try to reframe your attitude toward work. It doesn't have to be a chore. Think of college as a quest. Try to see just how much you can learn about the world before your time runs out.",

      "text": "How far in advance have you known about these assignments? Of course working hard is not fun, and it\u2019s frustrating when it feels like things are repetitive, but repetition helps to reinforce concepts.\n\nAlso, for every hour of class per week, there is an expectation that you\u2019ll spend 2-3 hours on average per week outside of class. Yes, it\u2019s a lot, but going to school full time is a full time commitment.",
