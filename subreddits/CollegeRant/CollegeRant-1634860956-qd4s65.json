  "title:": "Doing Poorly in Math Class",
  "text": "I know doing bad in a class isn't really anything new to anyone, but at this point it is getting to the point where I am becoming depressed even more. My goal is to eventually go to med school and I am doing well and understanding the content in all of my other classes but calculus is just eating me alive. I keep failing my quizzes and the first test we took I barely passed with a 71% (unless a D is passing idk). The class average right now is around a 52% and the average for all of the quizzes is around a 48%. I am honestly super demoralized and if the way he has been grading quizzes/tests so far is any indication I highly doubt he is going to curve the grade so idk what to do. At this point it is too late to drop and Idk. Just needed to rant. okay bye",
