  "text": "So im taking most of my classes online this semester and I've been frustrated by the lack of communication and interaction online. It would be really nice to have some friends in these classes that I could vent to or check in with when I have simple questions but because if the nature of online classes... its not really an option. \nI've been tempted to reach out to some of my fellow students that are around my same age and invite them to a group chat or something like that but I don't want it to come across as weird. \n\nHave any of you guys managed to make connections with online peers and do you have any advice on how to go about it?",

      "text": "Yes. We had a GroupMe chat for each class we are in. One class even made a separate group chat for sharing memes and venting. Having that group chat was helpful for homework, questions, and getting to know others. It\u2019s not weird at all and can be extremely helpful. \n\nOne person usually collects all the contact information needed for the group chat, then makes that group possible.",
