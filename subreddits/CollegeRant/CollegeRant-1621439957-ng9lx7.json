I hate to say it but I think I enjoyed the adrenaline rush of trying to get everything in + taking the final at the same time. \n\nI couldn't tell you what I did differently this semester, but apparently I did it right.", "author": "BonkBird652", "created": 1621439957, "retrieved": 1632950044, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {}}
