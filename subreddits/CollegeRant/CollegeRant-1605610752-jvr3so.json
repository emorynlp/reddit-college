I am glad they are taking the steps to catch the cheaters but what frustrated me the most was I did not receive a formal apology from the professor or a teaching assistant. They put me through an entire weekend of stress only to  let me go as though I owe them something? Excuse me? I used official documentation that we are allowed to access during the exam but the examples the official documentation uses are similar to the leaked answers so I was flagged? Is it so hard to just say \"Sorry for causing blah blah\" instead of \"we are dropping charges against you\"? The evidence they had was super flimsy at best and they want me to remember how I got my answers for an exam I took more than a month ago? That is it for my rant.", "author": "huntalittlebit", "created": 1605610752, "retrieved": 1632951773, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"gcmvj68": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvr3so/exam_cheating/gcmvj68/", "text": "Damnn that really sucks especially because they flagged you for cheating but you didn't cheat.
