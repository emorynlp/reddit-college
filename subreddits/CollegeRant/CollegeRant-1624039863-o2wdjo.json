It was all a little overwhelming because I was heavily involved in graduation due to leadership and I didn't really understand how to use canvas. I managed to figure it out and I had like 9 assignments due the day of grad and the day after so I did all of them -- save for one because I didn't even know we had it. \n\nGrad was on the 15th by the way, and on the 17th my psychology teacher sent out an email saying he was disappointed to find out that only 6 out of his 27 students did the discussion post that was due on the 16th. I actually did it, so I was like aw I feel bad but whatever. My next notification was telling me that I missed a syllabus quiz for his class. \n\nI reached out to him and let him know that I was sorry, and that because I'm the oldest I had so much family over and so much going on that I didn't have enough time to figure out Canvas enough to even realize I had a quiz. I followed up by saying that I didn't expect him to open it up because that part's on me, but after his last communication I just wanted to reach out and let him know that I did care about his class I was just overwhelmed (my mom's a teacher so I see how students not caring impacts her and I felt super bad).\n\nHis response: \"So you were having fun with your family, and you think that\u2019s an excuse for not doing your schoolwork?\" ...Ya I do -- I never asked for an excuse, I WAS LITERALLY GRADUATING and this fucker is flipping over a SYLLABUS quiz. Anyway, so I dropped his class. \n\nTL;DR my psychology teacher thinks a syllabus quiz is more important than a graduation", "author": "therealgigihadid", "created": 1624039863, "retrieved": 1632842203, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"h28ipo8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o2wdjo/my_professor_wanted_to_bitch_at_me_for_graduating/h28ipo8/", "text": "Thank you u/therealgigihadid for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
