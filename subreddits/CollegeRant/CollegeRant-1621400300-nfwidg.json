  "text": "Does anyone feel super stressed out about their gpa sometimes? It's like everyone is always saying how it wont matter bla bla but then some jobs do look at it, grad schools look at it, its required for certain majors/programs/scholarships.... I hate having to work so much to get a stupid letter at the end that apparently means so much. People change so much in four years. Even just from last semester, I am a freshman and I had serious mental health issues which caused me to get a Gpa im embarassed to say. Now, I am doing much better and getting better grades, but I can't erase those grades. It sucks. It will still be part of my gpa. You can change but that doesnt matter on your transcript. Those will still hold you down. You can retake the courses sure, but out of your own money, time, and effort. Shit just sucks. It feels like your mistakes are recorded forever and will still hold you back when you are still doing better. I hate this numbers game. I hate getting points off for very dumb things. I hate getting .01 away from a grade and it not getting rounded. I'm only a freshman and dont want to keep doing this. Sorry for being whiney, I just felt like ranting somewhere.",

      "text": "GPA matters in some fields, doesn't matter in others.  In banking, anything under 3.6 gets trashed. You also need very strong internships.  It's so competitive that I'm seeing GPAs in the 3.8+ range with 2-3 very strong internships.  \n\nGPA stressed me in college because I needed a certain GPA for my scholarship.  So I feel your pain.  Especially with group projects.  To this day I hate people.",
