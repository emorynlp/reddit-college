It\u2019s akin to forcing a nutrition/wellness major into studying theoretical physics, or making a dance major study engineering. The only reason I can think colleges force these bogus classes on students is to put as many roadblocks in the way of graduation as possible so they can make more money. Perhaps this is why most math instructors just lazily read off screens and rush through everything without explaining it for those who are confused, because they are aware this information is pointless too. Hell, I\u2019ve gotten more help from other students than the instructor during my summer class this year. Are universities this scummy about taking useless classes outside the United States too?\n\nTL;DR: college math classes are nothing more than a tool for universities to arbitrarily keep you from graduating.", "author": null, "created": 1593448030, "retrieved": 1632843381, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"fywtkz5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hi30x5/college_math_classes_are_a_bigger_scam_than/fywtkz5/", "text": "The first year of calculus and intro stats are super applicable to the real world.
