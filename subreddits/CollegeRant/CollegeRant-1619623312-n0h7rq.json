To do anything takes 500 emails. I have to schedule things using their shitty ass website that doesn\u2019t even work. Had a meeting today, they never send me the zoom link for it. I emailed them and of course no reply. \n\nI\u2019m trying to schedule another meeting and I\u2019ve said to them time and time again the website is not working for me. Their answer? Use the website. Fuck me i guess.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s them not taking responsibility for things. This year they fucked up move in so horrendously bad many students\u2019s belongings ended up in landfills. It\u2019s been months and have we seen any compensation? No.\n\nFuck this I\u2019m so done. Why should it take email after email and five weeks just to get a simple thing done? It was always bad, but during the rona it\u2019s even fucking worse. I pay so much in tuition and what do you have to show for it? Shitty ass departments that don\u2019t know how to do their jobs.
