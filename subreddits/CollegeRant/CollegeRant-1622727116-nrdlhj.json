They do next to nothing in the way of instruction, won't answer emails if it'd require them to do something (even as simple as looking up my grade. I'd love to look it up myself but they've set it so you cannot see it), and I am literally just reading a textbook and posting about it in the discussion forums. The only thing I have found they do more of is assign work. One of my professors, who insists on everyone calling him \"Dr.\", wants a 10 page paper written on HIS book. Not only is that bullshit that you make your class buy your own book, but the book fucking sucked and is only 100 pages long. So while it was a short read, it wasn't necessarily easy because the entire thing is a transcription of an interview with someone who doesn't speak English well. Oh yeah, and their standards are higher AND less clear than those of instructors. This same guy with the shitty book wants the paper written in APA format. No big deal, right? All of my papers have been in APA. He even refers to owl.purdue if we have any questions. So after I posted my cover page, abstract, and reference page like he wanted, he joyously listed several things I had done incorrectly. He is using an outdated version of APA without specifying that. I swear to god they are trying to set you up for failure. They want you to do the work incorrectly so that they can tell you what you've done wrong, instead of either giving clear instructions to begin with OR just answering the fucking emails you send asking for clarification.\n\nIt's funny to me that the highest level of educator is the one who does anything but make college feel like something I want to do.", "author": "ZacKaffeine", "created": 1622727116, "retrieved": 1632842280, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"h0fr1sn": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nrdlhj/has_anyone_else_found_that_instructors_are_better/h0fr1sn/", "text": "Thank you u/ZacKaffeine for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
