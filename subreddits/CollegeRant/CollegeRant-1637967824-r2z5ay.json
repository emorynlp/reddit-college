  "text": "One of my professors is teaching us content that is not a part of the curriculum of the course. A former student who took the same course also commented about it and wondered why he's doing it.\n\nHow is this allowed? Is this a valid reason to report?",

But, if he starts teaching algebra in your chem or even higher level chem topics to an unreasonable degree then you could go to the department head. ***Feel free to switch out chemistry with whatever course you are talking about, I just used it as an example***",
