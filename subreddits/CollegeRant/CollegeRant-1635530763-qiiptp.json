  "text": "And I'm certainly not doing well enough in the rest of the class to pull that up. \n\nDropped one class to focus on this one because I thought I had a better chance of passing it, but nope.\n\nNow I'm down to: dropped one major class, definitely getting a D in the other (if I'm lucky), and the jury's still out on whether or not I'll pass my GUR class. \n\nAll of this on the first quarter that my mom decided to pay for my college too, I really feel embarrassed and like I failed her. \n\nThis first quarter back has been so hard: I got covid on literally the first day of classes and had to miss 2 weeks because of that, then because of having covid I had to stop treatment for my disability which caused me to miss a bunch of class while my body staged a mutiny. \n\nAll in all I'm halfway through the quarter and I'd day I've done a little bit more than half of the work I've been assigned.\n\nNow I have to pull myself together, sew together a quick costume, and go work all of halloweekend and not even celebrate my favorite holiday. \n\nCould really use some encouraging words from people who failed important classes and bounced back",

If you got the grades you have due to partying too much then yeah your mom should be disappointed in that case but thats not the case. Can you still withdraw from everything? Take a break. Retake the classes when things are better",

It's ultimately not my fault that this is just how things have gone this quarter",
