I know I sound whiny and overdramatic, but I feel like I'm never going to have friends or a relationship again. It's pessimistic and I'm trying to enjoy the alone time at home, but I miss having people my age around so much.\n\nFor those in a similar situation, how are you?

Personally my friends up until the end of high school were the type to just come and go, so I became accustomed to not really having anyone to hang out with back then. \n\nAfter that, to try to move on from my past, I chose a college where virtually no one from my high school attends, but now I\u2019m starting to wonder if it really was a good decision at all because my current classmates seem reserved and quiet for the most part. Also, since at least half of them come from the same high school, it makes me feel all the more left out since most of them only interact with their peers from last year. We\u2019re in group chats together and I try to socialize as much as I can, but they don\u2019t return that to me and leave my messages on read. I keep asking myself if I\u2019m forcing myself too much or if they really are that rude (yes, I take that personally...)\n\nSorry for dumping all this on you, but clearly we\u2019re all struggling during this pandemic, especially those who have always been socially awkward (lol).
