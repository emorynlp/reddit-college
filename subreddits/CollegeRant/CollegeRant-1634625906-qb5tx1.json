I sometimes take 3x longer than I should for a low weighted grade. \n\nI was told it comes with practice and discipline. It sound like you maybe burned out or stressed. If that is the case bug your dogs and maybe talk to someone. \n\nGood Luck on your studies!",

      "text": "Good news! You can change your habits, today. If you dont already, keep an agenda, app, whatever and when you get a syllabus put all due dates in it. As more assignments and due days pop up, put them in as soon as youre aware of them. Look at whats due this week and next - if something is due tomorrow or the next day do that first. Once you have some buffer between when the next thing is due, do the easiest/least time consuming task first. Youll feel more confident when you check that off your list. For long assignments break it down into as many parts as possible; if you need to, put dumb shit like \"save document\" on there so you get some serotonin crossing it off. Lile for a lab report I will put each of the sections as its own task.",
