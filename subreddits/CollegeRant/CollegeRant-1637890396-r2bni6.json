Instead, I'm laying bed at 6pm trying not to puke.\n\n Why?\n\nBecause at this very important time of the year, my dumbass body decided to catch not one, but TWO completely random and extremely painful infections in three weeks. And of course, because life isn't supposed to be easy, the pain meds I got are giving me terrible nausea that I can't even focus on my assignments.\n\nWhat the fuck man I'm so done.",

This would be me leaving my first job post grad. \n\nSo I am cleaning up loose ends and finding that other people moved on. So I am like stunted in areas. I am still finishing up other cavities and needed to start over with dental in 2021. Stuff that was frozen in 2020.\n\nAcademically I am back in post bac at community college to start over with my life.\n\n But the sinus issue fed into other issues and I am still cleaning up the messes. It\u2019s reality, I need to find other friends, and move on from that chapter. But it\u2019s really hard moving past it",

My body decided it had had enough last week and I got terrible reflux for a week so that I could barely breathe and couldn't meet almost any deadline. Fortunately, my professors were understanding and I had good grades that allowed me to take the hit but sometimes anxiety can get us very sick if we don't control it well enough. Shit happens, just make sure to not stay on the floor for too long.",

Also, most symptoms went away after a few days once my stress levels went down, so I'm pretty sure its that. That said, I wish I knew how to treat this, I'm better now, but still. Besides living a less stressful life and exercising (which I don't do nearly as often as I should), there's not much I know of that can be done to alleviate these symptoms.",

If I eat all greasy, fast food (which I love) acid is high though the roof. Avoid fatty fried foods and acidic foods like tomato,  onion,  chocolate. Anything acidic.including alcohol. ALSO , you need to know what your failsafe are..nexium, famotidine,  these are antacids thats prevent acid before hand",

For now, it seems that the my #1 priority should be to fix my diet and avoid situations where I am forced to pull all nighters (ironic, I am writing this at 4:45 am though fortunately I don't have to study today). So, if I get some school life balance, I think everything will improve considerably, even if I still can't eat whatever I feel like.",
