Basically the program got cut off significantly. There were very rarely any lectures in online setting. Our group's personal seminars got cut off and we had to participate in online seminars with 30+ people online trying to discuss cases and theory and somewhat get ready for my exams. All of this was is still part of our current program in uni because there is a very big demand for law degrees and my country's judiciary system does not need. In a few words the quality of education is very low indeed and most of our university's program are trying to evade laws concering this problem to get profit bcuz of high demand.\n\nSo long story short, we were forced to do seminars with huge groups because teachers didn't want to do them individually with every group because Ig they had no time or sth like that in online setting. At the end of the year our country eased COVID epidemic measures and mostly everywhere there were bars, schools, clubs, restaurants, mostly everything was working.\n\nSo concerming the topic of this reddit post, we had this mandatory student practice, state required that we all had to undergo and there was an ordinance which read that mantatory practice was to be attended at the end of college year, at the end of May. It was supposed to take place in the Distict Court where my university is situated at.\n\nWe went to this so called practice and there were 2 college mentors who basically collected our documents that we had to acquire to get accepted to practice and basically stamped them and the practice was over and they let us go or as they said 'you can attend court hearings whenever you please'. When I say this I mean what we witnessed there in court was nothing compared to how the program was supposed to be executed from university, that university agreed to and let us know through email to prepare.\n\nSo aftermath of all this, the 2 mentors gave us an assignment to write about the experience of the so-called practice and we had to analyze 2 court decisions of choice, basically downloaded from the internet with no real practice or even attending court hearings of these cases. In my slight anger, first I wanted to write as a conclusion that the practice didn't meet the requirements and our expectations but then I thought that might be harsh because the 2 mentors notified us these things were supposed to \"certify\" the practice attended. So I didn't do it at last but.... and here comes my real question.....\n\nDo you think it was a bad idea if I sent an email to one of my assistant professors that I and a lot of my colleagues were dissatisfied with this so-called practice? Keep in mind this is supposed to be the first time we attend court hearing as part of uni program and so on. Basically I told him it's become a really huge problem in my country that universities don't put enough effort into these programs even though it is state required to acquire a degree in Law and subsequently we are the ones suffering and not meeting the bare minimum our state law's required us to achieve a Law degree in university. And basically bring to light a lot of the problems we got with this kind of uni program here and so on it's not of that much importance.\n\nSo to clarify, I've never given a 'complaint-like' per se, email before and I truly hope he didn't see it as a that because I didn't mean it to be like that. But nevertheless I felt needed to say that we were dissatisfied with what service we got at the end cuz giving chances to meet the setting where you plan to build and develop your career as a post-graduate jurist I feel like are important, at least for me and most of my colleagues.\n\nThere is also a big decline in Judiciary here in my country and millions of allegations have emerged to the surface about corruption of judges, influence trade.\n\nSo in conclusion, I truly hope I was not overly political in my email, but do you think I did the right thing? As attending in this same university I feel like I am supposed to give feedback on services they provide, especially when knowledge and education is in the matter and discuss problems facing education in my country? Also can I get expelled from university if this thing escalates into something I don't want it to be, like a court case or something like that? I am overly paranoid about this 1 day after I sent it, this same assistant professor i'm supposed to attend lectures and seminars next year. Is my grade going to hurt? Like I really don't know at this point.\n\nThanks for your time and sorry for my bad English, it's not my 1st language <3", "author": "epicpenguin911", "created": 1623982667, "retrieved": 1632949685, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
