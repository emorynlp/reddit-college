  "text": "And nobody in my life seems to get it. They think because I\u2019m doing so much already that they can just constantly pile more onto me because I\u2019m so \u201cresponsible\u201d. No, I\u2019m fucking breaking mentally. LEAVE ME ALONE. I can\u2019t pick up any extra shifts. I can\u2019t talk. I can\u2019t do fucking anything but work and school. My mental and physical health is coming dead last at this point because I have to finish, and then I have to risk my health working around hundreds of people everyday because I work at a grocery store as an essential worker where customers treat me like absolute garbage because we make them wear masks so more people don\u2019t goddamn die.",

I have no idea how you can take 7 classes, I\u2019m struggling with the few classes I\u2019m taking. Sometimes I just say F it and rest even if my grades stuffer some, it\u2019s not worth killing my self over. Is it possible for you to take a day for vacation time?",

People I love ask me to do things with them and make plans and want to ask how I am and I just want to scream that I am falling apart.  I barely sleep because I am so anxious about all the things I have to do at all times.\n\nAnd I am always worried about money.  Constantly.  Trying to do whatever random side gigs I can find to make extra, and being as frugal as possible to minimize spending.\n\nI'm sorry you're struggling.  You're not alone.\n\nAt least you're a senior!  Home stretch, right?",
