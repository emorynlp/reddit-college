  "text": "I\u2019m crying in my room for the second night in a row because I\u2019ve been so. so fucking lonely lately. I know I\u2019m certainly not the first or last person to complain about this but I just want someone to hear me. I\u2019m definitely an introvert but spending almost every weekend alone in my room is just fucking painful. I wanna go home. thx",

I hope you find comfort that you are not alone. I feel really bad for anyone else feeling this lonely everytime I see a post about it.",
