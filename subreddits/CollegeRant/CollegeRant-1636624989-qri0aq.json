  "text": "I\u2019m on academic probation because online covid learning was not my cup of tea. i couldn\u2019t do it at all and ended up failing and dropping out of all my courses that semester. i\u2019ve been trying really hard this semester and yet i\u2019m still failing one course and no matter how much work i turn in and do i feel like it\u2019s not benefiting me at all and i\u2019m stuck at a really poor grade. i cannot afford to fail and lose my financial aide i don\u2019t know what to do i\u2019m feeling so hopeless .",
