  "text": "I\u2019m on academic probation because online covid learning was not my cup of tea. i couldn\u2019t do it at all and ended up failing and dropping out of all my courses that semester. i\u2019ve been trying really hard this semester and yet i\u2019m still failing one course and no matter how much work i turn in and do i feel like it\u2019s not benefiting me at all and i\u2019m stuck at a really poor grade. i cannot afford to fail and lose my financial aide i don\u2019t know what to do i\u2019m feeling so hopeless .",

      "text": "If you can still withdraw from the class youre failing you should absolutely do so. But if you do end up failing out, try to see it as a blessing. Hear me out. I dont know what your story is but when I failed out school I was dealing with some personal issues. If I somehow hadnt been kicked out, I wouldnt have been doing my best and my issues would have spiraled further. Being out of school gave me time to work on my issues. After a few years off I went to community college, graduated with a 4.0, and am now back at the college I started at. So, if you do end up failing out, it isnt over. It doesnt have to be. Also, dont make the mistake I made - if youve been out of school for 6 months and you have to start repaying your loans, *do so*. If you fail out and come back at some point, keep in mind that you will start out at the same GPA you left with, and will be on academic probation for that first semester. But, its highly likely you wont be able to get loans that first semester back because your GPA has to be above that threshhold. So plan for that. Good luck!\n\nAlso have you tried tutoring? Going to office hours?",
