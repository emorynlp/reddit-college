I empathize with some of the comments down below, and have had some similar experiences. I just want to encourage everyone to hang in there and be kind to other students (and people in general). It's okay to be sad, it's okay to cry, make some good friends and be a good friend so that you can all support each other.*\n\nHi all, I'm sure that the people in this sub are well aware that college can be hard and can be the cause of many tears, both in ourselves and in our peers. I'm no stranger to having a crying session in college, and it's possible that you and your friends aren't either. I'm curious to know how many people have experienced crying (either cried themselves or seen others cry) in a university context (in class, just on campus, on student accommodation, in a club/society setting, etc) and interactions surrounding a tearful episode at college. I've created this short, anonymous survey on the topic for anyone interested: [https://forms.gle/6qLZUMepzh1tgbUZA](https://forms.gle/6qLZUMepzh1tgbUZA), but even if you don't do the survey, please share your thoughts on crying in a college setting below. Have you cried at college? What made you cry? Who saw you cry? Have you seen others cry? How did you respond? Survey responses and general discussion on the topic below are welcome. Thanks in advance. Hope you don't have too much to cry about and a lot to smile about! :)\n\n**TL;DR!** If you've cried/seen others cry in college, share your experience and if possible do my short, anonymous surveys: [https://forms.gle/6qLZUMepzh1tgbUZA](https://forms.gle/6qLZUMepzh1tgbUZA) &  [https://forms.gle/VeReRGc5VwzF98Wd9](https://forms.gle/VeReRGc5VwzF98Wd9)  Thanks!", "author": "jessm73", "created": 1610693568, "retrieved": 1632843041, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gjdu5zw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kxp5ng/crying_in_college/gjdu5zw/", "text": "I have some mental health issues that are lifelong and at times really hard to keep under control, as well as some family issues that got really overwhelming so I\u2019ve cried a fair amount in class and just on campus in general.

I\u2019ve been fortunate to have good professors that have been supportive and understanding, some of which even kept me after class to talk. It\u2019s always greatly appreciate by me and I\u2019ll never be able to pay them back for basically talking me off the ledge.

I am not a rich person and I'm paying for all of my studies on my own. I'm also in the US so it can get extremely expensive. Despite weighing all of my options, going for all of the scholarships, and fleshing out my resume to get the best opportunities possible I still have debts to pay and am taking out loans to stay in class.\n\nFreshman year was certainly the hardest as I was figuring everything out on the finances side for the very first time. I filed taxes and handled my own budget and bills. There was a lot of trial and error.\n\nAbout halfway through the first semester my car broke down on the interstate with a pretty substantial flat. I had to pay for a tow truck, repairs, and two new front tires. When I found out the total cost of everything I think I probably cried for a good hour or two just from built up financial stress.", "author": "passivedemonic", "created": 1610736726, "upvotes": 3}, "gjcftge": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kxp5ng/crying_in_college/gjcftge/", "text": "I cried a lot during my first two years at uni, especially when it was almost the Exam Day and I still could not grasp the material well enough. But there was also this one time where I cried after my first day in Micro Bio lab. I felt so overwhelmed and the TA was so strict. My eyes were teary during lab, but I didnt cry then. I cried after I went home so  no one can see me lol. I also saw one of my friends cry during our first semester of pharmacy school. He was so overwhelmed by the coursework. He hated the fact that he had to give up his social life. He failed almost all of the exams we had. He couldnt balance the time and he also didnt know how to study the material.  He doesnt want to continue anymore but did not want to give up for coming this far. I encouraged him that it was okay to start over. I knew he hated pharmacy, and i told him its not worth pursuing something if its not what he wants and if its not what makes him happy. After a few weeks, he dropped out and went to nursing school.", "author": "Illustrious-Row6461", "created": 1610720577, "upvotes": 4}, "gjcb5n7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kxp5ng/crying_in_college/gjcb5n7/", "text": "So I was having a ton if trouble with chemistry. It was the lowest level and I was still doing terrible. I had talked to my mom and she said I couldn't drop it. It would look awful on my transcript for vet school. I needed to do well. I had just done terrible on an exam and my mom called. Once she found out how I did, she sat and chewed me out till I was in tears.  She pointed out every fear i had about how i wasn't going to make it if i couldn't get a basic chemistry class. When I she finally quit and hung up, I lost it. I started sobbing and couldn't stop. I hate crying in front of people and my roommate was there. She knows how I dont like people seeing me cry, so she started singing everything is going to be all right.

The other times, which were plenty, were based on emotional lack of well being because of how much a I sacrificed socially to just barely pass my classes. It wasn\u2019t worth it to me to ignore people I loved and who loved me just so I could do the minimal standard for class. I transferred and still cry but it is because it\u2019s that stressful time of the semester: the beginning pressure, midterm, and finals. And there are more happy cries too: getting good grades and feeling that class is paying off despite the challenges.\n\nStill, there is the second semester of college finals season that sticks with me: Spring 2016. I had a 20 page paper due and was at the library scouring the depths when I started crying because of all the books I had to read that night just to write the stupid paper. I was holding a pile of books with my eyes fogging up my glasses on my way to my corner on the floor when I noticed someone sitting at a hidden table in the library. He was crying over his workspace and just looked at me staring at him through my fogged glasses and blotched face. We had a moment and then I just sat with him and we cried together. We didn\u2019t say much until after we had the crying session and he just said, \u201cI don\u2019t get why this is the norm\u201d.  I didn\u2019t really say anything but the next year at school they made a crying room in the library. To be fair I couldn\u2019t relate to him because I signed up for the 4400 class as a freshman and no one told me not to. However, the STEM professors prided themselves in failing at least half their classes to Cut out the weak ones.
