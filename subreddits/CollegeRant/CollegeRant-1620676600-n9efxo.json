If your averages are that low the instructor is either not properly assessing your students properly or sucks as an instructor or most of the students in the course are lazy. From my experience in those courses (as someone who did well was labeled the \"curve wrecker\" even by instructors) the problem was sometimes improper assessments, but more often the instructor just sucked. It is rare that the majority of the students are just lazy. Off the top of my head I can think of 2 courses with the same instructor where the majority of the students were just lazy because I got over a 95% in both by putting in minimal effort even though the course average was below a 70%.", "author": "squirrel8296", "created": 1620694292, "upvotes": 5}, "gxo0vu7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/n9efxo/having_a_50_test_average_is_not_a_good_thing/gxo0vu7/", "text": "I just took thermo and first two midterm averages were 49% and 56%.
