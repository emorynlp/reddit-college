  "text": "I had a bio 329 (cellular and molecular bio) professor that would discuss our test average after each test, the vast majority being in the 45-50%, and he acted like it was perfectly fine. The tests counted towards the majority of our grade and not once did we get above a 60%. Having a below 60% average is not good, and it\u2019s not the student\u2019s fault if everyone fails.",

      "text": "Colleges need to look at course average and exam averages when evaluating instructors. If your averages are that low the instructor is either not properly assessing your students properly or sucks as an instructor or most of the students in the course are lazy. From my experience in those courses (as someone who did well was labeled the \"curve wrecker\" even by instructors) the problem was sometimes improper assessments, but more often the instructor just sucked. It is rare that the majority of the students are just lazy. Off the top of my head I can think of 2 courses with the same instructor where the majority of the students were just lazy because I got over a 95% in both by putting in minimal effort even though the course average was below a 70%.",

This midterm... I genuinely thought if i failed, thats it, doesnt matter how hard i try, that class was ass.\n\nIdk, prof ended up curving the class pretty hard.

If they're teaching a topic which is at all difficult, even the best teacher in the world will still have some failures, due to limits on their student's grasp of prerequisite knowledge, time constraints, willingness to devote effort to learning the material, and of course just average mental acuity. \n\nPoor performance may be a perfectly normal thing, because the average student may not be capable of mastering the material to the prof's satisfaction. \n\nAnd sure, they could make the assessments easier, but that doesn't solve the problem, it just hides it.",
