  "text": "So im studying a psych degree atm and had planned on doing clinical psych but now i dont think i want to do it anymore. I realised that clinical psych is too competitive and i just dont enjoy the content anymore. its not interesting to me. I realised that i might want to go into counselling or social work since its more practical and less sciencey/research based. \n\nI have realised that the only reason why we all go to uni/college is to get a degree to make money to live. However, I think that there are other ways to make money not just through a job eg. freelance, online, business. I think that it has sparked my interest in business and entrepreneurship or even freelance. I like the idea of working for myself but i also want to stability of a job. \n\nI just think that the conventional way of making money i.e job is not the only way and that there are always alternatives/ options. \n\nI dont regret picking psych but if i had known what it actually involved, i would have reconsidered it. cause now i dont really find my subjects to be super interesting, in fact my interest for uni has almost been lost. Imn ot really interested in uni and wished that i had taken a gap year after finishing high school.  In fact I just want the time to work on other things that Im keen and actually interested about. I kinda see college/uni more as a hinderance to what i want rather than an assest. But i know that you need a degree cause it looks good to employers. I just hate the fact that we all need a piece of paper to get a job. I hate that employers look at the degree rather than real world expereince.",

Psychology can definitely help you in business as it's important to understand how people consume materials, products and services. You can definitely go in that direction with some business courses, books and materials if you really want to!",

I\u2019m not strongly religious but I like the subject very much. Recently was informed that the two subjects go well together so I may look into that. \n\nHaving a degree in psychology is not bad at all, you can always minor in something else or continue your education in another field after obtaining your psych degree. Keep looking too, for a job in the psych field, there are actually a few that you could benefit from. Even jobs you aren\u2019t fully interested in can give you a lot of experience to take to the next job.",

You can do social work, studies and research, school counseling, Human Resources, marketing, etc. Look up what you can do with a psychology degree and see if anything interests you!\n\nIf not, don\u2019t feel guilty about a major change. I started in business management and got two semesters in before I realized I didn\u2019t want to do that, and I switched to psych. My boyfriend was in engineering and actually failed out, switched to marketing and got deans list and graduated with an amazing job that he loves. It\u2019s super common to change your mind so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re alone! Better to do what makes you happy of course.",
