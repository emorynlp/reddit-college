  "text": "I have a cute planner with cute stickers. Even on the hardest of exams I put a cute sticker on my planner and write with pretty handwriting \u201cEXAM\u201d.\n\nI plan to study at least three days before the exam date, I plan for all my homework assignments, projects, meetings, classes. Whatever I need to do \n\nSo I woke up in the afternoon today (I don\u2019t know why, I genuinely slept through my alarms like wtf). And I was still not worried because class was cancelled today. I don\u2019t have much to do but in the next few weeks my work is gonna double. But the thing is, I can\u2019t do anything about those lab reports and projects. Because I haven\u2019t had those labs and project meetings. I wonder if this is what limbo feels like. It feels like a paradox to relax but that\u2019s literally all I should do. Well no I could study a bit more but that won\u2019t take my whole day up you know?\n\nIt\u2019s just whiplash, and soooo inconsistent. Or maybe I made myself this free time with my planning? Because everyone else looks so much more tired than me. I don\u2019t know. College is weird.",
