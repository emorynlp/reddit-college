It was already an accelerated course because it was over winter break. We had at LEAST one assignment due every day that took no less than two hours. So you can imagine my sadness when the third day of class we had 3 assignments AND a quiz due. Then a quiz two days later on top of that. Hell. We had an assignment due the first day of class! Every week we had a quiz Friday and a test that Sunday, then he changed the due times to the middle of the freakin day and didn't see a problem with it. I get that it's accelerated but most professors condense their course for that. A kid in the class had him for a different class before and he said that even during full semesters he still gave out a lot of work", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1612530852, "upvotes": 4}, "gm3ro2k": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lcr3hv/to_all_the_professors_who_give_out_assignments/gm3ro2k/", "text": "I have 4 classes this semester.
