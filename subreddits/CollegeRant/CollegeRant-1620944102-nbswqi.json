  "text": "At this point, it seems like college is not going how it was supposed to. I have to take summer courses in order to catch up on my classes, but this is not what I am complaining about. The fact that I could have gotten college credits earlier makes me feel hopeless. I have taken AP and IB courses in high school, yet only ended up getting a credit for one course. If I had gone to another college, then I would at least have enough credits, but going to a university that is not close was obviously not possible for many reasons. \n\nAt this point, I would not have to be so worried about finishing my degree and would already move on with my life. Getting employment is certainly not possible for me, which is why I needed to finish my degree earlier. It just takes too much time and I need to move on already. It feels like school is the only thing I can do as of right now.",

      "text": "I\u2019m 37 and I\u2019ll have finished a year of college courses once this term is over. I really wish that I had buckled down and gotten my degree back when I first went to college, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be in the right mindset if I didn\u2019t traverse the path I took.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if it takes longer than expected. The important thing is to continue working hard to achieve your goal (no matter how long it takes) - to experience, to persist, to grow, to inspire. You are doing well, but you also have remember to enjoy the journey.",

      "text": "College is different for everyone. I entered college with Sophomore credit status but I also need to take summer courses in order to graduate on time. My boyfriend is taking 5 years to graduate and his brother has taken 6 (he also switched majors about 3 times). I also have a classmate who\u2019s 39 that\u2019s finally graduating after dropping out during his last semester in his 20s. Just do what you need to do to stay healthy and get your degree :)",
