I know it\u2019s easier to specifically ask someone a question in a zoom room than to ask the general audience and wait like a whole 2 min for an answer but I get so anxious about them and choke. I would say I get even more anxious about being randomly called on in class than the exams! It\u2019s like a mini heart attack every MTW. Also, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand the material either, I\u2019ve been acing each exam. Each time I\u2019m called on though and give the wrong answer I feel so damn embarrassed I just wanna sink into the depths of my chair. Today was the last lecture for the summer course though, so I\u2019m glad that part is over.
