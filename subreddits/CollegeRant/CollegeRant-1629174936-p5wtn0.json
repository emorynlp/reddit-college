I found a decent text - decent, not great - for one class that was $140 so I switched. The book wasn't very popular. It's hard for a new name to get a foothold in some disciplines and this book didn't succeed. It went out of print and we couldn't even find enough used copies for my classes.\n\nMy options were to return to crazy expensive books or create sufficient materials to go without a text. I created materials for some of my classes, but I couldn't do it for all of them.\n\nI looked into ebook/homework combinations and found one for $120. My students don't usually read through the text, they just use it as a resource so an ebook should be sufficient. It's still more than I'd like my students to spend, but it's far cheaper than a physical text.\n\nI can see how it feels like they're being charged to access homework problems, but for me, it was best option I had for them to get a decent book at a somewhat reasonable price.\n\nWith some publishers, the single fee provides access to ***all*** of the publisher's books. If you can get enough teachers to agree on textbooks from a single publisher, then it would be even cheaper for the students. Unfortunately, faculty are fiercely independent about their textbook choices and it's nearly impossible to get them to agree on a single publisher.", "author": "WisconsinBikeRider", "created": 1629289688, "upvotes": 3}, "h9eh4x2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p5wtn0/stop_making_me_pay_to_access_homework/h9eh4x2/", "text": "This post is reading my mind", "author": "Sharkattack970", "created": 1629289626, "upvotes": 1}, "h9eag5l": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p5wtn0/stop_making_me_pay_to_access_homework/h9eag5l/", "text": "When ever I see one of those Pearson things, I email the teacher and ask them if I really need it.  id say 7/10 times, they will say I do not need to buy it.
