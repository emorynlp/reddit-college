  "title:": "Feeling lost",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my second year of university but I feel so lost and disorganized compared to my peers. All my friends have a good idea where they\u2019re going and I can\u2019t help but feel a little lost about everything. I have tried to get a part time job but due to my social anxiety, it\u2019s been hard so far. All my friends are working too and I can\u2019t help but feel a little lesser than them. My family situation isn\u2019t good either and it\u2019s negatively affecting my mental health, but the situation is out of my control. I dont know if I have the passion I once had for my major at all. I just feel empty and lost all the time",
