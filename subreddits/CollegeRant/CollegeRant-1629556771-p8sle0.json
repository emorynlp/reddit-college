I had one online class and one in person. After seeing what it is like I don't think ill be able to even make it through a semester. The amount of work I already have is stressing me out and Ive only started 2 of my classes (my other 3 start next week). I feel like I would rather just get a job instead but I don't know what my family would think of me. My mom really wants me to go to college and I honestly feel like I am just going so my family doesn't stress out or think I am lazy or something. And I know that so many people don't even get an opportunity to go to college so I feel kinda shitty. but is it really worth all of the anxiety, stress, and depression? just to get a higher paying job. thanks for reading I really just needed to get this off my chest", "author": "Colton_Cortese", "created": 1629556771, "retrieved": 1632841588, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h9skiic": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p8sle0/first_day_of_college_was_yesterday_and_my_anxiety/h9skiic/", "text": "Thank you u/Colton_Cortese for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CC still gave me the college experience I needed and I\u2019m thankful for that in which I saved a lot of money. Good choice of attending community college because you would\u2019ve been lost in a university which is worse especially when you paid to study there. I don\u2019t like the first weeks of school either. In 2 days, I\u2019m about to start my first semester at a university since I transferred, so I\u2019m going to have some real emotions about that. My advice to you is to just give the weeks a try because you\u2019ll get use to it eventually. If you think a class is not for you, drop it immediately so you can get a refund. As for the job, take some time to think about that. There might be opportunities in your community college that hire students for work study. I was a student worker on campus in which I learned a lot in participating and manage my time through academic work. If this is your first year of college, welcome to the college life. Let me know if you need more help. Good Luck! I feel your pain because I went through those same reactions.

The first two weeks of college are going to feel like that wall of fists that punches you while you try to get across (\"Sucker Punch\"). Hopefully, you're also excited to be running the race, though, which will keep you motivated to get past the wall. If so, you'll feel a lot more comfortable two-three weeks from now. If you're not psyched to be in college at all and your financial aid situation allows it, I'd recommend you stick with the two courses you started, drop the other three, and get a job for 20-30 hours/week. One big advantage to CC is that it's normal and really easy to go part-time.
