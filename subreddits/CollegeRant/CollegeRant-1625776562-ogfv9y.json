In a month, I'll be starting sophomore year. One of the most important actions I had to take was finding something to fulfill a fall semester practicum. Being a Sport Management major, I decided to revisit an idea I had last year: working for the college's basketball team.\n\nThis time around I got a response and it's likely I dedicate my time towards being one of the team's student managers! This is a year-round duty too and I'm excited for it! I may stick around for the next few years if I really enjoy it and may be able to travel with the team!\n\nI don't have a normal job either so I'd focus on that and schoolwork when I can. I'll be on campus every weekday with plenty of downtime so it works in my favor!", "author": "SportsMajor", "created": 1625776562, "retrieved": 1632949581, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 18, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h4j2yfd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ogfv9y/i_finally_may_have_gotten_my_first_major/h4j2yfd/", "text": "Congrats!", "author": "Redd_was_here", "created": 1625785625, "upvotes": 3}}}
