  "text": "I have many friends at school that I hang out with and talk to. My one friend and I sit for hours and just talk and all that. It's a great friendship, and I'm very thankful for her. I have friends in my major that I hang out with, go to clubs with, and do homework together. I have a handful of other friends that I get to hang out with about once a week or so. Yet somehow, I still feel lonely at times. Not all of the time of course, but sometimes it just hits me so hard that I have a hard time hanging out with anyone. I don't miss home or anything about home other than my family, so I'm not homesick. I'm trying to stay at school every weekend, but it's hard since I feel alone on the weekends mote than weekdays. I don't know if there's something I should be doing to help myself or what.",
