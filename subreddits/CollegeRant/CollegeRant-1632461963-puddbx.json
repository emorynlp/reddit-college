My one friend and I sit for hours and just talk and all that. It's a great friendship, and I'm very thankful for her. I have friends in my major that I hang out with, go to clubs with, and do homework together. I have a handful of other friends that I get to hang out with about once a week or so. Yet somehow, I still feel lonely at times. Not all of the time of course, but sometimes it just hits me so hard that I have a hard time hanging out with anyone. I don't miss home or anything about home other than my family, so I'm not homesick. I'm trying to stay at school every weekend, but it's hard since I feel alone on the weekends mote than weekdays. I don't know if there's something I should be doing to help myself or what.", "author": "seekthegiant", "created": 1632461963, "retrieved": 1632840986, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "comments": {"he24mf8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/puddbx/why_do_i_feel_so_alone_even_when_i_have_friends/he24mf8/", "text": "Thank you u/seekthegiant for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
