  "text": "Seriously though, why do they suck as a whole?\n\nI'm in a sorority and I'm forced to interact with the frats. I know I may not be considered \"attractive\" by their standards but they treat me and my sisters like shit. \n\nI feel invisible around them. They'll talk to all my friends and I won't even get a hi or an introduction. Half of the time I don't even get a glance in my direction, I'm never even acknowledged\n\nEven the girls that they do like they treat like shit. They'll use them, ignore them, I've seen many walk away in the middle of a conversation.\n\nIt just sucks constantly being treated as if I don't exist and see my friends being treated badly",

Several times I\u2019ve been going through campus at night, and see so many girls walking home alone from parties crying because of something that happened or their supposed \u201csisters\u201d abandoning them. I hate generalizing but you\u2019re just not gonna find many good people at those things",

          "text": "Depends on the campus. Where I'm at the Greek orgs actually do what they were intended to-they fundraise, they create events on campus, they do community service, the parties they throw are staffed with sobers and DDs to keep attendees safe. There was one incident at a frat's party like 12 years ago and they still haven't lived it down because the other Greeks are all so careful and actually give a shit. \n\nThe problem with a lot of fraternities nowadays is they lost that purpose of being a social club and a positive presence on the campus, and became one of the few bastions of shitty, toxic, \"good old boy\" behavior and protection that send adults of into the world thinking it's okay to be a toxic asshole all the time. They get away with it cause many of them have deep, historic roots and VERY deep alumni pockets that the school doesn't want to lose in scandals that also damage the school's reputation. \n\nDoesn't help that the media vultures are so ready to report on another \"social epidemic\" either. All you hear about are assaults and deaths because \"local chapter raises 10 grand for ALS research\" doesn't sell headlines. \"Local fraternity throws campus-wide tournament\" doesn't get eyeballs glued to your screen like \"sexual assault at Three-Letter-Org house at Blank U\". So all you get is this negative feedback loop that just encourages the cycle of protection for shitty behavior. \n\nPlus, when they do want to do something right nobody wants to help. I donate a dollar or two every time I see a table set up, I join in the charity functions and campus events, because THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR. But even when they try to do something positive people bitch and moan about them trying to fundraise and run service events and actually leave the world better than they found it. The Venn Diagram of people who wonder what the purpose of a Greek organization is and the people who complain about the fundraising and the events they throw is a circle, and it's bullshit. You want to encourage better organizations, reward the good behaviors they exhibit. \n\nThis all pisses me off because I see how great it can be when Greek is done right, and I truly believe fraternities CAN be a positive presence. Unfortunately nobody seems interested in getting them there.",

      "text": "maybe it's because they wanna sleep with each other instead <3  \n\n\nbut fr it's because they think they are using advanced tactics of neglect to attain pussy. (but really the women are aware of their fuckboy nature and women use advanced mental gymnastics to evade this awareness to self-destructively engage with the emotional absence either to replicate the disappointment of previous relationships that they've become accustomed to or to gamify the dynamic as a \"if I can make him change, (or if I can constantly earn his conditional affection) then I'm a successful girl/girlfriend and I win\")   \n\n\nbut yeah the frat boys think they're hot shit because they are in an echo-chamber of cockiness and their personalities are usually pretty similar between each brother, so they don't have a broader frame of reference or any context for who they are in relation to anyone outside their circle. Women are typically better at understanding a context because we are socialized to have awareness about how we come across to everyone. Guys are typically socialized by being rewarded for performance, not for image or for how they behave, so they think that performing well in sports, in sex, in drinking games, or whatever else justifies any bad behavior that women might interpret as deceptive or scummy. This is typical for most men, but frat guys are even more insulated because they are not interacting with people outside of their \"tribe\" as much, so they don't usually get perspectives that are different from their own.   \n\n\nHonestly, I'd say you can either bro down with them and get chummy with them as a friend/one of the guys or you can just vibe w your girls at mixers. I think it would be fun to just fake whisper and laugh while glancing over at them, make them feel watched and weird. but hey I'm a fucked up person sometimes, so up to you.   \n\n\nI think the best guys are very sociable, but had a good length loner phase bc they didn't really fuck with the system. They usually have an interesting perspective. They usually ran track or cross country and have a lot of siblings. Huge bonus if he has a lot of sisters.  \n\n\nThe best guys are found through friend IMO, so ask your guy and girl friends to let you know if they know anyone you might vibe with. That used to be such a common way to date and it just totally faded out of style.",
