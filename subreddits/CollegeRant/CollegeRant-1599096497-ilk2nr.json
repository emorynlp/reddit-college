Since I worked mainly  night shifts, my sleep cycle was thoroughly fucked and I literally slept all day instead of night. Like I couldn't fall asleep at night even if I tried. So...yeah when college started getting up in the morning for class when i went to sleep at 4am was hell, but at least I had a reason to enforce a normal schedule. (i actually finished work at like midnight, but my work always made me energetic instead of tired. Like *super* energetic. No way to sleep after that)\n\nAnd then Coronavirus came and I lost both my job and my classes. Stuck at home unable to go out, I thought at least I'll still have scheduled classes via Zoom and a reason to get up in the morning. I was wrong. No \"frontal\" college in my country has enough bandwidth to hold so many zoom sessions for their entire student population. In my case, all of my professors  dumped study material weekly into the site and we communicated through mail. The only good thing that came from that for me, beside not needing to drive, is that I can drink coffee in my room during my \"classes\" (When I actually got myself together and decided to study. Some of my classes in the college buildings were held in auditoriums with carpets and coffee and hot beverage is *banned* in these rooms)\n\nI'm glad your experience was better.
