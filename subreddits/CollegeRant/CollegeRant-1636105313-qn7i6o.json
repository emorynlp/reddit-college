This is also a hard one, but online classes since the exams are easier.\n5. Definitely college, even though it's hard sometimes.",

      "text": "1. Solo work. I can count on myself to get a good grade.\n2. Art projects. In my experience, They're not so much about technical skill as they're about meaning.\n3. Digital Planners. In the past I've always forgotten to look at physical planners.\n4. Multiple choice. Professors can grade multiple choice questions simply. For essays though, they can grade as subjectively as they want and not give good feedback.\n5. Online is much easier, but I haven't learned anything. I wanted to learn about my major and get involved at school, so I would say in person.\n6. My entire college experience so far has been online, so I can't really answer fairly. College being online has made it easier but high school was more fun.",
