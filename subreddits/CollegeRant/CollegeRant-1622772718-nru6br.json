  "text": "So I started my college career kinda weird. I took college classes in High school and got two B- and a C. After taking a year off from graduating I decided to take some classes and did awful. I received a C-, D and B. Granted only one of these classes had anything to do with my major. I'm currently sitting at a 2.18 with 12 credits. Currently I'm taking Pre calc, CS seminar, English and Psych. I'm wondering if there is still time to improve myself. I'm currently a C.S major who suffers from OCD and depression and sadly slipped into a depressive episode during the beginning of the year. Can't say I'm all the way better now but I'm working on it. I should pass all my current classes with a B or above God's willing and I'm wondering is saying I had depression a valid excuse to Colleges when I leave my two year or is too late. Thanks to whoever read all of this lol",

      "text": "It depends on which UC and how much you can raise your GPA by the time you graduate. Allegedly UCs don't even look at your freshmen GPA so I doubt it will be a deal breaker if you show strong improvement your next two years. Finally, even if you graduate with a 2.0 there's always the community college then transfer route. There's a program called TAP that makes it a lot easier. Good luck!",
