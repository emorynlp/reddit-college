Now, I have to figure out this fall if I\u2019m going to take up nursing or pharmacy. They\u2019re both hard but I don\u2019t know which weighs better and which one is worth it. Any advice?",

      "text": "Since you\u2019re a pharm tech you probably already know everything I\u2019m about to say. Pharmacy is over saturated right now so it would be harder to get a job. Also personally, I just don\u2019t like the way job works because it just seems like a bunch of paperwork ect. However, you can specialize within pharmacy and avoid the menial tasks of dealing with a corner store pharmacy job. You know more though. Nursing is also difficult but you get to be more hands-on and it\u2019s a job that will always be in-demand. I\u2019m not sure which would be better. Shadow some nurses this summer to find out what you really like since you\u2019ve already seen the pharmacy route!",
