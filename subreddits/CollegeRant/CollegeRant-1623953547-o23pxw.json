We met taking some CS classes years ago.\n\nDave is smart, a talented programmer, and a nice person. He spent ages 18-28 playing video games all day, then decided to get serious about finishing a bachelor's in CS. He has never lived independently or paid rent, and his only work experience was 6 months in a grocery store 10+ years ago. His parents make good money, so they live in a nice neighborhood, pay for his new car, and put money on his Starbucks card every week. Dave takes 1-2 classes per semester at the community college, and has been doing so for 7 years now.\n\nHe complained a lot about living at home, so one time I went to the IT manager of my then-employer, who said if Dave showed up to an interview in a shirt and pants, they would put him in an IT support role making $30/hour, they could do full or part time, and work around his school schedule.\n\nWhen I brought this up to Dave, he smirked and laughed like I had said something ridiculous, then he explained that it would be impossible for him to work and balance his heavy academic demands with any sort of employment.\n\nI am skeptical, but I am also not as technical as Dave. I deal with compliance and overall cybersecurity management, whereas Dave is taking classes in programming, circuits, and data structures.\n\nWould those of you who are more technical be kind enough to educate me? Is being a hardcore CS major so difficult that the option of juggling a job is out the window? I worked full time while I got my master's, and I went to school with people who worked their way through an undergrad program in CS, but Dave insists that working while he studies is simply not an option.

It depends how hard he needs to study or chooses to study, how many projects and extra work he does outside of classwork, and also it depends on his mental and physical health. Some people have more energy in a day, some have chronic pain, whether it be physical or psychological, and simply don't have the capacity to do as much as others. The fact that he has been pampered his whole life by doting parents makes me think he's probably just lazy and knows he doesn't need to work, so doesn't want to.
