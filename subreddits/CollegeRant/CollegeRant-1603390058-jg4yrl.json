Every second of the movie I\u2019m stressing and it feels so, so unhealthy. I deserve a 2 hour break but even taking a break feels stressful.

It\u2019s taken such a toll on my mental health because the constant stress makes me less productive, which creates more stress because everything takes longer. \n\nIf you get a chance, I recommend the Now Habit by Neil Fiore. It\u2019s not long, and it\u2019s one of the few productivity books I actually like because it\u2019s by a positive psychologist who focuses on making time for the things you want to do. I think it gives a lot of great advice about balancing self care and productivity. I don\u2019t want to add another thing into the overwhelming list of things you have on your mind, but this book really did help me. I think the tips in it are similar to the other comment that talks about making a schedule and taking breaks. It might help you put these things into practice. \n\nTake a deep breath. You are not your grades. Sometimes it\u2019s okay if things aren\u2019t perfect, or if you just skim the reading. It doesn\u2019t reflect on your intelligence. I think we need to remember to be kind to ourselves and weigh our mental health as an important factor in our decisions.
