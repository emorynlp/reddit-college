  "text": "After a long morning of doing assignments for my college, I wanted a break. But I have so many assignments to do and things to read and worry about that I literally can\u2019t put my mind at ease and enjoy a movie. Every second of the movie I\u2019m stressing and it feels so, so unhealthy. I deserve a 2 hour break but even taking a break feels stressful. I really, really want this online stuff to end soon because I mentally can\u2019t take this anymore",

None of my work is pressing, a draft here, a paper due later next week, an assignment due Sunday, but god I feel guilty for taking any time to myself with these assignments out there. But there also so far away that I can\u2019t bring myself to start them either. So I essentially am a ball of anxiety doing things, or sitting in my room writing a paragraph an hour",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar boat. It\u2019s taken such a toll on my mental health because the constant stress makes me less productive, which creates more stress because everything takes longer. \n\nIf you get a chance, I recommend the Now Habit by Neil Fiore. It\u2019s not long, and it\u2019s one of the few productivity books I actually like because it\u2019s by a positive psychologist who focuses on making time for the things you want to do. I think it gives a lot of great advice about balancing self care and productivity. I don\u2019t want to add another thing into the overwhelming list of things you have on your mind, but this book really did help me. I think the tips in it are similar to the other comment that talks about making a schedule and taking breaks. It might help you put these things into practice. \n\nTake a deep breath. You are not your grades. Sometimes it\u2019s okay if things aren\u2019t perfect, or if you just skim the reading. It doesn\u2019t reflect on your intelligence. I think we need to remember to be kind to ourselves and weigh our mental health as an important factor in our decisions. Obviously, education is important, but you\u2019re important too.",

Set a time when you are going to start school. Schedule a time where you are going to take a break. This way you won\u2019t feel guilty for taking a break because that\u2019s what you should be doing. Then at a certain time of the day, end studying. That way the day CAN end and you can get enough sleep. Don\u2019t feel guilty for taking breaks; even at work you have breaks and get to go home afterwards. When you\u2019re stressed about studying all the time, you never allow your brain to relax and heal from all the stress and knowledge you are giving it.",
