  "text": "I went to Hs in a small town and my parents were very focused on grades. I was really into art and music up until i started high school when I abandoned those pursuits to do well in school. I ended up doing very well in school but the only college I could afford was the last one on my list. I\u2019m miserable here, I hate the school culture. I also do so poorly in classes now no matter how hard I work, I can never get good grades anymore. I want to do well in school and maybe go to law school or do something related to finance but my grades are too low and I don\u2019t have any skills. I have no idea what to do. I\u2019m a junior and I feel like it\u2019s too late to fix all of my past academic mistakes in college. I don\u2019t even have any interests or hobbies at this point.",
