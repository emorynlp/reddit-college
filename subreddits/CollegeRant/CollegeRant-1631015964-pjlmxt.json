  "text": "I just got a job at a dining place on campus. They said it would be very easy, id just cut up food for the cooks. And that\u2019s about it. They instead had me do everything other than that. So sitting in the back, cleaning, having people constantly accidentally splashing disgusting water on me. All the other workers are old farts and are assholes. They held me extremely late (11:00), saying other nights it could be longer. The other workers even tell me they call this the hell hole here.  \nThing is, their papers say they need a two week notice.\nIs it out of the question to email saying It\u2019s not what I expected, and I\u2019m just flat out done, goodbye? No two weeks? I had my first day, after they kept screwing up my schedule, emailing me, saying are you coming to your shift today, when it overlapped many of my classes.",
