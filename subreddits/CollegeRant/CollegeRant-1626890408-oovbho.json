I fucked up this spring very badly due to mental health issues and covid.\ni\u2019m currently retaking a class I took this spring just to boost my gpa so i can keep my merit scholarship.\nI have a few more weeks left of the summer semester and i\u2019m having so many mental breakdowns and start feeling sick and unmotivated every time i try to attempt hw now. I was feeling fine for the first few days of class and now due to this i started falling behind again just like how i did this spring.\nThe fact i keep having mental breakdowns has been making me feel terrified going further in college.\nI do have a goal for college and that is to attend med school. I know things will go well if i work hard but i just cant get it in my head.\nI\u2019ve went to my doctor before and told them how i\u2019ve been struggling a lot with mental health issues and my biggest issue is dealing with these mental breakdowns. I hate how i keep having these feelings every day so many times. They brushed it off saying its normal and i just need to get through it.\nIm just feeling so lost rn and dont even know what to do.", "author": "luna-the-moon-cat", "created": 1626890408, "retrieved": 1632949374, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h61zyt0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oovbho/struggling_to_keep_motivated_and_having_mental/h61zyt0/", "text": "Retaking a class is not the end of the world. I don\u2019t know why I even bother giving advice. I\u2019m as fucked as you lol. \n\nI guess, the best you can really do is just keep moving forward by learning from your mistakes. I haven\u2019t met a single person who\u2019s perfect yet. Perhaps, you haven\u2019t either. It doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that you take these four years to learn and grow as a person and let that fuel your career.", "author": "majoroofboys", "created": 1626904385, "upvotes": 1}}}
