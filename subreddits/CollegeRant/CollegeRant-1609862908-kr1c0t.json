My semester starts in a little over a week and I feel unmotivated, but I am trying to force myself to be motivated because I know that I at least want something to fall back on in the future in case I stop after my degree if that makes sens.\n\nThe way I try to think about it, of course in my own opinion/based off of my experience, is that I want to be successful in the future. I've changed my major three times already. I hate that I keep failing some of my classes. I have NEVER failed a class in high school and I took honors and AP classes which were hard at both schools that I went to. It may just be the brainwashing that I went through with my teachers and what my parents told me when I was younger (I love them though), but I know what I want. A successful career where I don't want to live off of anyone else even though I am married to the love of my life whom has a good career.\n\nTry looking on YT at people who have found good ways to stay motivated through school. I found that even watching kids in high school who have high study drives have kept me motivated. I SUCKED this past fall semester, but I am 1000% motivated for the upcoming spring semester.\n\nThink about what you want in life. If college doesn't include those plans, then that's fine! Some people are willing to struggle for a long while just to get their dream jobs/careers. It is okay to be dreading an upcoming semester as I am sure most students are. Another thing that helped me get more motivated is thinking about how much money I was wasting. People, like me, have taken advantage of financial aid which is FREE MONEY basically and instead of taking advantage of it, you should be lucky to have the opportunity to use it. If your situation is using student loans or your own money to pay for college, that should be motivation also. You don't want to look back in a few years and think about how you shouldn't have used and abused your own money or student loan money on something that you weren't passionate in at that time. Good luck to you and every other student that feels this way!", "author": "prncsx", "created": 1609921121, "upvotes": 2}, "gi9utj6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kr1c0t/dreading_the_next_semester/gi9utj6/", "text": "Me too.
