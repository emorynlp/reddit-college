  "text": "my brother will start chemo the same month i am supposed to go away for a study abroad term - idk what to do\n\ni\u2019ve posted on here before. my brother is 24 and was diagnosed with brain cancer last month. he was able to have surgery done a couple weeks ago to remove the tumour. they got almost all of the tumour out but will need to do chemo as well. he\u2019s expected to start chemo in january 2022, but my parents are trying to have it done sooner due to some financial reasons. \n\ni\u2019m in my senior year rn. i\u2019m currently enrolled to depart for my semester abroad in late january 2022. i would be leaving after his chemo starts, but still in the middle of his round of chemo.\n\ni\u2019m conflicted on what to do. our parents have talked to me about it and said they won\u2019t stop me from going if i want. they know i\u2019ve been planning this for years. i was originally supposed to go abroad in fall 2020, but it got pushed back to winter 2022. idk whether to stay or go. \n\nthe doctors have told my brother that he will get over this. he read online the life expectancy for someone in his position is around 3.5 years, the doctor told him that\u2019s wrong and his case looks more like 10-15+ years. he said 20 years isn\u2019t outta the question. \n\ni feel like i\u2019m trying to rationalize going on exchange. i just feel like it\u2019s an experience being robbed from me. i\u2019m 22 and so close to finishing school. i already have a job for post grad so i have less than a year until i start working and leave school behind. my parents have suggested just going on a grad trip next summer instead of doing exchange. i\u2019ll still get to go to europe and be a tourist, but it\u2019ll be as a grad trip. i hate the idea. the whole point of exchange is the experience of being a student in a completely different country. my personal life has been absolutely horrible for 2021, the pandemic lead to me losing almost all the people i considered my best friends before it. exchange was supposed to be a new beginning, 6 months on a different continent and the chance to make new friends and have once in a lifetime experiences. on top of all this, my brother and i aren\u2019t close at all. i moved home from school for the last month because he was home cuz of finding out he has cancer. we\u2019ve talked a handful of times. we just have never been close, we coexist in the same house and get along very well, but we just aren\u2019t close at all. i wanna be here for him but i feel like i can\u2019t do much, there\u2019s not really anything he needs me for. i\u2019m scared he will do chemo, get fine and go back to normal, and i will resent him because i had to sacrifice things in my own life. i feel selfish for thinking this but i can\u2019t help thinking it. \n\ni\u2019m not sure at all how to proceed or make my decision. but i really just needed to rant and write it down.",
