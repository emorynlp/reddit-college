  "text": " \n\nI signed up for an online accelerated calculus 3 class; not sure if that was a wise choice. I couldn't handle the pace, on top of that, my teacher spoke in broken English and mumbled so much that replaying the videos was not helpful. Kept on getting grades as low as 30-40. I signed up so I can catch up, feeling like I was so far behind for whatever reason despite being young. I am withdrawing from the class at the end of the 2nd week out of 6.\n\nI want to know if this was the right call. I've been feeling so stressed and now feel like I let my parents down. They said it's fine and despite feeling a huge burden being lifted off my soul something tells me that I don't have much time left and should hurry so I can make a living and start a family.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nI know it's not the end of the world. Just wanted to vent. And I'd love to hear if there are any alternatives to college.",

You don\u2019t have to scramble for \u201cgood\u201d reasons for dropping a class because there aren\u2019t any bad reasons. \n\nI was a 4.0 GPA English major in community college and was terrified of losing my perfect GPA. I took an A&P class to fulfill a science credit and had to drop it because I was making grades 50 and under. I graduated a semester later than expected because of this and don\u2019t regret a single thing. \n\nAlso, your learning style, mental health, and progress are way more important than any undue suffering you feel obligated to push through caused by a bad class.",
