Depending on where they live, there might be a single option for internet service and without competition there's no incentive for the provider to offer \"the best\" internet.\n\nCoverage in some areas is spotty or has an outage. What are professors supposed to do about that? \n\nEven if they pay for top tier service, depending on the provider and demand, it might be throttled.",

Most salaries for professors at public colleges are on a state database so anyone can see). So it might not be that easy for them to upgrade their WiFi/cams/mics. But I do think they need to be gracious with students\u2019 technical difficulties if they expect the same vice versa. And honestly even if they don\u2019t. College students are known for being broke, and everyone\u2019s broke because of the pandemic, and nobody can use public resources as easily as pre-COVID. Professors should be understanding and flexible.",

Doesnt matter they can't hear the class but the class can hear them, when the prof speaks no one can hear it sounds watery and shitty. Also all prof does is reads slides VERBATIM. I mean the least you can do is have a good mic cmon, its not rocket science. Or just quit being a prof. Seriously mega millions shelled out for shit like this?",

If your prof needs a better mic, lobby the school to buy him one. He's not making any more money this year - in fact he's probably making less, since every school I know has put pay cuts in place. \n\nYou'd think students would generally be on the side of employee rather than employer!",
