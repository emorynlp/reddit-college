I have a few friends and whatnot, but it's just like high school 2.0 all over again. I think covid and zoom classes have only exacerbated the effects of it to a whole new level. I spoke to many of my peers and they all said similar things, they wanted to drop out, leave, never do it again, many were hopeless. While many people just look to the short term, I think long term it is going to stick around. This is going to be an experience that our generation will never forget and will always hold to a personal level. I am very curious to see the dropout or \"year skippers\" numbers, I want to know how badly this affected students across the globe.", "author": "Hess20", "created": 1622832816, "upvotes": 1}, "h0jetne": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nrrdm3/is_college_depressing_or_is_this_just_covid/h0jetne/", "text": "I think it's definitely MORE depressing now with covid and being online.

I started college in 2018 and got a year and a half of actually university. Before that I spent my senior year of high school in community college - not a high school/cc program, I just went to community college on my own in my own time. As covid restrictions lift you\u2019ll see what you expected come to be but you also have to realize college isn\u2019t a pr\u00e9 college program. I went to one of those too, mine was at UC Berkeley. I too loved and adored it and the friends I made. Real college is harder socially, you have to go out and find your people and sometimes that takes a while. I hope your transfer helps and I hope you don\u2019t get discouraged if it takes a while to find your group. I\u2019m a senior now and it took me until my junior year to find my group\u2026and I don\u2019t even like all of them all that much, but they\u2019re my people.", "author": "cantreadshitmusic", "created": 1622764083, "upvotes": 4}}}
