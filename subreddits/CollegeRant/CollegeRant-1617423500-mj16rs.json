I am taking my first year in school at a CC and then transferring to a four-year, but only doing 3 years. I have discovered that private schools offer in the way of merit and state residence money. I am going to Liberty University (I'm not religious but they have an **amazing** nursing program) and they can give me over 6500 a year just for my grades. It depends on what state you're in, but a lot of privates have a tag scholarship. For example, in Virginia, we have the VTAG, which is extra money if you are in the state. It's definitely worth checking out, for me it's cheaper to go to a private that's 3 hours away than a public less than 1.", "author": "evieblodgett26", "created": 1617710084, "upvotes": 1}, "gtg9obv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mj16rs/well_off_parents_cant_afford_college/gtg9obv/", "text": "Same situation.

Here's what I did and I'm graduating debt free next month: \n\n1. Find out which state school has both your desired major and will accept ALL of your transfer credits. Bonus if this school is close to your parents house and you can live there rent free. You will save so much money. Apply to this school as soon as possible. The early you get your admission decision the more time you have to apply for scholarships. \n\n2. Once you're accepted start applying for general merit scholarships. Some colleges will automatically consider you for scholarships when you apply but some won't. Make sure you know what additional applications you need to fill out for merit awards (if any). Reach out to the financial aid office if you need help determining this, they can be extremely helpful in pointing you towards scholarships and letting you know of unusual deadlines or requirements. \n\n3. Once you declare your major (which I'm assuming will be soon) apply for departmental scholarships. Most schools will let you have both merit and department scholarships, and the requirements are typically very similar. Department scholarships usually require a separate application than the general merit awards, so again go to your financial aid office if you have questions. Also look around at the various campus resource centers. If you are a member of one of their served groups you can apply for their scholarships and stack them with the other scholarship types. As far as 3rd party scholarships, ask someone in the financial aid office for a list of good websites to check, and then apply to every single one you even half qualify for. \n\n4. See what options the college offers to pay tuition. If they offer payment plans these can be helpful, provided you'll be making enough throughout the semester to make the payments. Payment plans are usually short term and interest free since they're through the school. Be wary of income share agreements. I personally hate these and think they're very scammy loans masked as a \"progressive\" payment option. Not every college offers these, but if you are offered one think it through long and hard. \n\n5. Get a better job if you can. Experience is good but unfortunately money is better. I scrapped by but my income was much higher than yours. See if there's any on-campus jobs hiring. The pay isn't the best, but you typically can get a very flexible schedule and even do homework on the clock. TA jobs tend to pay more. You might not be able to get one of these first semester, but keep it in mind and try to form good relationships with your professors so you can TA with them next semester. If you can swing it, full time campus jobs are a steal, they typically come with benefits like TUITION REDUCTION. If you find one of these nail it down, the benefit alone is worth whatever work it is you have to do. \n\n6. Get involved in research studies. Not like sell-an-organ or try-this-crazy-drug studies, but simple surveys, interviews, or focus groups. I've done many of these while in college and got anywhere from $25-$170 per study, just for my time and answering some questions. You probably won't get enough to pay tuition, but it'll help buy books or as spending money throughout the semester. \n\n7. If it comes down to it, take out only the best loans. If you can get a federal loan take that, the rates tend to be better than private loans. \n\n\nI wish you luck OP. The fafsa struggle is painful but don't let that hold you back from completely your degree. Keep your grades up and apply for every scholarship you can. With luck things will work out for you too.", "author": "Bored_Dragonborn", "created": 1617433873, "upvotes": 20}, "gt806jt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mj16rs/well_off_parents_cant_afford_college/gt806jt/", "text": "Defiantly try and see if you can transfer to a local state school and live at home, if possible.
