When teachers are passionate about their field it can be easy for them to go overboard in wanting too share too much all at once, but they need to understand that they only have a limited amount of class, and students have only limited amount of time to do the work for that class. \n\nAnother factor that plays a role I think is that this would require teachers to put in more time and effort to narrow down which information is the most crucial to their course. I imagine it's tempting for teachers, who are also very busy themselves, to give students a big list of reading and let them figure it out for themselves. They rationalise this by arguing that it's valuable to learn to evaluate information yourself, but I think it's more the fact that they simply don't want to bother doing it themselves. Teachers who assign a more focused reading every week and list the rest as background demonstrate that they're willing to put in time and effort to make it easier for their students. I've had teachers like that, thankfully, and they were great. You could tell that they really cared. That's why I do think we need to acknowledge it takes more effort on the teacher's part to develop a more concentrated course plan.", "author": "civilizedcat", "created": 1616793149, "upvotes": 2}, "gsc1liy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mdgsu6/why_do_lecturers_assign_readings_that_are/gsc1liy/", "text": "Learning to manage, filter, and process the material IS the training.

Her 2 hours of reading was more like 4-6 hours of reading for us. She assigned journals/scientific articles that were 20-30 pages long each. On top of that, she made sure we had work for the amount of hours we were to spend on her class each week (I think around 13 hours per week) so she made sure we had assignments to work on which was about 3-4 hours, 1-2 hour zoom meeting, and then the rest was our field experience... I hated it. I called her out on it and told her I basically wasn't doing the reading because I didn't have enough time considering I'm a full time student in other classes (we all were and no one had the time). And of course she asked questions about the readings in the meetings instead of teaching us so my grade was impacted but I also called her out on other issues with the class so I'm pretty sure my grade was also impacted by that. In 4 years of college, her and her class is what caused me to start drinking.

Depending on your major there are a lot of sections where the title says it all but the content is dense and unnecessary. If you think you understand what the section or chapter is about, then skim until you get lost/confused and go back to the last thing you understood. Continue reading until you get to the place where you were originally confused and check if you get it now. Rinse and repeat.\n\n2) Go to office hours. Go to office hours. Go to office hours. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! I never did this and still dont and its my fatal flaw every time. Professors that do this 100+ page nonsense often have some weird, unnecessary, and stupid motive behind doing it. Whether its finding out who is trying hard or who will be their next TA. Either way, if you go to office hours, its likely youll find out what they want you to focus on or what is actually relevant. From friends I have that have gone to office hours, sometimes those professors straight up give the answers to the quiz or test.\n\n3) I dont really have a third point, but dont be too hard on yourself either. If you feel comfortable with the material then feel free to give yourself a little slack. If you dont ever feel comfortable with the material, then seriously consider if youre in the the right major. From my experience, I spent years (and money) stressing myself out over material that I was never going to understand in a semester. Once I moved to an adjacent field with concepts I could grasp my GPA and mental health improved greatly...at least relatively.\n\nIf all of this is nonsense and not helpful then all I can say is keep on keepin on.
