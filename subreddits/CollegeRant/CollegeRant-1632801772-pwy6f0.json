I don\u2019t have office hours.\u201d And this is a 5 credit class, I\u2019m paying thousands to not understand the text, watch hours of YouTube to try and understand, then have Pearson grade all my assignments. This sucks.",

      "text": "Sounds like you got my prof exactly. Every single part of the course was copy and pasted from a template. So was the syllabus. She called herself the FACILITATOR for the course rather than the instructor! Didn\u2019t have office hours because she didn\u2019t even live in the state! No notes, no recorded lectures, just a shitty math lab that you had to pay an extra 150 bucks for. 5 credit precal class with trig and not one fuck given. Didn\u2019t even send an email welcome the first week of class. It\u2019s my last class before I get my associates too:/ I had to drop it. I\u2019ll just take the class at whatever 4 year I transfer to. I honestly can\u2019t believe they are allowed to do that.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about this. Online/asynchronous education has largely been self-led for many years, and COVID has made it more apparent to more people. To people who are used to live instruction, it can seem problematic. In any situation, there should be support for you if you have questions.\n\nWhat did you ask in your email? It usually helps to tailor your question to indicate that you read and still don\u2019t understand. For example, \u201cI read about X on p. XX, but I\u2019m still unclear on XYZ.\u201d If they still won\u2019t help you, then that\u2019s crappy, and you should consider speaking to the department chair. However, if you said \u201cI don\u2019t understand what to do,\u201d that can signal that you haven\u2019t tried (whether or not that\u2019s true).",

      "text": "Omg my daughter and I were just ranting about this. She still hasn\u2019t seen her Professor as he has the TA talking to them and just turned in a paper about something they never covered. It was just bam, here\u2019s a due date and write this paper and figure out the answer to this problem we never did before in an INTRO class.\n\nLots of students straight out of high school in there that are confused. He (TA)really gives off the vibe that he\u2019s enjoying stumping the Freshmen. He also seems stressed (understandably) and keeps mentioning he\u2019s super busy and may not be able to get back at them because he\u2019s working on his dissertation. No mention and no sight of the Professor.",
