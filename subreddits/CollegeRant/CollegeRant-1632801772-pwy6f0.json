Online/asynchronous education has largely been self-led for many years, and COVID has made it more apparent to more people. To people who are used to live instruction, it can seem problematic. In any situation, there should be support for you if you have questions.\n\nWhat did you ask in your email? It usually helps to tailor your question to indicate that you read and still don\u2019t understand. For example, \u201cI read about X on p. XX, but I\u2019m still unclear on XYZ.\u201d If they still won\u2019t help you, then that\u2019s crappy, and you should consider speaking to the department chair.

It was just bam, here\u2019s a due date and write this paper and figure out the answer to this problem we never did before in an INTRO class.\n\nLots of students straight out of high school in there that are confused. He (TA)really gives off the vibe that he\u2019s enjoying stumping the Freshmen. He also seems stressed (understandably) and keeps mentioning he\u2019s super busy and may not be able to get back at them because he\u2019s working on his dissertation.
