  "text": "\nSo I understand that this is normal and totally reasonable to be any number of years behind in college. I just wanted to vent/advocate for those on this sub dealing with the same issues I am facing. \n\nI was cheated out of a few classes that I did not need by my first academic advisor. I started at community college in 2018 and that is where I still am to this day. Unfortunately there has been multiple classes that I had to retake because of bad grades. I blame work for mixing into my study time too much. But in all honesty it is not worth pitting this against anything or anyone. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, college caters to a four year degree program. The only way to retain most scholarships and tuition reimbursements is to remain a full time student at a good GPA. \n\nI am simply here to say that it DOES NOT MATTER how long you take. My 4 year mechanical engineering program will take me 6 years. I do not care because these extra two years will not matter to me when I am in the thick of it as an engineer in my 30s, 40s, 50s, and so on. If anything, putting off the inevitable of working until you\u2019re decrepit and dying is somewhat favorable to me. \n\nYour friends may be further along than you, people may ask why you\u2019re 21 and a sophomore. You are working at your own pace. If you feel comfortable taking X amount of years to become a nurse, psychiatrist, physician, dentist, accountant, whatever, you are smart to enter your career when you are fully ready. I could not imagine almost already being an engineer. Bridges would collapse, cars would malfunction! The slower you take in knowledge, the more retention you have. \n\n- and if there is anything you ever wanted to get done quickly, training for your career is not it! Finish when you are ready and enjoy these years of your life that you will never get back. Because, sure, the genius next to you took 22 credits a semester and is graduating with honors early. But that person does not realize that a year head start only takes away from your youth. When you\u2019re colleagues with that person 20 years from now, 1-5 year difference on degree completion will not matter. \n\nYou cannot stress about things that you cannot control. Focus on moving forward and develop a plan from all the experience you have had. Learning to fail and recover from it is such a valuable skill to have that many students never deal with.",
