The whole night I was having dreams about college and my body was stressed af the second I woke up. I have no idea why I'm like this but I absolutely hate it. I've had severe anxiety for the past two years and I thought it was getting better but I guess not. If today was my \"day off\" I can't even imagine the hell I'm gonna go through tomorrow on my actual first day. I really just wanna crawl under a rock right now and disappear forever, or go to a random field in the middle of nowhere and live out the rest of my life with no responsibilities. If I could just stop existing right now I would, I already feel like I'm dying during each one of these panic attacks anyway. I had all summer to get help or find a therapist but I didn't, and now I have to face the consequences. I don't really know if this post fits here but I really wanted to get this out. I'm fighting this battle all alone and it sucks :/", "author": "IvoryFloor", "created": 1629723824, "retrieved": 1632950385, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 180, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ha4ch9n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p9zea9/my_first_day_of_college_is_tomorrow_and_i_know_im/ha4ch9n/", "text": "I just want to mention that your school might offer free therapy and I had a similar mindset several months ago with the panoramic happening and I really struggled with my mental health. I would also suggest reaching out to a crisis hotline when feelings such as no longer wanting exists occur. I dealt with them for a long time before realizing I was actually depressed. While it may not seem like a typical case, it\u2019s still something that needs to be noted so that you can get the help that is right for you. Especially with the level of anxiety you are describing, I think that making that a priority is extremely important. While I know it is difficult, I put off contacting a Councler for months because I couldn\u2019t get up the confidence to make a phone call, I wish I had done it much sooner. I also want to say that it\u2019s normal for change to cause a flair up of anxiety so you should feel no shame in talking to someone about it.

I\u2019ve struggled with mental health all my life and for multiple reasons outside of my control I\u2019v decided to ignore it. I was in pain with depression and anxiety almost all my life and I was dealing with it I stayed \u201cstrong\u201d. Needless to say the first days of classes this semester it eventually broke me and I have been in a severly bad place. Eventually I decided to take a break this semester to go home and get help for the first time in my life. I\u2019m not saying you need to take a break like I did but don\u2019t be ashamed to go that route if you need help. I would advise seeking counseling through your schools health center and if not find a phycologist and/or psychiatrist in your area ASAP. You can also get help through your disability resources center if you can get in so they can accommodate your needs so you can be successful this semester. Ultimately please get help and seek a therapist no matter the cost.", "author": "kall_me_kamikaze", "created": 1629775211, "upvotes": 1}, "ha410ur": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p9zea9/my_first_day_of_college_is_tomorrow_and_i_know_im/ha410ur/", "text": "I\u2019m actually a college teacher and I feel these nerves too.

Find people to talk to-a professor you click with-your roommate-your family-your best friend from high school-a counselor-the more the better.  Don\u2019t forget this college chose you just as much as you chose them-you can do this.  Get some help from your support system and remember that part of college is learning how to build a new support system.  In the mean time try to break down the big stressors into small manageable tasks that are reasonable to accomplish in one day.  Remember the times you felt like this before?  Maybe it was high school finals or AP tests or learning how to drive or applying to colleges-you made it through then and you can do this now.

The night before I had a small panic attack and then this morning I started becoming incredibly anxious and almost threw up in the bathroom. This, coupled with other things like not finding any friends here while most of my HS friends already have friend groups in their colleges and loneliness, has really made me dislike being in college. I just want to stop existing sometimes or live in the forest as a hermit. But, we'll power through this. I have hope in you, and in me, that there's a light at the end of this godforsaken tunnel.\n\nAlso, I suggest just sitting in the back corner so nobody really notices you.
