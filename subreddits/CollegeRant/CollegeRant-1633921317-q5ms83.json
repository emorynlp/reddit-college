  "text": "I worked double-digit hours on this code project. I tested it extensively in multiple different environments. I double and triple-checked the files I submitted for grading. The grade comes back an F(!), saying one of the functions didn't work.\n\nI downloaded the files I sent, ran them again, it all works perfectly. I even re-ran them on another computer, just in case. No problems. I've never had this happen before. Sometimes there's minor errors in grading, but I've never had a fully completed assignment graded as an F!\n\nJust venting a little here because I'm pissed. I've already sent an email to the assistant that graded it, and they responded saying they would check back with me after looking it over. Hopefully it's just a clerical error and I won't have to do anything else. If this program doesn't work for however the teachers are running it, what hope do I have for anything else I write in this class, seriously?",
