Most of the time, emails are fine. Of course, I don\u2019t have large sections and need the specific call-outs of class, section, etc. because I am able to get to know all my students quickly. I could see that being an issue for very large classes. But no one is ever too busy to take a few extra seconds to provide a respectful reply.",
