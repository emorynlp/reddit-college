It\u2019s straight bull. It\u2019s a bureaucratic system designed to test your patience and make you mellow out so you\u2019re ready to spend your life as a perfect little cog. Because after 12 years of school with an expensive little 4-year cherry plopped on top you are just perfect and ripe for the picking to be a good little submissive, calm, MANAGEABLE little sheep which is exactly what the capitalist workforce needs. And I do mean NEEDS. THEY NEEEED someone to manage. The big boys on top have to have a little bottom boy to push around and control because if you aren\u2019t there they CAN\u2019T exist. You and I mean YOU have the power in this dynamic that\u2019s what they don\u2019t want you to know. They make it seem like there is this fence around you that you can\u2019t escape from and they\u2019re just leading you to the gate of the rest of your life but that\u2019s the thing there isn\u2019t a fence just a dumb little entitled Sheppard boy and a big open field spanning in every direction. And I think the best part is that they make that Sheppard job look soooo good and soooo special but it\u2019s not. What does the Sheppard ok imma stop with the metaphors this is getting contrived what does a manager position have that you don\u2019t have? A big old ball and chain that\u2019s what. Because even if, EVEN IF all those hours nay years you put in behind that desk get recognized all you get for it is a little more money, a lot more work (and worst of all responsibility because who gets blamed if something gets fucked up? The manager then you\u2019re fired and you have nothing for your time, ok you get the point) and of course if you finally do get this coveted position what happens if you hate it and I mean HATE it? What are you gonna do quit? NOOOO that would be ungrateful and this job is all you ever wanted right? More money better job security more shit you can buy more dumb bosses you have to listen to and who wouldn\u2019t want that right? An asshole boss who doesn\u2019t even have to look you in the eyes when they order you around? Sign me up!! So good job now your a cog with like 4 more teeth on it and you\u2019re right where you started another little guy who just happens to have little guys under them. But you always have someone under you and you always have someone above you. You fit in so so nice now you little perfect little cog all because you went to college and now you can\u2019t escape because it was an investment into yourself right?? Bull fucking shit I\u2019ve been around enough Kelly kids to know the law of diminishing marginal utility when I see it. It states that when making financial decisions you don\u2019t think about how much money you stupidly threw away on a bad spread but you look at the facts of the current situation and when its time to pull out and cut your losses you gotta do it before you waste even more of your precious, oh so precious time because the big dogs they got a lot of money but they only have so much time so they trade your time for their money so they can follow THEIR dreams and convince you to like it. So don\u2019t be a bitch, do what you want and follow your dreams. I mean they are probably just as pointless and stupid but at least you picked it and that counts for something. But hey what do I know I haven\u2019t even finished college yet ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: go to college and be a good little sheep for someone to herd.", "author": "tylerspam17", "created": 1632781678, "retrieved": 1632948386, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"hejo7uk": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pws8ey/college_really_testing_me_lately/hejo7uk/", "text": "Go to trade school better then college", "author": "woodedglue", "created": 1632794966, "upvotes": 1}, "hej5yy0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pws8ey/college_really_testing_me_lately/hej5yy0/", "text": "You forgot to sign this work:\n\nRamblings of a Schizo.", "author": "Fluffy-Mechanic-7052", "created": 1632786511, "upvotes": 8}}}
