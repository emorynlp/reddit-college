For the past month I\u2019ve been checking my progress and the website to make sure I\u2019m still okay to graduate on time this semester with the 4 classes I\u2019m registered for. Up until today it\u2019s been saying I will have completed all requirements at the end of the spring semester but I checked again today for the last time before the semester starts and now it says I will need an additional class to graduate on time. I\u2019m so fed up because I\u2019ve had multiple meetings with my guidance counselor about setting up my schedule to work out but now they change the requirements on me so now I\u2019m getting fucked over.", "author": "tate3223", "created": 1610316773, "retrieved": 1632842900, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 155, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gltxvkt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kuoehe/college_continues_to_fuck_me_over/gltxvkt/", "text": "It's shocking how little people communicate with each other at a university.

The problem was that my normal freshman adviser gave me the wrong academic plan for my degree year. My degree cut clinical internships with a local hospital to a new out of state college. So we had to meet the new requirement of this out of state college. No one in that department updated the degree plan. I'm lucky that the out of state college came to give a lecture on the requirements to enter, because if they didn't I may have started classes that I didn't need. this is also when I was finally able to talk to the department and provide them with the mistake they did. They fixed it after I showed them, but it deleted two classes and added 3 more. so another semester basically....\n\nAlso after a year, I transfer to my CC since I couldn't do the hour drive anymore and my university provided a nice transfer guide that told me exactly what classes to take, except again one class wasn't required, and as I was finishing it up my university department adviser said that that transfer guide wasn't updated and it was no longer a class that I needed. So now I have the credit for nothing. I also double-checked this with the freshman adviser and community college adviser, so I was pissed that my department adviser was saying the other two advisers advised me wrong.", "author": "elocinkrob", "created": 1610389863, "upvotes": 1}, "giuh1gq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kuoehe/college_continues_to_fuck_me_over/giuh1gq/", "text": "If you're in a 4 year, check and make sure they have you on the curriculum/breadth for the year that you came in.\n\nThis might change some things and have you back on track\n\nOther than that I know har frustrating that can be and I hope eveything gets sorted out", "author": "P_poperah", "created": 1610343565, "upvotes": 3}, "giu9jq7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kuoehe/college_continues_to_fuck_me_over/giu9jq7/", "text": "Just talk to your counselor or someone else with email receipts.
