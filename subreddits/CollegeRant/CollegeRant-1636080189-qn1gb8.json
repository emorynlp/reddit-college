  "text": "So I just started my freshman year (a year late due to some medical issues), and I really love college with one exception: my fucking parents. I could give a bunch of reasons why. Here are a couple: \n\nI joined a fraternity, and even though my parents are happy that I\u2019m doing well with my social life, they\u2019re constantly on my ass about when and how long I spend time there. Not only that, but they\u2019re also threatening to force me to drop if I get below a C in *any* class because apparently my issues with understanding super hard shit in chem and calc are related to that....\n\nAnd the other thing is really just living in general. Constantly have them calling me at weird times to ask me about weird shit like \u201cwhether or not I\u2019ve been going to the gym\u201d or \u201cwhy I was out till 1:00 in the morning\u201d. Just let me live my life damn it. \n\nWhat do I do here?",

      "text": "This is my mum. Shes stopped because I basically stopped replying to her out of annoyance. \nShe would want to know everything about my Life and even visit unannounced. And expect me to visit her regularly. Oh and constantly ask me If i was passing classes.\n\n(For context: our relationship is horrible and I nearly cried of relief the day I moved out lol)\n\nIdk If youve got siblings that still live at Home, but your parents have to adjust to you Not being there aswell. Give them some time and boundaries and theyll probably eventually stop being into anything you do or dont do",
