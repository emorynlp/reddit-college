I still don\u2019t know what I want to major in, I changed last year in the fall, and I feel completely hopeless. I\u2019m going back this fall with 3 classes in person, and it just feels like static.

I took about 3 classes per semester since beginning college (2018) up until now. I've actually had to do summer classes in order to catchup with my presupposed graduation date, which I'll not be able to meet. Moral of the story is to take more classes. Get your general education requirements out the way first. I wouldn't worry too much about graduating on time.
