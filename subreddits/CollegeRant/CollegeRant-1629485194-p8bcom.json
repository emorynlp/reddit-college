  "text": "I\u2019ve only passed like 8-9 classes so far and I feel so behind (I am). I feel like everyone else around me who started college the same year as me in 2019, are so close to graduating. However, I still haven\u2019t reached the surface yet. I still don\u2019t know what I want to major in, I changed last year in the fall, and I feel completely hopeless. I\u2019m going back this fall with 3 classes in person, and it just feels like static. Does anyone feel like this or going through the same thing as me? \ud83d\ude15",

      "text": "I'm actually in a similar situation. I took about 3 classes per semester since beginning college (2018) up until now. I've actually had to do summer classes in order to catchup with my presupposed graduation date, which I'll not be able to meet. Moral of the story is to take more classes. Get your general education requirements out the way first. I wouldn't worry too much about graduating on time. Mental health and what works best for you is what you should prioritize.",
