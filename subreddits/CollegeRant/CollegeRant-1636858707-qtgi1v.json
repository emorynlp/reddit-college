What's the use in finishing something that you don't want to use anyways? Bragging rights?",

Ask them if there are other degrees that you have basically already completed. See if you have options that won\u2019t take a bunch of extra time. You can also just finish your degree. Remember, C\u2019s get degrees! But take any elective you have room for that fits your interests. I kind of did this. My last year of undergrad I only needed 6 credits total for my major, and then just 30 total hours with NO restrictions on what they were in (other than the 6 for my major). I had SO MUCH FUN taking random English and Psych and Linguists courses! \n\nIt\u2019s really true though that PLENTY of jobs dgaf about what you majored in as long as you have a degree. Legit, I have a classical languages degree and now I teach high school math. (Fwiw, I LOVE being a teacher, but I\u2019m glad when prospective educators realize it\u2019s not for them before they have classrooms full of students for whom they are responsible). Finish out your degree while taking as many classes that interest you as you can. You have options here OP. Don\u2019t lose hope.",

I would suggest seeking a guidance counselor if you are not sure what you want to do next. This is exactly what i did twice : first in 2014 when I realized 3 semester in, that elementary teaching was not making me happy and second in the beginning of the year when i realized that my love for linguistic was overtaken by my anxiety of not being able to find a job in the field i was doing my PhD in. Take time to evaluate where you are and where you want to go and a professional can help you tremendously (at least it did for me). The result of those scholar path are making me have a kickass profile in job interview.",
