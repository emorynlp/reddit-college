I\u2019ve been taking my classes online at a fairly slower pace \u2014 12 credits for fall/spring and 6 credits for summer, but I\u2019ve been taking them continuously since last summer and won\u2019t finish until at minimum *next summer* going at this pace, and my hardest classes are coming up right at the end. I get a 1 week break between sessions and a 1 month break between semesters (except between summer/fall), but it\u2019s finally starting to get to me now :(. \n\nNow I\u2019m debating between taking more classes to speed it up and increasing my risk of burning out or taking it even slower but having to wait even longer to graduate \ud83d\ude2d.",

Third semester I tried it again, but I had almost all major-specific classes (mechanical engineering). That was the hardest semester I've ever taken in terms of mental health and burnout. I've done 16-17 credits ever since no problem, but I already suspect this semester is going to be a tough one. I'm considering dripping down to 13-14 credits next semester, even though it means I'll need to either take a summer class or add on another semester.\n\nUltimately, you need to do what's best for you. There are all sorts of resources and people available for you to get advice from, but you're the one who needs to synthesize the input and decide what you want for yourself. (Especially since you're going to get conflicting opinions on what to do.)",
