Because the idea was just so impossible. I always wondered how someone could possibly not hate these inane topics. But since coming to college, more and more I\u2019m getting the sinking suspicion that some people aren\u2019t actually lying.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. I always thought school was a place where the meaning is sucked out of life and passions go to die. Like a black hole that drags you down further and further every time you step in, until finally you can\u2019t crawl back out.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a life like this where every day isn\u2019t suffocated with regret and hopelessness. I'm still trying to slowly smother my hobbies. I know that as long as they're alive I will never be able to give my all in school, I will never be able to get passable grades. After all, why would anyone want to waste their life on these horrible topics when there\u2019s so much art and music and beauty waiting to be created in this world? You\u2019re telling me there\u2019s people out there who don\u2019t live with this constantly on their mind?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUp to now I've never even had the chance to make any friends or go to parties or date anyone..
