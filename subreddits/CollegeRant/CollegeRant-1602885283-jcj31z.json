  "text": "So all my life I used to think everyone else was lying just like me when they said they were interested in their major or the program we're in (I study a STEM topic). Because the idea was just so impossible. I always wondered how someone could possibly not hate these inane topics. But since coming to college, more and more I\u2019m getting the sinking suspicion that some people aren\u2019t actually lying.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. I always thought school was a place where the meaning is sucked out of life and passions go to die. Like a black hole that drags you down further and further every time you step in, until finally you can\u2019t crawl back out.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a life like this where every day isn\u2019t suffocated with regret and hopelessness. I'm still trying to slowly smother my hobbies. I know that as long as they're alive I will never be able to give my all in school, I will never be able to get passable grades. After all, why would anyone want to waste their life on these horrible topics when there\u2019s so much art and music and beauty waiting to be created in this world? You\u2019re telling me there\u2019s people out there who don\u2019t live with this constantly on their mind?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUp to now I've never even had the chance to make any friends or go to parties or date anyone.. How much more am I expected to give up??",

      "text": "To be honest, if that's how you view school in general, you shouldn't be in college. Maybe find a great high paying job (learn a trade. Still difficult but way less expensive) so you can focus on your hobbies and interests. To alot of people a job is just a job and that's okay.\n\nI am crazy passionate about my major and I enjoy my classes. Sometimes it gets tedious and some parts are boring bur overall I love what I'm doing.\n\nAlso outside of the school setting, I don't think it's common to feel that way. I would talk with a therapist if you have the ability to do so. I mean that in the most respectful way.",

          "text": "Yeah for sure, I never expected to actually get anything besides money out of a job. \"A job is just a job,\" I never really knew what that means because... what else could the point be, besides to get paid? Good point about trade school. College is expensive but I'm on a pretty good scholarship, which is part of the reason I'm just trying to shut up (besides ranting on reddit ofc haha) and get through it.\n\nThat's cool that you like your major. A bit jealous haha. I think there's a huge difference when it comes to how you view work if it's something you're passionate about vs not. For instance I would have no qualms staying up all night writing an article or essay, sure it's tedious but no problem. But when it comes to the same amount of work into chemistry or biology I really feel like I would rather be dead.\n\nMay I ask what you mean by outside of the school setting? I've never been to therapy but I assume the basis is talking out your problems. I'm quite sure these problems wouldn't exist if I didn't go to school.",

The pitting students against eachother, wanting the best of the best students..no thanks lol.\n\n I just wanna learn and get my degree in peace. Instead I'm rigorously tested and have to do homework that doesn't even help me learn. Not to mention how shitty the education system is for disabled people.\n\nIf this society didnt require a college degree in order to have a higher chance at a decent paying career....i wouldnt have went to college at all lol",

I've always thought they've got to keep us all against each other and dissatisfied with ourselves so we don't wake up and collectively realize how fucked up everything is. Recently I saw someone call it capitalist conditioning, lol. Definitely agree with school being able to suck the passion out of things you might've originally enjoyed.",
