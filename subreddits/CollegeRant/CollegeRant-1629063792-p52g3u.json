  "text": "Why do I have to pay full price for classes, only to find out on the first day that if I don\u2019t pay even more, I can\u2019t access any assignments and will receive a zero. I have to pay out of pocket for everything, and this adds up. Every semester it\u2019s another program I have to pay 100$/200$ for per class. What was the cost of class even for? I do my classes online, and some classes utilize Canvas, which is free.",

      "text": "College instructor here.   Check your school's schedule of classes to see if you can see what books/programs are required for that course. This way,  you know how much books and online  programs are prior to signing up for those classes.   \n\n  \nEven better,  look for OER (open education resources) courses which means the materials for that class are available for free online. I use OER for all of my courses because I don't want my students to have to pay for anything else other than  the school fees.  Good luck!",
