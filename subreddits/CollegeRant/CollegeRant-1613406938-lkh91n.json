Even before the pandemic I spent most of my time doing work, studying, you know what school is actually for. parties sucked & were kept secret so I didn\u2019t attend. Clubs are intensely religious even though my uni isn\u2019t religious so that\u2019s no fun either. There\u2019s more fun shit to do around my uni (it\u2019s in a city) than in it (but i haven\u2019t made any friends at my uni so ofc i haven\u2019t been anywhere). I probably won\u2019t be able to study abroad either which is what i was looking forward to the most, cause I\u2019m graduating early next year (to gtfo this place, ofc) & this virus isn\u2019t budging so imo college is a complete scam. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i don\u2019t know how people find a work-fun balance with all these assignments we\u2019re being handed.

Reasonable get togethers with people you actually know who don\u2019t care if you drink or do drugs or not?? Amazing!

Pre-covid, you at least were able to hang out with people in your classes and bond over stupid things like that professor that's overly hard or that one inside joke on campus about some building being underappreciated or that one place in the food court having the best (insert good food here) that anyone's ever had.\n\nNot to mention if you were stuck in a boring major because you chose money over passion (hello FAFSA squad!) there were still opportunities to explore other hobbies. For example, I really like reading and writing, and apparently my college would hold several open-mic events throughout the year but not now because of COVID.\n\nFinally it was a lot easier to make friends (or maybe even more) because again, there are much more opportunities to talk with your peers outside of a class setting where you had to be professional and stay on topic with whatever you were supposed to be discussing in the Zoom room.", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1613408041, "upvotes": 110}, "gnjs6ew": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lkh91n/college_isnt_fun/gnjs6ew/", "text": "If college isn't fun you might not be getting everything out of it.

Work party's can be just as crazy as college party's so it's not exclusively a college thing. \n\nFor a lot of people college isn't fun, it's not going away to a dorm and partying all semester and coming home for maybe the summer.
