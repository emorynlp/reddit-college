  "text": "Currently stressed as fuck, my school just emailed my mother about never receiving my final transcripts. Can't even access naviance anymore as my account for the school is gone since I graduated. I'm fuming and sent my old counselor a email asking why my documents where never sent over. My aid is at risk now and I'm pretty much to stressed to even think.",
