  "text": "So...ppl say that you're supposed to figure out what to do with your life in college. Well...kinda can't do that when your gpa still matters and you're  struggling to graduate on time while taking classes that are no where near your general direction.\n\nThis is lowkey like high school again. Ppl be saying enjoy it, figure out yourself, etc. Like, how? When opportunities are based soley on your gpa and successful work experience, you don't have the opportunity to try new things and fail. Doesn't help that that gpa factors in classes that aren't anywhere related to what you're studying. Like, if im going to major in X subject that I'm doing well in and struggle in an unrelated (let's call it Y) subject, why I'm forced to take 3 classes in Y subject? It will only tank my gpa and waste my time.\n\nAdditionally, how am I supposed to balance that shit with \"figuring out yourself\" and maintaining a social life? I also have to work and am on a super tight schedule, not only in terms of my weekly schedule but in the long term. Weekly, it's pretty straight forward in that I have work and school. In the long term though, I cant afford to stay in college longer than the 4 years. Tbh, i probably cant even do 4 years bc the cost of living is rising pretty quickly in the university town. As a result, this is cutting into my finances, forcing me take on more  classes. That's a problem bc of work, which affects my grades & gpa. The thing is that I can't drop out bc of how it would negatively mpact my future employment, chances of re-entering school, chances of pursuing grad school, etc. \n\nDamn, college is one hell of a confusing shit storm",
