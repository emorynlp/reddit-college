  "text": "I\u2019m referring to when people can\u2019t even say thank you or anything when someone helps open the door for them or some nice gesture. I get that people aren\u2019t obligated to respond, but I just feel like the world would be a better place if we took the time to help do something nice for someone or if someone appreciated the gesture in some way. It just seems kinda cold or rude idk.",

Some of them turned around and just stared at me for a second and didn\u2019t say anything\u2026 Felt like I was in the twilight zone or something. I think college (especially for these next few years) is going more lonely than usual, unfortunately. Don\u2019t let it get you down too much though, I\u2019m sure there are nice people around somewhere \ud83e\udd72",

      "text": "In one of my classes, the classmate who sits next to me is frequently on her phone instead of listening to the prof's lecture. Since she misses everything she literally asks for help from me every time, and I go out of my way to help her to the point where I sometimes miss the instructions because I was too busy focusing on teaching her what the professor said literally two minutes ago. Nary a thank you, either. I really dislike how cold and unwelcoming the college atmosphere is",
