I like the flexibility and tgat it doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cactual school\u201d. However, my family is wanting me to go back to campus this semester and it is causing me a lot of emotional distress. \n\nI currently attend Penn State Harrisburg and this will be my first semester on campus if this is the case. I know there is the online World Campus and it has my major, but idk if I should switch. I understand that being on-campus helps me socialize, but I am already in a crisis mode of if college is right for me. \n\nWhere I live is 20-30 minutes away from the Harrisburg campus, and most of the classes that I need either make my schedule 5 days a week or have a night class and I am not happy about that. I want to know from you guys if I should stay online or I should take a shot on-campus.\nThe fall semester is coming up in about three weeks so I need some quick advice.", "author": "lunamoonorg", "created": 1628258116, "retrieved": 1632949143, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h8y006v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oz7410/stay_online_or_go_back_to_campus/h8y006v/", "text": "I LOVE living at home and being with my family and doing online classes.

Being that close to home it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be that hard to commute to you classes and not be stuck living on campus full time, plus it would save thousands. I\u2019m in the same boat that I prefer the online classes now too. I\u2019m not a super social person, though. If you\u2019re looking to have that social life I\u2019d suggest going as college is one of the easiest ways to make friends. If you\u2019re more concerned with getting your degree and moving on, I\u2019d definitely say online is easier and would save you a ton of money in the long run.", "author": "XxNHLxX", "created": 1628327840, "upvotes": 4}}}
