  "text": "I'm a freshman at UNC Wilmington and I'm just not having fun here at all.\n\nThe school is way too white and conservative for me and I would really like some help finding a school better fit for me. The people here are not welcoming, there's not much to do other than going to the beach, and the school is so big and spread out that I feel isolated. Also, almost everyone here goes home every weekend to see their family and friends!\n\n I visited Belmont University to see a friend and loved the vibe there. Liberal, lots of LBGTQ+ students (I'm queer, so I would love this), and lots to do around the city of Nashville.\n\nDo you guys know any schools I can transfer to my sophomore year that fits those categories?",

      "text": "Idk if it\u2019s worth it for out of state but my brother  goes to VCU and loves it. Diverse and very LBGTQ+ friendly and welcoming. Housing is a bit expensive though. He is a transfer too and the community has been very welcoming. Richmond, VA was the capital of the south but it\u2019s actually pretty cool now. It\u2019s also a city campus so not isolated like a traditional campus. I don\u2019t know that much about the academics there though or what you\u2019re majoring in. They do have an excellent art department but I don\u2019t know much other than that academically.",
