  "text": "Every prof I\u2019ve had each term (that uploads lecture videos) has done this. It\u2019s never just a few mins over either, always at least 30mins to an hour. Now I can\u2019t watch them during the scheduled time (like we\u2019re supposed to in my classes this term) because I have too many classes in a row and none of these damn videos are actually the length they are supposed to be. Tbh I thought most of my profs would be uploading shorter videos, seeing as class time isn\u2019t being consumed by those kids that ask googleable and/or answerable-by-syllabus questions. Anyways. Hope y\u2019all are doing well\n\nEdit: synchronously or asynchronously",

We are providing more to watch because we are providing you more material to help you do better. It\u2019s not meant to be a thing you consume for credit. It\u2019s a resource just like any other. It\u2019s contextualization of what you\u2019ve learned. \n\nNow, if a prof is awarding credit based on watching a video completely through that you can\u2019t fast forward through, that\u2019s a sick move.

The alternative is that they go into less depth about the topic in order to meet the time constraint, which benefits no one, as you\u2019ve pointed out. We are still required to watch the entirety of the lecture (technically, although no points are awarded or subtracted for doing so), and all information given in lectures and readings is fair game for the weekly homework and quizzes. It\u2019s a little frustrating when I spend an additional hour or two collecting and studying extra material every night of an already busy work week simply because longer videos can be uploaded, and it adds up when multiple profs do it. Plus I have the attention span of a fruit fly so it\u2019s a little painful lol. All of that being said, thinking more about the classes I\u2019m currently taking, a good chunk of extra time is taken up to complete example problems that would normally just be partially completed in class, so I appreciate that a lot.",

If profs can\u2019t teach students what they need to know in the time provided to them and the time we get credit for, then that\u2019s not a failure on students\u2014that\u2019s a failure on the prof and on the department as a whole. I shouldn\u2019t have to routinely watch 2-3 hour long lectures twice a week that are only supposed to be an hour and a half long. Like many other students, I\u2019m taking several classes and when every prof is doing this, it\u2019s just really stressful. I\u2019m fine with profs uploading smaller lecture material for me to review while studying, but that\u2019s different than coming to class (online) and the prof saying, \u201coh, I\u2019m only on slide 78 out of a 150 slide presentation, I guess I\u2019ll record that later and you guys can come back and watch.\u201d Actual example of my class last week.

No, it's not like a video game with extra content. It's not like we're provided extra lectures deemed \"optional\" just for the sake of learning new material for enrichment if we want to. We're given more material to learn and study (just as if we were given extra assigned readings). Obviously we aren't graded on whether we watch the videos or not directly, but the extra material will still be on the test, meaning we're still graded on watching them. Students don't have all the time in the world to watch 8 physics videos every week (as my professor has us do) in addition to hw, labs, discussions, and other classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: One way I think we could combine the ideas of extra pre-recorded lectures and normal live lectures is how one of my professors did last quarter. He had many pre-recorded lectures for us to watch every week, and also went over the material as he would in-person during the lecture time slots. I think that's a great way for students to choose whether they want the more in-depth videos or if they're satisfied learning from the live lectures alone. The downside is that this method is probably very time-consuming for the professor, in which case only recorded live-lectures would be optimal.",

Faculty across entire regions and certainly within a single university have the same set of core \u201cthings\u201d they need to cover in, say, Chemistry 101. This is called accreditation. Those requirements do not change if the class is in person, online, or on the moon. And I would imagine no sane accreditation board has made any major changes since Covid started coming around about a year ago. And no professor is going to add extra shit for you to learn just for fun. Believe me, none of this is fun for them.\n\nMy boyfriend is a lecturer split between two institutions and has been struggling for an entire year to get his lectures recorded and uploaded to Canvas. He has to try to do two per day to keep pace; he teaches six classes per semester to make ends meet so I\u2019ll let you do the math. At 90 minutes per lecture, you can likely imagine how raw his throat feels at the end of the day because he\u2019s not just talking into a golden microphone that makes everything perfect on his first attempt. Everything requires multiple takes, editing, putting together the slide deck, all while responding to emails, attending meetings, writing exams, grading papers, etc.\n\nWith that said, for a lot of students it\u2019s more difficult to learn with the disruptive arrangements we\u2019ve all had to deal with. The hours go by more slowly than when you have a more immersive in-person experience. But to say you\u2019re being FORCED to LEARN MORE is ignorant (and ANNOYINGLY privileged).\n\nI think you should listen to what the professors ITT are saying instead of whining about the amount of work you knew you were going to have to do when you (or your parents, or your bank, or your government) decided to pay for a college education. As a returning student in my mid-30s trust me, you\u2019re gonna be paying that student loan debt for years to come so you might as well quit your bitchin\u2019 and get your money\u2019s worth while the gettin\u2019 is still good.",

This makes a 3 hour class 6 hours a week and it\u2019s ridiculous. The in class time is used for problem solving and IMO, this is very helpful but professors need to cut back on something else because on top of these videos we still have to read the textbook and do all the assignments for the class which is extremely overwhelming and makes me dread these classes. If a professor thinks time to go over problems in class is absolutely necessary they should do it in office hours and not require us to go to it",

          "text": "Did you know that a Carnegie credit hour stipulates that you should be spending an additional 2 hours per week working on class material outside of the designated class time per credit hour enrolled? So for a 3 credit hour course you should anticipate spending 6 hours on additional work outside of class. So by the Carnegie definition for one class you'd spend 9 hours a week working on that course. \n\nIf you have a 12 credit hour course load (~4 courses), you work 36 hours a week on school work. If you're enrolled im 15 credit hours (~5 courses), 45 hours per week is expected. Most universities are set on this system. Of course, Carnegie credit hours were designed pre-must work to pay for college years. \n\nHere's a summary of the Carnegie unit and why they decided not to change it in 2015.\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/29/carnegie-foundation-says-credit-hour-although-flawed-too-important-discard",

Some of us don't get feedback during the course and with Zoom boxes it's hard to gage how students think things are working.",
