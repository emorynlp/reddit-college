My brain still feels like fudisjxbcidksskzncjcjak sometimes (finals week lmao) but being able to process that and have the support of a good therapist is SO helpful and important. College matters for like 4 or 5 years, but your mental health is gonna stick with you for the rest of your life (at least that\u2019s what my therapist tells me a million times every session)",
