  "text": "I really thought I just needed to take college math and English for the prerequisite because that\u2019s what it says\u2026. Then next year I can finally take a class for my major but my schedule for next semester doesn\u2019t have it. I told my counselor my major and she said I\u2019ll just take these other classes for the next 2 years to get enough credits for an associate's degree and when I switch over to a university I can take my major. I was hoping to start learning and experiencing my career shortly but I\u2019m going to be 2 years behind. In high school, I was taught that I could just pick any class I wanted. I\u2019m bummed out. Has this ever happened to anyone?",
