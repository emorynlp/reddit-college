  "text": "I really thought I just needed to take college math and English for the prerequisite because that\u2019s what it says\u2026. Then next year I can finally take a class for my major but my schedule for next semester doesn\u2019t have it. I told my counselor my major and she said I\u2019ll just take these other classes for the next 2 years to get enough credits for an associate's degree and when I switch over to a university I can take my major. I was hoping to start learning and experiencing my career shortly but I\u2019m going to be 2 years behind. In high school, I was taught that I could just pick any class I wanted. I\u2019m bummed out. Has this ever happened to anyone?",

I'll finish my associates in the spring with all of my basics done and when I transfer to university I'll be in my major only courses.",

          "text": "Ah well glad I\u2019m not the only one. I\u2019m a animal science major. Are you taking other sciences? I take biology and will be taking chemistry. I just feel like a fraud for some reason when I say my major bc I see freshman already taking the classes for their field.  And I feel like ppl will think I\u2019m somewhat of an expert on this and it\u2019d be awkward to say well I\u2019m not taking the class rn.",

              "text": "I've taken chemistry 1 and I'm in 2 currently. As well I've taken physics 1 and A&P. So definitely had some science course but truly nothing related to my degree title. I try not to think about it too much because I know I still have two and a half years full of science courses ahead of me. I definitely have felt like a fraud a couple of times, but I just try to remember that I'm getting the same education, just maybe not in the same order.",
