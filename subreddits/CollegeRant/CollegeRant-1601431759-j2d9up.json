I\u2019ve met ppl that are taking 15-18 credits and doing a lot of ECs and having those credits b majority major credits and not GenEds. I even met a guys whose a math/cs double major taking 15credits of pure math n engineering and also working almost full time every week and he barely batted an eye about it. Another girly Ik taking 17 credits and on the cheer team and RA. Like I am taking 13 credits alone and I am struggling HARD they\u2019re tuff courses but I\u2019ve never started a semester this poorly before in my life, I recently had a mental breakdown about it and almost withdrew the entire semester, but now I\u2019m slowly getting back on my feet but once again slacking on my work. I will say I\u2019m not just taking courses, I\u2019m the prez of a club, an RA, and working at a lab on campus, and will soon b (fingers crossed) VP of another club (but at least hold some leadership position there). But Bc of that mental breakdown my parents told me to take things slow but I feel so stupid compared to everyone else I just feel like I need to take on more ECs but IK that grades matter the most. Idk. I can\u2019t fucking study and I just want to put my energy into these ECs that interest me, I\u2019ve started taking meds for concentration and anxiety but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re working... I haven\u2019t even gotten any studying done today or yesterday idk wtf I\u2019m doing. I feel like I\u2019m going to fucking fail the semester and I just CANT I just cannot I know that I NEED this 4.0 bc I have dream schools that I want to attend but fuck man I just can\u2019t sit down and fucking study.\n\n\n.....sorry this is so long didnt think this would turn into a rant.", "author": null, "created": 1601431759, "retrieved": 1632951384, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 52, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g76nbrf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j2d9up/anyone_else_feel_stupid_for_not_taking_a_lot_of/g76nbrf/", "text": "Who gives a shit what others are doing?", "author": "shitheadboot1122", "created": 1601482157, "upvotes": 1}, "g76h87v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j2d9up/anyone_else_feel_stupid_for_not_taking_a_lot_of/g76h87v/", "text": "Haha it feels as if im the one who wrote this.

Four classes is as much as I know I can manage and do well with; didn't help that I only decided my major finally in my first semester of my sophomore year, so although I was nearly through with gen eds, I hadn't begun taking *any* major required courses yet. I even tried taking 5 classes versus my normal 4 this semester, only to find out I double dipped in one of the classes and ended up dropping it so I wouldn't have a W on my record because 1) this semester seems to have SO much more work than my prior ones (for example, I've got over 3+ textbooks for two classes when normally it'd maybe be 1 primary book and a secondary for supplementary material, what gives?) and 2) there was no point in taking a class I already had credit for.

You definitely aren't alone.  This semester has been pretty terrible, and my friends in bio, chem, and engineering majors have been failing classes left and right.\n\nYou are involved in plenty of things outside of academics (in my opinion).  This alone proves dedication to not only classes but also your interests and the college community.\n\nI've known some students to take fewer credits per semester in order to ace them all, and also students who prefer/need to pile on responsibilities (like working full time and taking a ton of credits).  With the latter, oftentimes grades take a dive.  Some of the people you mention comparing yourself to are probably sacrificing at least some of their grades in order to keep up with everything they have going on.\n\nIf your goal is to maintain the 4.0, don't feel like you are slacking at all by not having a job/ being in a million different clubs/ etc.  And don't let anyone make you feel stupid for doing this: keeping up a 4.0 in order to achieve your goal of getting into your dream school is just as valid as everyone else's goals.\n\nBe kind to yoself.
