I was a really good student in high school. Never cheated, was in the top 20 of my class, studied for hours every day, and did really well in AP classes. Got straight A\u2019s, didn\u2019t want anything below a B, etc. I\u2019m a sophomore in college now and I feel so much worse. Online classes have destroyed my work ethic. I\u2019m happy just to pass my classes, and I have no motivation to study when all exams are open note (and realistically, open internet if there\u2019s no supervision). I\u2019m an engineering student (though I\u2019m changing my major next year) and I feel so stupid compared to my peers and the standard we\u2019re held to. I feel like a complete failure, and I don\u2019t know where this went wrong. 17 year old me would be so appalled by 20 year old me. Anyone feel the same??\n\nTL;DR I was a much better student in high school than I am in college, and I hate myself for it. Anyone relate?", "author": "toastedmeat_", "created": 1619418453, "retrieved": 1632950905, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gw5ly20": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/myr9rs/im_disappointed_by_the_student_ive_become/gw5ly20/", "text": "I felt this way when I was going to college in the late 2000\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know why I was in school, I wasn\u2019t interested in it I just went because my parent stressed it. I ended up super depressed and unproductive and felt exactly what you describe. \n\nI\u2019m now 32 years old and back in school for something I\u2019m truly excited about, and it\u2019s an entirely different world. I have a goal and a purpose that gives the classes meaning. I feel like myself again after over a decade. \n\nTo be honest I think your early 20s is too early to know what the hell you want to do, which is why what you describe is so common. Just remember you are still that high achiever, but you have to find what pushes you...and that may take time. \n\nIf taking a break from school is possible it may be what you need. This is also a particularly rough year with everything going on, it\u2019s understandable you\u2019re burnt out.", "author": "alonebadfriendgood", "created": 1619604304, "upvotes": 2}, "gw0a72c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/myr9rs/im_disappointed_by_the_student_ive_become/gw0a72c/", "text": "Same here.
