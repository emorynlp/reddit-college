  "text": "words really can\u2019t describe how to really feel . I\u2019m hella exhausted. \n\nTwo Mondays ago my campus apartment flooded ( The people above us ran their water on for hours causing damage \ud83d\ude12) . My stuff wasn\u2019t damaged luckily but the school temporarily moved us and now we have a another campus apartment. That week literally they were moving us to place to place which means me and my roommates had to move EVERYTHING of our belongs. That week I didn\u2019t do any work or very little it was hectic. \n\nLast week I\u2019m playing catch up. \n\nNot to blame the flood but really messed me up. Now in this one particular class I\u2019m behind in and more and more keeps piling on me .\n\n\nAlthough I\u2019m good in my other classes . \n\nThis week on this past Tuesday, I LOST MY CAR KEYS . Had them in my hand and must have slipped out. All day Wednesday I was looking for them. Had to ask my roommate to drive me home and get the spare car key from my mom. \n\nI\u2019m a fashion design major and I\u2019m taking a collections class where I\u2019m doing my senior collection making garments. We had a critique and basically my teacher didn\u2019t like my garment and I have to redo it. And I couldn\u2019t really say anything to her other than if I want a good grade I just have to suck it up and do it. And redo the prototype which doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. But I still have to remake my garment . \n\nTo today campus security found my keys!! \n\n\nAnd I also have a part time job . It\u2019s very tiring .",

      "text": "It sounds like you have had quite the two weeks! Dealing with a flood, on top of school work and a part-time job, would be exhausting.\n\nIf you haven't already, you might consider emailing the professor of the class you are struggling to catch up in. Explain the flooding situation and they may consider giving you extensions on deadlines. It's worth a shot. \n\nI hope things get less stressful for you soon.",
