Students may have straight As in lit classes in HS without ever having read a single book, or without being able to write a coherent paragraph throughout high school.

If you force someone to waste their time for a year\u2019s worth of credits, that\u2019s like 50k extra the school gets before you even \u201cstart\u201d anything. \n\nFor \u201cbreadth\u201d of knowledge concerns, or \u201ccritical thinking\u201d concerns\u2014 I disagree that these are actually valid reasons to force a year\u2019s worth of gen-eds.

Most colleges and universities were founded on the concept of [liberal education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_education#/search) (also called \"liberal arts education\") meaning that in addition to discipline-specific knowledge and skills, college should also provide graduates with a broad range of knowledge and transferable skills (e.g., critical and creative thinking, engaged and informed citizenship) that can only come from learning across different programs and fields. \n\nLiberal arts and the humanities help students (and thus professionals) consider the ethical and practical implications of their work, understand the context in which their work is situated, and thus create new and better things that learn from the past. It also helps people learn about historical and ongoing societal issues and recognize, for example, when harmful rhetoric is being used to spread falsehoods (\"fake news\") or propaganda, or how to address issues of structural inequality.\n\nEdit to add: no, your coworkers won't care about what you know about \"some tomb,\" but think instead about the broader lessons that course and others have provided. They help you communicate more effectively (especially with people outside your specific field/subfield) and build tools that account for (and maybe even counteract) societal issues or concerns.
