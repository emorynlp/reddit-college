I have a professor that refuses to teach an algorithms / data principles class with anything other than PDFs and PowerPoint slides. (Read: no video lectures or links to YouTube). Same professor gave me a 0 on an assignment that I didn't turn in even though I told him I was going through losing 2 family members nearly within 24 hours due to covid, only to come back home and get food poisoning. My two other classes are not hard, just very time consuming. .\n\nI'm so afraid that I am spending entirely too much brain power / energy / time trying to learn this algorithm class that I can't do much for my capstone. And if I don't do anything for the capstone then I will fail, obviously, and this is my last semester of my bachelor's degree. \n\nDuring the time that I was away dealing with the loss of my two family members, I left my group with the necessary setup done to begin working on the project. I also made myself available to them should they have any questions. Got back home and the project was in the same state it was in when I had last worked on it. \n\nThis semester SUCKS!", "author": "Littlebitt95", "created": 1631905041, "upvotes": 1}, "hd6hhg7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pposyw/fall_semester_is_kicking_my_ass/hd6hhg7/", "text": "I\u2019ve got two \u201cmajor\u201d quizzes, three exams, a 1300 word paper, and a lab report all due within the same seven days.
