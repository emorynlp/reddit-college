I email them and call them and they email me like 10 days later. It looks like my aid hasn't been processed yet cause my bill is still like 19K$ and the bill is supposed to be paid soon. Emailed them and just got the \"you'll get your awards soon\" yeah, okay. I have to pay whatever in like how many days? 12 days lol. this shit is so stupid. If there something wrong with my aid, how am i supposed to know vs. back when you were able to go to financial aid and figure it out there and then. Why can't they be fucking lenient this semester knowing whats going on -.-\n\nHow can we be proactive and \"responsible adults\" as we are told we are supposed to be when in fact we can't even talk to anybody about it to be proactive.", "author": "Lelricaa", "created": 1595526203, "retrieved": 1632843542, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"fzfb0u1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/hwk7n3/is_anybody_else_having_trouble_with_their/fzfb0u1/", "text": " Sheesh tell me about it.
