The school was a safety for me when I applied out of high school and I attend this specific institution for financial reasons. I applied as a social science major but after my freshman year decided that it wasn\u2019t a good fit and looked into other majors. Unfortunately, my school has its head very far up its own ass and most of the more \u201cchallenging\u201d majors are locked behind a selective application process. This on its own isn\u2019t surprising to me as alot\nof colleges and universities do this. The reason I say my school has its head up its ass is because they make it damn near IMPOSSIBLE to switch to any sort of stem or business major unless you\u2019ve applied in straight of out highschool. I decided I wanted to switch into business and grinded my ass off in the \u201cpredictor courses\u201d they made me take as part of the application process and finished my second semester with a 3.9 GPA. Well, apparently thats not fucking good enough and I just wasted an entire year and a couple thousand dollars worth of credits for NOTHING. What bothers me the most about this is for this specific school I\u2019m fairly confident that I could have gotten into the business program had I applied directly out of high school given my high school course history and my academic performance. So what\u2019s the fucking point of punishing kids for not knowing what they want to do coming directly out of high school and making it literally fucking impossible to explore certain majors and see if they\u2019re a good fit because it certainly beats me. Looks like im gonna have to keep applying and keep getting rejected and end up graduating with a useless major that I don\u2019t even like! Hooray! I\u2019m going to talk to an advisor soon about a different program im interested in thats also locked behind an application process. If that doesn\u2019t work out for me I guess I\u2019ll have to consider transferring to a different school that would be more open to me exploring and studying what I want. I\u2019m just fucking pissed off about this whole situation.", "author": "secretpepper", "created": 1596102382, "retrieved": 1632950999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fzr1nsp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i0j8n6/whats_the_point_of_being_in_college_if_i_cant/fzr1nsp/", "text": "Go to community college, it's all cheaper and online anyway, and then transfer to a different uni with the business major \n\nOr take other classes, and realize something else you like / are good at\n\nMaybe you go to trade school instead and realize you like that best", "author": "P_poperah", "created": 1596130967, "upvotes": 2}, "fzq6x51": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i0j8n6/whats_the_point_of_being_in_college_if_i_cant/fzq6x51/", "text": "Honestly, this is what I hate about more \"safety\" type schools and why I ended up transferring out of the one I went to straight out of high school.
