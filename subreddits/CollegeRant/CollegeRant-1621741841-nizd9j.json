I thought things would be amazing transferring to a new university from my community college. But doing that seemed to open a huge can of worms that basically means that I failed 2 of 5 of my fall classes and 4 of 5 of my spring semester classes. Fall was my first time ever being full online and I tried to push through. I thought I could save myself in the spring but no. Not only trying to get through online school  and then figuring out that I had heart failure the week before my fall final exams. Timing was absolutely horrible. Then for my spring semester two weeks after the drop date I learned that my heart function had decreased even further from the test done two months prior and I learned that I had Marfan\u2019s syndrome. Then my cardiologist literally talking outside the examination room saying this man is in trouble didn\u2019t help. After more testing it was finally determined that I just needed surgery to try and fix this. Trying to push through exams a week after open heart surgery was not the best idea. And now I  don\u2019t know what to do. has anyone had something like this happen?", "author": "Intelligent_Phase_74", "created": 1621741841, "retrieved": 1632842332, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gz4l6el": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nizd9j/im_at_my_lowest_point/gz4l6el/", "text": "Thank you u/Intelligent_Phase_74 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If they don't they are just heartless. I think at my uni I used to go to they have a medical appeal for leave so it might not affect your grades.\n\nThe crazy thing is you learn about how college is and worry trying to work through bureaucracy instead of focusing on your classes. The life experience of having to go through college is a lesson in itself.

I\u2019m so sorry that sound so hard. I\u2019ve had a hard semester as well but I can\u2019t imagine dealing with such intense health issues at the same time.\n\nMy best advice would be to take a gap semester at the least or Maybe take less classes ? Online school is difficult in general especially with lots of credits. \nI wish I had better advice Or more to say but I seriously think less classes at a time is your best bet if you wanna stay doing school but also lower workload and stress.", "author": "Cooch_2119", "created": 1621746447, "upvotes": 6}}}
