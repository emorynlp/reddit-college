I was so proud of myself for going and getting my bachelors and as a Criminology major I technically have no choice because all my career options require a BA. Was very \u201cnice\u201d to wake up one morning and check my account to see that almost 2000$ was left for me to pay out of pocket. I\u2019m a 3.5 honors student and couldn\u2019t get any scholarships. I have no support from family because I\u2019m trans and they refuse to be around me. Like I don\u2019t know if anyone has been through this but genuinely what do I do\u2014 I\u2019m 25\u2013 people 21 already have their degrees. I work at a petsmart like I have never been so lost I guess. Growing up I\u2019ve always been in school. Even when I took a gap I was self studying. I would love to work with juveniles but I can\u2019t without a bachelors. This sounds so gross and whiny of me, but has anyone dealt with this? Where you realized you can\u2019t obtain your dream degree anymore? I was thinking of just getting my associates in criminology and at least I\u2019ll have 2 associates right?\n\nTL;DR\n\nI found out I can\u2019t afford school and now I don\u2019t know where to go from here.", "author": "tendencytoharm", "created": 1631626512, "retrieved": 1632841064, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hctgn9b": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/po2whw/i_had_to_drop_out_and_now_i_dont_know_what_to_do/hctgn9b/", "text": "Thank you u/tendencytoharm for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
