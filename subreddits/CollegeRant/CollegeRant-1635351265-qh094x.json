  "text": "And the project is semester long...There is just this power imbalance; where and when we meet and stuff is up to them. They wanna meet and start working last minute, I can't really have a say cause the boyfriend is like \"calm down\" and the girlfriend doesn't say anything. When we are discussing the project, they talk back and forth like I'm not there or the guy just keeps looking at his girlfriend while I'm trying to get an idea in and it's just frustrating. Dude's also one of those guys who does half the work wrong and his girlfriend won't say anything and I can't voice frustration cause it would be 2 against one. And I thought maybe I'd make friends this year but they just stick together and don't even come up to me and ask about any updates.",

      "text": "Definitely contact your professors and let them know. I had this same problem last year online and was able to email my professors the chat room messages my two partners was saying and not doing or barley doing any work at all. I received a A and extra credit points on my final exam. My two team members received a D and a F. One did some work but wasn't valid and the other waited last minute to say something when it was due in two days.",

          "text": "the thing is that they act friendly and we end up getting the work done and a good grade but it's always so full of mistakes on their side i have to spend hours proofreading. We'd meet up and I'd get all the work done in an hour and their joking together and leaving things till last minute. I don't want to fight with them or have any tension with anyone but they're so inconsiderate. What happened with you though shows me that something can be done. Thank you.",
