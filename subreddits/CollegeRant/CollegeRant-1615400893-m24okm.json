I studied all night and into the morning so my brain is fried and can barely hold in the information. The exam is worth 40% of my grade so just feeling pretty depressed about it. Have you guys bounced back after failing a huge test? If so, how?\n\nEdit Update: Went terribly, probably got around 25-40%. The good news is that the whole class seemed to be struggling based off their expressions.

On February 19th, 2020, i studied for six hours straight before taking a Spanish midterm the next day. The Spring 2020 semester of college was rough. I bombed that midterm exam and also failed the final exam, but filled out a pass/fail form so that my GPA wouldn\u2019t be affected by the negative test scores. You\u2019re not the only one who has screwed up on an important test. I would suggest reaching out to your professor  or TA first to try to get a retake. On a couple of occasions, i have gotten extensions on work and such due to some mental health issues, which the professor accepted as an extenuating circumstance.\n\nIf you have experienced any extenuating circumstances that put you at a disadvantage during the midterm exam, you can use that when you contact your professor or TA.", "author": "DConMont505", "created": 1615419194, "upvotes": 2}, "gqhxmqd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m24okm/gonna_fail_my_midterm/gqhxmqd/", "text": "Failing a test can be one of the most terrifying things that could happen to any student.

Every week make sure that you know your content well (I like to make outlines on google docs so I can keep the notes for the content that week in one physical place). Taking the notes will help you retain the information better. That way, when the final comes up, you have notes to study that you already took and it'll be more of a refresher. You just really have to make sure you understand the content when making the notes. \n\nFor ex. If there's an important word and definition you need to know, put both in your notes then also put an example that the word would be used in or examples that go with the word. Type how it's used. The more you find ways to understand what you're actually reading the better. It's too late to change the past but it's not too late to fix your future.
