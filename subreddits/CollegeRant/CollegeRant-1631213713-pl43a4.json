I went from a test-less class with a rate my professor 1.5/5 with many saying \u2018run\u2019 and \u2018gpa killer\u2019. I swapped into a class with test heavy grading and stricter homework grading, but with kinder ratings and no red flags. \n\nI already changed my work schedule and am setting it in stone, but I\u2019m also anxious for myself. I\u2019m a 3.95 gpa student only able to attend college while working 25 hours and keeping my grades that high. \n\nIf I get a single bad grade I am royally screwed. My anxiety is through the roof, and I want to do the best that I can. I fear this class will be the death of me and my academic career, it\u2019s an algabraic and trigonometric physics class with elements of biology incorporated. I am at 16 credit hours including physics lab and a research block, so 21 hours total. I also commute around 10km via bike.\n\nFor the past 8 hours I\u2019ve been having slightly less than an anxiety attack, cool/numb, pit in stomach, only offset by cbd gummie I had after I made the swap. How do I focus on doing well without enducing panic in myself, going complete burnout, or risking bad grades like a b- or worse?", "author": "Topazz410", "created": 1631213713, "retrieved": 1632948591, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hdi86t0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pl43a4/how_to_deal_with_college_anxiety/hdi86t0/", "text": "dont take your anxiety too far worse i did this and it ruined my sleep for good and health too i regret too much dont do it your health is most important thing you have than studying", "author": "lomar911", "created": 1632082537, "upvotes": 2}, "hce9hog": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pl43a4/how_to_deal_with_college_anxiety/hce9hog/", "text": "Stop fixating on GPA.
