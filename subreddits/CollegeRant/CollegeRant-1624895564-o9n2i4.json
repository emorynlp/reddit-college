He will input the dates from whenever he first made the course and refuses to change it for any other semester/terms. All the canvas due dates say \"February 2nd-May 3rd\" when this is a Summer B course. He put out a disclaimer that we have to refer to the syllabus for the correct due dates. Just really annoying and makes it a little harder to keep track. \n\nI can already tell this class is going to be a headache if he can't even make a simple fix like this.\n\n**EDIT**: Professor won\u2019t even correct the dates for Pearson textbook either!

So I\u2019ve had this happen before and by no means was my teacher lazy. Took him a while to get it changed as he has a lot of things to do on top of teaching the class. My teacher is the welding department chair, meaning that he is in charge of how all the money is spent in the welding department. He eventually changed it but because he has other responsibilities as well it took him a few weeks. Just really depends on the teacher.

Guilty. Yes, it\u2019s not super difficult to change. I copied a few quizzes over for this summer B semester from summer A and changed them all. The problem was that even after double-and triple-checking, one fell through the cracks. I got an email with a question about it and fixed it, gave a longer grace period for literally no reason because I wasn\u2019t due yet and apologized.\n\nYou know it\u2019s literally just a list of stuff on a page for us, yes? It\u2019s not easy to just pick out each due date and it doesn\u2019t update the order as we go. Canvas is clumsy af on the prof side.\nYou\u2019re aware that we didn\u2019t all major in computer science and Covid forced us to become experts outside of our fields? Because students tell me all the time they need extra whatever (time, assistance)  because they don\u2019t understand how to use computers (happy to help in that regard).\n\nSometimes we copy from the original which may have been many semesters ago because it was a perfect template and then we edit the specific quiz or assignment according to the context of that class, and forget some little thing like a due date (which is on a different page).\n\nJust a friendly reminder (and go right ahead and downvote this professor to oblivion) but we are actual human beings too. We haven\u2019t had the easiest time and we are very aware that you all haven\u2019t either. I love my job, I absolutely love teaching young adults and I have a great relationship with my students. Every due date you have means at least 30 for me. So you bashing someone for something small like this which you could literally just send an email to get it quickly fixed honestly says a hell of a lot more about you, as a student, than it does the professor. \u201cSigns of a lazy professor\u201d indeed! I wonder what kind of image you have put forth in your undergrad career thus far.\n\nETA: I was responding more to the comments by others that your professor just didn\u2019t change due dates on canvas (for whatever reason). But that it was just lazy without any contact about it. Apologies for that. I do tell students to use only MY calendar for due dates which is a separate, very detailed doc that I put together for each semester, no matter how short. Just in case there\u2019s a mistake. So I definitely apologize for that. I was reading way too many of those other comments before I responded. You obviously reached out and yep, they proceeded to just be lazy. That\u2019s shitty. I\u2019ll keep my original as it is, though so I can take my lumps when it\u2019s deserved.", "author": "IntenseProfessor", "created": 1624946862, "upvotes": 1}, "h3djc0u": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o9n2i4/signs_of_a_lazy_professor_when_the_canvas_due/h3djc0u/", "text": "It literally takes me five minutes to update due dates in Canvas.
