  "text": "I am so alone. I commute to school, so I've been trying to burn the candle at both ends to get the \"college experience\", but I think I might just be kidding myself. It's been a two full months, and I haven't made any friends at all. This shit sucks so hard.\n\nDoesn't help that I have social anxiety, and am really awkward around people in general. I want to meet my people, and make connections. I am a bit girl crazy at this point in my life, so I also strongly desire to have a girlfriend. It fills me with jealousy to see friend groups and couples on campus just living it up and seemingly enjoying their college experience.\n\nI feel like such a fraud almost every day I go there. Even though my grades are good, I feel like such an idiot most of the time. I feel like most of the students in my classes have a way better understanding and know what to do, whereas I am clueless to such a degree that I probably appear to others as mentally challenged. The idea of dropping out has gone across my mind quite a bit, but I feel like I gotta stick it out to have a good chance at life and not be a fucking McDonald's fryboy or a suicidal Walmart employee. \n\nNot even sure why I still show up to class, because I barely understand the lectures, and just go into low self-esteem fueled daydreams.\n\nFor context, I am 23. So I feel like being older is kind of a barrier to entry with all these baby faced teenage students. I regret not starting university earlier, but I obviously can't make up the time lost.\n\nAll I do is go to class, go to the library to study, but it's not a very good social outlet since most people are off to themselves studying or in groups. Other than that, I try to go to the gym, but I haven't really met many people there either. So, I spend the entire day by myself, and have not a soul to talk to, it gets really lonely and puts a damper on my mental health.\n\nIt's dawning on me how overrated this whole college shit is. I wish I could just live the rest of my life in a cottage out of a Peter Rabbit book. Tired of all this, I just want to have a cozy simple life and be done with it. Is that too much to ask? Fuck me.",

Reach out to your professors, identify some potential mentors, and express interest in your field of study. Commuters have it hard, but it\u2019s not impossible to make friends.

      "text": "Hey hey hey\n\nNot sure where to start with this, but just relax. Chill tf out! Honestly, right now just close your eyes and take a few breaths. While you're doing that, think about the things you want out of life. But try not to stress over them in this moment. Do that for how long you'd like.\n\nReady? Well let's sum up your situation:\n\n* Loneliness (No friends in 2 months of beginning school)\n* College Student (Commuter)\n* Social Anxiety (I have/had that)\n* Social Awkwardness\n* \"girl crazy\" + wants friend group\n* Has imposter syndrome and insecure what he doesn't know\n* Library + Gym are the places you frequent outside of class\n* 23 years old; insecure that he's an older student in college\n* Believes college is overrated\n* Doesn't understand lectures\n\nAlright now, that's a lot. But you're human so don't be too hard on yourself. Two months of school has already passed. You're not getting those back, so don't dwell on those if you are. Yes, that would've been the best time to mingle with other first-years. But I do get that there could be such a social divide with those \"baby faced teens\" fresh outta high school. But there are students around your age. Some of which are going back to school a bit later than other people. Honestly speaking, 23 isn't old at all. And you're too much inside your own head. You shouldn't be concerned about \"being too old.\" No one gives af. It is an understandable insecurity to have but no one cares as much as you do. Not everyone is the same. We all have our own journey and need to stop comparing ourselves to others in ways that make us think bad about ourselves. Also, college may be overrated for you but someone at the same school is having a totally different experience than you. Some are living the experience you want to have. I am in college myself, and I am lonely all the time. I do make an effort to see friends a few times outta the week to eat or just do work in the library.  Previous years it was worse for me, but I am making an effort to be more social. And you can't expect the \"college experience\" to come to you as it is what you make of it. You decide your fate essentially. You have social anxiety and that is rough. I know personally and ugh it fucking sucks! Baby steps nonetheless. Your goal for the month could be making a friend in each class. But break that down by week and/or day for example. A friend that you can eat together with, study with,  go to the gym with would be nice. But you're gonna have to seek that out and find that amongst a different people if anything. Take interest in any clubs/orgs that you like and go to their events. Better social outlet than the library and class at least. Get social media of people you're acquainted with and maybe through text you'll be able to make a friend.\n\nAlso, your number one priority is getting your degree. So definitely pay attention, go to office hours, tutoring, etc to understand and to catch yourself up to speed. Learn from your classmates even if they know something you don't. Everyone graduates leaving with the same ifo pretty much since they learned the saem things. Ik your girl crazy, but focus on school. Not to say you can't have something going on with a girl but be safe and smart. I'm sure you don't wanna be in your room \"girl crazy\" and start busting nuts on yourself. That's no way to live man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart off slow, set your own social goals. But remember your academic goals take priority. Get out of your comfort zone. You'll have your good and bad days, but take care of yourself and your mental. Sucks being alone and feeling like your missing out on something you so desperately crave.\n\nDON\"T FUCKING GIVE UP!!!! KEEP PUSHING FORWARD!!! DON'T QUIT! GET SOME FUCKING CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF TO FUCKING EXCEED THESE GOALS! Find that shit! If you feel you are lacking and want to get better than find it within yourself because the shit is there inside if you! College isn't everything but you're paying for it so better find a way to make the most of it and fucking grow. \"You're either getting better or you're getting the worse. And if you're the same, then you're getting worse.\" - Goggins\n\nAnyway tho, this is too long and I'm tired lol. Hope this helps! Also, do yourself a favor and go on YouTube and watch this: [https://youtu.be/d-pBUJJDJXA](https://youtu.be/d-pBUJJDJXA). If you know anything about Goggins then yk\n\nP.S. Goodluck and take care :))",

And honestly before today and even still so I felt the same way but trust me you aren\u2019t alone. \n\nIk it might be harder for you to start convos since you have social anxiety but literally everyone questions if they\u2019re awkward or not, and even if you are abnormally awkward most people are too busy to remember you specifically. \n\nAs for not knowing what\u2019s happening you\u2019re not alone at all, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the lectures/classes aren\u2019t really there to teach us the information in depth but rather just expose us to it in a general sense. Going over the math textbook before class, making sure you read the chapters assigned for the section, and making sure you go over your notes within 24hrs will help. \n\nI think I really struggled with this bc in high school classes were always so small so while doing work I was always getting verification on if what I was doing was right or wrong, whereas in college there is no check for understanding or anything.",
