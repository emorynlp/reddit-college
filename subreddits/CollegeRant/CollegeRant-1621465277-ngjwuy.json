  "text": "So every since my sophomore year where i tanked from a 3.8 to a 2.5 I've been on the road to recovery. It has been going so well that I've managed to get to a 2.8 and this semester was supposed to boost me back to a 3.0. From the fall i gained a 2.82 and i was aiming high only to do my two summer classes and end with a 3.0 or 3.2. either way i would have been good but here comes finals i do extremely well on all of them and here we get to final grades. 3 A- ok no biggie and then the horrible C or the 76.87. now my dilemma starts a 76.87 off of my school grading scale is a C+ so i email my professor saying \"there's an issue with my final grade\" it should be a C+ not a C based off of the scale. You would think my professor would say \"oh you're right\" nope turns out she uses her own grading scale so for me to get a C+ i needed 0.25 to get a C+. I really needed that C+ because either way i would have been in the 3 range because those As would have carried me. So here I am with a 2.88 and summer classes and if i get two As I'm ending off with a 2.99 instead of a 3 great. But hey I'm graduating in August and applying for grad school maybe hard fuck me",
