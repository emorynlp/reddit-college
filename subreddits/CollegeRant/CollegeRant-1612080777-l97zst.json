I don't know what your major is, but in most of hte humanities and social sciences, it is pretty common to have discussion based classes (that, yes, can sometimes get into tangent-land) that are predicated on the assumption that you've done the reading(s) prior to class and that you will then integrate the discussion of the material into your later assessments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor perspective, I teach 100-level intro classes and 300-level electives in a social science. In my upper level classes, I hardly lecture at all. We discuss the readings I assign to the class, and sometimes I prompt students to think about how the readings could apply to their own personal lives and experiences. Sometimes I'll give a brief and pretty basic example from my own life to sort of get the ball rolling (nothing too personal, maybe something like \"If I had to answer this question, I might say that the author's description of the gendered forms of communication resonated with my experiences of how differently my mother and father communicated with me when I was a kid. Anyone else?\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo maybe you need to realign your expectations with how college actually works. At this point in the process, you should be able to think for yourself.
