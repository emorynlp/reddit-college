  "text": "It seems that in all my difficult and more advanced classes, the instructors will literally never teach us anything of importance in the lecture. They always go on about their personal lives and experiences the ENTIRE time.\n\nEven though there is nothing I can do about it, I am just getting tired of it because it feels like it is such a massive waste of time. Even more importantly, studying just becomes a time consuming guessing game because they only ever manage to cover 2-3 things in the lecture that are relevant to the tests, quizzes, and exams. \n\nAt this point, I am just paying for a 1 hour and 15 minute long group conversation lmaooo",

For me, I expect my students to come to class prepared. I should never have to tell them what the book say because they should have already read it. Many of my students seem surprised by this.",

Some courses quite literally throw the book out the window and simply list a \"required reading\" textbook you can either break the bank to read maybe only once in your life or just pull it from the internet somewhere.\n\nGod only knows why some high level 300 courses do this, but some profs throw the book out the window and end up making their own asinine interpretations of the textbook readings and concepts and end up confusing every student alike. It doesn't matter how the textbook does it, only how the professor wants to do it.\n\nUsually the only way to survive these classes is to either suck it up and constantly waste time reclarifying each and every question you have during office hours in an already-long queue and then digging up connections with past students who had these types of professors. They're the only ones who understand what the hell's going on in their outdated mindsets.",

      "text": "Honestly, I can't say because I haven't been in your classes, but the expectation that your professors will spoon feed you the information in an upper level class is misguided. I don't know what your major is, but in most of hte humanities and social sciences, it is pretty common to have discussion based classes (that, yes, can sometimes get into tangent-land) that are predicated on the assumption that you've done the reading(s) prior to class and that you will then integrate the discussion of the material into your later assessments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor perspective, I teach 100-level intro classes and 300-level electives in a social science. In my upper level classes, I hardly lecture at all. We discuss the readings I assign to the class, and sometimes I prompt students to think about how the readings could apply to their own personal lives and experiences. Sometimes I'll give a brief and pretty basic example from my own life to sort of get the ball rolling (nothing too personal, maybe something like \"If I had to answer this question, I might say that the author's description of the gendered forms of communication resonated with my experiences of how differently my mother and father communicated with me when I was a kid. Anyone else?\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo maybe you need to realign your expectations with how college actually works. At this point in the process, you should be able to think for yourself. Learning is not about you just sitting there passively waiting for information to be dumped into your head.",
