I know that it's school, and I can't expect school to be super exciting all the time in the same way that my future career probably won't be super fun and exciting all the time. I just want to learn new and interesting information that I can use in the future.\n\nSo tell me why I'm a Junior and only now are a majority of my classes actually useful for the future? My University literally refused to take my transfer math credits because \"they're very specific about what kind of math I need for my major.\" I'm a Communication + Social Media major?? We pretty much never use anything past basic math. Why'd I have to pay for an extra math class? Or science. I think science is very interesting and important, but why do I have so many required science credits? When am I ever going to use geology in my future career? Why can't I tailor my degree more specifically to my goals? I've already got my major, a certificate, and a minor, plus a foreign language. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I've got some really exciting (by my standards... not sure everyone would consider a class on analytics and metrics exciting) classes that I'm really looking forward to, but so much of college feels like redundant busywork. Why am I paying to do this, again??", "author": "subversiveradiohost", "created": 1631804547, "retrieved": 1632841037, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hd34ebp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppf0l2/forget_fun_i_just_want_useful/hd34ebp/", "text": "Thank you u/subversiveradiohost for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
