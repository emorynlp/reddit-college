AND I DIDNT EVEN CHEAT", "text": "So I am currently on my final semester of school. I took a final the other day and during the exam the proctor was mentioning she can hear and see typing (webcams are on our face and mics are on). Next thing I know I get an email stating I have been reported to the Office of Student Conduct for possible cheating and they will evaluate the zoom recording for evidence of me typing, using multiple screens, and using notes/powerpoints. Mind everyone, I FAILED this exam. Im just at a loss of what to do? Anyone have any ideas? Also just to mention, many students in the zoom had said they didnt hear any typing and if they did it definitely was not as loud as my keyboard which is very clicky and loud!", "author": "annoyedstudent8889", "created": 1621821538, "retrieved": 1632842328, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"gz88sdr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/njmwry/accused_of_cheating_on_an_online_exam_and_i_didnt/gz88sdr/", "text": "Thank you u/annoyedstudent8889 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
