  "text": "So I am currently on my final semester of school. I took a final the other day and during the exam the proctor was mentioning she can hear and see typing (webcams are on our face and mics are on). Next thing I know I get an email stating I have been reported to the Office of Student Conduct for possible cheating and they will evaluate the zoom recording for evidence of me typing, using multiple screens, and using notes/powerpoints. Mind everyone, I FAILED this exam. Im just at a loss of what to do? Anyone have any ideas? Also just to mention, many students in the zoom had said they didnt hear any typing and if they did it definitely was not as loud as my keyboard which is very clicky and loud!",

Once they deemed that there\u2019s no cheating involved, the professor will need to change that failing grade to what you should be getting.",

          "text": "It was reported to them by my professor, so I have a phone call with them tuesday morning. The thing is, I cant possibly see what evidence they could have just from my face you know? Like I dont think they could have any, but at the same time i cant prove i didnt? Like i can say i failed, i can say i look around when i think, but none of those can say 100%. i dont know, i fee like the whole things baseless and targeting me",
