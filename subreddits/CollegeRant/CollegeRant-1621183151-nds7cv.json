I got straight A\u2019s in high school but college has been a completely different story. I was depressed the first couple years and then just lost all interest in doing well. Failure became my normal. \nAs this term was approaching I had no desire to sign up for classes. So I got two jobs. I work on a farm (and i\u2019m getting some credit from that bc it fits my major) and on a food truck. \nI haven\u2019t worked this hard, been this motivated, or been so proud of myself since I can remember. \nI hope when I go back to school in the fall I will be the student that I know I can be. \nBut this has taught me a lot. \nAcademia is so disconnected from actual working and sometimes, people need a fucking break. \nI don\u2019t know I guess I\u2019m saying that if you aren\u2019t a good student that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t a good worker. Hang in there. \nGood luck y\u2019all.", "author": "Slut4Plantz--", "created": 1621183151, "retrieved": 1632950150, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gyeqpng": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nds7cv/quick_epiphany/gyeqpng/", "text": "Exactly work outside school is a breath of fresh air", "author": "ddoomshroom", "created": 1621226147, "upvotes": 2}}}
