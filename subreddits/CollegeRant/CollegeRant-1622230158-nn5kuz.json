I hate it here. I don\u2019t know why I came here, but now I\u2019m stuck. I could\u2019ve went to the Naval Academy or Georgia Tech and I decided to pass on those for here. And my gpa is taking a hit because I have 0 motivation not only because of where I am but also because I\u2019m doing some bull shit major because it is promised to pay well. I don\u2019t know how transferring works, but my 2.8 gpa is not getting me into Annapolis or GT, and now I have a huge regret hanging on my shoulders. I fucked up and just had to vent somewhere so why not here. I want to just drop out and join the military, but I understand the privilege I have to go to college, I might as well not waste it. Fuck, it is going to be a hard grind to graduation.", "author": "ajb1221", "created": 1622230158, "retrieved": 1632949778, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gzzet2o": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nn5kuz/wrong_choice/gzzet2o/", "text": "I would look into transferring.
