Having no money? Having no freedom in life? The professors who think they are WAYYY smarter than they actually are, even though most of them are complete idiots with no legit experience? The fact that 18 year olds are being told \"you have to know what you wanna do with your life right now!\" Staying up late to write an 8 page paper on some bullshit topic that doesn't interest you? Being totally confused and lost as to your life's purpose? \n\nI have to wonder if the people who say \"college is so great\" just have shitty lives or are pining for their youth. Or maybe their brain has blocked out all the shit and only kept the good memories. Or maybe they're just crazy. But regardless, college is NOT the best time of your life - it is an incredibly scary and confusing time, you don't know what's coming up next, you're trapped in classrooms all day, you're shielded from the real world, and you cant pursue things that interest you. \"But in adult world we have to pay bills\" so shut the fuck up and pay the damn bills!! How hard can it be?? At least you actually have money to pay the bills!\n\nSorry, I just had to get that out. I can't wait to be done with the education system in America. 20 wasted years of my life I'll never get back. I can't wait to get on with my life and start doing things I want to do.", "author": null, "created": 1581827466, "retrieved": 1632950949, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"fjiu8tj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/f4lk5b/honestly_fuck_anyone_who_says_college_is_the_best/fjiu8tj/", "text": "I will admit, college is *very* stressful.

As someone else has mentioned, the people who say 'college is the best time of your life' tend to be the partiers who don't care that much about their grades. As someone who is introverted and academically motivated, college is lackluster. Im on the newspaper for business and art but besides that, all other social clubs and involvement seems overrated at school.\n\nIn my opinion, I think everyone needs to experience life to THEIR needs and THEIR wants regardless of the stage of life (upon entering adulthood). Why should 'good times' be exclusive for college? The common misconception of college being the best time of your life stems from not having all adult responsibilities yet and still being able to do 'fun stuff' (drinking, partying, going out late). \n\nI think people also tend to forget the burdens on college kids' shoulders, too. During my parents' time, student debt could be paid with a summer break part time job. That is no longer a reality. Unless you go to community college or have your parents financially support you, student debt will literally cripple you. So, I see the financial aspect of college as debunking the whole 'college is the best time of your life' notion. \n\nNot to mention, once you do take out loans, finding a job in this economy is like a Hunger Games. Its so hard for college kids to find a decent paying job because most entry level positions (ironically) demand prior experience. Getting internships will provide experience but even the internship process is super competitive. It's even worse if the internship happens to not be paid.", "author": "RegalRoyalDragon", "created": 1581834038, "upvotes": 11}, "fhrnbdl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/f4lk5b/honestly_fuck_anyone_who_says_college_is_the_best/fhrnbdl/", "text": "Yeah.
