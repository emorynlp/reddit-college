Therefore, when I submitted my assignment I was under the impression that I hadn\u2019t gone over the word limit, but it turns out that when the marker checked it using Word I\u2019m somehow 7 words over! Yay! Bye bye 5 marks. Apparently there\u2019s nothing they can do because it was not an error on their part - essentially they told me \u2018that sucks \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\u2019 \n\nTL;DR - Google Docs and Word count words differently resulting in me losing 5 marks on my final essay.", "author": "sofuckingsleepy", "created": 1624879202, "retrieved": 1632842166, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"h3b56f3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o9i88p/lost_5_marks_for_something_i_couldnt_control/h3b56f3/", "text": "Thank you u/sofuckingsleepy for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am more understanding of a word count limit versus a minimum, but nonetheless it seems this is something that should have hit a \"margin of forgiveness\" and if you boil down the words, I imagine somewhere there are probably some really simple devices in the paper that increased the word count but did not increase the read time in a meaningful manner. Even in a large class where small increments add up, these classes tend to have TA's that help grade papers and thus the point once again becomes moot.
