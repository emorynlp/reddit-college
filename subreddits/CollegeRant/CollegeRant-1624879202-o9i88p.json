  "text": "So I found out yesterday that Google Docs and Microsoft Word count words differently. Therefore, when I submitted my assignment I was under the impression that I hadn\u2019t gone over the word limit, but it turns out that when the marker checked it using Word I\u2019m somehow 7 words over! Yay! Bye bye 5 marks. Apparently there\u2019s nothing they can do because it was not an error on their part - essentially they told me \u2018that sucks \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\u2019 \n\nTL;DR - Google Docs and Word count words differently resulting in me losing 5 marks on my final essay.",

Especially if your school doesn\u2019t provide you with a subscription to Microsoft Office. If need be, take it to your campus chancellor or president. 5 points may not seem like a big deal, but it\u2019s honestly more about the school treating people fairly than taking the loss.",

      "text": "These kinds of professors are the worst. I am more understanding of a word count limit versus a minimum, but nonetheless it seems this is something that should have hit a \"margin of forgiveness\" and if you boil down the words, I imagine somewhere there are probably some really simple devices in the paper that increased the word count but did not increase the read time in a meaningful manner. Even in a large class where small increments add up, these classes tend to have TA's that help grade papers and thus the point once again becomes moot. I experienced far more power tripping in the academic world than I ever have in the corporate world.",
