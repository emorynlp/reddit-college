Last semester I had a great teacher but he was horrible with constantly changing assignments because it didn\u2019t fit his vision of what the course should be. Our class was the first test group for trying to outline new curriculum standards/course outcomes for that class. It was rough. I like to work ahead, so at first I did. But I\u2019d complete things and then he would rescind the assign and give a new one. So i did the original and the new assignment. I just stopped. Then I started turning things in late because I felt so out of sorts. Not the time to change up course outcomes and definitely not like that. Everyone was a mess between that and COVID crap. \n\nLectures can still happen.  I don\u2019t understand this \u201cgo teach yourself!\u201d mentality. Record a lecture and let us watch it on our time by specific dates. Some colleges have dead professors still teaching because they made great videos and course shells that can be reused and then an adjunct just guides the process.
