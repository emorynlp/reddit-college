(Unless your financial aid is dependent on you taking a certain number of units of course). Don't over extend yourself.

Like for Econs, I\u2019ll get 8/10% for this assessment. Wait no, that\u2019s too high. Maybe I\u2019ll get 7/10% the very least. I think I\u2019m not gonna get high marks for this one. It\u2019s so hard. So I think 6/10% is realistic. Then I\u2019ll end up getting 8.5/10%. It\u2019s like I always think of the worst possible scenarios but in the end everything turns out to be fine. My family have been the victims of my endless rants where I blurt out all my uncertainties with myself. Also, I relate to you A LOT when you say you\u2019re scared of failing a class. Cause that\u2019s sooo me. I always think there\u2019s a possibility I\u2019ll fail a class but in the end I get high distinctions and even got a scholarship! And EVERY TIME after finals, I can\u2019t even enjoy my sem break cause I keep thinking of how much I\u2019m gonna get for each exam. I can\u2019t relax at allll. I\u2019m just ranting cause i want you to know that you\u2019re not alone. cause I always think I\u2019m the only one going through something and no one can relate with me.
