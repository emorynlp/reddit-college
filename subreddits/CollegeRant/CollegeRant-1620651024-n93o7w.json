I can already feel my mental health getting back to normal as I don't have to worry about the stresses of grades, group projects, and doing a lot of homework throughout the week while maintaining a part-time job. I can feel a weight being lifted from my shoulders already. It will get better once you graduate. College will be one of the most stressful time of your life which can definitely have an impact on your mental health. But take care of yourself and it will be better in no time",

Worrying won't give you a better grade, you did your best and now you CAN relax because there is nothing more for you to do to improve the grades. \n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with taking a lighter load of classes. (Unless your financial aid is dependent on you taking a certain number of units of course). Don't over extend yourself. You'll be happier and do better in your classes if you only take on what you know you can do. \n\nCongrats on finishing your exams! Celebrate yourself and the hard work you put into it please. You deserve it.",

Each sem I\u2019ll panic about the grades I\u2019ll get for each assessment for my coursework. I\u2019ll make a forecast of what I think I\u2019ll get. Like for Econs, I\u2019ll get 8/10% for this assessment. Wait no, that\u2019s too high. Maybe I\u2019ll get 7/10% the very least. I think I\u2019m not gonna get high marks for this one. It\u2019s so hard. So I think 6/10% is realistic. Then I\u2019ll end up getting 8.5/10%. It\u2019s like I always think of the worst possible scenarios but in the end everything turns out to be fine. My family have been the victims of my endless rants where I blurt out all my uncertainties with myself. Also, I relate to you A LOT when you say you\u2019re scared of failing a class. Cause that\u2019s sooo me. I always think there\u2019s a possibility I\u2019ll fail a class but in the end I get high distinctions and even got a scholarship! And EVERY TIME after finals, I can\u2019t even enjoy my sem break cause I keep thinking of how much I\u2019m gonna get for each exam. I can\u2019t relax at allll. I\u2019m just ranting cause i want you to know that you\u2019re not alone. cause I always think I\u2019m the only one going through something and no one can relate with me.

But I read the readings assigned on the syllabus before each class, and that seems to keep me up-to-date for my easier classes. For my stats class, I try to understand some of the concepts we\u2019re about to go over beforehand because I\u2019m terrible at just \u2018getting\u2019 it. And I do the HW so I know what I\u2019m not getting at all. Zoom has actually worked out nicely in that class, because my professor recorded the classes so I could go back and rewatch parts I didn\u2019t understand or missed (also so easy to search for key words on the transcripts!) I\u2019m really going to miss having that option when we\u2019re back in class next semester. For classes that require a lot of memorization, I just make flash cards as we go thru the semester. For me, those are helpful ways to learn the material even when it\u2019s really hard for me to pay attention during class time. Disclaimer: I have a leg up on you. I\u2019m in grad school getting my PhD, already have my masters. I learned through experience that those are the things I have to do to manage.",
