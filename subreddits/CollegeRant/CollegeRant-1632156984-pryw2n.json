Got a 78. I'm definitely not happy right now.\n\nI've been slaving over that textbook for at least a week straight but there's no way in hell I'm going to remember *every single detail* out of every chapter. Like, the chapters are extremely long with like 50+ key terms per chapter, not to mention all the different organizations and their functions. \n\nI felt confident after studying, quizzing myself constantly. Reviewed recordings of the lectures. Most of the stuff I laser-focused on wasn't even on the exam. \n\nI'm basically just bitching but damn I was expecting a better grade than that.", "author": "unholymanserpent", "created": 1632156984, "retrieved": 1632840993, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdm06ka": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pryw2n/exams_over_textbook_chapters_suck/hdm06ka/", "text": "Thank you u/unholymanserpent for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
