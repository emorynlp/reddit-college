  "text": "Just had an exam that was only over 3 chapters out of my Cybersecurity textbook that I studied like crazy for. Got a 78. I'm definitely not happy right now.\n\nI've been slaving over that textbook for at least a week straight but there's no way in hell I'm going to remember *every single detail* out of every chapter. Like, the chapters are extremely long with like 50+ key terms per chapter, not to mention all the different organizations and their functions. \n\nI felt confident after studying, quizzing myself constantly. Reviewed recordings of the lectures. Most of the stuff I laser-focused on wasn't even on the exam. \n\nI'm basically just bitching but damn I was expecting a better grade than that.",

      "text": "This is really why professes either need to make study guides or at least review over the most important topics before exams, especially when there is so much material to study. I\u2019ve had classes with like 30 plus terms and I\u2019m like\u2026there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m gonna remember every single term or concept fully. Sometimes you just take the C and move on because you did the best you can. Like if you know it\u2019s not your fault and there isn\u2019t a realistic way to get higher",
