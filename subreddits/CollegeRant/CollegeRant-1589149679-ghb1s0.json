{"sid": "ghb1s0", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ghb1s0/how_the_fuck_does_someone_like_to_go_to_college/", "title:": "How the fuck does someone like to go to college!?", "text": "After finishing a bachelor's in math and currently finishing a master's in applied math, I can say that, without a shadow of a doubt: college is LITERALLY the worst fucking thing to waste our money and time on. At the beginning of my college days, I was stupid enough to believe that \"college was going to be the best years of my life\" and that \"I would be learning with the best professors in the country\" (my bachelor's holds the title for \"best math course in the country\" where I live in). It sounds like people are paid to boast the college they were in because my college was literally the biggest clusterfuck LMAO.\n\nI had around 20 different teachers but only 4-5 of them actually took the time to make sure we learned the material as best as we could. The rest? One of them forced us to TEACH THE FUCKING MATERIAL! Yes, literally he told us that \"I'm not in the mood to come to class and start yammering about the material, here's a list of topics you'll be presenting\"; other couldn't give less of a shit about us, she didn't teach us anything, only gave us books to get the material from and never responded to our emails when we had any issues with our learning.\n\nAnd don't even fucking get me started with the \"but college teaches you how to learn, you have to go get things on your own, in the job market no one's going to teach you anything\". If college is all about learning by ourselves,what the serious fuck are teachers doing there, you fucking idiot!? They're supposed to give us the necessary tools in order to learn more efficiently, which doesn't fucking happen. And most jobs need specific skills that you'll learn there, you normally go through a internship and people actually take the time to guide you until they deem you can be autonomous enough, because guess what: NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING GENETICALLY MUTATED, SELF-TAUGHT GENIUS, EVEN EINSTEIN AND NEWTON HAD SOMEONE EXPERIENCED GUIDING THEM. STOP BEING A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS, PLEASE!?\n\nEven though most of the things you learn in college are meant to teach you problem-solving and other soft skills, the way that they're thought totally defeats the goddamn purpose. Instead of teaching stuff in a way that we'll understand and apply them to exercises and further work on real-life projects, no, you're studying things you half know of so you can regurgitate them on an exam and forget them when (or if) you'll use them again. Outdated courses are also an issue but that's a rant for another day. The only positive aspect of this expensive shitshow is the friends we make along the way, otherwise it would be an useless and painful piece of shit of a process we all go through if we don't want to starve to death.\n\nAnd fucking hell, man, it ruined my self-confidence, my brain \"jams\" when I try to learn anything, my potential is being squandered, I fell into a horrid depression which I'm still trying to get rid of. If college are the best years of your life, I might as well get cancer if it's all downhill from here, right? Or the people who say that \"college years are the best\" are the ones who peaked there, just like with high school? Here's some food for thought...\n\nFeel free to tell me that \"I don't deserve to have a master's\" and that \"I'm in for a rude awakening when I get a job\", I don't give a goddamn shit, I hate college and I can't wait to be done with it LMAO\n\nEDIT: I'm talking about MY experience in a specific college, on a specific degree. If your college experience was completely different from mine, I'm glad you didn't have to go through hell, like I did. My experience is still valid and I'm not generalizing or hating on you because college were your best years, if you feel offended by this post that's on you. Try not to invalidate my experience just because my college doesn't match with the good times you had in yours, it makes you look like an idiot, try to be more empathetic with people who were unlucky in their college, as the \"best years of your life\" generalization is just that, a goddamn generalization...", "author": null, "created": 1589149679, "retrieved": 1632950292, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g5p0yje": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ghb1s0/how_the_fuck_does_someone_like_to_go_to_college/g5p0yje/", "text": "Bruh I HATE SCHOOL.

A lot of your time is taken up by studying for rigorous classes, (in my case since I'm a computer science student) studying different skills in your free time and/or completing side projects. There's little time to be social and have fun in college, especially if you work at the same time. \n\nNot to bring anyone down but if I was majoring in communications or psychology or a similar major then I'd be having the time of my life but I chose computer science in order to have a career that is high in demand. I lose the fun of college for the most part but it works out in the end.\n\nThat being said, I fully agree with OP.
