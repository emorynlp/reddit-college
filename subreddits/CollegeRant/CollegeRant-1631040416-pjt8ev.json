I thought it was gonna be a nice experience but if I\u2019m being honest it\u2019s meh so far. I really regret with all my heart not going to a 4 year university for my freshman year. I want the college experience and didn\u2019t get to have that for my freshman and now sophomore year. Everybody seems to have fun hanging out with friends at uni. I haven\u2019t made someone who Id call a friend yet and I\u2019ve started since August 23. Since everyone commutes it\u2019s like harder to make friends based on what ppl say and yeah they were right. I wish I had just applied to universities back then and idc if imma be in debt, those are memories I\u2019ll remember for a long time :(. I\u2019m gonna transfer next year but this isn\u2019t for me I don\u2019t like it. I feel out of place. And it doesn\u2019t help how I have social anxiety and that the people at my college mainly keep to themselves and half of the students are too old for me to be friends with them. I want friends who are 18-21 years old not some 30/40 year old people who have kids :/ just needed to let this all out.", "author": "smolrose-", "created": 1631040416, "retrieved": 1632948682, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hc3ct98": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pjt8ev/im_lowkey_getting_depressed/hc3ct98/", "text": "The college experience is a product marketed to young people.\n\nThe college experience is taking out massive loans to pretend to play house and pretend to be independent, when it's really either your loans or your parents throwing away massive amounts of money.\n\nThe college experience is something only rich people can afford or those who don't mind taking on \\~40k in debt over 4 years.

I promise you, it\u2019s not. \n\nI applied for a community college in 2016 and finished in 2018 cause I had 0 clue on what to study so I didn\u2019t apply to any universities before high school. \n\nI did feel like shit when all of my friends were at University, getting that great college experience but that wasn\u2019t it for them. \n\nOh no, many of them we\u2019re struggling so bad they had to drop out or switch to a community college because they were stuck. \n\nPlease don\u2019t focus on those things, focus on yourself and what you want to get out of this. \n\nDo your 2-3 years at CC and then transfer to a University, you will say so much money! \n\nDebt is a bitch! I promise you, you will regret once you\u2019re done with school and you gotta pay those off. You\u2019ll be stuck with a job you probably won\u2019t like just to pay off student loans, which will affect your credit score, in which you don\u2019t want. And having a shit credit score means you can\u2019t lease an apartment unless you get a co-signer, same with a car and other things.", "author": "DumbHuman53", "created": 1631110662, "upvotes": 1}, "hbzjw1u": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pjt8ev/im_lowkey_getting_depressed/hbzjw1u/", "text": "If it makes you feel any better I\u2019m at a four year college and I hate it so much.

Ended up transferring a year early. \n\nI would really recommend that, if you\u2019re comfortable with it, once you transfer, sign up to live in the dorms with a roommate and join as many student organizations as you can.
