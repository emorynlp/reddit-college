I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised but, this is a joke and scam of money. We\u2019re using YouTube, Quizlet, and Rosetta Stone. I could do this on my own without a student loan and even save money. \nWhat school uses Quizlet? A site that things aren\u2019t always accurate and almost anyone can create content. \nI already tried to study using it but, there have already been things screwed up in it. \nFor example: \u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1s? According to quizlet, is spelled \u00bfC\u00f3mo ests\u00e1s?\n\nHow am I supposed to be confident in this education??", "author": "Sweaty-Vegetable-311", "created": 1623253611, "retrieved": 1632842250, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 106, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h15ytoh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nvz02g/american_public_university/h15ytoh/", "text": "Thank you u/Sweaty-Vegetable-311 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
