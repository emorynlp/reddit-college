I know for a lot of people 3 classes isnt a lot but I found it great for this online environment. I shouldve kept it that way...\n\nThis semester i have failed 2 midterms. 2/4 classes i have a failing midterm mark in, only thing keeping me alive/passing those classes are assignments. Of the other 2 I BARELY passed the midterm (think 52/100) for one and, the other, i got a good mark! But that is the only class i am doing alright in.\n\nGod fucking kill me. I have NEVER done this bad in a single semester. Fuck me. Im not sure why i am such a dumb ass online. Fuck my life. I feel like this semester will tank my grad school opportunities for the future.

I got A's in both my classes last semester. I think this is because I actually enjoyed what I was learning. This semester I'm happy to get a B & I'm very \"C's get degrees\" at the moment. I think it's because it's just the last 2 classes I need to graduate. I hate them both but they're required for my degree. I've been awful at attending zoom but last semester I had no live lectures. I leave the meeting as soon as we have to share with the whole group because it gives me so much anxiety. I have no midterms or finals this semester so I've been lazy because I know I don't need to remember the information for a test. My motivation has just vanished unfortunately.

This is the first semester in years that I've had to take 4 classes (was the only way I could graduate in May) and it has definitely kicked my butt. Especially since I'm not used to having a problem with literally ALL my professors. Usually it's one class that gives me problems and the others are okay enough, but jesus. These subjects that really shouldn't be that difficult for me have the most disorganized out of touch professors.
