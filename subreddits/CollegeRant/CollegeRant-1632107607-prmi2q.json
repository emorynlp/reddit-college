I thought I respected you! Every single time I have the misfortune of walking past the gym, I see 20 maskless athletes gasping and panting and writhing like blind puppies, and in the evening when I see them tumbling into the library like a swarm of sweat-stenched locusts with nothing but a paper-thin surgical mask clinging for its godforsaken life to the lowest part of their upper lip, I see the home that isn't safe to go back to. I see the school nurse that refused to test me because the school had no tests left, I see the graphs of vaccine effectiveness declining over time. I see all of the hospitals spilling with blood and shit and the death rattles of nurses, babies, and elders, and the people who died outside of them. I see the orphans, I see my grandparents, I see my friends, I see my professors, I see all of the people who \"survived\" COVID with side-effects that will haunt them for the rest of their life, and I wonder what it must be like to give so little of a fuck about anything.\n\nThey put up 500 million signs everywhere, in the simplest possible language, that you have to wear a mask inside, but nobody gives a fuck! Nobody knows, or nobody cares. Every single time I see some group of maskless kids chuckling like morons, and 90 people sitting for hours in the cafeteria without masks, and worse, nobody stopping them, a little bit more of my soul dies. If you can't learn this shit after two fucking years, TWO FUCKING YEARS BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T LEARN HOW TO WEAR A MASK, I don't think there's any more hope for you. I had to watch this, along with everybody else in the entire world, transform into a sprawling omniscient monster with the failures of the public and the government, and I hope every single goddamn college student who thinks \"oh it's fine:)\" after going to a frat party knows what a miserable little cog they are. It doesn't matter that we're still both in a global pandemic, just keep eating your shitty little lotuses! You know who you are, and I hope you're ashamed. \n\nIf you don't wear a mask in public space, here's my message to you, baked with 100% pure love and affection: you are a selfish asshole, and I hope every risk you present to others is brought on you 10 fold! Have a great day, and I hope your throat falls out of your body!\n\nAnd I have a lovely special message for the people who wear it only over their mouth, as well: You're a fucking idiot!

Like have you literally never stepped outside and done anything other than like window shop on other people's lives and browse reddit and watch fox news or something? You're talking like you're a man baby right now who doesnt understand freedom of choice and selfishness in humans. \n\nLet me key you into somethings thatll make more sense as you mature.\n\n1. You're not the main character and the world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n2. Literally nothing you do will change anything about everything you complain about and sulk about so you might as well try to find the positive side to life. \n\n3.

Unfortunately, if you focus on what other people are doing, things that are out of your control, you\u2019ll only make yourself more and more unhappy. For me, I have the best quality mask I can find, I surround myself with people who are being safe and responsible, and do my best to limit contact with those who are aren\u2019t. It\u2019s deeply disturbing that schools and governments aren\u2019t taking things as seriously as they should be, and all you can do is the best you can.
