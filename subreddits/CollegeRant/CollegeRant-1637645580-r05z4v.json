  "text": " Ever since COVID hit, I realized that I needed to stay longer at college in order to figure out what to do and what route to take from there. Luckily, I am at community college and I'm currently 21 (almost 22) so I am saving some $$$ at least. I just remember last year in 2020 feeling so lost on what to do and it impacted my mental health entirely. I was so stressed and felt overwhelming anxiety with these online classes that I had to drop a few of them and knew that I did not want to do my Business degree anymore, but the other problem was that I did not know I'm not gonna lie, it kinda hurt seeing other people that I knew graduate while I am just going to stay longer at cc.\n\nLuckily, I am not totally stuck exactly compared to last year. I realized that healthcare is always going to be in demand and thus, I am either going to become a Physician Assistant or a Speech Therapist. Both of these careers require going to Grad School and it's something that I really don't mind. I will also be living with my parents in the meantime and I also want to earn a certificate so I can gain medical experience and money. I also don't want to be in a lot of debt and jobless when I officially graduate from college because one's degree/network and experience matters nowadays.\n\nIt's also going to be a bit of a mess since my family and I might be moving (Which I don't mind about moving). It's because I know that not all of my credits are going to transfer at the next community college, but you gotta do what you gotta do. (College advisers also stink btw)\n\nBut I feel like that \"I am falling behind\" a bit because I am going to be graduating \"late\". But I also know that I should not be feeling this since I am still young and that plenty of people go back to school when they are older. Still, I won't be surprised if I am over 25 when I am completely done with college. Heck, I won't be surprised if I am 27 or 28. Is this \"abnormal\"? Any advice is appreciated!",

      "text": "My guy you are right, you are still young and will have plenty of opportunities. IMO the most important thing is to do what you want or what you think you will like in relation to a future career. \n\nI'm in the same boat as you. Im still in college and I'm even older than you (due to bad life decisions). I have been all over the place, shifted courses, transferred schools, but luckily for me my parents supported me and what I wanted to study. I'm currently attending a State U in my country and hopefully will be able to finish studies ASAP.\n\nHope you find your calling too, and I hope you have someone to support you emotionally also. English is not my first language so excuse me if my grammar is bad sometimes.",
