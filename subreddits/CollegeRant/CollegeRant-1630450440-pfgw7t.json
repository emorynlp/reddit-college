Always have been, really. When I gradated HS, my mother said that I WILL get a job. Period. So I got one and went to CC for two and a half years while working. I then transferred to a four-year Uni close to home in 2014 and left after one semester because I couldn\u2019t afford to keep going. I then switched to working full time for about four years, and after my grandmother (bless her) passed, she left money for all her grandkids\u2019 education and I went back to that same Uni in 2019. (And YES, I\u2019m aware of my privilege here, but the tuition and student loan fight still makes me angry for others). \n\nI\u2019m still working, though I was able to work part time (24hrs/week), and that, combined with being older than most of my classmates AND an introvert with niche interests means that, after two years, I still have no friends at school. \n\nI will admit that It does get lonely from time to time, though I\u2019m used to being by myself. I also have social anxiety \u2014 probably from being bullied all through K-12 \u2014 and I just don\u2019t fit in with other people. I can\u2019t just walk up to people and start talking, especially with my weird range of interests. Plus with work and being a commuter, clubs and meetings are not an option. It\u2019s hard at times, but As I\u2019ve gotten older, it\u2019s been easier to accept my role in the universe and let things be. \n\nI do have friends, they just don\u2019t go to school. I volunteer at my church and know people through there. I met my two best friends at work and though they moved, we talk all the time and hang out when we can. And All of my other friends I met online through fandom spaces. I even met my boyfriend online. \n\nHonestly, fandom space and the internet has been a godsend for me and many other nerdy introverts. I know it doesn\u2019t seem the same and you can\u2019t just go hang out when your online friends live in places like Alaska or Portugal, but it helps me feel a little less alone knowing I have people to connect with, even if we don\u2019t see each other in person.", "author": "LostButterflyUtau", "created": 1631110966, "upvotes": 1}, "hb6w6er": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfgw7t/is_it_normal_to_spend_most_of_my_college_life/hb6w6er/", "text": "It\u2019s pretty hard to make friends in college.

I graduated university last semester, and if I were to sum up my college experience it would just be about all the things I did by myself. \n\nI also felt like I wasn\u2019t utilizing the opportunity my parents gave me to the fullest, simply because I wasn\u2019t in a group sharing different experiences. The big truth is, the people you see don\u2019t make up everyone at the college (probably less than 5%, if that). The ones you don\u2019t see are either working or taking time for themselves. In addition, your observations coupled with the fact that you\u2019re in a different environment can by itself be anxiety-inducing, and that\u2019s completely normal. \n\nOne of the good things about college is that you\u2019re now in the process of figuring yourself out, and certain steps of that process involves learning how to perceive/control your environment and how to be content with it, while also maintaining class work. This can include listening to music, keeping your surroundings clean, going out to exercise, exploring new places, etc. Don\u2019t perceive being alone in your room as a bad thing, but do also go out for your own sake. As you may or may not have heard, people will naturally gravitate to you when they see you collected and self-focused, but when you get to that stage you\u2019ll find that you don\u2019t necessarily need the company of others, nor do you have to revolve your life around expectations. It\u2019s all about *perception*, and you should have fun constructing yours through trying as many things as you can, because in the end it\u2019s your life and no one else\u2019s.\n\nAlso, there should be a handful of groups that\u2019ll take you in by simply asking, but finding good friends that\u2019ll actually stick around with you isn\u2019t something you go out to find. You\u2019ll eventually meet them as you go down your own road of self-interests.", "author": "Zealomon", "created": 1630505535, "upvotes": 1}, "hb6mrlz": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfgw7t/is_it_normal_to_spend_most_of_my_college_life/hb6mrlz/", "text": "My freshman and sophomore year were like this.

But not everyone wants to live that kind of life, and that's completely fine too.\n\nLook, I'm going into my 2nd year of college and I haven't really made any new friends yet.

You're just getting started!\n\nAttend club meetings (this one is better because you may meet people with similar interests) and events people have on or around campus. Maybe join a sport or any extracurricular (like a music group) if you're good at them. When attending these things be open and inviting--So stay off your phone as much as possible.
