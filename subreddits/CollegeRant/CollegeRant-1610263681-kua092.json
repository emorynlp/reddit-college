  "text": "It feels like my mind has melted into a pile of mush. It's like the pandemic and the weight of recent events in the world and personal things in my life, combined with work and all the schoolwork I have to do, have fried it. It's really difficult to focus on homework right now, especially when it's something I don't understand right off the bat. It's like my brain is collapsing in slow motion.",
