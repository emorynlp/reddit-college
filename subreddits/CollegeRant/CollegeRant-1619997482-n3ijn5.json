  "text": "looking at other peoples end of year posts on Instagram made me realize that I didn't make the most of my on-campus experience. I barely attended lcub zoom meetings or explore the off-campus areas. I really struggled to balance academics, social life, and self upkeep. I let academics take over my freshman year and for what? maybe if I got good grades then at least it would've been worth it. But I barely managed to pass Bio 1, and basically failed philosophy I literllaly rmeber thattehey were some days that I wouldn't eat, sleep, or exercise to would turn down outing invites from friends just to do homework or study for a test. I just feel so dejected that I spent the who semester depriving myself only to get subpar grades, I have no idea how I will find the right balance semester because my class schedule will be even more packed than this past one.",

In my case, I had the ability to go on campus, I joined a club but covid made it so hard to make friends. I feel really sad whenever I see a group of college students hanging out in a group having fun together bcs that used to be me b4 pandemic hit and i transferred. As for grades, since you are a freshman, you have plently of time to make up classes u fail and plenty of opportunities to bring up ur gpa. Dont beat yourself up bcs this year and the beginning of this year is just hard and I feel for you even more bcs this is your first year in college and you didnt have pre covid college experiences.",
