They seem to have a Professor vs student mentality. Just reading their questions and posts they look down on us. Make fun of us and seem to imply how most of us are lazy whinners while they complain about the same thing believing they have it hardest. I will admit I am biased as I have a strong dislike of professors at least at my current school. I use to love learning but this new school beat it out of me I just want the degree. It seems to be the general consent with my fellow students as well. If you have free time take a peek over there and see what I mean, won't take long to find something to raise your blood pressure.", "author": "fruithat123", "created": 1603926992, "retrieved": 1632951512, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"gbesnpb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jjyo36/professors_seem_so_cruel_on_rprofessor/gbesnpb/", "text": "I would personally disagree because many of the posts are about how to make learning better for students. So, I don't think professors on r/Professors are cruel, merely human. Sure, some posts (more replies than posts really) are rude and paint students as having a victim mentality or something, but honestly, if I get to vent on r/college then why shouldn't professors (especially those who actually care about our education) vent on r/Professors every once in a while? I agree that it's not right to be insulting/derogatory to students, but I get the sense that most instructors on r/Professors are just trying their best at this point to make college survivable to us students, staff, and even themselves. I think r/Professors is just one of those somewhat helpful non-official resources where they can be honest and so I don't pay much mind to the occasional toxic member.

You pay tuition, you deserve a professor who gives a shit and as such, should voice your opinion. \n\nProfessors are also allowed to vent about students though. Imagine spending 5 months straight, thousands of hours, developing a course over the summer to a T making it extremely well-detailed and putting in so much effort just to have a student call you a piece of shit because they didn't do the reading or follow the instructions. E.g., students take a mandatory quiz on academic plagarism then proceed to bombard your email with hateful messages because they got a zero for copying and pasting 80 percent of their paper. X5 classes with 90 students each in just one semester. As an instructor who legit bends over backwards for students, it breaks my heart to get these emails but I do...a lot. I stay up till about 1-3am every night continuing to make changes to the course, following up with students, allowing assignments to be submitted months after the deadline cause\n..yeah this semester sucks with COVID and I feel awful these students have to learn online. \n\nFrom my POV, the instructors who complain the most about students are often the ones who care the most, especially at a community college level where they are there to teach rather than do research. \n\nThere is two sides to every coin and I hope you can one day better understand that professors have a right to vent just as much as anyone else. Does that mean they should use a social media platform to talk shit about students? Definitley not, especially when you're right in the notion of double standards and some instructors being incredibly awful. I see first-hand people who have no right being instructors. But I have mostly seen the thread be used for help regarding better teaching policies, suggestions and genuine questions/inquiries. \n\nAnd if it does happen, venting is okay. And not that this is an execuse, but unfortunately after 20 years, tenured profs often get fed up with it because they will be lucky out of the thousands of students they've taught over the years that maybe only 5-10% have actually appreciated them and taken their course in stride. \n\nAt the end of the day, it also doesn't help that the post secondary system is riddled with politics, policies and systems that are starting to care more about money than education, something of which professors have no control over.", "author": "Pyroofreekz", "created": 1604461423, "upvotes": 6}, "gaqn2gs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jjyo36/professors_seem_so_cruel_on_rprofessor/gaqn2gs/", "text": "Yeah, there does seem to be a bit of a double standard.
