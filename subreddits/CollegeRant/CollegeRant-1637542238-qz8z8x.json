  "text": "So I'm in my third year of food engineering and lately I have been extremely unmotivated, so getting a little motivation two days ago to study for my exam that is basically due this morning was refreshing and I had to capitalize on it (yes, I'm a very last-minute-person but I have managed to pass everything so far). As I was reading the material I was taking notes as well, but after a while I stopped and I realized that I wrote down all this information (mostly regarding composition of materials and plants in %) which I hadn't even started memorizing yet, and there were a plenty left. I got sad and frustrated due to the fact that this was another memorizing game where I would've had to force all this information into my head that I didn't care about the slightest and that I will forget most of it shortly after the test.\n\nThere have been a lot of lectures where I just had to force information into my head, like I have to be a walking database. I get it, I have to know and memorize some essential and important things, but come on, is this really it's all about?\n\nI just can't do this anymore, it's so demotivating and uninspiring having to memorize bulks of data for the sake of being able to answer questions on a piece of paper. I'm not even wondering now why I got burnt out.\n\nThe sad part is that nobody cares, it won't change and if I don't force the material down my own throat I will get a bad grade.",
