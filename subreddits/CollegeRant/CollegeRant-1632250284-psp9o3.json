  "text": "I have a great professor, but the subject makes me want to puke. I wish I could withdraw now but it's too late. The class, where we just do things, is fun. Knowing that I have to go home and watch boring videos about the theory behind what we do, is not. Statistics is the spawn of Satan. And Biometry is just statistics with the word Bio to trick hippies like me into taking the boring class. The fact that I like and do better in Organic Chemistry than this class, is either a reflection on me, or on this class, but I'm convinced it's the latter.",
