I\u2019m so stressed, i have been working non stopppppp! I\u2019m not failing any classes but in my math class I\u2019ve been trying and trying and trying so hard. I\u2019ve been pulling all nighters just to study but literally I\u2019ve been doing worst :( IT SUCKS WHEN YOU GIVE IT YOUR ALL AND YOU END UP DOING WORSE THAN WHEN YOU WERENT GIVING IT YOUR ALL!!! I literally can say that out of this semester I have not even had a chance to just take a break and breathe. Online school has messed me up so bad. I don\u2019t even wanna become a doctor any more because I\u2019m just tooooo stressed at this point. To many, this class is like an easy A and literally to me it\u2019s just soooo hard. Algebra sucks, I feel like precalc and calc is easier than algebra :( Ik I\u2019m dumb so please don\u2019t mention it, I already hate my self.", "author": "underated_zanett", "created": 1605132034, "retrieved": 1632842921, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gc45cg7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jshht4/i_dont_know_what_to_feel/gc45cg7/", "text": "I'm in the environmental sciences. I 10000% agree that calc is easier than algebra - i'd go as far as to say it's also easier than precalc. I dunno, each brain is different. Don't let the current global situation lead yourself to feel like you're inferior where you otherwise might excel. \n\nLiterally my lowest grade of my entire academic career was in algebra & precalc. If your heart wants you to be a doctor, then it's worth persevering. Especially with COVID & such, graduate schools will be much more tolerant of GPA declines than they have ever been before. Absolutely zero people are able to say what your odds of becoming a doctor are at this point. The modern world has simply never gone through so much unilateral turmoil before, so my advice would be to just keep doing what you must to reach your passions.", "author": "Austin1173", "created": 1605235280, "upvotes": 1}, "gc02fcv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jshht4/i_dont_know_what_to_feel/gc02fcv/", "text": "Really? I got an A in Algebra but barley passed pre calculus and failed chemistry 1 my first college semester. You\u2019re not dumb, I feel like math is another language that sometimes isn\u2019t taught as well. Many people have been struggling with school especially with covid around, you\u2019re not alone. Maybe you gotta change the way you do things, change the way you handle your time and try and get homework/studying help. Does your school have tutoring?

This semester has been rough. Would it be possible for you to take a semester off to work and see if this is what you really want to do? Being a doctor is a huge commitment and you don't want to regret anything. Also there are so many jobs in the medical field that are equally fulfilling. If you can't take the semester off just try to hang in there to the end of the semester. Hangout with friends & family or take some time for yourself.
