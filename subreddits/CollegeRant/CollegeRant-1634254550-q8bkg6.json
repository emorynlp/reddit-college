  "text": "I am straight up just not having a good time at college. I have really not had the best luck with finding a friend group. I hangout with some people occasionally but it's like I'm not vibing with them. My mom encouraged me to rush to join a sorority as a way to meet people. I got dropped from every house which was a horrible feeling because I was hoping this would be a way to make friends. I'm having serious doubts about attending the big party/state school and I feel like I should have opted for the city college experience. I have no one at my University and I just feel so horrible and lonely. It just feels like high school here. I'm having a serious identity crisis and I feel like I don't fit in at my University. I really just needed to vent because it seems like it just getting worse.",
