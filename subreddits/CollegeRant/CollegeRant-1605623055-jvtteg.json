It\u2019s taking a lot from me I don\u2019t know how I could still manage it.", "author": "shygirlsclub", "created": 1605623055, "retrieved": 1632951443, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gcn3xkr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jvtteg/burned_out/gcn3xkr/", "text": "Ya same.
