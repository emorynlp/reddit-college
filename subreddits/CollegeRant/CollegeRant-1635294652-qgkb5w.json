  "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure I bombed a midterm worth a mere 25%, but I don\u2019t care. I winged it. It was really easy, too, and I\u2019m sure plenty of people got high scores. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been going through a hard time lately in my personal life, so these past few weeks have been a struggle. I\u2019m not performing my best and picking and choosing where to exert my energy instead of aiming to do well on everything like a normal student. So, I didn\u2019t try very hard on this test. \n\n\nI\u2019m really sad\u2014not about this specific test\u2014but in general. So this test wasn\u2019t my best work. But it also wasn\u2019t worth much in comparison to my other tests, so I know that I\u2019ll get an okay final grade in the end. It might not be an A, but I won\u2019t lose sleep over it.",

Sometimes life throws fucking cat cancer at you and you gotta prioritize your mental health. Good for you getting a good grade. Keep up the good work.",
