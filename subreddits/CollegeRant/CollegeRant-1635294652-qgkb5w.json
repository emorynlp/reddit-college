  "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure I bombed a midterm worth a mere 25%, but I don\u2019t care. I winged it. It was really easy, too, and I\u2019m sure plenty of people got high scores. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been going through a hard time lately in my personal life, so these past few weeks have been a struggle. I\u2019m not performing my best and picking and choosing where to exert my energy instead of aiming to do well on everything like a normal student. So, I didn\u2019t try very hard on this test. \n\n\nI\u2019m really sad\u2014not about this specific test\u2014but in general. So this test wasn\u2019t my best work. But it also wasn\u2019t worth much in comparison to my other tests, so I know that I\u2019ll get an okay final grade in the end. It might not be an A, but I won\u2019t lose sleep over it.",

Sometimes life throws fucking cat cancer at you and you gotta prioritize your mental health. Good for you getting a good grade. Keep up the good work.",

Im still bombing in my classes because life is hard right now. Maybe reach out to your professors or advisors on what's going on. Schools have good counselors too.",

So I guess maybe I\u2019m trying to say that sometimes even if you study, it doesn\u2019t work out? I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve been having mental health issues that my family ignores and I feel so sad. Just know that you\u2019re not alone in this, it\u2019s been a hard semester for many despite everyone appearing to be alright. I wish you the best on everything",

      "text": "u/2S2S so sorry to hear about your struggles. Hope you feel better soon. \n\nI am 25 years old and i am junior at the University of Arizona. I have dealt with anxiety, panic attacks, and occasional but intense bouts of depression for a good chunk of my life. \n\nI have testing accommodations due to my anxiety and mental health struggles and get to take my exams at the on campus disabilities resource center.\n\nLast Thursday, I walked into the testing room and sat down to take my exam for a class called 450-American Foreign Relations since 1914. I opened up the test booklet and looked at all of the questions and was immediately sent into a full-on panic attack. My mind went blank, my thoughts raced, my heart was beating out of my chest, and my palms began to sweat. I wrote a message to my professor in the test booklet. That message said \u201cI am sorry that I can\u2019t finish the exam, i have been struggling with anxiety and a personal health issue.\u201d\n\nAfter writing the message, i closed the test booked, packed up my stuff, exited the testing room, and dropped off the test with at the desk of the disabilities resource center so that it could be delivered to the professor. It was a truly terrifying experience.\n\nI am dropping that class this week because I can\u2019t mentally handle stepping foot into the professor\u2019s classroom again after what happened. The professor doesn\u2019t bother to make study guides for his students, he leaves it up to the students to pull information from the assigned readings, which is an asshole move.\n\nThe professor has stated that he \u201cis not a visual person\u201d. I just take that to mean that he is a lazy SOB. He also doesn\u2019t use PowerPoint slides. Instead, he lectures from his personal handwritten notes. He is a boomer who doesn\u2019t know how to use technology, let alone a goddamn iPhone.\n\nI have learning disabilities and i need visual cues to take notes from.\n\nAfter i drop the class, i am gonna go on ratemyprofessors.com and write a bad review about the professor.",

If I can just get it up to a c and pass I will be happy. I struggle with anxiety, depression, and lots of procrastination. Recently, my boyfriend just went to jail over a dui and I have no one to hold me accountable. Guess I\u2019m finding out just how bad do I really want a better life. Hang in there bud.

This summer I was selected for a research paper( funded by our government) that will be published in the next month or so and I don't care about it. Even tho objectively speaking, it's huge( second year bachelor's).\n\nWell maybe not huge, I am part of the et al. But still my name will be second on that paper. The first one is obviously the PhD student that applied for the funding and did the paperwork.",
