I hate this shit so much now I\u2019m actually so desperate to raise my gpa and here I am with 2 cs. Never got a c in my life and I think it\u2019s about time. My calc professor is such an asshole too bc that mf didn\u2019t give us our grades until a week after the withdraw deadline passed, so people in my class that didn\u2019t know they were failing can\u2019t drop out now without affecting their gpa\n\nI fucking hate this shit I wanna give up so bad and I feel so alone with this problem. Most of my friends saying \u201coh it ain\u2019t too bad rn\u201d like BRO I AM ABOUT TO LOSE IT EVERYDAY.

Lowest grade I've had in college so far. I felt like such a dumbass and I still do. It's so hard this semester, but keep pushing.
