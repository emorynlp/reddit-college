I don't have any of that from the cafeteria; I fill up my plate with as much of everything besides those- and eat all 5 food groups at every meal- and I only drink water and coffee with skim milk. I'm 5'11\" 135 lbs so it's not like I'm a fat person trying to lose weight. Yet I'm always the least popular person at the table. Guys who get desserts with every meal and rarely eat vegetables are somehow getting more attention. I'm not going to stop eating healthy, it's just annoying that the cliche of \"you need to take care of your body for people to like you\" is not reality.", "author": "bonobo-no", "created": 1631152660, "retrieved": 1632948621, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.14, "comments": {"hce5c62": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pko9qt/i_eat_healthier_than_most_people_and_it_gets_me/hce5c62/", "text": "It's good that you eat healthy.
