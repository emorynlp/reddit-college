  "text": "I am so glad this is the last time I have to register for classes (graduating next spring). My family was practically yelling at me this morning about how I needed to register for my remaining classes as soon as the online portal opens. I\u2019m already stressed enough without having to worry about classes filling up, and yelling just stresses me out even more.\n\nAnd of course I forgot to sign up for my senior capstone class. I realized that a few minutes after the portal opened and I had already added my other courses. It was already too late to add it because the class filled up in just fifteen minutes! I had to run across campus to try and get an override request from the dean (who already had a queue of other students with the same issue).\n\nRegistration is always such a pain in the ass, and now my head hurts from stress.",
