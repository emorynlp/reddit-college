Most students fail Chemistry because of poor math foundation. I am not saying this must be the case for you. However, review some basic math. Then spend a shit ton of time on conversion factors/dimensional analysis and review exponents and scientific notation. When you elementary math is fine you can spend more time understanding the relationships in the formulas and conversions just make a whole lot of sense.", "author": "foreducatio", "created": 1621180318, "upvotes": 3}, "gyaohsc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nd4frt/retaking_general_chem_for_the_third_time/gyaohsc/", "text": "Melissa maribel on YouTube is really great.", "author": "superlameusrnam", "created": 1621144095, "upvotes": 3}, "gy9p2aq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nd4frt/retaking_general_chem_for_the_third_time/gy9p2aq/", "text": "Read the syllabus closely, focus on the things that make up the most of your grade.

Show up to class (every single one, no matter how tempted you are to skip)\n2. Take your own notes (even if you\u2019re given slides) to help you focus on what the teacher is saying and synthesize the material\n3. Do the assigned readings before class. And the homework, even if it isn\u2019t graded or you don\u2019t have to turn it in.\n\nThat\u2019s the minimum. For any class, really, that\u2019s the minimum. One extra to-do is to make flash cards each week on the previous week\u2019s material. Then, if you still don\u2019t understand concepts, I guess try watching vids of those specific concepts you\u2019re struggling with.\n\nIf you did all those things the 1st 2 times taking it, sorry if my advice wasn\u2019t helpful. I had to take 2 chemistry classes in college, and making my own flash cards (writing them on note cards) helped the most to improve my memory and understanding. And honestly, those of us who showed up to class did way better on exams than people who didn\u2019t. Good luck!

I retook gen chem during a winter semester and I swear the only reason I passed was because it was a super intense 3 week long course\u2014basically an entire semester condensed into 3 weeks. I did chem all day every day because I had to, and it stuck. Doing it during summer or winter is also helpful because it\u2019s probably gonna be the only class you\u2019re taking, and the professors have smaller classes so you get more 1 on 1 time with them. Either that, or take it at a community college if you can. Chem sucks ass so i wish you luck", "author": "payvt", "created": 1621111724, "upvotes": 21}}}
