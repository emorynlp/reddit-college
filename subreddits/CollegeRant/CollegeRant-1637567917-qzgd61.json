  "text": "hi all, so i've had a crazy past semester, i started a new job right before as well as had to deal with heavy family shit and move houses. Its been a lot and i've fallen a month behind in one of my classes. I've skipped the past 3 weeks of class and the more i skip the more scared i am of turning in course work. I don't even know where to begin and what i can even do to catch up. whats your best advice? I use to have an A but we get about 6 assignments a week that don't have due dates but i've missed 2 quizzes that i'm not sure the professor will open up as well as the exam that i now have to make up and learn the course work of. im very stressed to say the least.",

People miss class all the time for various reasons. What is the subject in? You might be able to catch up on the material with YouTube or whatever resources outside of class.",

Hopefully, my college allows me to do that!",

              "text": "Very nice, sounds like you\u2019ve gotten a better grasp on things. I\u2019ve never heard of the incomplete grade thing but if it seems like a nice option so go for it if it works for you. \n\nI would definitely recommend trying to at least show up to the final and put in an effort to pass. I finished a 2-year program and my final two semesters I stopped giving any fucks and did the bare minimum, some courses I was like one percent away from failing, definitely stressful and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, but I got a diploma out of it!\n\nWhat\u2019s the course and test format like? I might be able to offer some more specific advice for passing.",

      "text": "Hi OP, \n\nI\u2019m in the same boat and I totally get what you mean about being scared to turn stuff in the more you skip class. I notice when I put off class I\u2019m too anxious or embarrassed to go back cause I think the professor hates me too. \n\nSome things that may help? \n1. Try putting a class off for now and handling the rest. For me I dropped my most difficult class and it helped a lot but personally not enough for me. If it is for you though - awesome! \n\n2. Try communicating with your professor that you\u2019re going through a burnout. I know a lot of times our instincts are to lie or play the whole family emergency card but sometimes being straight up and vulnerable does the trick. Our professors were students too and don\u2019t get me wrong a lot of them are probably assholes just like a lot of people in the world are. But you never know unless you try. \n\n3. Try requesting an incomplete for the semester. I did that once and what they\u2019ll essentially do is give you an i for the semester and it gives you some extra time to finish any work you\u2019re behind on. Your essentially have an incomplete for the end of whatever semester you\u2019re in BUT you have until the next semester to finish any and all work. I know it\u2019s different school to school but check it out and see if it\u2019s a possibility? \n\nYou\u2019re gonna be okay OP I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it now but you got this!",

I just checked my college's policy and I qualify so definitely going to fill out a request form, thank you for that suggestion! Thank you so much for all the great tips, I'll try reaching out to the professor too since I have a class with them again next semester so I want to get on good terms with them.",

If you ever feel you need to drop a class for a semester when you\u2019ve got a ton, DO IT. It\u2019ll help you out in the future ensuring you get a better grade even if you take a little longer. \n\nJust look out for yourself and you\u2019ll be okay. Good luck!",
