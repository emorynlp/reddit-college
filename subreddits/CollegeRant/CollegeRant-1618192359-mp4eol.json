How do people just let others do all the work? Ignore attempts at communication? What goes through their mind? Maybe they\u2019re busy but everyone is. Maybe they see someone taking the lead and doing the work and think ehh they\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nI genuinely wish to know. I\u2019m always worried I\u2019m not contributing enough and so I make sure to do my part and usually more than I even need to. So I have no idea how some ppl can just do absolutely nothing or the bare minimum while others have to cover their slack on top of their own strenuous work load.\n\nAh..why can\u2019t I just work on things by myself. People always say you have to work with others in the workplace but I feel like at that point most people would at least put in a bit of effort for the sake of their job. Some ppl just don\u2019t care about school but it hurts the rest of the group and the people that do.

The presenters were more keen and I was so frustrated. Our presentation was done first at the middle of the sem and the paper was due a couple weeks ago. We all had our sections assigned and I finished my part. 2 never showed up to our meetings or contributed to the paper. I had to edit their sections and write the intro and conclusion while the presenters just criticized the whole paper. I didn't mind criticism, but some were ridiculous like just a spelling error. I or someone probably didn't notice some spelling errors that anyone could correct if we didn't notice it. They could have fixed the minor mistakes and made more points regarding what was unclear. I kept opening the document the days before the paper was due and it was just criticism after criticism and I felt angry cause 2 were unreachable and the other kept saying she was going to help but only ended up focusing on her part.

First of all there was 5 of us so working on it on zoom together was pointless. Why would I put in effort when there\u2019s 4 other people who are there too. There was 5 questions all together and 5 of us so all we had to do was do one question each. Had we approached it this way I would of made sure to do my one question to the best of my ability.
