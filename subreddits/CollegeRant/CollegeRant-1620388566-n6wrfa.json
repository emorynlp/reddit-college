I know that I'll just have to retake it but all these professors posting assignments in every folder's folder and the gradebook being fucky just makes it sting so much more. I tried hard in this class but kept missing assignments because I either couldn't find them or I got the due time wrong. I thought I was getting a B in this class but apparently it was calculating grades incorrectly and I was just skirting failure for like half of the semester and never noticed. There was an optional exam to bring your grade up and I didn't take it because I thought I had a b. All my other classes were As or Bs and I just hate myself for failing this class. I'm dreading what this could do to my grad school applications in these upcoming years and I just feel awful. Is anyone else stuck with a failed class?

I failed a class during my undergrad. Still graduated with honors and still got into a PhD program. It is definitely not the end of the world. The advice I give my students as a TA is to find the syllabus, print it out, and keep it handy. If there is a schedule in the syllabus tape that up by your desk/workspace. Personally for my own courses as a student, I take the course schedule and put it in a Google calendar and set it to give my phone reminders for important due dates. If there isn't a schedule for assignments ahead of time, set aside a set time at the beginning of every week to click through the course and make sure you understand what's going on. And if you aren't sure, send an email to your professor and ask.\n\nUltimately the best thing you can do is turn this into a learning experience. Figure out what works best for you to keep this from happening again.

He ended up getting straight A's at that point, but had to take a lot of online classes to catch up and made student of the year when he graduated.\n\nThen he managed to get to grad school who also overlooked his earlier fuck-ups and did the accelerated program. He also graduated with honors.\n\nMy fun fact is that I failed a philosophy class on Logic which is the study of arguments because the professor's teaching style did not vibe with me and I couldn't keep up. He pulled me aside after and told me it wasn't going to be the end of the world like I had felt at the time and idk why, but it's stuck with me for 11 years now. I've since transferred and make decent grades now. I'm an academic coach too.\n\nIf you need help or an accountability partner, feel free to DM me.

I believe there's supposed to be a function where you can determine what your current grade is or if it calculates your grade by filling in the qualities slowly and leaving unopened assignments as 0.
