  "text": "I just failed my first class ever. I feel like such a failure. I know that I'll just have to retake it but all these professors posting assignments in every folder's folder and the gradebook being fucky just makes it sting so much more. I tried hard in this class but kept missing assignments because I either couldn't find them or I got the due time wrong. I thought I was getting a B in this class but apparently it was calculating grades incorrectly and I was just skirting failure for like half of the semester and never noticed. There was an optional exam to bring your grade up and I didn't take it because I thought I had a b. All my other classes were As or Bs and I just hate myself for failing this class. I'm dreading what this could do to my grad school applications in these upcoming years and I just feel awful. Is anyone else stuck with a failed class? I feel like such a fuckup",

      "text": "It will be ok. I failed a class during my undergrad. Still graduated with honors and still got into a PhD program. It is definitely not the end of the world. The advice I give my students as a TA is to find the syllabus, print it out, and keep it handy. If there is a schedule in the syllabus tape that up by your desk/workspace. Personally for my own courses as a student, I take the course schedule and put it in a Google calendar and set it to give my phone reminders for important due dates. If there isn't a schedule for assignments ahead of time, set aside a set time at the beginning of every week to click through the course and make sure you understand what's going on. And if you aren't sure, send an email to your professor and ask.\n\nUltimately the best thing you can do is turn this into a learning experience. Figure out what works best for you to keep this from happening again. And also take a deep breath, because it will be ok.",

      "text": "My husband fucked up his first few years (I mean really fucked it up), dropped out, figured out what he wanted to do and went to a university willing to overlook his fuck-ups. He ended up getting straight A's at that point, but had to take a lot of online classes to catch up and made student of the year when he graduated.\n\nThen he managed to get to grad school who also overlooked his earlier fuck-ups and did the accelerated program. He also graduated with honors.\n\nMy fun fact is that I failed a philosophy class on Logic which is the study of arguments because the professor's teaching style did not vibe with me and I couldn't keep up. He pulled me aside after and told me it wasn't going to be the end of the world like I had felt at the time and idk why, but it's stuck with me for 11 years now. I've since transferred and make decent grades now. I'm an academic coach too.\n\nIf you need help or an accountability partner, feel free to DM me. I have to use Canvas too and sometimes professors put assignments in the worst possible places.",

I believe there's supposed to be a function where you can determine what your current grade is or if it calculates your grade by filling in the qualities slowly and leaving unopened assignments as 0. But that was a few years back. Either way I missed lots of assignments due to them not showing up on the side bar. For some classes it literally just wouldn't work. I'm not sure if the professors can change it or not but I just remember hating canvas",

She never even apologized and she only gave us an extension the first time. But the annoying part was that classes were Tuesday, but she wouldn't open the module til Thursday, then next class was Tuesday. So you wouldn't know there was a problem until MAYBE Thursday, but sometimes she was just late to opening it for us. Then she doesn't respond on weekends. Whole thing was a mess and it was annoying having to wait to see if you were gonna have to cram a week of work into one day with less than a days notice",

One  instructor didn\u2019t realize that all 68 students didn\u2019t complete assignments she randomly placed in a \u201cmedia\u201d folder. \n\nWith other LMS, there\u2019s generally a distinct format that can change a little between courses, but overall is similar enough that students can easily figure out where items are. BrightSpace is just a hodgepodge of whatever the instructor thinks makes sense and it rarely makes sense. \n\nAnother example was from last semester when an instructor made it so you had to complete an assignment and click certain buttons in a specific order so that other assignments in the module would appear for that week. Without a rundown of assignments by week in the syllabus or LMS, almost everyone missed at least two assignments for the first three weeks until the instructor caught on after making a shitty announcement and getting \u201cfeedback\u201d in which students were like \u201cwtf are you talking about!?\u201d \ud83d\ude02 \n\nWith Canvas, the calendar option only works if specific criteria is met. I have two instructors that lock modules so that you can\u2019t see what is coming up and one that didn\u2019t put due dates on assignments. So three of my five classes don\u2019t show up on the Canvas calendar.",
