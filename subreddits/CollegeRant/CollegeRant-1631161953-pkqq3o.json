I've just lost the will to do shit.  I get my homework done most of the time but it's hard to go to classes.  I'm a flim major and my first two years were nothing but fucking GenEds, and I was so excited to start this semester thinking I'd finally be able to take some fun classes, but nope.  I got one fun class where I am actually making films, but my other two \"film\" classes are shit.  More relating to a film historian/analysis major.  This is my fourth semester dealing with covid restrictions.  I've had two quarantined all video classes, and now it's masks only.  I just feel beaten.  I feel like I'm never going to be able to actually take classes I want.  I feel like I was building up and building up and this just sweeper everything from underneath me and I feel empty inside", "author": "TheNuclearNacho", "created": 1631161953, "retrieved": 1632841118, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc5aier": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkqq3o/how_to_deal_with_burn_out/hc5aier/", "text": "Thank you u/TheNuclearNacho for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To me, it seems like most students, regardless of what they're studying, aren't able to apply themselves to something beyond theory or analysis in most of their classes.\n\nEven if it sounds like yet another stressful thing to take on, it might be helpful to reach out to professors, peers, and people outside of your college entirely to get those opportunities to apply yourself by making films. If your school has a career center, especially with career counseling options, people there might also be able to offer some guidance on what you can do or who you can go to for more information. Otherwise, an academic advisor might have some helpful input.", "author": "yourangleoryuordevil", "created": 1631163664, "upvotes": 2}, "hc5awi8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkqq3o/how_to_deal_with_burn_out/hc5awi8/", "text": "You can do it", "author": "IIIIIIIIIIIIIIlIIl", "created": 1631162210, "upvotes": 1}}}
