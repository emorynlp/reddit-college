  "text": "I'm a transfer senior who can't afford to graduate late. So I work extra hard to plan my classes accordingly, weigh options and somehow manage to fit in all my reqs in 2 years. I find out yesterday that my school cancels not just my first choice that would allow me to graduate on time without destroying myself overloading, they cancel my backup too. They only had two classes of this nature for the whole department and the rest of the classes I don't have the pre reqs for or I will just fail bcs I'm notoriously bad at the subject and chose this major to get away from it.\nEveryone I talk to of course can't do anything and I can't even file a complaint or dispute it. It's not like I didn't try to compensate for the possibility of a cancellation. I totally did and they cancelled it like 2 weeks b4 registration and didn't notify anyone so I check my planner and was like WHAT THE FUCK.\nI have to overload/possibly fail from overworking myself all bcs they hired someone but somehow allow them to postpone starting work for a whole fucking 2 yrs. They screwed a whole major over btw. I was taking it bcs it was in my field and met my needs but (for example) just imagine being a comp sci major and their isn't an intro to comp sci class or any class for that matter.\nFuck college",
