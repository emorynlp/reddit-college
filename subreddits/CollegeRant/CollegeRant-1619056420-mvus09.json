I\u2019m a grad student who has been through 6 years of undergrad and now 2 years into grad school, with one year of being a TA.\n\nI agree with you, and I\u2019d like to give my perspective. \n\nI don\u2019t think homework should be an option in our higher level learning; studying should be. Homework just to be homework is bullshit. We should be in a class to learn, requirement, elective, or core class, it doesn\u2019t matter. Yes we need to be evaluated and I think purposeful exams do just that. But they have to be purposeful exams and/or assignments depending on the field. Not busy work, not half-assed exam multiple choice questions, but real exams that test your knowledge, and more importantly, critical thinking skills in the field over the course of the class. In grad school, that starts to appear, but it\u2019s still not enough. \n\nI\u2019ve been asked as a TA to email students over and over again who haven\u2019t been up to par in terms of grading and I finally refused. We are all adults, we should all be expected to learn as adults, and I\u2019m sick and tired of the babysitting from all sides. This includes the busy homework, and the countless emails and reminders. I don\u2019t want to receive them and I don\u2019t want to have to send them out. The point of higher education should be to learn, no matter what, and I feel that it\u2019s been lost under tenure, societal pressure, and capitalism. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, emailing a professor or TA 3 days before an exam and not receiving an answer on time is unacceptable, I would never do that to one of my students. However, this highlights the main issue: the people in charge in this scenario don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care about you, your learning, or the people that work for them (TAs). They are only here for a job, and that\u2019s not fair to everyone involved. \n\nThat being said, most professors, and TAs for that matter, have to develop a way to filter out the bullshit they receive. When you care as an educator, you will be taken advantage of by students, and you have to learn how to navigate though that. It\u2019s a very hard thing to balance. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to give my thoughts on this subject because it\u2019s a wild experience being in the middle of both sides right now.", "author": "lep187", "created": 1619067190, "upvotes": 35}, "gvetaxo": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mvus09/message_to_all_professors_lurking/gvetaxo/", "text": "can't even argue with this one lol", "author": "Puzzleheaded_Can_750", "created": 1619066823, "upvotes": 7}, "gveswpi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mvus09/message_to_all_professors_lurking/gveswpi/", "text": "Honesty yeah.
