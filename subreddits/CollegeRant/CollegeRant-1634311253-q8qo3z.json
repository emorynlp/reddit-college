  "text": "Hello people of Reddit I\u2019m currently in my first semester of college. So I was bullied earlier in the semester the bullying was not resolved and I had to drop a class. I don\u2019t really feel safe at my current one and I Have a 1.8 Gpa and I\u2019m failing a class. After this semester if I go on academic probation should I go to a different CC ?",

      "text": "I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s bullying going on in college, I would reach out to someone at the school and tell them that they are harassing you and file a report with the police. That might make it better especially if it\u2019s a case of cyber or physical then it was be a form of assault if physical. If you don\u2019t feel safe at your school or don\u2019t like the school then I\u2019d transfer out to a different CC if one is close. Just make sure they have your program of study and make sure the credits could transfer over if you go to a bachelors degree program. Can\u2019t believe adults have the audacity to bully someone in college.",

      "text": "I guess that bully will eventually drop out because I don\u2019t think anyone with that kind of attitude will survive in college. But definitely agree you should file a report, if you don\u2019t feel safe enough transferring would be okay too, I think CC still offers online classes and that\u2019s convenient if you\u2019re far away. Also, this is not recommended, but if I was you I would email the department that couldn\u2019t deal with this issue saying I\u2019m transferring and cc the Dean lol.\nAnyways, I know there\u2019s always better CCs out there that would welcome you, I hope you the best.",
