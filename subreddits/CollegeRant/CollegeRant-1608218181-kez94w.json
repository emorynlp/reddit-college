The only person that doesn\u2019t deserve to be disappointed is you. Going to school isn\u2019t easy; during a pandemic/epidemic, certainly isn\u2019t any easier. Give yourself credit! Mentally, failing helps us learn where we need to grow. Maybe not necessarily in the class itself, maybe in a habit or behavior that hinders our ability to absorb the information. Anything is possible, what is known is that you did fail, and you still have options. That\u2019s still somewhere to start! Emotions are strong and temporary, acknowledge how you feel, and once you\u2019ve reached a satisfactory level of acceptance Im sure you\u2019ll know exactly what to do. Keep your chin up!",
