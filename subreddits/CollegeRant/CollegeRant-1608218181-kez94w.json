Going to school isn\u2019t easy; during a pandemic/epidemic, certainly isn\u2019t any easier. Give yourself credit! Mentally, failing helps us learn where we need to grow. Maybe not necessarily in the class itself, maybe in a habit or behavior that hinders our ability to absorb the information. Anything is possible, what is known is that you did fail, and you still have options. That\u2019s still somewhere to start!
