Like my body can\u2019t handle staying up and pulling all nighters like I used to. I\u2019m confused on if wanna push through it and not sleep but then again self care? I started to take workout classes and this has been making me feel so great and when I sleep it\u2019s the best bc my body is tired. Lmao at this point idk. Try to focus on self care but it interferes w school stuff. And I honestly feeelll Soo Soo sad. I took a BIG L this semester my grades are not the best. Trying to tell myself that grades don\u2019t define myself.", "author": "pinkkcloudsss", "created": 1621002980, "retrieved": 1632842392, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gy3rgi4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nca3k4/sleeping_too_much/gy3rgi4/", "text": "Thank you u/pinkkcloudsss for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You shouldn\u2019t get into the habit of over sleeping, but you also shouldn\u2019t get 5-6 hours on a regular basis. A solid sleep schedule of 8-9 hours a night and the occasional nap is usually the sweet spot. Your brain functions better with proper sleep, and pulling all nighters often is definitely not productive. Listen to your body.", "author": "caitybailey", "created": 1621016099, "upvotes": 4}}}
