Like my body can\u2019t handle staying up and pulling all nighters like I used to. I\u2019m confused on if wanna push through it and not sleep but then again self care? I started to take workout classes and this has been making me feel so great and when I sleep it\u2019s the best bc my body is tired. Lmao at this point idk. Try to focus on self care but it interferes w school stuff. And I honestly feeelll Soo Soo sad. I took a BIG L this semester my grades are not the best. Trying to tell myself that grades don\u2019t define myself.", "author": "pinkkcloudsss", "created": 1621002980, "retrieved": 1632842392, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gy4m36n": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nca3k4/sleeping_too_much/gy4m36n/", "text": "There\u2019s a fine line with sleep. You shouldn\u2019t get into the habit of over sleeping, but you also shouldn\u2019t get 5-6 hours on a regular basis.

Your brain functions better with proper sleep, and pulling all nighters often is definitely not productive. Listen to your body.", "author": "caitybailey", "created": 1621016099, "upvotes": 4}}}
