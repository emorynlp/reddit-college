I\u2019ve done three internships and I\u2019m also an officer in two student orgs and a senator for student government. I was hoping these experiences would make me more marketable but it seems like I\u2019m only able to compete for more internships(often unpaid) or jobs that only require a high school degree. I\u2019ll admit as a non STEM major, my job prospects were never going to be great and obviously COVID-19 is making things worse but I\u2019m tired of competing for jobs with joke salaries or no pay at all. Half of the post grad jobs I was told companies and non profits were offering were $30k in large cities. This is literally not only low, but arguably unlivable without extra support in a large city. The others were offering unpaid internships. One even had the audacity to suggest I do a year long unpaid internship after graduation. I could literally make more working at Starbucks. \n\nIdk man I get that businesses and especially nonprofits are suffering but it honestly is starting to infuriate me how many companies go to college fairs and demand that college students have years of experience. The amount of ones who also seemed to not count internship experience as relevant but suggested interning to get a foot in the door was also hilarious. Honestly I\u2019d be happy starting at $40k. It would be still be shitty but at least I\u2019d be able to survive in the city. \n\nIt just makes me feel like not only college was a waste of time, but also the internships I did. I was already seriously considering doing a gap year and going to grad school after but this just solidified my decision that that\u2019s the right choice. Idk maybe this whining makes me entitled but it honestly just feels like a non STEM bachelors won\u2019t get you very far these days, even if you try to network and do everything right.", "author": "SexiestPizzaAlive", "created": 1602115977, "retrieved": 1632842955, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g8mr2qm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j72nm3/career_fair_made_me_feel_like_college_was_a_waste/g8mr2qm/", "text": "This is my exact experience. Except I do have one of those STEM majors you speak of. I seemingly did everything right: I did well in college, graduated with honors, took up an extra minor to make myself even more marketable, had a good internship and so on. I\u2019ve now been applying to jobs for about a year and a half, without any luck. Except for the occasional insulting job offers like unpaid internships, and unbearably low compensation packages ($12-$14/hr). I made more money before going to college than my current prospects. To add insult to injury, if I had continued doing what I was doing (construction) and not gone to college, I would be a superintendent by now making at least 60k/yr.", "author": "agiuchin", "created": 1602538453, "upvotes": 3}, "g8452bf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j72nm3/career_fair_made_me_feel_like_college_was_a_waste/g8452bf/", "text": "Tbh I'm nervous cuz although I'm planning on majoring in bio/chem, I'm not sure if I'll get a job.
