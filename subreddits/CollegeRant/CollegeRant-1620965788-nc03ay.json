I stupidly missed a deadline to turn in two labs and I failed my physics lab again. A one credit class. Now I get to go to campus twice a week for 2 hours for 10 weeks to take a lab that I\u2019ve already done all the work for. I\u2019m so upset at myself and the unwillingness of my professor to work with me. I haven\u2019t told my parents yet, I don\u2019t want them to be disappointed in me. After 5 grueling years with only one summer semester off, I\u2019ve made it, and there\u2019s one more goddamn bump in the road. This college shit is bullshit. I\u2019m so over it. If covid never happened I am so sure I would have graduated already.
