It can definitely still be frustrating simply because it always is when you can't communicate with the professor, but it's at least structured to make sense. I did online classes for years and only had a problem with a handful, but when classes became remote, most every asynchronous class I had was a dumpster fire. Night be something to consider if you don't wanna completely give up. That being said it might also be good to take a break if you aren't already doing it for summer or decrease the amount of classes you take in the fall", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1617960591, "upvotes": 7}, "gtwnorg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mn1yer/i_am_tired_of_online_school_i_will_never_be_doing/gtwnorg/", "text": "I\u2019ve reached my breaking point as well.", "author": "Jobbitussin", "created": 1617953811, "upvotes": 7}, "gtweoro": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mn1yer/i_am_tired_of_online_school_i_will_never_be_doing/gtweoro/", "text": "I'm upset as the fact that school did not decrease the cost since we are getting a reduced education", "author": "GothicAssassin", "created": 1617946189, "upvotes": 14}, "gtwa1x1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mn1yer/i_am_tired_of_online_school_i_will_never_be_doing/gtwa1x1/", "text": "Going through the same shit.
