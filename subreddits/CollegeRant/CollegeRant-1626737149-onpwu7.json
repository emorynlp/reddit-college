So sorry mods if I broke any unmentioned rules. Anyways here is my rant:\n\nI signed up for a CC 8 week summer course for Calc1 because if I didn't I would have to spend 4 years at CC and I did not want that considering I have to already spend 3. Apparently a week before the class started they had to change the professor I originally signed up for due to her having family issues which is completely understandable. However a notice would've been nice but I did not get such. The professor I signed up for originally I took before and liked them so I wanted to take them again, the new professor however was rated poorly on rate my professor and within the first few minutes of class I knew this was going to be hell. \n\nFirst off, week one we covered limits, the topic itself didn't seem to hard but the issue occurred when we were assigned 2 sections a day meaning we got about 40-65 long ass limit problems a day. It took me 8-12hrs just to grind through homework! To make things worse I had work on the weekend and essentially had no time to study for the test next week on the Monday. The first exam I essentially flunked but so did the class, with everyone averaging an F and no one got an A. The professor did not curve the exam.\n\nThankfully they realized the hw seemed extreme and limited us to about half of the hw problems which was manageable and something I respected because they listened. However as the course went on they began to get lazy, we get either no or very late email responses to concerns or questions. They take 2weeks to grade exams and to top it off we dont even see what we get wrong, so I can't even correct my mistakes. \n\nSome other things that were annoying is, we cannot see our grades, we have to calculate it ourselves because our assignments are all on mymathlab and they use a weird grading percentages so its really hard to estimate my grade. The professor also forgets to post hw which delays my schedule and everyone else time even more and since I essentially have no way to contact them they won't publish it till the next day of class which sets me behind even more and adds unnecessary stress. She also fails to teach us well, I have to rely on 3 of my friends who have all finished calc3 with stellar As and professor Leonard on YouTube to even understand material since class is a waste of time. (I have yet to miss a day of class)\n\nI am not the smartest person, I admit that, but I am proud of earning straight As in both college algebra and Trig. I like math too, I love explaining concepts to my friends who don't know as much as me, I even explained derivatives to my friend who hasn't started calculus yet. I am doing everything in my power to pass but the class ends in 2-3 weeks and I am so scared of failing it. I have gotten anxiety attacks at work and with friends, I am very irritable, all of this is caused by lack of sleep as well since I am so stressed I just fall asleep and wake up early in the morning due to anxiety. All my friends know I am overworking myself as well, they feel bad and say that calculus 1 shouldn't be this hard. \n\nI wanted to make this post a month ago but felt it was too early. I am the type of person who likes to push on through and see how far I can go but its really beating me down. I'm just not sure what else I should do. I feel like the dean won't do shit because this professor was a replacement for another professor. So regardless if I fail then I will probably have to retake and waste more of my time.\n\nTo those who have made it this far thank you, I will not respond to comments since this account will be thrown away but I will monitor the post to see responses if you have advice :)\n\nTL;DR: My calc teacher is not doing her job well at all and I am worried about failing the class, I just needed a place to get it out of my system and complain.", "author": "newrantacct", "created": 1626737149, "retrieved": 1632841747, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"h5t9cdd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/onpwu7/my_calc1_class_has_been_a_nightmare/h5t9cdd/", "text": "Thank you u/newrantacct for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
