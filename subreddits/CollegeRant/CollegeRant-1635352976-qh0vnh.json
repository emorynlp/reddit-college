  "text": "I have accumulated a collection of books from my past college courses and I am having a lot of trouble getting rid of them. All of the books combined are worth at least $80 but the college I attend will only give me $3 and they won't accept them in person. Tather I have to ship it to a company in China and then the school will buy it back from there ( I have to pay for the shipping ).\n\nI want to get rid of the books, I have no need for them and I'm wondering if anyone knows a good place or service that I can sell my books to and get their proper value in return.",

              "text": "I wouldn't say nothing. It's really a question of what you want to do. \n\nDo you want to simply get rid of your textbooks? Then those are pretty much your options. If you price them by marking them down, you can still likely sell them at a decent price and recover some of your money. I.E. $50 textbook (original price) can be advertised for $30. \n\nIf you're looking to get your money back, it's unlikely. Much like cars, college textbooks are usually designed to depreciate as soon as you buy them, which is why many students will go out of their way to find free online versions, buy used (and adjust towards the material), or might even skip buying a textbook altogether. Unfortunately, many textbook-based courses update their materials every year/couple of years and professors will push their students to buy the updated versions because of licensing agreements between institutions and the publisher. \n\nInsane mark-ups and obsolescence by design are major issues with college textbooks, but you still have options m8.",
