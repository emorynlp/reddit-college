I spent 10-15 hours research and putting this shit together. The professor did not specify how much time we\u2019d be allotted and it\u2019s worth 80% of our grade so you know I went all out. I got halfway through and he started getting mad because I didn\u2019t see he put in the zoom chat to wrap it up. I\u2019m literally crying because I\u2019m so worried he\u2019s gonna tank my grade because of it. And I tried so hard.
