  "title:": "Professor cuts off my presentation worth 80% of my grade halfway through",
  "text": "I just presented for a class. I spent 10-15 hours research and putting this shit together. The professor did not specify how much time we\u2019d be allotted and it\u2019s worth 80% of our grade so you know I went all out. I got halfway through and he started getting mad because I didn\u2019t see he put in the zoom chat to wrap it up. I\u2019m literally crying because I\u2019m so worried he\u2019s gonna tank my grade because of it. And I tried so hard. Like I wanna die omg.\nedit: should i ask if i failed",

Emphasize that you put a lot of hard work in to this project, but you weren\u2019t warned that there would be such a short time limit and that is out of your control.\n++ it\u2019s his responsibility as a professor to give out clear rubrics",
