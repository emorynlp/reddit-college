  "text": "I withdrew from a college I loved due to health reasons. I then transferred to another, larger school closer to home to finish my degree. At my old school, there were a few gen ed requirements, but at this new one I have to take THREE natural science courses as well as three history/social studies, a philosophy course, and a ton more. For the first two semesters at this new school, I did nothing but gen eds.\n\nFor some reason, a bunch of my credits from my old school didn\u2019t carry over and I had to make several calls/meetings with people to get it fixed. After talking to several useless advisors, I was told I could graduate Spring 2022 based on how I planned my classes. \n\nFast forward to last week. Another advisor is now telling me I could be up to 9 credits behind if I take 12 credits my final semester. Even though I will have completed all gen eds and all of my major\u2019s requirements by May 2022, that *still* somehow isn\u2019t enough to graduate in then. \n\nI feel misled. I had at least three people telling me for over a year that I could graduate in the spring and that I\u2019d be fine. And now in my last year, I\u2019m told I can\u2019t? So I guess I\u2019ll be taking classes in the summer, even though I planned to move right after graduation and now have to change all of my plans.",

      "text": "Was the original college you transferred from an accredited school because that can play a part in wether your credits were transferred or not. I would recommend checking your new schools pre reqs and seeing if your old school has an equivalent of that you took already. Then you can make a case to your academic advisor on why you should get those credit approved",

              "text": "On your transcript from your previous college it should have an exact title and course number. I think when they transferred over, sometimes they will as generic names because the college system doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. However your old school as excuse course names and codes for them. So you look at your old college transcript, then look at the course requirements for your current degree program and see if they match. Also look at the course descriptions of both to ensure you we\u2019re learning the same thing. If it\u2019s a general education course it was more then likely the same thing. Email is always the best way to get in contact with someone so I\u2019d start with that. Emailing you academic adviser and them telling them you know the college has these exact classes you also took. \n\nAlso it\u2019s important to note that colleges will only accept a certain amount of credits from other colleges and then they won\u2019t anymore. Its usually about half of what you need to graduate, the equivalent of an Associates degree.",
