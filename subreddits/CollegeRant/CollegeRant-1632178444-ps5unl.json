I then transferred to another, larger school closer to home to finish my degree. At my old school, there were a few gen ed requirements, but at this new one I have to take THREE natural science courses as well as three history/social studies, a philosophy course, and a ton more. For the first two semesters at this new school, I did nothing but gen eds.\n\nFor some reason, a bunch of my credits from my old school didn\u2019t carry over and I had to make several calls/meetings with people to get it fixed. After talking to several useless advisors, I was told I could graduate Spring 2022 based on how I planned my classes. \n\nFast forward to last week. Another advisor is now telling me I could be up to 9 credits behind if I take 12 credits my final semester. Even though I will have completed all gen eds and all of my major\u2019s requirements by May 2022, that *still* somehow isn\u2019t enough to graduate in then. \n\nI feel misled. I had at least three people telling me for over a year that I could graduate in the spring and that I\u2019d be fine. And now in my last year, I\u2019m told I can\u2019t? So I guess I\u2019ll be taking classes in the summer, even though I planned to move right after graduation and now have to change all of my plans.", "author": "miscellaneousbean", "created": 1632178444, "retrieved": 1632840992, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hdnf4n9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps5unl/some_schools_really_dont_give_a_shit_about/hdnf4n9/", "text": "Thank you u/miscellaneousbean for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would recommend checking your new schools pre reqs and seeing if your old school has an equivalent of that you took already.
