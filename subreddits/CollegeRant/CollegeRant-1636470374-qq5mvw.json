  "text": "that's such shit. \n\n80% is the general cutoff for 'i know my shit well enough', same for a 3.0 GPA. \n\nBut fucking WHY does a B- [ie, a percentage score above 80, I know there's a '-' there, I do not care] turn into a 2.7. \n\nFucking absolute shit. \n\n81%, 81%, 85%. Looking fairly okay. But the GPA conversion fucks me in the ass sideways. \n\nShit.\n\nedit: furthermore, I'd complain about the letter grade system too. A 79 and 80, when looked at as portions of 100, are effectively, statistically, basically the same. Yet the arbitrary cutoff there changes a B to a C and a 3 to a 2. Fucking asinine.",

I know that they're trying to better fit grades into the scale by keeping full letter grades at those numbers while giving the pulses a boost and the minuses a penalty, but a B- is still a B and should qualify for the 3.0 range. It really screws students when compared students in other institutions that don't do the plus/minus thing an just give a full letter grade to whoever passes the post. \n\nPersonally I think that all letter grades should have the same weight and the plus/minus (if they have to be used) should just be there as an indicator to the student of how well they did. That or do away with the minus all together and give a 0.5 boost to the plus grade.",
