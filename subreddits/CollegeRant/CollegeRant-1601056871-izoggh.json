  "text": "COVID-19 has made college extra lonely, even being on campus. But considering that most of my life I\u2019ve been very outgoing and social, I don\u2019t know why I got here and it\u2019s so hard to make friends?? Everyone here seems to already have their own group and it makes me feel like no one is as alone as me. I have about 3 friends and that\u2019s because one is someone from home. My anxiety has increased soooo much, and I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m slipping back into depression. I\u2019m not homesick or disliking the school/city, it\u2019s just the social aspect. So is anyone else this lonely?",

      "text": "I find myself getting more lonelier as the years progress. When I was a freshman I had so many groups and friends and people to be around that made that point up to the first half of my 2nd year great. Then shit happened and suddenly most of those people are gone by my 3rd year and then corona happened and now just about everyone but 1 or 2 people I really trust are left. And now I will take a 5th year and they will be graduated at that point lol. I really don't even know what to expect after I graduate. \n\nI am not sure how far you are in but I would say to frame yourself into a person you would want to be friends with and strive towards becoming that person everyday. This is what I have been doing and while I generally have trouble making friends, I still have the one friend I mentioned before that has told me I am a good influence and I do my best to try to be the person I picture myself to be. Generally a lot of people will be attracted to that and want to be your friend. I think this is why people say you gotta love yourself first before other can love you in that sense (of course im talking about friendships tho)\n\nAlso if you can, join a club/organization! This is probably the best and really only way to make friends in university now at this point and its how I met most of the friends I have today. Most of them should be doing virtual meetings and doing stupid college stuff like playing Among Us and Animal Crossing. (like me :D ), but it also helps for potentially networking in the future.\n\nHope these random snippets of text help and I am always open to talk about life college or anything :D",

      "text": "I was fairly popular in high school and knew all my small graduation class (around 250ish students), now college comes about, commuting to save money, thought I would still make friends. Long story short, 6 weeks in and the only people in the college who know my name is a small handful of  teachers and advisors. \n\nAs hard as it, try becoming comfortable with yourself, don\u2019t limit yourself to only having fun when around friends, you can do stuff like walk or run and figure out life.",

I don\u2019t have any friends and the masks plus the no roomate situation make making friends really hard. All of my friends are 3 time zones away and my depression is slowly creeping back as the days get shorter. Even speaking in class gives me a crazy amount of anxiety, even on zoom and it never used to be this way. Just know, you\u2019re not alone.",
