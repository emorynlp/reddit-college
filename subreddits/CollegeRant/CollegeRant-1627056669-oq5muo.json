  "text": "Sometimes I feel like everyone around me believes I am predestined to go to med school. Chosen by Hippocrates himself. My parents both went to med school in different countries so I don't think they can relate too well to how I view the experience. I think I really want to study sociology. Not medical sociology or public health, just sociology (though that comes with its own fears). It's going to be hard enough to convince my parents that it's something I can make a career out of, but I also literally just came from a job interview today where I said I wanted to work at a nursing home for the summer because I was a premed student.  \n\n\nI feel like I've just put myself in a bind right before I have to decide classes for next year. My dad's already talking to me about ochem prep when I know I want to sign up for sociology and poli sci classes. I don't want to have to suck it up and waste another year on premed classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: don't want to do medicine, but everything is pointing in that direction and it's awkward for me",

      "text": "I think you should definitely study what you\u2019re more passionate about, but if you choose a risky degree make sure you don\u2019t go into debt for it. I would really take the time to explore your passion and see what motivates you to study sociology, and find a way to incorporate that drive in to your future job. \n\nPeople really can\u2019t mentally get through med school unless it\u2019s what they want to do, and your parents need to understand that it\u2019s your life and you don\u2019t need to be a doctor just because that\u2019s what they chose to be. Nor do you need to be a doctor in order to be labeled as successful in life. IMO if you can find any job that involves bettering the world they should be proud.\n\nJust make sure you understand what opportunities getting a degree in sociology will open up for you, and if you think it\u2019s a good idea then lay it all out to your parents. Good luck OP",

      "text": "My first degree was in social psychology. I went back to go to med school and make my resume better with more science courses, a science degree and prerequisites. The switch was because a sociology and psychology degree was worthless. Be sure to really do your research. That\u2019s an expensive degree to get screwed like I did.\n\nEdit: I have an as sociology bs psychology ms social psychology in this field. Plus some for sciences. I did love it, but the pay I couldn\u2019t do.",

      "text": "OP I think if you really want to study sociology and not continue with premed you need to have a conversation with your parents about the same. Do your parents even have a clue that you have no interest in med? If you haven't said anything about it they might not even have a clue that you do not enjoy pre-med.\n\nThere's nothing worse than being stuck with a major you have no interest in.",
