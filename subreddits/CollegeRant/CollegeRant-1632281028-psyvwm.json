  "text": "do any first gen kids of immigrants feel any guilt for getting into college? both my parents didn\u2019t go to a four year university but my dad dropped out of UH because he went broke. i feel so guilty that my college is paid for when he could\u2019ve used that money to finish his degree.\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong, i am more than ecstatic to get into my first choice school. not to mention that i get the biggest privilege of having it paid for and having my main focus on my studies. i know i earned my spot at this school and i am proud of myself.\n\nthe thing is, my dad worked harder than i ever will in my entire life. i mean, when i told him i got in he was at work covered in oil (he\u2019s a mechanic). and seeing him cry from my accomplishments made me cry, but that was because he made it possible for me. \n\nin all honesty though i just feel snobby. and guilty for feeling guilty. like my dad works 7 days a week 9-5 just so i can move 1,000 miles away to chase my dreams. while he still has to work his ass off for another 2 years. i literally asked him how long he\u2019s been saving up for me and he said once he found out my mom was pregnant. i cried on the spot\n\nall in all, grateful is an understatement, i am more than thankful. i deserve the spot at my university because i worked hard but i feel guilty that my dad worked harder.",

You getting your degree will give your dad way more happiness than him finishing his own degree. One day when youre successful, help your dad go back to school or help him in some other way",

I\u2019m almost 32 going back to college to hope I can make enough money that I can put away savings for my kids to do so much more. \n\nAs parents all we want is to see our children have less of a struggle than we had. To see them blossom and flourish. In your eyes he may have \u201cmissed out\u201d but I\u2019d be willing to bet every ounce of work he\u2019s ever put in was to see you do good and he\u2019s just thrilled! Don\u2019t stress it!",

Your parents have been striving towards that goal since before you were born. \n\nYou shouldn't feel guilty for availing yourself of the opportunity they're providing you. You should only feel guilty if you squander it needlessly. Go on, work hard, do well, and make your parents proud. That's a far greater gift that you could give them than the monetary value of the money spent on your tuition.",

      "text": "I'm a dad and I would much rather my son pursue his dreams over me pursuing mine. I had my chance, he's young and has his whole life ahead of him. He's only 3, but I can't imagine feeling any different about this when he's 18. I'm also saving for his future, but I'm not the kind of parent that will force him to go to college, just so long as he has a plan. If he wants to be a plumber and he's passionate about it, fine, go be an apprentice and do it. If he wants to be a doctor and go through a decade of school, also fine. I'll support him either way.\n\nI suspect your parents feel similarly about you. They're just happy you have opportunities that they didn't get. Every parent wants their kids to have a better life than they do. If your dad works 7 days a week, he's going to be thrilled at the end of your senior year when you tell him you have a good paying job with a salary that is 9-5 and M-F.",
