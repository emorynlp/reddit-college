  "text": "I woke up at 10, stayed in bed for like 2 and a half hours, did almost nothing today, other than clean and rearrange my room, and I just am sitting on my bed. I\u2019ve been trying to exercise to help with depression, but I was just sore as shit and the depression is still there. I never realized how much I\u2019d waste my time being exhausted in college, it\u2019s fucking unbelievable. I see people going out, being with friends, being productive and studying, and I can\u2019t even go out and like read a book? Fuck\u2026",

      "text": "dude thank god you posted this. I totally feel this way and I have a midterm tomorrow- havent done any readings. also havent enjoyed my few social experiences lately. I woke up at 9am and read like 2 pages of a reading over an hour because I am just distracted. This definitely happens to a bunch of college students, just no one can tell because we don't show that side usually.   \n\n\nI used to rearrange my dorm room all the time because I was so sick of the monotony. If you have a nature area on your campus, try your best to dick around in the woods like once a day. I didn't do this every day, but whenever I did go dick around in nature it really grounded me. I dont easily like people at my school, so chilling with trees and wind and stuff is a nice outlet for pent up social energy.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, I hear this not only from students... educators also are struggling with different kinds of depression. And I absolutely get what you feel when you don't do anything - you don't have a rest really and waste your time.\r  \nUsually, you need to get a bit of support from your friends or your family in this case, but sometimes it's necessary to get professional help. Don't hesitate to contact a mental health service - it's usually available at college campuses. You can look for the right contact in [this list](https://ivypanda.com/blog/mental-health-resources/) as well - there are a lot of options.\r  \nWe all should take care of ourselves. Hope it helps.",
