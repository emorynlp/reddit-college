  "text": "I\u2019m a first semester community college student. This quarter has honestly sucked. All online classes, meaning I ended up spending most of my time stuck at home. I also clearly have not learned anything since high school because I ended up failing nearly all of my classes. Have been spending 25-30 hrs/wk working a shitty retail job, I kept asking them to reduce my hours but they never did because they\u2019re ridiculously understaffed and the company has shit management. I\u2019ve been trying to at least work towards getting my drivers license because not being able to drive in the suburbs is hell, but I honestly just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m cut out for this world sometimes. Like, even with driving, I feel like I\u2019m just not cut out for it, I feel like I\u2019m going to inevitably screw something up. Just like with my job, just like with college. I know I\u2019m not as smart as other people and maybe I\u2019m just not cut out for this. \n\nI signed up for classes for next semester but they\u2019re all still online too. Don\u2019t know when or if the college administration is planning to actually re-open the campus. I want to quit my job so badly but at the same time I feel guilty. Like I shouldn\u2019t quit because if I do it\u2019ll mean I\u2019m lazy. I\u2019m already lazy but this\u2019ll just be further proof of it. I have no friends and I suck at making friends. I\u2019m so lonely but I don\u2019t know how to not be. I don\u2019t know how to be a good person. I know I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019ll just never be one. Maybe I\u2019m not even meant to be here in the first place.",

      "text": "hey just saw this. Please stop being so hard on yourself. Everything in life is a learning process especially at your age. Take everything step by step. If you can\u2019t keep up with school, I highly suggest you cut down the work hours or quit if that\u2019s impossible with your management team. This will give you more time and energy to focus on your studies. You are not \u201clazy\u201d for not working 25-30hrs/wk. There is nothing to feel \u201cguilty\u201d about. It\u2019s called prioritizing and doing what\u2019s best for your study and mental health. If you must work for financial reasons, get a new job with less hours. \nAs for making friends, go out and meet new people.  Ofc it\u2019s easier said then done but honestly, that\u2019s the only way to see the change you want. Push yourself and see it as a fun challenge. You will surprised the amount of people that are willing to befriend you. Trust me, there are so many genuine people out there (ahaha myself included). You have to make the effort to see the change you want. Granted, you will come across awful toxic people but never take anything to heart. If they don\u2019t want to your friend, no hard feelings. It\u2019s their choice and honestly why be friends with someone like that. repeat this process until you meet people you truly vibe with. Most importantly, reward yourself every time you do something out of your comfort zone :)\n\nLastly, please please speak more kindly to yourself. I\u2019m sure you would never speak the way you do to yourself to a another person. SO why be so mean to yourself? be your own damn best friend and cheerleader. you don\u2019t need this and that to love yourself. From right here and right now, choose to love yourself regardless - no conditions. Why? Simply because life will be SO MUCH easier for you if you just make that choice. the longest and most important relationship is with yourself. You are with yourself 24/7 so please please be kind to yourself. be super meticulous about this. Whenever you catch yourself with negative thoughts and insecurities. Stop yourself  right there and ask yourself, how does this benefit me in anyway? it never does. So why continuously participate in an action that brings you only harm? trust me, be super logical about it. WHY BE SHIT TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU CAN EMBRACE YOURSELF and make your life so much easier. I hate sounding cheesy but life really is too short and wonderful to reject yourself. Start building a healthy relationship with yourself. Ofc it takes time but you have to make the effort to see the change you want. I\u2019m SO proud of you for even seeking advices. You already know what you want for yourself, now you just have to put in the work. \nP.S you always have a friend in me :) \nStay safe \u2764\ufe0f",
