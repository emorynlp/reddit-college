  "text": "I'm a student at an community College and am studying for biology however my parents ( father mostly) is pushing me to do nursing because they make more money and hours are better. Since he's been doing this since I was a senior in high school back in 2019. My depression has kicked back in since 2020 from his constant jabbing at my career path. I many end up doing physical therapy but everytime I press career change for my college it tells me something about a application but send me to a blank page. I contacted my advisor but haven't seen a word back in a month. I tried again last week no response back. I understand many a bagged up due to covid and student complaints but my father is tearing me apart emotionally.\n\nSorry if it's too long I just needed to vent a bit.",

      "text": "Your advisor is probably trying to switch you to a premed program if you are planning to do physical therapy program after graduation, unless your school has their own (I have to apply to a different school after graduation for physical therapy). I'd look up the program at your school, then email your biology program advisor. Or heck, just go to their office before a scheduled class or something. \n\nBTW, fuck your dads opinions about what you should do. Then ask him if he always lived his life by how other thought he SHOULD live it. Also, let him know he's affecting your emotional well-being. If you two have a complicated relationship, then set a boundary - like \"dad, I love you, but these conversations make it difficult for me to focus on my studies, please stop.\"\n\nIf he doesn't let up, then ignore his phone calls. You don't owe them anything. Parents like to guilt trip their offspring into all kinds of stuff, but you're gonna be on your own one day and if you don't want to be a nurse, wouldn't that make you a bad nurse if you didn't have any ambition to do it in the first place? \ud83d\ude09",

      "text": "Honestly, you should focus on what YOU are passionate about. If you wanted to, you can still complete the Biology requirements but I would also complete chemistry and physics because that will make it 10000% easier for you to change majors even if you change your mind at a later time, whether it be biology to nursing, to physical therapy or other related fields. \n\nI still highly suggest talking to a counselor, send them an email or make an appointment in person if that\u2019s an option. \n\nBut most importantly: at the end of the day, you should study what YOU are passionate about. This college experience is YOURS, not your parents. I attended city college for 8 YEARS because my parents pushed me to do something I wasn\u2019t happy doing. You deserve your own happiness!",

I got one semester done and dropped out. If your heart is not in it, you will be miserable. You are in a good place at CC to change your mind. Hopefully you hear from your advisor soon.",
