  "text": "Dude I put in so much time and effort for this class online during covid. Never missed a class, actively participated during the lectures and kept my camera on the whole semester. I got a 91.3 as my final and I got a A- when the cut off for an A is a 92. I was so close to having straight A's man and I really fucking busted my ass this semester while working 30 hrs a fucking week. This is my first semester at this new school and I really was hoping for that shit but fuck it now. Idk Rant over I guess. Hope everyone else is doing well.",
