Everything is great EXCEPT the shitty ass POGIL that no one warn anyone about.\nIf you didn\u2019t know what Pogil is, it\u2019s a program that go \u201cfuck lecture, only group work lmao\u201d. It\u2019s another thing that denotes lectures as evil and only forced unnecessarily group work. Wtf learns like this. Meanwhile my group never includes me so I never learn. Yeah, fucking expect the adhd person to just learn from a textbook because according to Pogil \u201cLectures are only passive learning and student don\u2019t engage\u201d(fucking lies, those are the people who never ask questions). BUT THE WORST FUCKING PART?! IT TURN OUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY GOOD QUALITY REAL LEARNING CHEMISTRY LECTURES AND I WAS SIGN UP FOR ONE BEFORE I CHANGE MY SCHEDULE BEFORE THE SEMESTER STARTED! The stupid fucking university behind the scene crew does not distinguish between the two groups! So now I\u2019m fucking dropping stupid fucking Chemistry BECAUSE I END UP DREADING THE COURSE, not because it\u2019s my least favorite subject but because I\u2019m not even learning the subject and instead gaging in my mask full of snout and tears knowing that it only stress me out.", "author": "AlexandraThePotato", "created": 1631189694, "retrieved": 1632841117, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "comments": {"hc68a24": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkwm3s/fuck_pogil/hc68a24/", "text": "Thank you u/AlexandraThePotato for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
