I'm well aware of this. So no surprise this communication class is a requirement I can't get out of. I've invested a lot of my outside time in editing papers for this class, along with having family and school tutors critique my work. I only received a 73% on my last paper. My tutors said my work was good, it just required a few changes in sentence structure and rechecking my grammar. I fixed where there they pointed out my mistakes, strengthened the sentence structure and expanded details and still, my professor scored me so low with little feedback other than my citations were off.\n\nNow with this being my last paper for the class, I reached out for my professor for extra assistance to avoid previous mistakes. His only advice was to reread the articles he assigned us to read. \n\nI'm going to go scream in some pillows.", "author": "SmoothFlow8820", "created": 1628043155, "retrieved": 1632841678, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h7mogx4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oxioho/professor_is_a_tough_grader_and_it_makes_me_want/h7mogx4/", "text": "Thank you u/SmoothFlow8820 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I use the free version all of the time. Sometimes I\u2019m so exhausted that my work takes a nose dive when I stay up late writing. This helps highlight obvious errors and even suggests revisions for better clarity and style sometimes. \n\nAlso, use the Citations Manager in Microsoft Word if you can. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re using Word, but if you are, this is a life saver. Google a few videos on how to use it and take off from there. \n\nDoes the instructor use rubrics? Its hit and miss in my experience, but if they do, make adjustments based off of what\u2019s marked on the rubric. I\u2019ve had a few classes where I had to hunt through a bunch of hyperlinks to get to a rubric\u2026some don\u2019t lay their course content out well :(\n\nIf they\u2019re telling you to re-read the articles, my other advice is to open all of the articles, then open a word document. Paste the writing prompt into a blank word document. Section the prompt out into its distinct parts. Go back to each article and look for information that satisfies the section of the writing prompt you are working on. Copy and paste or somehow reference the information (ex: Article B, Page 2, Paragraph 3) the lines that correlate back to that section of the writing prompt. Add the articles you are referring to the citations manager immediately, so you don\u2019t forget. Go back through when you feel satisfied and synthesize the information into your own words and thoughts based on the content you\u2019ve drawn from the articles. \n\nThis is how I got through two masters programs with a learning disability. Give it a shot. It may or may not work depending on your style, but it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nAlso, keep using those resources. Tutors and the writing center at your university can be very helpful.", "author": "mother_of_nerd", "created": 1628072596, "upvotes": 22}, "h7my5sq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oxioho/professor_is_a_tough_grader_and_it_makes_me_want/h7my5sq/", "text": "1: Has your professor given you specific feedback on your previous assignments and have you followed that feedback specifically on your next assignments to show you're trying to improve?\n\nDid you actually read, and re-read the assigned articles? College requires close reading, and re-reading to really understand concepts at a more advanced level. \n\nMy suggestion for the future is to go to your professors first because it shows you're putting in work and trying to do well. It also allows you to clarify things so there's no misunderstanding. Best wishes.", "author": "orangeblackteal", "created": 1628048261, "upvotes": 22}}}
