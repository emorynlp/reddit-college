I am planing on going into medicine which will have me in college around 8 years (4 pre-med + 4 med), so I decided I wanted get a year out of the way.  Fast forward to me making my schedule, rather than give me that year, they want to have me take a more relaxed schedule for my college career, and when I asked if I could get my pre-med done in 3 years, which I have the credits for, they said I would have to take a strict schedule consisting of little free time and many summer classes; I\u2019m not looking for a cake walk, but I\u2019m also not looking for a tight packed schedule, I just want normal.  After this they referred me to a separate advisor, who I would email day off; the email I sent him was of my current predicament, along with if there was anything could do to help sort anything out.  This man doesn\u2019t message me back for 2 days, this isn\u2019t even the weekend, and when he finally responds he has the audacity to act like an ass, saying that my email wasn\u2019t appropriate for an email (even though I was just trying to catch him up on what is happening) along with other things I won\u2019t get into at the moment; just know when I showed my dad the email, he was extremely pissed after hearing how this guy talked.  There were other things as well, however this was one of the biggest things at the moment.  Thank you to anyone who is reading this, as I wouldn\u2019t normally post anything like this, but the way this college has treated me in the past couple weeks has pissed me off a lot.\n\nEdit:  Thank you to all those who responded, with it being my first year there are many things I still don\u2019t know, so all of the info was helpful; this goes for both the positive and negative comments.  Although it was just me ranting, the feedback was great, when it comes to information.\n\nTL;DR  I got referred to an advisor who is an ass after trying to get my schedule to be normal.", "author": "Kc357", "created": 1627515166, "retrieved": 1632841697, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h6w5fcm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/otlsfg/i_have_a_years_worth_of_credits_but_rather_than/h6w5fcm/", "text": "Thank you u/Kc357 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Twice they've fucked up my degree by being wrong about requirements. My best advise is to talk to someone a year or two ahead of you in the same program. My other thought is if you didn't take ALL the credits for your freshman year in high school, you aren't a year ahead. You might have a years worth of credits but if they aren't the specific ones for your freshman year curriculum it will most likely take you just as long but with a somewhat reduced course load. This is because classes often have prerequisites. For my degree the chain of prerequisites starts the first semester.
