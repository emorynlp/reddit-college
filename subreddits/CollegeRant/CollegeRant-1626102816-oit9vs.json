  "text": "I graduated into the pandemic last year, but I want to talk about the worst professor I\u2019ve ever had. \n\nHere\u2019s a list of things this woman did:\n\n- Day one syllabus quiz. This is the only professor I\u2019ve ever had that did that. There was no point. I was legitimately already an adult. \n\n- Took 5% of our final grade every time we were absent. I had to cancel a job interview because the only time I was able to schedule it was during her class. When I emailed her, she said that since I didn\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s note, I would lose half a letter grade. She was 20 minutes late to class that day. And every day. When we went online due to the pandemic, she sent an email telling us that since times were difficult, we needed to all be patient and understanding with one another. I was fuming. \n\n- Gave us writing assignments graded by a computer. This was exactly as absurd as it sounds. We would write one page papers and submit them online. Some algorithm would read it and spit it back out in seconds. We had three tries to fix any problems it had with our work. These were not simple grammar issues; these were actual reading comprehension things this algorithm was looking for. I was a writing tutor at the time. I wrote a fucking book. I could not get more than like a 73 on these horrible assignments.",

It's one of the best things I've added and I recommend every professor do it.  You may think it's pointless, but you are grossly under-estimating how many emails we get from students asking questions that could be answered by reading the syllabus.\n\nAs for attendance, I don't care.  Come...don't come.  It's up to you.  It's your grade.   Data does show some sort of attendance policy does raise the average grade and average professor evaluation, but I still don't care.  I don't have the time to babysit students.\n\nEdit:  I see in another comment that this was a capstone.  These are treated differently.  Less strict.  I would not do a syllabus quiz in this class, however I also wouldn't answer emails that could be answered if the student read the syllabus.   However, generally don't have this issue in a capstone.  By this level, students are ready to fly from the nest.",

Way too many emails that could easily be found in the syllabus. I even put the boilerplate stuff at the very end so my students don't have to read through it. The other points are BS (on the prof's end, not OP) but \"syllabus quizzes\" are one of the few ways we actually ensure students have at least opened the damn thing.",

Our university has a system that emails students their exam dates/times, they have it on the front page of the website, and it's front page of syllabus.  But I'll get a dozen emails every semester asking.  At least until I started the syllabus quiz.  \n\nAnother thing I do first day is show students some emails I receive (I remove students names of course).  We discuss how ridiculous they are:  \"Professor, I know I have a D, but I really need at least a B- or I won't be accepted to B-school\".  Sent the month of the semester.  Stuff like that.",

Syllabi quizzes are more and more common as people\u2019s willingness to read syllabi seems to be getting worse on the whole. If nothing else, it\u2019s an easy few points.\n\nAI grading is becoming more and more common. I am not a fan of it as I like to grade things myself (I don\u2019t even like having graders), but for large class sizes, those kinds of tools are being implemented more frequently (especially for low stakes assignments). She may also have no choice but to use those assignments if it\u2019s a course with many sections managed more closely by the department (in which case, this is a departmental issue that might need to be discussed). It would be helpful to know what it\u2019s looking for - was it looking for specific keywords that were in the readings and then docking you for not using enough of them? It\u2019s probably difficult to get the formula it was using since it\u2019s probably proprietary (thanks, major publishers!).",
