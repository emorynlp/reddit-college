  "text": "I recently took a midterm, my first exam during the quarantine, my first exam using Respondus. And I can say with no hesitation: what a load of absolute bullshit.\n\nExams count for high portions of class grades in a short period of time - they\u2019re stressful enough under the regular testing conditions. So here we are at a time of unprecedented crisis, what do you do professor?\n\n* Have students install the infamous Respondus lockdown browser, which you might as well call malware, intrusively hijacking and monitoring your computer, streaming your webcam and microphone; can\u2019t wait for the security flaws that come forth in that.\n* Violate students, forcing them surrender their privacy and record their surroundings in their living space for the professor and TA to watch through Orwell's eye.\n* Scramble the order of the questions. Yeah, if they\u2019re all equal multiple choice, it makes sense. But otherwise \u2013 ya know how you\u2019ll have some True and False, some multiple choice, some short answer, and some long answer, in some reasonable order? Nah, fuck that. Long answer at the start, make me nervous for whether I\u2019m saving enough time for the other questions, and do shitty on this big question.\n* Prevent students from going back to review questions. God forbid I want to think about this question while answering other ones. Or otherwise be smart with my time like one does on an exam.\n* And randomly, in the middle of the exam.\n\n>\u201cType your name below to certify you didn\u2019t cheat. If you admit it now, there are less consequences?\u201d\n\nHere I am. Thanking Pepe^(TM) on the daily that my family is in good health, with this virus killing a New Yorker every \\~109 seconds. And the professor is wasting my energy on this moronic ass question? The whole exam isn\u2019t even over yet. Oh fuck oh shit, how will I type my name in this box if I cheated, my evil plans are thwarted. /s.\n\nAnd to what end? To the end of academic integrity and maintaining the reputation of this school (which I 100% support)? \n\n# No.\n\nThis is the epitome of **security theater**. Exacerbate the stress of honest students, while doing absolutely nothing to prevent dishonest students from cheating.\n\n* As if my 1/2 pixel potato webcam in this shitty lighting is going to pick up a cheat sheet. I\u2019m the one filming the environment video, I can hide whatever I want.\n* And as if a class of upper division Computer Science students can\u2019t figure out how to isolate and mitigate the Respondus trash? I can play a fake recording from a virtual webcam. Put Respondus in a VM. A second computer/monitor. The field of vision of my webcam can barely fit my giant head, you can\u2019t effectively see my surroundings and me simultaneously while I\u2019m taking the exam.\n* And how does scrambling the questions do anything but make it more frustrating to take a test? If students are collaborating, they\u2019ll tell each other what the question they\u2019re on. Doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re scrambled.\n* A god damn sheet of paper under my keyboard. Gosh golly gee, It isn\u2019t rocket science, the possibilities are endless.\n\nBut hey, if I\u2019m so smart, how do I say we fix this? How?\n\nWell that\u2019s easy. Make cheating not cheating. There are many better ways to ensure students are learning lecture content than to give this condensed second (as if we've learned that much since the first one) midterm exam that didn\u2019t move from its original schedule on the syllabus, after Spring break, after all students being forced to move out of their dorms, after an extra week off, and after a week where a sizable chunk of class was invested in turning the boomer into a Zoomer.\n\nGive an open assignment, have students explain their rationale for each question. Every student will learn the material if they haven\u2019t already through the assignment. Make it a bit complex, open ended, thought provoking, sure. Nothing more realistic than having students answer questions, and if they don\u2019t know the answer, they consult the material \u2013 sounds like the real world to me. Spend a class session going over the material instead of this useless exam. Use safe assign, that\u2019s non-intrusive and effective. It\u2019s a win win, if the aim is to facilitate understanding.\n\nBut no. hurt honest students. If the University supplies us dedicated hardware, a 360 camera, a solid internet connection, deploys Pepe^(TM) to bless each of our homes and watch over us (from 6ft away), then *maybe*, we can prevent cheating \u00adto some degree. But until then?\n\nWe're all adults. I'm here to learn. Spare the bullshit.\n\n`</rant>`",

It\u2019s not lost on us that there are hundreds of ways to circumvent these measures. It\u2019s also not fully my choice to use these cheating deterrents, but rather something imposed on us at the department level. \nWith all of this in mind, they are cheating deterrents - not cheating prevention. I definitely believe that these efforts deter cheating for those less determined to do so.",
