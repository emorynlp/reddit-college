I want to early start my career by looking for projects and stuff to do. \nI emailed my current professor (he teaches most of my Computer Science classes) about opportunities. I sent a very formal and respectful email, I just always do that. Though, I didn\u2019t receive any response. So that next thing I did was asking the head if CIS department who is also a professor but I never took her class because there was a section in syllabus that says I could email them if I am interested in their professionals. I also got ghosted. \n\nAm I bothering my professors? Is it a sensitive subject to ask a professor? I wish they said no instead of silence because I feel really bad if I offended them or something. And, I can\u2019t talk to them face2face because campus is still closed. \n\nPlease tell me your opinions, I can take criticism.
