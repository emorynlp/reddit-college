  "text": "I don't hate college but I don't love it. I'm just tired of it and it's getting old and I don't know if things will get better. I just transferred from my school and I work full days two days a week MW 9 hours a day and go to school TTH 9 hours a day and then I'm too exhausted to enjoy the weekend. I feel like I can't connect with the people that I've met here because of my schedule and I don't know what I'm doing wrong otherwise. On top of that there's a concert I wanted to go to in another city in a few weeks and I can't afford the trip because I have to pay for spring semester a few weeks later and I don't know the future of my job that I used to like but that now drains the life out of me. Like I work so hard but I'm still so fucking broke and can't do the things I want to and its ridiculously frustrating. On top of that I have to search for an internship NOW and I have made absolutely no progress because I'm always working or doing homework. I feel like college is making me miss out on life and I don't know how to shake this feeling.",

      "text": "Yeah. People always say college will be the time of your life but to many it's just a couple of years that you will lose entirely to being constantly drained of all energy and joy. There's nothing you can really plan for because the next semester is usually in the fog. I haven't had any time for myself and my things only since 2017. I spend all my holidays studying, writing papers or doing internships, while I still have a job as well. I can't afford anything because rent is crazy expensive these days.\n\nI like to study, I like learning but I hate the stress. I'm 22 now and I'm like: you lost your prime and youth to working yourself into the ground for a future that may be but maybe also won't. And the worst: it's expected of you and nobody appreciates it. At least in my country people constantly make fun of students for being useless know-it-alls and lazy people. I don't want anyone to pat me on the back but maybe don't call me useless and lazy, please?",
