  "text": "So I was interested in computer science and took a beginner coding course. Overall I still like the concept but I was stupid and picked a once a week class, not realizing we learn at our own pace and that day is for lectures and review.\n\nI struggled to keep up and eventually just started paying people to do it for me. So far I got a B, but I know down the road finals will come and I\u2019m probably gonna fail cause I have bare minimum knowledge and I\u2019m just stressing. We switched from python to Java this week but I feel like I\u2019m so far behind I don\u2019t know how to pick up the slack.",
