              "text": "So whats the game plan, smoke every day for the rest of your life? Your tolerance will only go up, and if you take a tolerance break youll be miserable and useless. What if you want to go somewhere or do something that means you cant smoke, are you just gonna miss out on fun life events to feed your addiction? What if money gets tight and you cant afford your weed? What if you get a job that drug tests? Trust me, addiction kicks your ass somewhere down the line. Recovered h addict here, I know thats more severe but the behaviors and mentality are similar",
