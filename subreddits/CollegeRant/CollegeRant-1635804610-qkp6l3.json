  "title:": "Spent my senior year Halloween/rivalry weekend alone",
  "text": "This is my last year of college. We had the big rivalry football game on Saturday and Halloween on Sunday.\n\nBut in my four years, I've made basically no friends on campus (I know a few people, and we text, but we rarely meet up/seem to be first priority).\n\nI tried to get closer to my crush in my hometown, even if it was just as friends, but she blew off my last couple invites to hang out (though she says she still wants to hang out, I don't think that's true since it's been a couple months now). \n\nI am somewhat introverted in terms of shyness, but I am somewhat extroverted in the sense that my biggest love language is probably quality time. So I've tried to put myself out there and initiate making plans with people and building closer friendships and stuff. But like I said above, the results have been suboptimal.\n\nSo I spent this weekend the same way as the previous years: laying in bed, watching everyone's Instagram and Snapchat stories, wondering how they all managed to find their friend groups that actually seem to reciprocate the interest.\n\nI just worry that I'm going to graduate without any number of firsts (first date, kiss, etc.), with very few friends (and I hear it only gets harder as an adult), and without ever really having the \"college experience.\"",

      "text": "Wow! Wishing you better luck!\n\nHave you tried Bumble BFF? I know someone who has had good luck making friends through that app.\n\nMy go-to suggestion is to get to your classes well ahead of time. Other students who are waiting in the hall for class to start are often interested in conversing. Just make eye contact (if they don\u2019t make eye contact, try them another day) and say something like you like their shoes/shirt/necklace/cap/whatever and watch their body language.\n\nEdit: If you still haven\u2019t made any friends by the end of term, volunteer to foster a puppy. You won\u2019t even have to start the conversation!",

(I don't have any problem being friends with the same gender or anything, and I get why they have it set up that way, but I just didn't love it on principle. The few friends I do have are split pretty evenly between men and women.)\n\nMy schedule this semester doesn't really let me get to class early most days sadly, but maybe next semester!",

I hadn't really socialized because I didn't want to get attached to my college (i have zero school spirit and i dislike certain aspects of it a lot) because i just wanted to just get my degree and regroup afterwards, since I was basically in too deep by the point of my realisation that I wanted to leave. And I already had friends outside of college.\n\nI integrated ok with the latino students b/c of my major this year but that has been hampered by my spanish is suboptimal since I have a difficult history with it and haven't practiced really at all. Also it's difficult because everyone i know who is an upperclassman is busy and are taking tough majors. Most upperclassmen friend/social groups are feel hard to break into, since it feels like they've already solidified.\n\nAnd, while I don't mind hanging out with lowerclassmen, it isn't great when you're also trying to look for someone to do some casual dating with.",
