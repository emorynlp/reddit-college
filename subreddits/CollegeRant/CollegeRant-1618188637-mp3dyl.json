Meanwhile, every Saturday we see giant tours going on - they aren't social distancing and they're even coming in to see our dorms! My dad can't come in to use the bathroom but yeah sure let's allow a bunch of strangers in. I'm so glad I'm graduating in June, this is ridiculous... we get tested at least once a week! We aren't doing anything wrong! I have to fill out a form to leave campus for groceries!", "author": "cr1ss-b", "created": 1618188637, "retrieved": 1632951553, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gu9lim8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mp3dyl/school_warns_us_about_a_rise_in_cases_making_us/gu9lim8/", "text": "It's always deflection with these people.
