Anyway let me explain my situation, I'm a student at uni studying computer science. I start the first few weeks off strong (I get fairly decent grades) however there was a death in the family that got me a little depressed in mid January. I was feeling down, I attended class but stopped doing work as I would say \"it's fine to miss one week of work I'll do it next week\". Fast forward a few weeks more of this depression and the fact that a few of my friends are still unemployed after graduating last fall. Suddenly a second family member died, this time it was a murder. Anyway long story short these events have made it hard for me to get back into studying. Now I'm really scared that I blew this semester and feel like a complete loser. I've been absolutely horrified to email my professors because I feel like I might get some bad answers from them (such as failing me/not helping me catch up etc). Anyway what do you guys think, any opinions? I'm basically writing this here to get it off my chest and calm my nerves but I really need some advice. Also sorry for my weird English, it's a second language.

I stopped going to class, stopped turning stuff in, I even stopped being interested in doing the things I liked to do outside of school. I felt completely hopeless and feared letting my professors know (especially the ones who I had already earlier in the semester asked for extensions before the passing had happened). But, like you I had no other choice. I told them and they all responded with compassion and tried to work with me to figure out some way I could get all of my work done (and exempt some others) so I could actually pass that semester. It still was hard for me but I mustered up the little energy I had to finish. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of bed most of the day and eventually through constant self persuasion I would make myself practically crawl to my desk to do a few hours of work. You HAVE to let your professors know. It\u2019s the only way they can help you during this difficult time and the only way at this point you can help yourself.
