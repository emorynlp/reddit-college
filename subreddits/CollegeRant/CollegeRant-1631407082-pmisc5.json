Plus it has some positives which while writing made me very happy to reflect on them.\n\nAs of now, I am a 30M, but it all begins after the 2008 recession my father lost his job, I graduated high school but knew that college wasn't in the cards. Over the course of several moves and jobs, I started working for the airlines I worked there for 5 years. And while the job like most had its ups and downs, I was able to pay off a new car very quickly, but I was never really satisfied. This all stems from people in my life who in their own kindness wanted better for me than to work some job at the airport. I love to draw, create and make animations. So I often heard comments and insights from Friends and Family that I was wasting my time and that I should do what I'm good at. I never really paid too much attention because above all things I appreciated having a stable income and a reliable job. But in my last year working at the airport, I had an accident that left me very bitter at work. And the voices of people saying \"do you really wanna be throwing bags in your old age.\" really were getting to me. On top of the mental state of me not being in a relationship for a long time, struck me very hard that year.\n\nIn early 2017 I looked at my bank accounts and figured I had a decent amount of money saved. I applied to a local state college and was surprised to see I was accepted especially since I was a very poor student in high school and my ACTs were awful. In this bittered state I worked a lot of overtime to prepare to quit and go to school. (Sidenote my family had moved out west but my father lost his job for the 3rd time in 10 years, they all moved back to the midwest and I followed them. Because a family member of mine was diagnosed with cancer for the 3rd time and we all needed to stick together as a family to help each other out.) Thankfully during my time at school, I was able to stay with my family and rent a room while I went to classes.\n\nFirst-year of school I instantly felt something was wrong. I previously did research on schools and programs for animation. But unfortunately, I couldn't afford the move or the schooling. But I settled for my local college whom on all their billboards promote being a leading school on some chart for animation. Now I understand that a majority of classes, in the beginning, are Gen ED classes. So my freshman and sophomore years I was fine with them. But my major classes were a joke. A very large amount of students that I grew to know dropped the major after the first two years because we were required to take experimental film classes. They were a nightmare, you would think in film school you would watch great films by classic directors Spielberg, Hitchcock, Lean, etc. But we watched someone pouring water on a picnic table and were tested on whether it evoked any emotion or deeper meaning. By this time it was junior year, I was only required to take a single animation course which was an intro to animation. I was panicked looking at the downline of my classes. There were no drawing courses, just random electives about character design and such. I had to use my electives to take beginner art courses, but all the advanced courses were locked behind Art major advancement. I took an elective on the Animation industry, which I took the last semester of my junior year, it scared the hell out of me. We talked to graduate students from bigger animation schools and they all had portfolios and websites and internships. While we had animations with paper cut-outs and puppets. So far I had only finished one short, no established portfolio from classes built by schoolwork I had nothing. And most of my teachers never really taught, they just looked at your work and gave minimal feedback. But never really taught any theories ( color theory, the importance of shapes, timing, scriptwriting, so much stuff, I only know of their importance and existence because of popular artists and experts in the field posting youtube videos or Ted talks on the industry.) On top of it, Covid was a blessing and a curse, I continued to not get the feedback and learning I wanted. But staying at home allowed me to work on my thesis better.\n\nThis is where I started to break, when people say C's get degrees they mean it. Because I worked my ass off to get nothing. I got a 3.85 GPA and I spent most of my free time doing Gen Ed work rather than draw and build a portfolio. I wrote 12-page papers and math classes and language classes that did nothing but hinder my actual learning. In my senior year, I bite off a project I was determined to accomplish as my thesis. I made a short film that was a tribute to my favorite Saturday morning cartoons like DuckTales and so on. It was 3 mins long and a year's worth of work. Granted I never got to get it colored but I was able to hire voice actors and get very well done music for it. I'm very proud of it, but looking at it not as a perfectionist but as what I wish I could have accomplished I see the glaring flaws in my college education. I say this because I look at other graduates at the nicer schools and they made beautiful creations that I aspire to make as well.\n\n(Another sidenote my senior year I finally met someone and it has been the driving force I needed to finish school, we are engaged and can't wait to get married.)\n\nSo ultimately I graduated this spring, and immediately I can feel that school ruined me. Aside from the burnout of my last year. Every job I look at in my field looks for 3D animation or some form of 3D software knowledge, which we sadly were never taught. I've slowly tried to teach myself blender through youtube and online courses. But one of the beauties of college is that you have that time for being in school that you get to use to learn. But again I'm burnt out, my drive for art has been soured because of my inability to accomplish what I wish I would have learned in school. (Guys I mean basic stuff too, I just learned this last few months how to use multiply layers in Clip studio paint decently.) I feel bitter that I didn't learn what I wanted, that I'm in debt, not terribly but still it's looming like a shadow over me. Now my family is down my neck to find a job, it's been 4 months with no luck. I know nothing about graphic design which is the only artist-related thing near me. I never hear back from things in my field and rightfully so, I don't know Maya or 3DS Max, I have a shotty portfolio. And I'm starting to get very depressed and have thoughts I've very rarely given into. I have in-laws that are rightfully worried, parents and siblings, and family too. I fell for a job scam about a month ago and it severely messed me up. I look for work out of state and still nothing.\n\nI regret going to school, if I had just not been upset with my job I could have, had enough money for a house by now. I still would have met my fiance, I feel so lost and helpless. Applying for jobs is killing me it makes me depressed. Granted I know most people don't work in the field they went to school for. But I really went back to school because I truly wanted to learn and prove to myself, after all, this time I could do it. I never knew it would make me feel this terribly. And like how it started I have a million voices telling me to do one thing or another. Start a youtube channel start a business etc. Idk if I feel like listening anymore because I oddly blame it on just not sticking to what I was doing. Because all I want now is a stable job to set up this next step in my life. :(\n\nLike I said above there are good moments from this, my engagement, my family member has beaten cancer again. All in all, I just needed to get this off my chest and I don't expect anything special from the response to it, I just needed to clear my mind.
