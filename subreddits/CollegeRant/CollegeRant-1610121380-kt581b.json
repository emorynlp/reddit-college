No complaints and all. But I just realized the problem. The problem is me handling all things more than i think i could handle. I seek help during holiday and i was diagnosed with ADD (fml). I told my doctor my situation and he told me, its okay to have all of those but he thinks that I wasn\u2019t giving myself a time. Honestly, it\u2019s not bad but damn now i think about it. Must be nice to just focus on school and work only two days a week. I wish i paid more attention to myself. I also failed a lot of classes because of how focus i was in my job and not my school work.

It has to be one of the hardest things I've done in my life thus far. I have no social life and usually spend what little time I have outside of the two catching up on shows or cooking, just generally doing things that are relaxing and low maintenance for me. I don't have a lot of friends just because I feel like I cannot properly upkeep the relationship with everything I have going on. I know some people may think it is unhealthy to place such importance on school and work and none on my personal life outside of the two, but I'm almost 2 years deep with 1 year left till I gain my bachelor's and I just keep on repeating to myself that it will all be worth it once I get that degree and open up more doors. Just trying to drag myself out of poverty here haha. I don't have much advice other than to listen to your own needs and wants and do what is best for yourself always. I can relate and so can many others!

Last semester I worked a full time job while being a full time student. It was not feasible for me. My hours kept going up and my grades kept decreasing. I would be so exhausted from work I would go home and crash and feel like crap for missing assignments. I had to withdraw from a class so I wouldn't fail it. \n\nIf it is possible I would consider not working and focus 100% on schoolwork. I did this and while I am taking way harder courses this term, it has benefited me tremendously.

I work full time and can tell you first hand you NEED time to yourself or else you can\u2019t focus on anything. Last semester I missed some assignments because I just needed a break.
