Exclusively online learning does not work for me. I genuinely cannot process the information. I wound up withdrawing from most of my classes and I passed all the ones I did take, but my grades were poor enough to drop my GPA down to 3.2. Despite this still being a perfectly fine (if no longer honors) GPA and all of my classes having passing grades, my school put me on academic probation. \n\nThis involved going through an incredibly patronizing short online course that, among other things, suggested that I simply get off my computer and go outside more... things that couldn't possibly have been an issue for the past year due to circumstances outside of my control, right? It also suggested that perhaps what we call ADHD is just the result of kids not going outside enough, which I found horrifically uninformed and offensive as someone with ADHD who spent plenty of time outdoors as a kid. \n\nI had the option then of either joining another equally patronizing class on a topic like \"avoiding procrastination\" or \"getting motivated,\" or attending academic counseling. I decided to go with the latter, and even though it's not all bad, it's really insufferable being forced to attend what feels like the college equivalent of mandated defensive driving classes where I'm told that I need to spend practically 30 hours a week outside of class studying and if I think that's ineffective for me and the way I learn then I just need to learn better study techniques, and that I need to work harder because \"I'm an upperclassman now and my classes will want me to think critically\" or something like that. (Did I not think critically before now?? What kind of college, or hell, even high school classes don't require critical thought?)\n\nI genuinely do not give a fuck anymore about graduating with honors. I barely give a fuck about college at all anymore. I want to care as much as I used to, but the hard work I put in before the pandemic seems to be completely meaningless.", "author": "subversiveradiohost", "created": 1631802319, "retrieved": 1632948511, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hd9k8xp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppebnd/all_the_hard_work_i_did_before_the_pandemic_means/hd9k8xp/", "text": "As someone with ADHD, I feel your pain with those patronizing time-management classes. Most time-management and study advice is useless when you suffer from ADHD, but everyone thinks you can overcome it if you just \"work harder\" and \"stop getting distracted.\" As if it's as easy as that. It's no joke as a disorder!\n\nIt sucks, but keep your chin up. Just do the best you can to finish your degree, and don't let all the bureaucratic BS keep you down. Having a perfect GPA and Honors isn't the be-end be-all to getting a good job after graduation, so try not to stress about it too much.", "author": "anonymous_Maid", "created": 1631919136, "upvotes": 4}}}
