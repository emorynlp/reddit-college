I am a junior still taking 100 level classes.", "text": "I feel stupid. My freshman year was cut short, leading me to fail 3 classes. I have a learning disability, at home school was not my thing, i struggled to keep my head above water but somehow I did it. \n\nI look at my labeled notebooks for the upcoming semester and I feel defeated. \n\nMath 140: calculus for life scientists, a class I would have taken 2 semesters ago if it weren\u2019t for me failing not one, but 2 other math courses \n\nChemistry 106: again, a class I would\u2019ve already taken, but failed a prereq due to covid. \n\nI tried to get ahead during the summer, but my grandfather died in the middle of the session, I fell into a depression and pulled out with a C in one class and a D+ in another (yay, another retake)\n\nI feel like the worst student ever. I am so motivated to do well this year, but I feel like I\u2019m gonna end up as an embarrassed 6th year finally finishing up their degree.", "author": "Mentallyeightteeen", "created": 1629582681, "retrieved": 1632841589, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h9u54tm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p902hq/covid_stunted_me_i_am_a_junior_still_taking_100/h9u54tm/", "text": "Thank you u/Mentallyeightteeen for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
