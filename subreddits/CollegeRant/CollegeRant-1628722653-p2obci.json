However, this year, I\u2019m doing dual enrollment classes at my local community college in addition to my own classes at school. The classes are online and asynchronous (I have a chronic illness and generally like to limit my exposure to COVID, especially with my high school being in-person and cases on the rise where I live). The classes I chose are in subjects that I generally like (Writing Fiction and Archaeology), and the teachers are rated pretty good on Rate My Professor (English professor is 3/5 and Archaeology professor is 4.5/5). Despite this, though, I\u2019m still worried that I\u2019m biting off more than I can chew.. \n\nI\u2019ve taken 5 AP classes, 1 IB class, and honors classes all throughout high school, and gotten good scores on most of the exams I\u2019ve taken. I\u2019m taking AP Calculus BC this year in addition to my required courses for graduation. There are no more English classes for me to take at my school, so I have to do it here. I only know one other person doing dual enrollment (my friend), but he\u2019s taking way different classes than me, and all of his are in-person.  \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice for these college classes and coping with everything, or any sort of encouragement? If anyone else is or used to be a dual enrollment student, I\u2019d really like to hear what you think. \n\nThis is my first time taking real college classes and I\u2019m really intimidated, but I\u2019m also extremely excited.", "author": "Laffy-Taffee", "created": 1628722653, "retrieved": 1632841645, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "comments": {"h8ldvtp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p2obci/worried_about_dual_enrollment/h8ldvtp/", "text": "Thank you u/Laffy-Taffee for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In my experience, AP is pretty comparable to dual enrollment. If you have been successful in previous online classes, that will also help out.
