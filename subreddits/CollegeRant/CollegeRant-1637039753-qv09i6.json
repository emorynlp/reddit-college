  "text": "I'm sick of these snooroar making post about not making friends or being privileged that's all you see alot when coming on this page now. I just want to see post of ppl college experience or education not these snooroar. They need to do something with these folks.\n\nIn other news I passed my  Calculus 2 class with an 95 and I'm shocked cuz I'm not very good at math but I guess studying and pushing myself day and night on it was worth it.",

      "text": "Congrats on your test and the hard work!\n\nSadly, all those posts came from the same guy who just keeps making alts to evade bans despite what mods and people have been telling him. Guess maybe he loves the attention or just wasting people's time. Hopefully he won't comment on your post, but he had reach out to random people before; so some caution on that. \n\nGood luck on your other tests!",

Hopefully he gets the counseling and support he needs. \n\nRegarding the IP ban. Sadly, I think it's harder to do that as he's using a public network or his campus? Think that was the reason.",
