The top behavior I see in the students earning the lowest grades is ignoring the tools they're given. I'm talking about not using a calculator, ruler, equations sheet, or book. Or not talking to anyone where collaboration is encouraged or when you're allowed to use a program like excel or something to help. Coming to tutoring is a good step, at least. This type of student is usually surprised when I pull out my binder, laptop, whatever. I've been asked if I remember everything from my old class. No! But I know when and what to look up when I need it.\n\nI've heard too many people say \"but I don't want to use the equation/reference sheet\" or \"I want to do this (insanely long problem) by hand and no other way\" and proceed to do something that wasn't even taught in the class.\n\nI don't really think it's an ego thing, but a general misunderstanding of what makes the good students, good students. There seems to be this idea that good students have super-brain, photogenic memories, never need help, and do things in a special way. In reality, they're the people who know how to use their resources and work with others. \n\nIf you legitimately don't need the tools because you've done something so many times, that's cool, but in college, a proffesor will make an exam expecting students to use what was given.\n\n**TL:DR**  In the real world professionals double-check their stuff. There's no secret level you unlock by doing everything from memory.", "author": "odgoodli", "created": 1616852181, "retrieved": 1632951402, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 49, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gsh9g3c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/medxe9/use_your_equation_sheet_jeezus/gsh9g3c/", "text": "I\u2019m an accounting major and excel is my best friend for most classes.
