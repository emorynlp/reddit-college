Spending too much time studying?", "text": "I dont know if this is necessary a rant butt anyway I need to get it out of my system.\n\nI just finished my first year of college and it was really nice. However, I don't think I'm the most outgoing and friendly person, mostly because I'm just selective of my company and I'm soooooooooo horrible at small talk. I've spent a lot of time this year studying and not really going out ( def due to covid) but I also kind of love my system of studying, building small healthy routine like running etc . I really learnt how to spend time with myself and enjoying it. However, I'm also scared I'll withdraw just into myself so much and I'm missing out on all the fun partying youth stories on my early 20s. I feel like Ive got the drugs, drinking, partying etc all done in high school and frankly I'm just sick of it now. My GPA has also been steadily good but at  the same time again Im scared Ill grow older and regretted not going out more and having this college experience. I've also got a few close friends but they also arents so much the party drinking types. Im not really sure if I'm making the right decision to keeping to my routine or if I should actively try more to socialise and take parts in these things? I do enjoy company with people, just necessarily in a bar or pub setting while drunk so much (although i used to enjoy this in high school, idk what happened).

I don't go out much either, and if you feel comfortable having a digital party on animal crossing or whatever then literally make that your college experience! If you still feel like you should be going out,  then honestly go out to a gastropub or something on a Wednesday night,  so you have excuses to leave early but you still get that outing.

It wasn't even all partying, I had my weekends wide open to do stupid, impulsive shit, yeah I had a few parties but I had time to join a DnD campaign, I wrote music, did road trips. It was nice being able to go full Yes Man for a bit. I'll be going back to the team in the fall, but I'll be yelling my stories from this year for a long, long time. \n\nSo, yeah, focus on your studies, make sure your GPA stays up. But give yourself time to pull a Yes Man every so often and just do shit cause you can. \n\n(If you don't get the movie reference, WATCH IT.

So going and leaving early is my suggestion in that case. \n\nIf it\u2019s the same kind of thing every weekend, maybe devoting certain things to certain days of the week would help?", "author": "tfhaenodreirst", "created": 1625156518, "upvotes": 4}}}
