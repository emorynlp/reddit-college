Good, even. I\u2019m back at college, it\u2019s the first day and I can see all my friends again. We\u2019re chilling, vibing, and I get an email. Pfizer\u2019s been approved. And with it, my college is requiring the vaccine.\n\n\nThis is bad. I\u2019m not vaccinated, but not by choice. My parents threatened to cut me off, forcing me to drop out of school and get my own insurance and everything, if I went behind their backs. So I didn\u2019t. For months I made my disgust at them very clear, but it\u2019s so hard to argue when they genuinely believe taking the vaccine will harm me and are protecting me by not letting me. \n\nBut the requirement changed that. I had hope that with it required, they\u2019d relent. No. They wanted me to try for a religious exemption. I told them I would not lie. They got mad. We argued for hours. I eventually told them this was jeopardising their relationship with me, and that if needed I could get by without them\u2014 so their threats didn\u2019t have pull. \n\nMy dad eventually relented. He said not to rub it in and to please reconsider. I feel so guilty. I\u2019m getting Pfizer tomorrow, and I don\u2019t want to feel so guilty because I know I\u2019m doing the right thing but it\u2019s so fucking hard. \n\nAnd then my brother keeps trying to talk me out of it and eventually said it\u2019s my own fault when I die of complications of the vaccine\u2014 and he\u2019s saying this not just because he believes it but because my parents are bribing him with soda. And it hurts. \n\n\nMy relationship with my family is incredibly rocky now. And it\u2019s horrible. \n\n\nTo make matters worse, I got doctors results and based on an ultrasound, that can neither deny or confirm thyroid cancer. Apparently there are some suspicious nodules, but there doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s vasculature\u2014 small help.\n\nI want to die. I\u2019m not going to kill myself but I feel so shitty. I can\u2019t do right. Either I disappoint my family and get the overwhelming anxiety that they\u2019re right, or I let down my school and community and lie for them.
