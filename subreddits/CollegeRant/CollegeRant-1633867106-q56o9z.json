  "text": "Im not actually in college, I\u2019ll be applying to college in 1-2 years time and I pretty much have nothing for my portfolio. I just realised how competitive college is and I\u2019m trying to study hard for my A levels either next year or 2024 (long story), do you guys think it\u2019ll be possible for me to start now to participate in more EC\u2019s and try to bump my grade up? I\u2019ve seen other kids my age r/chanceme and their portfolios are pretty insane. Any tips to start working hard right now? Or any tips for EC\u2019s? thank you\n\nsorry if this is the wrong sub\n\ntl;dr Wanted to see if i can get my grades up",

      "text": "I graduated high school 10 years ago but every counselor I had then told me that a comeback story can be just as compelling as someone who got perfect grades all 4 years of HS. Showing a university that you realized what it was going to take to get the future you want and made the changes to get there is really amazing. \n\nSo the short answer to your question is no, it\u2019s not too late. \n\nAs for tips, you\u2019re going to want to show community involvement, school involvement, and improvement in your grades. This means sign up for community service in something that interests you, join a club or a sport, and (pretty self explanatory) study hard and raise your GPA. \n\nAlso, get ready to write a killer essay about this transition. Maybe write down little thoughts you have about this process as you go along so you can use those in your essay. It\u2019ll provide color and depth to your story that will get a recruiter to look twice. \n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "Hey, just wanted to put in my two cents and hopefully calm your nerves. It is NEVER too late to go back and anyone can salvage any hand they\u2019ve been dealt. No matter what you\u2019ll have an excellent story to talk about to prove your flexibility and persistence. \n\nWith that being said\u2026 please be careful with student loans and the types of institutions you\u2019re looking at. Be extra careful with for profits. I\u2019m actually anti American higher ed but at the same time I\u2019ve also invested in it as well. \n\nIf you\u2019re still stressing out about admissions please know that the majority of institutions are struggling with attendance so things are even easier to sneak in.",
