I\u2019ve been a very studious A student my whole life and this semester my mental health just dropped. No motivation to do anything, procrastinating every assignment and turning them in late. I had to drop calculus in the beginning of the semester because I was failing. I was failing Chem for the longest time and I just brought it up to a C. I have a D in my BioEthics. I stay up until 3 am, sleep in between classes, sometimes skip classes and just say I was sick so I don\u2019t get marked for it. I\u2019ve never blatantly lied that until now.
