My school released their course offerings today and I excitedly logged on to the scheduling platform to see which of my courses were being offered in-person. The school released their game plan for the coming fall semester a couple of months ago, saying that they were going to be offering some sections of courses online and some in-person. \n\nI can\u2019t take anything in-person. Nothing. My courses all have maximum 60 people that can be enrolled, but it\u2019s sort of unofficially capped at 55. Only classes that have 50 people or less have sections that run in-person. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t stop crying. This was just the last straw and it broke me. I can\u2019t do another semester of online school.

I also hate online schooling and after doing it for 2 semesters I'm completely done with it. It was so hard to complete this latest semester but I did it.

None of the in-person core classes fit in my schedule as well. What I ended up doing is contacting my academic advisor about my mental health issues in regards to online courses and she got me into an in-person core class that was previously blocked off. I also have an in-person yoga, so that's something.\n\nFor me, taking time off is not an option as it is impossible to get into nursing programs; there's no way I would be able to get back in. I tried to make the best out of the bad situation and I hope it's enough. As for you, maybe it's worth considering taking some time off if that's a feasible option for you. If your mental health is at a bottom right now, then its going to be so much harder to complete work and actually learn in the courses. If you cannot drop, then try to make the best out of it if you can. Contact your advisor with your concerns, try to find something to do on campus.
