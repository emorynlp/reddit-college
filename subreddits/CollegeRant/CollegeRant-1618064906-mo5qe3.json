Last semester, my school had this policy where you fail a class, you decide to put NC meaning No Credit and it won\u2019t affect your GPA.

Almost every college student has a goal but I feel like I\u2019m stuck in time and I have no passion for my major. No passion in life at all and it\u2019s killing me. I\u2019m fucking tired of it all man.

I went back to my home state and attended a smaller university and told my advisor what I experienced and how in the world is it possible for me to get accepted into graduate school with my GPA so low. She told me that I would have to improve my grades here and that\u2019s what I did. I\u2019m a senior now and for the past 3 semesters I\u2019ve made straight A\u2019s and about 2-3 B\u2019s. My advisor told me that even if I did make straight A\u2019s and B\u2019s, my overall GPA (factoring in my GPA with the first Uni I (attended) wouldn\u2019t be enough to give me a 3.0.

My advisor also told me she has previously worked with looking at applications and the students they accept are those who have interesting lives/those who have persevered through hardships. \n\nI hope this helps comforts you in some way.
