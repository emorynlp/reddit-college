The first assignment is due at 11:00PM. Ok, no problem. I\u2019ll just get that going-Then I noticed the very next assignment after, you know the one you should be doing, after you finish the first one. Is due at 10:22?! \n\nWTF!? Why is the one that is known that many people will do second pushed up more than the first fucking assignment!? \n\nThese are all due on the same day so keep that shit in mind.\n\nOh and before both of those things are due is a quiz at 10:00PM\n\nLike fucking excuse me!? \n\nBeen at this(college work) for about 3 years now, but never in my life have I seen a teacher assign material and have it due after a quiz on said material. Isn\u2019t it the point of the homework to be prepwork BEFORE you take a quiz!? \n\nOk. Whatever. 10:00PM - 11:00PM times I can work with? Just gotta get to work abit earlier right? \n\nBut here\u2019s the real ringer. New week the Proffesor set up an assignment due at 6:00PM\u2026\n\nOH WAIT THERES MORE! \n\nThe syllabus just does fuck all to help since the material that is assigned can\u2019t even be accessed before he puts in the inconsistent times and posts them for the week. \n\nWithout even the times it doesn\u2019t have a consistent date either. Just bracket week that even within the second week he hasn\u2019t seemed to be following. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve had times before where they don\u2019t specifically write down times. I would even go so far as saying a chunk haven\u2019t. But they have been consistent in just simply having it be a default time of 11:59PM. \n\nSo just goodbye to the nice fucking written schedule I use that has the dates and times. UNLESS I PUT IN A BIG ASS QUESTION MARK FOR THIS BULLSHIT\n\nI always do my work at night, sometimes before the day or day of. It is just how I\u2019ve been working it and it helps slot my days for specific subjects. Everyone mostly fucks off to bed and I get peace and quiet. Now gotta accommodate some asshole who appears to just write down times on a whim it seems. \n\nAll in all professor go respectfully suck a bag of dicks\n\nTLDR; Professor posts inconsistent times and dates on assignments. Doesn\u2019t follow their own written syllabus.", "author": "Kintaro402", "created": 1632324417, "retrieved": 1632950950, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdwck9i": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pt9wjy/fuck_these_inconsistent_deadlines/hdwck9i/", "text": "Bro I\u2019m about to change your life: make a spreadsheet.
