Thinking of a topic for the podcast?\n\nI definitely think that starting the project, even if it's in a smaller way initially, will help with those feelings.\n\nBest of luck",

      "text": "I felt intimidated when I did 50 pages for a 40% assignment in my undergrad.\n\nSo I approached it in sections. Then I joined it all together. Every section had unique references as it was like writing a series of individual papers. \n\nOnce I got all the individual pieces lined up I never looked at my 50 pages again. Except for minor editing.\n\nThere was some things I couldn't edit due to the assignment size, I tried making it as good as I could before murging it. I learned once you murge a large assignment together it's practically over.",
