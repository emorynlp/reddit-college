I barely graduated by going to an alternative school at the very last minute. and I had a terrible gpa. Because of this no one ever showed me how to apply for scholarships, or apply for school. I\u2019m completely lost and I just want to go to school. I want to tattoo and have an apprenticeship. I already went and got my hand, head and face tattooed so I don\u2019t even know if teaching is still an option for me. But I want to get a degree for teaching, as well as just some art classes to further my tattooing abilities. I know 2020 is a weird year for colleges in the us but Im determined to start soon. I\u2019m just looking for any advice on how to even get started on my college journey.
