Or just generally making this semester harder?\n\nI go to a decent university and never really had much of a problem until this semester. Maybe i just have really bad luck.\n\nSo far i have one professor who will talk well over the class time limit. Im talking 30 minutes past the end of class. Sometimes not even about class material. Will go on long rants and have an attitude if people leave the zoom call before they finished. Has also told us the class may start being held outdoors On campus instead of online because in person teaching is more comfortable for them.\n\nI have another who unfortunately had to be quarantined the second week of class. and just announced that we need to make arraignments with our schedule because we will be going over the class time once class is back in session. This professor is giving us the two tests we missed due to him canceling class plus a lab experiment.\n\nAnyone else got horror stories so far? Figured might be a nice place for other to vent their frustrations\n\nAlso to professors who might browse here. If your one of the ones that go above and beyond to make classes less stressful during covid. Thank you.You have no idea how much it means to us students.", "author": "fireflyfunny", "created": 1599495287, "retrieved": 1632843021, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 92, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g4evtlz": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ioadg4/anyone_else_having_a_bad_time_so_far/g4evtlz/", "text": "I can\u2019t imagine how international students are dealing with all of the online stuff...I\u2019m on week 2.

I can\u2019t be in person for any lab and I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything at all because of that, I\u2019m a very hands on person.\n\nWe had the option to do in person, but because of the pandemic I\u2019m doing all online for my own personal safety. But I can\u2019t learn anything if I\u2019m not in lab, it\u2019s unfortunately not just looking up a YouTube video on it and watch a demonstration of a chemical reaction. I have to document things in person in the environment. And that\u2019s just one class.\n\nI somehow manage to get double the homework in classes that are not major related compared to my own major and minor, and it\u2019s not just because my major and minor happens to come easily to me. I took 5 hours on one history assignment when I could catch up on a lecture I missed in history because something went wrong with the zoom software at the time of class (adding more homework because I had to show I watched the lecture by doing an assignment to get \u201ccredit for attending\u201d).\n\nI can\u2019t even focus on my actual major based classes, which are not as textbook based because they\u2019re more creative and demonstrative, making them absolutely doable for online courses.

I've also had this happen IRL where the professor seems to think their subject is the greatest and only thing to matter, (looking at you shitty, bitch of an Econ.
