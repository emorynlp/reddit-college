I originally had a plan and was excited to go through with it but lately I've had a change of heart for what I want to do and an extreme loss of motivation to do school after a tough year with Covid. Is anyone else just really unsure and unmotivated (due to mild anxiety) to look into what to do for their year after college? I feel behind, I don't know what I want to do with my life other than that I really like some things within my field. Just hate being so unsure especially when people are starting to ask what I'm gonna do afterward.\n\nTLDR: unsure about future and feel pressure from people to know what to do about grad school after college", "author": "lewan115", "created": 1624152685, "retrieved": 1632949670, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h2e64kc": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o3un12/anxious_to_graduate_from_undergrad/h2e64kc/", "text": "I have decided to take a gap year", "author": "Distinct-Hat77", "created": 1624160327, "upvotes": 3}, "h2e2d30": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o3un12/anxious_to_graduate_from_undergrad/h2e2d30/", "text": "I got into a funded phd program in chemistry having graduated this spring. I understand where you are coming from with the anxiety to graduate. I think a lot of my anxiety stemmed from not being sure how to pay for the titanic money sink that is undergrad. Right now I'm going to give grad school a shot. Worst case is that I don't  like it and drop out, at no real cost other than opportunity cost. My goal is to get a decent paying job in industry.", "author": "MolecularMalevolence", "created": 1624158149, "upvotes": 4}}}
