  "text": "What is better for you having online classes or in-person classes? \n\nWe have heard a lot of pros and cons regarding this topic. Students mostly say that online courses are better because they don't have to move from their bed, on the other hand there are students that think in-person classes are more productive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is your opinion?",
