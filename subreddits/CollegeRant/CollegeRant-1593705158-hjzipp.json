I had to use one of Cengage's programs for my college algebra homework (the name escapes me, I apologize) and it didn't even work half the time and it when you got a question wrong, it wouldn't bother to teach you why you got it wrong. You could get the answer right, but because the answer wasn't in the format the program recognized, that question was wrong.\n\nSome are alright, but have irritating downsides. Cengage's Mindtap simulations for some of my Microsoft Server classes have been an amazing help for learning, but holy shit is it slow. You're fucked if your internet goes out in the middle of it or if it's an issue on their end that disrupts your work because it makes you start over.\n\nWhat I'm not a fan of is now that tools for remote learning are getting more and more available and a lot of classes that could be taken in person are now only available as an online course (this was also the case before the pandemic). I love tech and even going for a major in the industry because I have a passion for it, but I'm not a fan of remote learning.

If the professor cares, it can be great. In one now that she made 4 to 12 videos per lecture that are 5 to 14 minutes each.

(It is very boring material, so can't focus long however well she teaches, which is pretty great)\n\nHowever, when you get told to buy a Pearson subscription and they upload a five minute video going over what to read and some links to resources, I want to scream. That is not worth the money. I could have done that and taken a test to place higher in math when entering the college. That is penalizing people for staying at the university to learn.
