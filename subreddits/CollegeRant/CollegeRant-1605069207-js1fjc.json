I just discovered this Subreddit and I came here to post a question. It seems that I am not the only one having trouble with courses. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I have not passed any of my three exams in a single course. It's a financial accounting course, and it's the most difficult course I've come across. If you're curious on my grades of these three exams...\n\nExam 1: 48%. Exam 2: 35%. Exam 3: 49%. Exam 3 just happened yesterday and I studied so damn hard on that one, just to have it flop like that.\n\nI won't lie, I kinda entered a depressed state upon receiving my grade. This may be the first time I may fail a course. And it hurts. A lot.
