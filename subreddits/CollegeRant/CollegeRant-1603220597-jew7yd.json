  "text": "I feel exhausted all the time. I feel like all I ever do is attend class and do homework. I feel so overwhelmed, I cry almost everyday, and I feel like I don\u2019t ever do anything except work. I\u2019m not happy at all.\n\nI hate this. I hate being a student. I\u2019m lucky enough that I get to live in an apartment with my friends instead of at home, but I have absolutely nothing to look forward to and I feel so hopeless. I don\u2019t have any motivation at all and the only thing that gets me to do my work is the intense anxiety I feel at the thought of failing. I don\u2019t know how to keep going.",

I\u2019ve learned only one thing from this semester so far. \n\nCollege isn\u2019t a place of learning, its simply a means to an end. Wasted time and a piece of paper to show your future boss some proof of commitment. That\u2019s all people these days want. A legal form showing that you can stick with something for a few years. \n\nCollege isn\u2019t important, and I hate that most people have been brainwashed into thinking it is. Only reason I\u2019m here is cause my parents left me no choice.",

      "text": "I don't know if this will help, but your profs likely feel the same way (I'm one, and I do). I've had to put together a schedule for myself that allots me time to play my video games, do some fun writing, run with my dog, and still get work done.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean I actually FOLLOW that schedule, unfortunately. I'm holding online office hours right now (one person has shown up for these one time this semester, so I wonder why I bother, sometimes) and the fact that I'm faffing about on reddit is just depressing. I should be grading. I'm not grading. But I'm also not doing something that recharges my batteries, either, so as to make it easier to do what I HAVE to do. That's where the problem lies - the time that you ARE able to take off and get away from the screen, you have to make count.\n\nSo I'm going to drink a cup of coffee, get the hell off reddit, and go grade some work. I hope things pick up for you, and you start to feel a little motivated. I try to keep in mind that my students are struggling as much or more than I am, and I adjust my approach to teaching with that in mind.\n\nI was told by a mentor while in grad school that there are semesters we do amazing work that moves us ahead and there are semesters we survive - both are acceptable because the semester is over and done and we got something out of it. Good luck, friend, and I hope things get better (also, I always remind my students that there's counseling available that you already pay for in your fees - make use of it! They can help).",

Although it is nerve-racking to be away from my work (especially with stacks of homework), I just tell myself that small healthy breaks are better for me.

I try not to think about this often, because, in the long run, (healthy amounts of) breaks are more beneficial because it allows one to recuperate and retain information more effectively. Maybe try setting a small amount of time per session (to stretch, go on a walk, self-care, etc.) so you feel less burn out and maybe finish the more challenging assignments early so you can relax and watch at night. Whatever works for you. We'll get through this together, OP.",

I want you to know that you are really not alone in this. This is my senior year and this will be my fourth year of feeling like this (haven't had the best college experience). I thought I could get through one more year of this, but with covid it's been even more of a struggle. I'm also living on campus but with everything else going on I don't see my roommates (who happen to be my only friends on campus) ever so I'm trapped in here 24/7 and feel so alone (and would rather be home to feel more comfortable but due to my student teaching year I really can't do that). \n\nI also do not feel motivated to do anything and have been experiencing anxiety for a lot of different reasons - all very new to me. The way you can try to feel a little less hopeless is that this is one step closer to your degree. By completing just one assignment, regardless of the effort you put into it, you're one step closer. Small as it may be, you're getting there. And, its almost Thanksgiving (if you celebrate it) and winter break. So there's that too. \n\nThis year is so damn hard for everyone. Its so hard to be a student right now. I wish you the best of luck.",
