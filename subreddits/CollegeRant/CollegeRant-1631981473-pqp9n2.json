He has recorded lectures online and just tells us to watch those, fill out study guides, watch lab videos/read procedures and take a quiz with ridiculously hard and specific questions... I\u2019m already doing so poorly. Lecture is just him talking at us for 2 hours\u2014 very little is ever put on the board for us to take notes on. If we have questions, all he says is just \u201cwatch the recorded lectures\u201d. I watch, and they\u2019re just as boring and hard to extract note material from.\n\nI have a 66% in the class. I\u2019m so fucking devastated with how things are going.\n\nI have to take a bunch of biology courses for the degree I want. I have always been terrible with science but was ready to go in stong, open-minded. But just as with every science class I\u2019ve ever had, I have another really shitty teacher. I don\u2019t know how this semester will go, but my originally bright spirits are already stamped out entirely.\n\nThe drop date has already passed, so if I want to withdraw from the course, I still have to pay for the class. \n\nI don\u2019t know. My mental health has been dropping sharply from its already-low place. I\u2019m really scared the stress is going to make me do something to myself that I\u2019ll regret.", "author": "concerninglydumb", "created": 1631981473, "retrieved": 1632948488, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"hde3s56": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqp9n2/i_hate_my_biology_class_with_a_passion/hde3s56/", "text": "Sounds like a flipped classroom method?", "author": "renebeca", "created": 1632005857, "upvotes": 1}}}
