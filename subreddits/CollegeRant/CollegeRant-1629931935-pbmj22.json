I'm sorry if this comes across as overdramatic/ whiny\n\nI went to a mostly commuter school while most of my friends went to far away colleges. I did well academically, minimized how many loans I had to take out, and graduated early, but looking back I had literally no fun. I failed to make many friendships and did not join any clubs. I take responsibility and it is my own fault that I did not do more, but I did not realize how much I would regret it. I realize college is only 1 part of people's lives, but I'm afraid I will regret this for a very long time and don't know how to move on. I also feel like I did not develop independence like many people I know who went elsewhere.\n\nThis has just been consuming me lately and I feel ridiculous for it! I know that even if I had gone to a different school, my experience might not have been better because I'm just not the type to get very involved but the what ifs consume me. Sometimes I wish I could have a redo, but that probably isn't smart. However, I also graduated before COVID and I know that being in school now with that would stress me tf out so props to everyone navigating that. Sorry if this is incoherent lol I just need to rant\n\nTldr: I had a lame college experience and regret not doing more now, even though I know I can't change the past", "author": "Hmmuknowit", "created": 1629931935, "retrieved": 1632841556, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"hacqor3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbmj22/regretting_college_experience/hacqor3/", "text": "Thank you u/Hmmuknowit for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Whether I want independence and activities in a far away college or get into a nearby college, which has no campus life and I wud be living with my parents. No clue what to do. Sometimes Im like I can chill at home, and everything is safe and comfortable with no changes, but sometimes I feel adventurous and want to go to the one that provides a better 'experience' and seek discomfort lol.", "author": "ActualStrawberry556", "created": 1629972529, "upvotes": 3}, "hae0sop": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbmj22/regretting_college_experience/hae0sop/", "text": "Girl\u2026I know exactly what you mean!! Been there. Was also a commuter, didn\u2019t join any clubs, nothing. Literally went to class and then went back home and because of this I didn\u2019t even make friends. Just had acquaintances. I did end up regretting it. Not just not being involved but my whole degree and all. \n\nSo 2 years later (after graduating) I went back to college ( a different one, this time in nyc) to pursue a new degree that I was passionate about. But Covid hit and my first 2 semesters were online.  By the start of the second semester I was like I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore. I am taking this semester off for two reason: 1) I dont even now If I even wanna finish this degree and 2) I don\u2019t wanna get vaccinated and my school requires it. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m doing research on how to start my own business. Just wanna do something that\u2019s my own and be creative.", "author": "maddymckay", "created": 1629954603, "upvotes": 6}, "hadf3zs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbmj22/regretting_college_experience/hadf3zs/", "text": "Something interesting i heard is that people love to fantasize what they never experienced. The idea of the experience is what you want, but the idea can be far from the reality. Scroll long enough on either r/college or r/collegerant and you'll hear about people regretting taking on debt for the \"experience.\" \n\nWhat you can do now is find ways to make your future enjoyable. You can make friends and join clubs outside the college circle, those things exist without university's help.\n\nBe proud of yourself with minimal debt, a degree, and your new found independence. (Its not a race so don't worry about being independent later in life)\n\nIf it makes you feel better, this random ass stranger on reddit thinks you made a smart choice thinking about finances at an early age. It takes maturity and intelligence. I wish you the best! Againyoumadetherightchoice!", "author": "Turtleisim", "created": 1629943012, "upvotes": 17}}}
