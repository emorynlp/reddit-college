It's especially disappointing because I had a few electives on feminism and gender studies (I'm a CompSci major, but I still find stuff like that really interesting to learn about) and it's definitely not going to be as cool doing them as home with my conservative Christian family.\n\nAnd I really feel like I'm missing out on all the cool parts of being in college (hanging out on-campus outside of classes, going to events and clubs, making friends, dating, etc.). Remote college is garbage, but at least it will probably be back to normal by the Fall when vaccines are released and more widely distributed \n\nI think it's all overwhelming right now because we're coming off of what is probably one of the worst college semester in the history of higher education, and now that we're being told that we'll have to do it all over again next semester we're freaking out about it. But we survived this remote semester, and I think we'll definitely survive this next (and hopefully last one) . Plus winter break is pretty long in college, use that time to just unwind and destress\n\nAs for that group project (I feel your pain) subtlety let them know that if they don't get their shit together you're going to tell the professor know because if they fail, they're sure not going to be taking them down with you (in a more professional style let them know that you're going to be updating the professor on the status of the project) \n\nIn the meantime, if they still don't respond, just continue working on your section of the project and let the professor know that your group is being uncooperative and not communicating. No reasonable professor is going to punish good students who get stuck with bad groups.", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1607011726, "upvotes": 5}}}
