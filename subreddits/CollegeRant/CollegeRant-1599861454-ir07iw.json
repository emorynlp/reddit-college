Big Brother is watching you type beat. i don't even use the echo dot i got for christmas bruh. if u think i'm going to let some random ai on a chrome extension watch me take a quiz every other week u are simply not correct.\n\ni just went to registration and dropped the course. i already didn't know what was going on in that class to begin with so like... i don't have any remorse. (sidenote: does ANYONE know what's actually going on in their classes or is that just me?) we're only three(?) weeks into the semester and i'm fresh out of fucks to give.\n\nshould i have looked more into Proctorio when my tuition could have been reimbursed to me during add/drop? yes. Proctorio caught ME slipping, okay. that is on ME.\n\nis it going to bite me in the ass later? absolutely. has the last 6 months of this year given me a completely nihilistic view on life from here on out? absolutely.\n\ntldr; proctorio is weird so i dropped my class", "author": "haribopeep", "created": 1599861454, "retrieved": 1632951429, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"g5fwcty": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ir07iw/i_withdrew_from_a_class_because_i_didnt_want_to/g5fwcty/", "text": "Yeah that\u2019s some bullshit.
