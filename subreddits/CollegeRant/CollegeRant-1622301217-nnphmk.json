In any given semester, at least a half dozen students whose grades are on the shady side of a border email with reasons why they should be bumped up. If I bumped up everyone on a border, then a whole new set of students would be on the border. And if I should bump students just below a border up, should I also bump as many students just above a border down?\n\nIt's also impossible for lil' ole me to sort out the real excuses from the made up excuses, and exhausting to try, so I allow students to drop the lowest exam grade and the lowest quiz grade. This policy, however, does not prevent the grade-bump requests.\n\nMost of us would be uncomfortable sending our loved ones to doctors who got where they are by cajoling profs into boosting their grades, so I continue to be firm about those borders!", "author": "eyeofmolecule", "created": 1624963518, "upvotes": 1}, "gzyaua2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nnphmk/how_often_do_profs_get_grade_grubbing_emails/gzyaua2/", "text": "I get 4-5 per day in the final weeks of the semester.", "author": "TheProfessorsCat", "created": 1622357690, "upvotes": 2}, "gzwa6ac": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nnphmk/how_often_do_profs_get_grade_grubbing_emails/gzwa6ac/", "text": "I get a few every semester.
