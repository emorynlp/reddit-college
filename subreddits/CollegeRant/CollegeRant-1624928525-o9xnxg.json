How can I be more positive", "text": "Nobody seems to feel this way. It's not like I'll be in debt. I'm trying to get a business degree but I get so pissed off having to sit on my ass behind a screen, doing things I won't even use or remember half of, watching everyone else kiss the professor's ass for an A. I go out of my way to learn plenty of things on my own time but when it comes to organized education I just have this strong aversion to it. The way I'd describe the feeling... it's like a possessed person in a church. It's like I don't care so much that I intentionally avoid it until it's too late, then when something is graded missing I'm like, whatever fuck this.", "author": "Mandona", "created": 1624928525, "retrieved": 1632949638, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"h46nkvu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o9xnxg/free_college_and_i_still_hate_it_how_can_i_be/h46nkvu/", "text": "Look at college as a job I guess?", "author": "WalmartDarthVader", "created": 1625531051, "upvotes": 1}, "h3ij1gb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o9xnxg/free_college_and_i_still_hate_it_how_can_i_be/h3ij1gb/", "text": "College is optional!
