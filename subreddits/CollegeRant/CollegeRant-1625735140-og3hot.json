It sounds like you may be a bit surprised by your performance, and thats okay. I have failed a ton of classes, but that is simply part of learning. The next step is to recognize why you shit the bed last semester and make sure you do not do that again, good luck!", "author": "Thewarrior556", "created": 1625778517, "upvotes": 3}}}
