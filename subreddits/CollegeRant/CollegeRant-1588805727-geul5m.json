College is a waste of time.\n\nIf I'm being unproductive, I of course feel like I'm wasting my time, but I feel paralyzed and unable to do anything. If I'm being productive towards hobbies, self care, personal projects, job hunting, etc. it feels like a waste of time because I *should* be doing schoolwork. If I do schoolwork, I still feel like I'm wasting my time because there's so much I want to do that would be productive and fulfilling if I didn't have academic responsibilities. I want to search for a job and take steps towards a career, I want to use my skills and abilities and develop them through field experience, I want to create content and get out into the world as a journalist or photographer or designer or artist. I just have to get a piece of paper first.\n\nI'm not allowed to choose what my priorities are. It's school. It's always school. Even though its so difficult for me to get things done with the systems that are currently in place, and I could be a much more fulfilled and productive individual if I were doing something else, I am to be a student.
