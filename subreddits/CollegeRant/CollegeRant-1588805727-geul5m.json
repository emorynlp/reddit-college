  "text": "Relaxing is a waste of time. Doing hobbies is a waste of time. Playing with my dog is a waste of time. Sleeping is a waste of time. Bathing is a waste of time. Homework is a waste of time. College is a waste of time.\n\nIf I'm being unproductive, I of course feel like I'm wasting my time, but I feel paralyzed and unable to do anything. If I'm being productive towards hobbies, self care, personal projects, job hunting, etc. it feels like a waste of time because I *should* be doing schoolwork. If I do schoolwork, I still feel like I'm wasting my time because there's so much I want to do that would be productive and fulfilling if I didn't have academic responsibilities. I want to search for a job and take steps towards a career, I want to use my skills and abilities and develop them through field experience, I want to create content and get out into the world as a journalist or photographer or designer or artist. I just have to get a piece of paper first.\n\nI'm not allowed to choose what my priorities are. It's school. It's always school. Even though its so difficult for me to get things done with the systems that are currently in place, and I could be a much more fulfilled and productive individual if I were doing something else, I am to be a student. Anything I do that isn't part of my career as a student is an objective waste of time.",

Relaxing is not a waste of time because it is essential for your mental health. Homework is not a waste of time because it is necessary to do well in a course. College is not a waste of time because it will enable you to get a job you love. Bathing is not a waste of time because self-care is important (and we want to smell good).",

Part of my study was focused on economics and I kind of became obsessed with efficiency and opportunity costs. But it\u2019s dumb. There are a lot of logical fallacies and psychologically, only following logic is a pretty solid way to fuck yourself. \n\nI\u2019m still trying to unfuck myself more now \u2014 some of the hobbies I\u2019ve created and thought processes are legitimately helpful, others cause this kind of Catch-22 everything is a waste of time kind of thinking that still really messes with me. \n\nCheck out this [video](https://youtu.be/JcDXJxpB8UQ) \u2014 it definitely kinda helped me but even though it changed my mindset a little, let\u2019s be real, one video by itself probably won\u2019t be enough. Start talking to your friends more about this stuff even though it can seem hard or like a waste of time \u2014 I honestly think talking and journaling are two of the best ways out of this",

I always knew I needed a break when I legit just couldn\u2019t focus on my work anymore and I needed a breather.\n\n5. if you need an entire day to yourself, take it. don\u2019t do it so often that you don\u2019t get anything done anymore, but if your head is not in the right space you\u2019re not going to want to do anything.\n\n6. if you want to get a job and gain field experience, GO FOR IT! you will want to gain that sooner rather than later because after you graduate employers will ask about your experience in your field",
