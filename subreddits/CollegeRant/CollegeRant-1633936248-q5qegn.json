  "text": "I really hate college this year and I'm really frustrated with it. While some of it might be because of things that's my own responsibility, like my overall life situation (loneliness and boredom), some because maybe this study isn't the best for me, some of it is absolutely is because of specifically this college's system. So here's some rant specifically towards something that I can't do anything against. I'll also compare it a lot to my high school's schedule to show that this schedule COULD'VE been good\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the WORST schedule imaginable! First of all, like last year, I do approximately have 35 hours per week, which translates to 8 hours each day minus half of a day which is free. It's from 8h30 to 18h00, excluding those free hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the same as high school. Except, for some reason,now the SCHEDULE CHANGES EVERY DAY! While in our high school, we the same schedule for each week, but now it ALWAYS CHANGES!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(If anyone wants to know, I'm in \"DUT\" in France, which apparently translates to \"community college\" in America. I'm not that sure tho)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd also, even the 5 hours of free time changes every time! I have to watch every week my schedule not only to view what classes I'll have but also when I won't have classes! Imagine if it would've been in a consistent time tho! I could've make plans for any activity I want! It was ALWAYS Wednesday afternoon for ALL my life! Why change it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd also the online classes... Online classes are already bad, but I mean it's not their fault, it's because of the pandemic. What IS their fault however, is having HALF A DAY ONLINE AND HALF A DAY NOT FOR 3 SEPARATE DAYS!!! So very often, I have to commute at lunch to go to school or to home! WHY do this HORRIBLE thing when other schools have just done a very easy thing of 2 days online and 3 days at school? WHY??? No wonder then that I often disregard the schedule completely and just come very late! With this horrible inconsistent schedule!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, even the small things became way worse. For example, the different classrooms. We kinda move back and forth between all the different classrooms. Why tho? They have enough classrooms for all the classes, or at least they could've that we go to one classroom at least most of the time! And it's not like there's anything different in different classrooms, we're in programming, it's all the same and we're mostly always on our PCs! In our high school, we were mainly in our class! And why is this a problem? Of course, for having a good routine (since the lessons AND the classrooms change, I have to check my phone every day since it's always different!). But also, more importantly, it would've mean that I wouldn't have to take my heavy backpack everywhere, including recess and lunch! This would've been SO much better!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - my schedule in college is very horrible and despite my classes being basically like in high school, the schedule is way worse. It constantly changes, including the free time, classrooms. Also, half of a day is online and I have to commute at lunch.",
