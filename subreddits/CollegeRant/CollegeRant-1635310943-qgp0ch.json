  "title:": "I honestly have no idea how to form friendships anymore",
  "text": "I feel like whenever I open my mouth something incredibly dumb comes out, or whenever I try to make friends I never really ever can make headway, it usually just stays surface level. Like I seriously can\u2019t blame anyone else for how fucking terrible of first and second impressions i give off, and how I can\u2019t seem to form any connections at all, but I have no idea how to at this point. I know it\u2019s silly, but at this point I just don\u2019t want to keep fucking up so badly on everything I do. The thing is, I usually try to talk about class or like, idk, whatever else we may have in common, but then I just blank and like nothing good comes out. I also am terrible with following up or reaching out, as typically whenever I tried that it never works out. I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point.\n\nLike I seriously just have been feeling like each attempt to make friends just fails miserably where I realize I\u2019m kind of just forcing it, and in not wanting to be a burden, I just don\u2019t reach out first or try and take initiative, which results in me being stuck like this. Idk what to do, but I\u2019m increasingly miserable and cynical about people and I just hate it at this point",

Sometimes you can find Facebook groups in your area interested in things you are. I\u2019ve found friends that way! I heard there are friend apps like dating apps which I\u2019ve never tried but would be interesting",
