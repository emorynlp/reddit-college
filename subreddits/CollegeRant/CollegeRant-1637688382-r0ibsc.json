  "text": "On the one hand, I look forward to finally having some sort of break from classes. On the other, my family will probably give me shit to do (which I understand since it\u2019s their house) and there would be little to no privacy. I\u2019m just hoping to get some peace, but I can already feel that it\u2019s not gonna be like that. I still wish I truly have someone to confide with, but oh well I suppose.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping for a great Thanksgiving! \ud83e\udd83",
