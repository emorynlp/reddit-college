I\u2019m an insane planner, if I can\u2019t time my day right I feel like a failure. Although this has helped me in college GPA wise, it drives me insane when I\u2019m not in school. I literally overthank about a stupid little interview with my advisor for a tutoring job a teacher recommended me for, butchered everything word due to the crippling social anxiety I have and looked red as fuck. I just hate having this mindset, and people say well your GPA is good! I\u2019d literally reread emails to professors I sent months ago, thinking wow I sound stupid asking that etc.", "author": "ttyltyler", "created": 1623827493, "retrieved": 1632950991, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 68, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h1yqfll": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o0z0yg/i_hate_overthinking/h1yqfll/", "text": "I feel this.

In college classes, I would re-read assignments over and over again and try to find ways to make them perfect. I would even rehearse what I was going to say to professors before going to office hours. Literally anything that I do I overthink about. What if it\u2019s not good enough?, what if I mess up?, etc. Even after I do things, I realize ways I could have done it better and then I beat myself up for not thinking of these ideas initially.
