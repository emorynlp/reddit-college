  "title:": "how to politely send an email saying \u201ci\u2019m not going back and forth through email, you\u2019re wasting my time, thank you\u201d",
  "text": "THIS IS A GENUINE QUESTION so a little backstory, a few weeks before my semester started i freaked out and thought i should get an internship and i emailed a woman on campus who was looking for interns. i asked her 2 questions which were basically \u201cwhat are my duties for the internship and what is the schedule like\u201d. she emailed me back saying she wanted to Zoom with me to explain more. i was a little annoyed because my school isn\u2019t doing Zoom anymore and also bc the questions were simple enough to be answered in an email. anyways, we\u2019ve now emailed back and forth a total of 20 times planning the Zoom and her canceling it a few hours before 3+ times. i originally told her i would be interested in interning next semester, but at this point i do not want to intern with her anymore. the going back and forth is not worth it to me. she just canceled for the 4th time earlier today, 30 minutes before we were supposed to Zoom. \n\nHOW DO I POLITELY SAY THIS IS NOT WORTH MY TIME, SORRY BYE? i really don\u2019t want to be rude or harsh but she hasn\u2019t given me the time of day so i don\u2019t feel like kissing her ass for wasting my time\n\nUPDATE: i emailed her saying something along the lines of \u201cwe seem to have conflicting schedules so i think it\u2019s best if we put off the meeting until next semester when i know my schedule. thank you for your time.\u201d i didn\u2019t want to burn any bridges in case i meet her later in the year. her reply was her excuse for canceling today and it sounded like she wanted to make me feel guilty, but i don\u2019t. thanks for everyone\u2019s suggestions!",

Getting internships, jobs, etc is all about relationships.
