Then he assigns about 20 problems on Wednesday to be due the following Monday. \n\nSo far, there has not been a single week where I am able to have the larger assignment turned in on time. \n\nI am taking 16 units and I literally spend HOURS trying to get his problems done, and then scramble to get by in my other classes. It\u2019s costing me in all areas ( I am aware that this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.)\n\nI sent him an email today \u201ctouching base\u201d generally about the Monday assignments and my inability to get them done on time, hoping that he can be reasonable. Otherwise I am going to have to drop with a W. \n\nWhat gave y\u2019all done in situations like this?", "author": "Stellablu12", "created": 1632339336, "retrieved": 1632840988, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hdvskuu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ptf6p4/what_do_you_do_when_you_have_a_professor_who/hdvskuu/", "text": "Thank you u/Stellablu12 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
