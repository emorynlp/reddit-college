I have so much work I\u2019m literally staring at my screen all day reading and writing and watching three hour lectures and taking quizzes my eyes literally ache and my head hurts. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I could always email my TAs and professors but what are they supposed to do? The work has to be online, and I highly doubt they\u2019re gonna suddenly stop assigning all the readings and check ins and summaries because I complained my eyes hurt. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re giving us advanced notice on work, it\u2019s like: assignment posted- due the next day, assignment posted- due the next day. I literally can\u2019t have even one day for my eyes to rest, even on weekends. I can\u2019t drop classes cause I need financial aid money to live, but my eyes keep unfocusing when I try to read. Also a TA informed me that if I have any late assignments or don\u2019t turn one in (even small ones like posting comments and questions on the forum 3 times a week) I will be dropped from the class. \n\nI\u2019m dying.
