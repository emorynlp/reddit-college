Especially when the point of asynchronous classes are for you do do the material on ur own time. People do a lot of things outside of academics on the weekends and have prior commitments. I shouldn\u2019t have to email my professor for a different test time, and my excuse has to be valid with the university\u2019s guidelines. Meanwhile I can\u2019t even find the university\u2019s guidelines.
