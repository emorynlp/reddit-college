  "text": "This seems to be a common theme amongst this thread. I am achy, tired, and consistently dread any work that needs to be done. This is my final year. I feel like I should have graduated a year ago. I've relapsed farther into a depression, and my anxiety is at an all-time high. I don't eat much; sometimes I eat *too* much. I can't convert my energy into a meaningful workout because working out at home sucks and costs money. I don't want to go to the gym (despite being fully vaxxed) because I've grown to hate germs more than anything. \n\nThe one awesome thing about this pandemic is that I have a girlfriend now. Even then, I can't offer her that much post-graduation. I can't even find a fucking internship. If we live together, I'm just going to be a useless homebody. Each day I just feel like an utterly different person--way too happy, way too sad, way too bored, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: This sucks. I've grown to hate school. I want to go home and rest.",

Reflect on what you want to do, etc. I know college feels boring the longer you stay but you need to figure out how to not make it boring. Remember that you entered college to make yourself a better person; if not, then at least to become knowledgeable enough within an area of interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Don't give up.

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry what you\u2019re going through. It sounds like you\u2019re in a rut. You need a break, a reset. I think this actually isn\u2019t that uncommon for college seniors - there are a lot of decisions to be made as you get closer to graduation and that alone can be exhausting to think about. I\u2019m curious who you have to pay money to to work out at home? Also regarding your girlfriend - as a woman who has supported herself since graduating undergrad and continues to support myself in grad school thankyouverymuch, if my boyfriend were graduating college and having trouble finding a job, I would be wondering how I could support him emotionally, how I could lift his spirits and keep up his confidence during the job search, I would continue to enjoy his company and sharing important parts of my life with him... I wouldn\u2019t care at all about what financial things he can \u201coffer\u201d me. When I entered the job market after undergrad, I could barely support myself. I had to budget and save every penny to get financially secure. I would never expect a bf to do any different. Actually, I think if he tried to spend a bunch of money on himself or anyone else at that point, I\u2019d think he was bad with money.\n\nAnyway, I think your depression and  anxiety are making you catastrophize a bit - as in seriously consider every worst case scenario as a likely probability and every barrier as insurmountable, and it\u2019s making you put thoughts in other people\u2019s heads. If you got this far in college, you can absolutely get through the last bit of it. And if you did that, I believe you can absolutely be successful at finding a job in your field (even if it\u2019s not your dream job at first!) Getting rid of those negative voices in your head might be the hardest part. \n\nI hope things look up for you. Good luck!",
