I know my family is going to take the same precautions as me. I get along with my family well enough. I have friends in my hometown so I won't be lonely. It makes more sense logically to stay home.\n\nBut damn this hurts. My freshman group chat has been overtaken by pictures of people's dorms being set up and people inviting others up to their dorm. All of my social medias are full of move in pictures. A few of my other friends are still moving out. But here I am, stuck in my house for at least another four months.\n\nI don't want to be the guinea pig this semester and move in only to have to move out again in a month when there's inevitably an outbreak. I don't want to catch this virus because even though I'm low risk it sounds miserable.\n\nBut at the same time I only have two semesters before nursing school and I wanted to enjoy them. \n\nThis post is probably a mess but I guess it's kind of a reminder for others in a similar situation that you aren't alone, and it's a way for me to get everything out of my system.\n\nUgh I'm really banking on a vaccine being ready by next semester.", "author": "yeeeeeete", "created": 1597197738, "retrieved": 1632843448, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"g1hd86o": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i8547f/my_housing_contract_finally_got_cancelled_and_im/g1hd86o/", "text": "This year isn't the move for many colleges.
