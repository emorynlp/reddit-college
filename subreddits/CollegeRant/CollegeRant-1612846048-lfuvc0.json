  "text": "Yeah. My prof justifies this \u201cbut you have no homework\u201d (readings tho same thing to me)\n\nDude wants 4 1,000 word essays produced in 75 minutes with coherent arguements about various topics on Latin American sociopolitics. This is an undergrad course. \n\nIf he\u2019s not the nicest grader we\u2019re all gonna fail. Honestly if you want quality work from us have 1 1,000 word essay. \n\nAm I trippin? Am I being a child about this? Or is this just a sky high expectation of undergrads",
