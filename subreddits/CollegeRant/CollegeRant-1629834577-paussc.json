  "text": "I had to laugh to keep from crying\u2026the instructor was trying to yell over the landscapers, when he asked who heard him nobody raised their hands and he continued on anyway. \n\nThe instructor seems nice, but I think he\u2019s stuck on outdoors because of Covid. For the cost of a private school this is at least ridiculous, at most fu#%ed. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to complain, but asking for a quiet space for lectures is reasonable right? I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be doing landscaping every week, but the lack of a desk and humidity make it hard to focus on cell biology\u2026.and these classes are wildly expensive",
