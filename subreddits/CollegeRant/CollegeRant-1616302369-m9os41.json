Come to find out he took off points because we didn\u2019t name the word doc with our names, everyone was a bit aggravated and was still trying to understand. We spent an hour on that whole conversation.\n\nThe guy isn\u2019t good at teaching or explaining, and always try to make a joke that ends up dying immediately. He got so frustrated he ended up banging on his desk saying *this is what happens when I get angry*\n\nHe has us working on 2 projects thats due next week...and one doesn\u2019t work correctly and the other one he wants us to set up a Virtual Machine and write a paper but never told us how to write it.", "author": "Hello-Im-Trash", "created": 1616302369, "retrieved": 1632842887, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gro604c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m9os41/on_friday_my_class_actually_pissed_off_our/gro604c/", "text": "Thank you u/Hello-Im-Trash for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
