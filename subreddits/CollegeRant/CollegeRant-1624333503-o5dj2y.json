It turns out it's an absolute nightmare.\n\nWe have 3 assignments per week. That's not bad at all. One is a discussion board worth 8 points, one is a McGraw-Hill assignment where you answer like 50 questions (you get a 100 if you turn it in by the due date) worth 10 points, the last is a test worth over 100 points. \n\nI just finished the 2nd test and got a 79, on the first test I got an 80. On the test, 90% of the material have no connection with the McGraw-Hill content, and the lectures the teacher provides are generalized, so they're quick with not a lot of information. I literally studied more for this last test than the first one, I even re-read the two chapters covered multiple times AND did an outline, all of which I did not do the first test, and performed *worse*.\n\nRate my professor has students complaining about this exact same issue, even going years back. \n\nAnybody else relate to this?", "author": "Livelordx_lol", "created": 1624333503, "retrieved": 1632949659, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 20, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h2p350b": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o5dj2y/anybody_else_have_a_class_where_the_tests_dont/h2p350b/", "text": "Yes, my biology professor last semester had some random tidbits thrown in on his tests.

The rest are either dead, dying or dropped. Those who made it past a D are welcomed into the halls of Valhalla. The rest are sent to the deepest pits of hell wagering their grade appeal and pleading for a chance to be heard by the people who spend college tuitions on private islands and expensive cruises while you go broke. \n\nThis shit is like do or die. I hate it. Subscription services have saved me. **Collegeboard is a fucking scam. They owe me my AP credits that my college doesn\u2019t fucking accept. Fucking hell. Passing an AP class isn\u2019t enough. Gotta pass a dumb test. Even if you pass that, you still don\u2019t get credit and if you do, it\u2019s under electives?? WTF.** I\u2019d elect myself to ass whoop whoever thought that was a good idea. You owe me money damn it.\n\nI relate.", "author": "majoroofboys", "created": 1624344148, "upvotes": 11}}}
