When I was picking out my colleges, I only looked into the engineering programs. If the college didn't have it, I won't even consider it was an option.\n\nNow that I've started it, I realized how much I don't want to be an engineer. Sure, I think it's fun to build things but I can't see it being a career for me and I don't want a math based career. I can do math but I hate doing it.\n\nIt took me a really long time to be okay with not wanting this career option because everyone always took me \"oh well it's just because the being classes are always boring and hard, you'll get to the fun stuff later\" but even those classes didn't look interesting. \n\nI still want an environmental based career so I'm going into environmental science next semester because I think I'll enjoy it more. Fingers crossed",
