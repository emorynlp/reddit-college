Don\u2019t be to hard on yourself, and focus on doing better or seeking help for next semester. You\u2019ve got this!!\n\nP.S. If it helps, I\u2019m a CS major in my last year. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me for help if you\u2019re a fellow CS major!! Or if you just want to vent.",

Idk if I\u2019m even in the mood to attend school next semester and classes start on the 27th. Might just take off and go in the summer and fall",
