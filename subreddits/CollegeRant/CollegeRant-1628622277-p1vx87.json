I understand that college has a lot to offer and it\u2019s annoying that covid is making it hard to do all the fun things, but holy shit don\u2019t make me sacrifice higher quality education so you can go party. People on my college subreddit are constantly complaining about having to mask and that they\u2019ve already sacrificed enough of their \u201ccollege experience\u201d that they\u2019re just going to go do whatever they want and be unsafe. I have one year until I\u2019m going to be training for my actual job in the lab, and I really need to be in class so I can actually retain basics I might need. Online class (labs especially) sucks, and while I\u2019ve kept my grades up for the past year, I haven\u2019t retained as much as I feel I usually do. I\u2019m just frustrated that we have so many selfish people turning down the vaccine, being stupid, and ruining this for everyone. I\u2019m so close to in person classes and I worry that it\u2019s going to fall out of my grasp right after we start. \n\n\nTl:dr get vaccinated, don\u2019t force me and the rest of the students interested in actually learning to go back to online school cause you didn\u2019t get to party last year.
