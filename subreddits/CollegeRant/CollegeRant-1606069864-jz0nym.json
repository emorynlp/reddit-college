Currently on 3rd Year college and our Tech Research instructor gave us a 200-page baby thesis project during our midterm and is due for Semi-finals. Midterm was on October 20 and our semis will be at the end of the month. Said he wanted everything compiled (all four chapters) for submission on that date, and they barely even discussed anything they just went and handed us pdfs straight out of Google docs without going in-depth of teaching them and on what we should do. Though I've completed the 1st chapter, I haven't touched it for a while now . But this time maybe after posting this comment I would start working on the remaining chapters. I hope you could start on yours, too. Plus, no you aren't a failure. Maybe all you need is time to de-stress your mind a bit. Take that time. Just not all of it though coz you might miss out on the deadline \ud83d\ude05. You can do this.",

I know the project is easy, and I\u2019ve done much more difficult things in less time in the past but I just can\u2019t convince myself as well to do it like I usually can. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re struggling. But I think it is more due to the online learning then you being suited to college. Don\u2019t let this crap semester convince you college is not for you, this semester is not a true example of what college is usually like I promise. I was fine, even great in college until COVID happened.",
