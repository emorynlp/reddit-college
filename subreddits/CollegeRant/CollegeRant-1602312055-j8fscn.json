  "title:": "I hate it when profs don't provide enough information and then say we didn't do it \"like that\"",
  "text": "Forgive me for coming here and ranting. Engineering undergrad here.\n\nMy major is Computer Science and this is my junior year. We have a class on \"Management and Enterprenaurship for Industry\" which is exactly what it sounds like. A lot of rote learning is involved. And while I don't have anything against this subject, it's the prof that angers me.\n\nWe had a question in one of our internal exams where we had to basically describe how we would go about doing the recruitment process of our hypothetical company. And that's it. No other information was given in the question and similarly, nothing was told by the prof about the answers beforehand.\n\nSo, I wrote the answer as good as I could and submitted. I was well versed with the material and I knew what I was writing so no worries there, I thought.\n\nBut FF to today, when he declared that we had to include case studies of existing companies and how THEY did the same stuff, some specific formatting of the answer, giving extra details about our own (hypothetic) company.\n\nI know this might sound trivial to some of you and I'm sorry if I'm dense here but I simply had no idea that we were to write our answers like that. CS has majorly technical subjects and even if they are not, I was never aware of stuff like this.\n\nThat's it. Rant over. Bye.",

      "text": "Sometimes we make our instructions intentionally vague because part of the collegiate level assessment is seeing if students can aggregate their information and produce a product on their own/solve a problem on their own, as they would likely have to do in the workforce. We know you can follow directions, you did this all throughout high school, and we know that if we put a general format/structure/etc in front of you, you understand how to copy it and reword stuff/fill in the blanks. However, what we want to see is your ability to approach a hypothetical real world problem/example/whatever and apply your knowledge and solve it. One thing that needs to be noted is that if you\u2019re being vague with instructions you need to make yourself available as a resource for students. You don\u2019t necessarily need to advertise that you\u2019re a resource (since college students should know how to seek out resources on their own and this was probably done on syllabus day), but you should make it a point to be available if any student asks for help. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s a line between being intentionally vague and being unclear on standards. If you\u2019re expecting students to produce something specific, even if you\u2019re vague with how they accomplish that you should entail those expectations within your instructions. You can\u2019t just have a prompt and expect certain elements to be included/a certain format to be used if you\u2019re not going to communicate those standards. It also opens the door to grade appeals. \n\nJust my opinion on things. Feel free to disagree.\n\nEdited some typos/autocorrect changes.",
