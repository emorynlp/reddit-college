So I go to a cafe about 15 mins from my house. Does anyone have problems with their parents and studying ? I let my parents know where I am at all times and they have my location and they make me take pictures of myself when I get to my destinations(I\u2019m 22yrs old lol ) but despite all of this, they will make me come home and study because they want me home all the time \u2026because they think I\u2019m sneaking or meeting up with guys \u2026.but the study environment at my home isn\u2019t beneficial for me. 7 people and they always want me to do something and it always gets in the way of my studying.I\u2019ve already failed out of classes once and I don\u2019t want to do it again. What\u2019s a way I can tell my parents that I\u2019m not sneaking around and I\u2019m actually studying and getting my work done.
