So I\u2019m a freshman who stayed at home for the fall semester due to Covid, but since I have a chemistry lab that\u2019s partially in person I had to move to an apartment right next to campus for the spring. I chose not to stay in the dorms because I wasn\u2019t sure how safe that would be due to the high density of people that would be moving in and out, so I took over someone\u2019s lease at an apartment place that\u2019s right next to campus, and it\u2019s really REALLY nice and I got a discount on it so I was excited! \n\nSo I\u2019m all packed up and ready to go because I\u2019m supposed to move in today but last night one of the roommates who already lives there texted to let us know that she and her boyfriend decided to come to the apartment, for what reason who knows? Anyways they were with her boyfriend\u2018s mom, who now has Covid, on Monday and now they both tested positive for Covid while at the apartment\u2026 I was supposed to move in today and start work on Tuesday but because of the setback I\u2019m probably gonna have to wait two more weeks to move in. The girl can\u2019t go back home because it\u2019s not safe to travel and possibly spread it, and also because she has high-risk family members so I am going to have to call my job and try and figure stuff out, and luckily classes we\u2019re just moved completely online until the end of January giving me more flexibility, but I\u2019m very annoyed that I\u2019m gonna be paying a ridiculous amount of money for the month of January only to live there for one week. \n\nI\u2019m not really asking for advice or anything, just here to rant because it\u2019s super frustrating and everything that could\u2019ve gone wrong with this moving process for the spring has gone wrong. I\u2019ve had to get my lease fixed three times, go through a bunch of negotiations, and pay a random fee required by the apartment place so I\u2019m just super frustrated that I\u2019ve done all this and right when I\u2019m about to finally be in Austin, everything doesn\u2019t work out. Well now I have to go call both the apartment place and my job to see what I can do since they will be opening soon. If you read all of this thank you for listening to my rant :) y\u2019all stay safe out there!", "author": "kkomolafe", "created": 1610211646, "retrieved": 1632842896, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"giqs8rj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ktukbq/roommate_got_covid_the_day_before_i_move_in/giqs8rj/", "text": "The exact same thing happened to me this fall semester. I know the incredible frustration to be paying so much money to not be able to get into your apartment. Much worse- I had already moved in so all my stuff was there. I had to leave for the weekend for my job, and when I came back that Tuesday, my roommate told me she and her boyfriend who wasn\u2019t supposed to be there came in contact with someone and they needed to isolate. We even emailed before we moved in and she decided to tell me while I was trying to open the door.\n\nIt was infuriating at the time, so I completely understand. Hope that those feelings don\u2019t get in the way of doing your best this semester though! Stay safe, and Lysol everything when you get back! Don\u2019t trust anyone else to do it but yourself.\n\nEdit: fixed autocorrected word (on mobile)", "author": "FearlessTanuki", "created": 1610263538, "upvotes": 3}, "gipocg4": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ktukbq/roommate_got_covid_the_day_before_i_move_in/gipocg4/", "text": "Ask the person who you subleased from for a prorated rent of January.", "author": "mjsong", "created": 1610239331, "upvotes": 3}, "gipbfoh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ktukbq/roommate_got_covid_the_day_before_i_move_in/gipbfoh/", "text": "I'm a sophomore and moved into a suite dorm since I had a chemistry lab for fall quarter.
