Last semester I was grinding like crazy, but this, whew, this semester, I've been so lazy with just simple tasks. And I'm talking lousy procrastination. I hate myself.\n\nI have to get my shit together if I want to get through this semester.\n\nUPDATE: I just withdrew from the course as I had to.

My brain goes \"I should have more free time than this\" and \"you weren't working at this time yesterday\" in a little squirrel voice, but I haven't failed any assignments yet.\n\nIf you're getting bad scores, you might want to check what you've been doing lately.
