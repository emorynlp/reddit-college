I've gotten horrible scores on both my tests the past two weeks. The thing is, it's all on me, I've been procrastinating so hard this semester, and I don't know what it is. Last semester I was grinding like crazy, but this, whew, this semester, I've been so lazy with just simple tasks. And I'm talking lousy procrastination. I hate myself.\n\nI have to get my shit together if I want to get through this semester.\n\nUPDATE: I just withdrew from the course as I had to. There was no way I could get a high enough score to pass.

I don't know what it is, either. I've had to force myself to do some assignments, and I've been feeling more mentally drained. \n\nIt might just be a higher workload. My brain goes \"I should have more free time than this\" and \"you weren't working at this time yesterday\" in a little squirrel voice, but I haven't failed any assignments yet.\n\nIf you're getting bad scores, you might want to check what you've been doing lately. Like, if you've gotten really into a new game, or a friend, or a TV show or something that might be distracting you too easily.
