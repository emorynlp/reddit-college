That said, if you have some flexibility in your degree plan, talk with your advisor about taking some classes outside of your major, or comfort zone,  some of my favorite and most challenging classes during undergrad were ones that had nothing to do with my major.  For example, I took 3 semesters of Latin, and thoroughly enjoyed them, despite them being pretty difficult for me. \n\nAs an aside, it sounds like you might be suffering from a slight case of depression.  Especially these days, there is no shame in asking for help.  Your school likely has facilities on campus that provide students with someone to talk to, if you haven't already, you might want to consider taking advantage of them.  \n\nHope that helps!", "author": "Tiny_Giant_Robot", "created": 1603467338, "upvotes": 5}, "g9r6pii": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jgk4a7/im_doing_better_academically_but_at_what_cost/g9r6pii/", "text": "Cs get degrees friend.
