  "text": "The people here are so standoffish and rude and never do their work, the professors procrastinate with their grading and rarely ever teach their subject in an interesting way, there\u2019s zero accommodations for people who don\u2019t fit in the college life and it\u2019s so cliquey and boring\n\nI wish more than anything in my life that I never went here and spent years of my life and hundreds of thousands of dollars for the worst experience in my life",
