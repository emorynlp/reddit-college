I've only had two (maybe three) classes that have used Cengage and they were all **so** much more expensive than my other classes, so there must be a way around it.", "author": "starmanismyviolin", "created": 1620934127, "upvotes": 2}, "gr5iul3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m5xik9/cengage_sucks/gr5iul3/", "text": "Facts, got a textbook from them and after searching around found cheaper previous edition books for about 1/3 the price.
