They force you to purchase products that you don't need and try to trick you into buying more products that you don't need. We shouldn't be forced to pay $100 for homework for a single class for a single semester (looking at WebAssign). Does anybody know why professors use Cengage products? Are there not other options? I've only had two (maybe three) classes that have used Cengage and they were all **so** much more expensive than my other classes, so there must be a way around it.",

Asked them to cancel the rental, but these dumbasses can't even do that on the same day I bought the rental and sent that thing here deliberately even when I told them to cancel. Applied for a refund but never got my money back and after many angry emails from me they kept saying they sent me the refund but I did not get anything back. \n\nAlso had to pay my own personal shipping back to their warehouses because their website is absolute garbage. Absolute dogshit company.",
