I talk about the mistakes that got me forward, but made me more miserable. \n\nI talk about the balance of study and relaxing, let me repeat the balance of studying AND relaxing. Everyone knows about it, YET a very low number of students achieved this level of their perfect balance. \n\nI was the type of student, who thought that everything should be achieved through, hard work, grind, stress. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel exhausted after you finished studying it means you\u2019re doing it wrong\u201d that was my mindset. I sacrificed almost ALL of my time to relax, hang out, go to events and purely focused on 3 main things, sleep well, study and train. \n\nYes I got good grades and was ahead of my colleagues, but I couldn\u2019t be chill and have a normal conversation. \n\nI managed to balance it out, and started to enjoy the studying process once I made my life direction clear for me and drop the mindset of constantly living up to people's expectations.\n\nDo you still think that studying more is always better?", "author": "NikitaRetro80", "created": 1602850878, "retrieved": 1632843443, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g9nea5m": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jc8stm/please_dont_repeat_my_mistake/g9nea5m/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1603376557, "upvotes": 1}, "g91hsfp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jc8stm/please_dont_repeat_my_mistake/g91hsfp/", "text": "As a full time student and full time lab tech this is my problem I am so tired of work and it is hard to focus.

So if I really don't feel like doing work, I'll do a small amount or a small Assignment. That way I'm still doing SOMETHING. Then when I feel motivated I can fly through a week's worth of work in a day if I wanted to. It's probably pretty bad that it's so inconsistent, but I always try to finish all my work by Friday 5pm. I try to take a day off during the week so that I don't feel too burnt out. I haven't assigned a specific day because like I said, I work in bursts, so if I just REALLY feel like I can't do work or that I'm not actually gonna process/ achieve anything, I dedicate the day to getting sleep, eating well, doing something relaxing like binge watching TV, then go to bed early. That way I can kinda recover from whatever mental struggle was stopping me. It seems to work. I think when your body is in need of things like food, water, and rest, it makes it harder for you to work because it's telling you to stop and fulfill these needs yet people continue to deprive their body of it. Not saying no one can do it, I personally just don't function well living that way.", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1602880240, "upvotes": 5}, "g90xoc6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jc8stm/please_dont_repeat_my_mistake/g90xoc6/", "text": "I agree with your point that it should be balanced.
