Don\u2019t even know why I chose a school in the middle of nowhere, I passed through My school during the summer and explored and honestly it was kind of depressing, a little different from my expectations. I can see the niche of the college town but I can easily see after a while there really isn\u2019t much to be excited about. I know there\u2019s a lot of students excited for \u201cthe college experience\u201d etc but from my perspective especially reaching 20\u2019s, my perspective has drastically changed from when I was 17-18. I just want to make money, be surrounded my family and friends, travel, and avoid school lol. Just being invested in and doing things I\u2019m truly passionate about. Business marketing and school work and test are the opposite of what I\u2019m passionate about. I\u2019m also financially ok from working and saving for two years and I see much more avenues I can take that doesn\u2019t involve school. Being a junior definetly won\u2019t make things easier, and it being a quarter system. This is just more of a rant, Anybody else having second doubts or are already homesick?", "author": "Joeguyden", "created": 1631479709, "retrieved": 1632951376, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hcmwc8h": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pn0tf8/anyone_else_depressed_thought_of_going_back_to/hcmwc8h/", "text": "Yup, I was and currently am now that I am in school. Only have 7 credits left (three classes) and it's kinda hell. I go to work full-time which is an hour and a half away, so the commute to work/school is utter hell. I already had a rough time these past school year and I thought life would get better after I start working but I found out I would have to stay an additional semester and that changed everything. I also have to pay for this semester tuition out of pocket and it's just a mess. I cannot wait till I'm finally done with this hell. I love my major but my god, I am SO done with school. Just like you, I want to enjoy life while making a decent income. That lasted for about a few weeks before I started class and now I hate my life lol. But there's light at the end of the tunnel and we'll both make it in the end.
