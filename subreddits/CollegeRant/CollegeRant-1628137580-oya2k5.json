I am an incoming freshman moving to Washington D.C for school. While I am excited to be in a new spot and have some sort of independence I feel really scared and worried. I am worried that I am not ready to be by myself yet, I live with my parents for 17 years straight and I was only completely by myself for only two nights ever. Besides that I am afraid that I am way in over my head, I got accepted into a great school (to give you a hint about what school I am talking about it\u2019s currently one of the top 80 colleges in the nation and it\u2019s a HBCU) and I am afraid I am not prepared for college classes and that they would be too hard for me to keep up in. In my academic background I have only taken on level classes through high school and my senior was my only year were I have made all A\u2019s ( I still don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or not considering I was taking easy on level classes) and my soft more and junior year I had most As and Bs. The whole point is I was not the sharpest tool in class and there were way more people smarter than me. I also fear that I will be alone and that o will have an hard time making friends and have a hard time connecting with my roommates. I really don\u2019t want this loneliness and the rigorous work load to trigger symptoms depression or major anxiety disorder. In the end I really want to graduate school so I can feel like I can accomplish anything in this world and nothing is impossible and that I am not stupid and a waste. ( I got this idea of being dumb and stupid from primary school where I was put on IEP for low performances in class luckily I was removed from the program by high school) I want to validate myself to at the end of the day to think that I am smart and have worth. I also want to know how do you do selft care at college because it seems you\u2019ll be so busy you won\u2019t even have the time to sleep and get some rest. I know I might be worrying a little to much but I just can\u2019t help to stop and think to myself \u201cI\u2019d this the right decision \u201c \u201cwill this option cause me pain and suffering or will it payoff in the future?\u201d So I would really like to hear some of yours ideas to make college as easy and as less mentally draining and depressing as possible\ud83d\ude23\u263a\ufe0f", "author": "Squirtjuice18", "created": 1628137580, "retrieved": 1632841674, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h7rn0y0": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oya2k5/starting_uni/h7rn0y0/", "text": "Thank you u/Squirtjuice18 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Going to college to prove yourself can really be motivating, but it helps if you also enjoy it. How many credit hours are you taking? I'd really ease myself into it at first, depending on what your requirements are (I know certain scholarships require you to take more credit hours). Try to not to pile on the workload for the first semester - ease yourself into it. Once you establish a routine, it will be easier to take on more courses at once. Remember that your grades are not your worth as a human being, and it's okay to get B's and C's too if struggling to get straight A's would ruin ruin your life. Do your best to establish good habits though, they'll take you a long way. I didn't establish good study habits until after dropping out of college, and I payed for it.  \n\n\nReally decent video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you will probably find a lot of people in a similar boat in college! Maybe not people that come from a background exactly like yours, but with similar feelings about being away from home. Meeting new people can be challenging, but the fastest way to make friends is to establish some common ground with them. Try to find out if you have any mutual hobbies or shared interests!", "author": "AlkaidsAlmanac", "created": 1628139740, "upvotes": 2}}}
