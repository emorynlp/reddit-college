  "text": "Bulletpoints for my issues with this professor \n\n**general disorganization/ poor communication**\n\nLectures are all over the place, don't match power point, don't match paper handout \n\nGoes off on irrelevant tangents mid lecture\n\nTakes way too long to respond to emails. Missed one class due to covid scare and took me over a week to get missing handout\n\n**unprofessional**\n\nCusses during class/too informal\n\nHas joked about drug use and suicide\n\nMade sexist comment in reference to a fertility ritual\n\nSO. Now my conundrum. I can either bite the bullet and take finish this class that I hate and am not learning in OR withdraw and have to take it again with no refund.  I have a C currently. If I tank the next test I will fail the class, if I withdraw it won't affect my GPA. What would you guys do?\n\n\nTL;DR  should I stay in a class I might fail or withdraw and have to retake it",
