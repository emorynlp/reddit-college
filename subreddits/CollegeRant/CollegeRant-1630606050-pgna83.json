I\u2019m coming on here today to let you know that I am saying goodbye to my dream of becoming a doctor. I know it\u2019s cheesy to say but, I have wanted to be a doctor ever since I could actually think about what job I might want in my adult life. Knowing that I was an international student, I knew that my opportunities and my attempts would always be limited but I always had hope in this country\u2019s immigration system. I came to this country when I was entering the first grade from kindergarten at the age of six or seven. My father had obtained a work visa and had brought me and my family along to the USA from India at that time. For the past 14 years, I have lived in this country, becoming more American than I ever was an Indian. The US has been and forever will be by home but I am never going to be considered a legal permanent resident of this country. \n\nKnowing all of this, I still entered into my undergraduate degree as a biology major thinking that through some miracle, the immigration system would not fail me. I maintained perfect 4.0 GPA in my degree, got a leadership position at a health related club at my university, volunteered at my local ER for the past year and a half and did research and shadowing too. Being an international premed meant that every single one of these things was doubly harder to get into. In order to volunteer at my local hospital, you needed a SSN and I did not have that. After a couple weeks of persistence, I finally managed to get that. When I tried to get a job as a COVID contact tracer at my university, they had to reject me because they needed an SSN. Every single summer research program that I have found requires permanent residency or citizenship. Every single time I see a cool opportunity that I know I could do, I am crestfallen when I see the mocking \u201caccepting only citizens or permanent residents.\u201d on the application. When I look on the news about immigration, I can\u2019t help but grow enraged at the idiots, both democrat and Republican who waffle back and forth doing nothing to change the status quo. Just know that the age of bipartisanship is dead and gone. Because of a quirk in the immigration laws of this country, I will at the age of 21, \u201cage out\u201d of my parent\u2019s visa application and so, I will be reduced to nothing more than an international student who might have come to this country only to do their undergraduate degree. After that, if I were to continue on this premed path, I will have to apply to only the top tier schools and nothing more because 95% of medical schools do not accept international students. \n\nAs my peers in class go onto pursue their dreams, I have been forced to come to the conclusion that I have to drop my passion and pursue a more practical degree for people like me. I\u2019ve been extremely depressed for the last few months and I just don\u2019t know what to say to make me feel better. I hate that the country I call home does not want me here. If I am forced to go back to India because I have aged out, I don\u2019t know what I would do. I think that at that point, I will go off to the big man in the sky because I am not leaving the only country that I would call home alive. I know that this rant will probably be heard by nobody but I just needed to vent to feel heard.", "author": "UnarmedIntestine", "created": 1630606050, "retrieved": 1632841178, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"hbcff5y": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pgna83/giving_up/hbcff5y/", "text": "Thank you u/UnarmedIntestine for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've never wanted to be a doctor but I understand your dream. I don't know how frustrated you are right now, but I can imagine. I know you probably don't want to hear this, but don't give up. Not just yet. I am totally with you on the immigration thing. Not allowing people from other countries into the US as a full citizen is damaging socially and economically. I don't know how much I'll be able to help. I don't know much about medicine, or immigration for that matter. But I do know you shouldn't give up. I know it sounds cheesy, but seriously. I'm sure there's other things you can do in the medical field that would make you happy. Sure, maybe you can't be a full doctor right now. That's okay. You'll get there. Have you researched anything else you might like, medicine wise? I'm trying to help out here, and I really do feel for you. Ranting can feel good and I understand you have to get it in the open. Just know, although I'm nowhere near the realm of medical school, we're all in the whole university thing together. We all know how tough it is. Some just a bit more than others. I'll understand if you don't want to reply, but I hope this helped even a little bit.", "author": "idioticathiest", "created": 1630609686, "upvotes": 2}}}
