If a student tells me that they got called into work and if they could have an extension on an assignment, I grant it no questions asked. But all I see from faculty is shit like \u201cwell then if I extend it for you I have to extend it for everyone\u201d no tf you don\u2019t, because not everyone NEEDS the extension. \u201cBut that\u2019s not fair to the other students\u201d what the fuck do you mean \u201cnot fair\u201d?? All I care about is my students learning the material. What\u2019s not fair is expecting Suzy who works 40 hours a week to learn the material in the same time as John who doesn\u2019t work. \u201cWell they signed up for a college class, they need to figure it out\u201d and I suppose that people who are poor and can\u2019t afford food or shelter should just \u201cfigure it out\u201d as well? They have to work, what tf do you expect them to do?? If you give a student more time on an assignment they will almost always know the material better, why wouldn\u2019t you want that? Because of some misplaced sense of what is \u201cfair\u201d when it isn\u2019t a competition in the first place??? This is one of the many many reasons why higher education is so inaccessible to the working class, and fuck you if you think I\u2019m going to participate in that.", "author": "Gerardo1917", "created": 1617571533, "retrieved": 1632951353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"gu01saw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mk59ee/education_should_not_be_this_way_due_date_rant/gu01saw/", "text": "Once I had a professor say \u2018yes of course I\u2019ll extend the deadline from noon to midnight, you can turn it in the next morning if you need to\u2019.
