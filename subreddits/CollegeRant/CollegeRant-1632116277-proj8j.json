I pride myself on getting good grades but this week really fucked me over. Like I\u2019m a 4.0 student (it\u2019s the one thing I have left going for me rn please spare me the lecture on that) But damn my professors have been on some bs this semester. One of my professors doesn\u2019t care what happened they won\u2019t excuse anything. One girl in my class lost her mother and because she missed an assignment she got a 0. Then my math professor was like a lot of people don\u2019t pass this class. Like bro this class is literally word problems what do you mean. I now see why though we go through 3 sections per class and never get to ask questions. So yea that\u2019s cool. Only two classes I\u2019m doing good in are my 8 week classes. I study hard for everything like I spend 2 hours studying every day. I\u2019m exhausted and annoyed. I appreciate my professors and I know Covid but this isn\u2019t it.\n\nRecaps: some teachers are wildin and im overwhelmed", "author": "babyygirlls", "created": 1632116277, "retrieved": 1632948470, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {}}
