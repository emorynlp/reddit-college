I have a couple acquaintances and that\u2019s it. My existing friends have all made new friend groups and whilst we\u2019re thankfully still pretty close I feel so weird that I only have them whilst they have tons of other people. I\u2019m an introvert and have social anxiety so I prefer to have a few close friends but I feel such a pressure to do what everyone else does. \n\nThis year will be my final year. I would like to have at least one new friend but I feel like everyone has made friends at this point and it\u2019s awkward for me to try and fit into existing friend groups. I\u2019m going to try to join societies and talk to people in class. But I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on that amazing social life everyone else has and it\u2019s too late now :(", "author": "tupsybee", "created": 1629655060, "retrieved": 1632951224, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ha4ecef": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p9hbln/has_anyone_else_completely_failed_the_social_side/ha4ecef/", "text": "Hahah me too !
