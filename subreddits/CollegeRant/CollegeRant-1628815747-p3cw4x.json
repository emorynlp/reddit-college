I don't know what to do. When I was looking for advice for college, they told me that I shouldn't let anyone know that I came from a \"Science High School\". In my country, science high schools are considered advanced schools with entrance exams. \n\nWhen I began college, I had my identity hidden. My profile was free of anything that would indicate my past so my blockmates don't really know much about me. By the second week, surprise surprise, we were asked to send a picture of ourselves and the school we used to go to. I can't lie about it, right? And I never believed that advice of not saying you came from a science high school, anyway. So, I did tell them. \n\nAlright, this is the part where I overthink too much. I am present in a class and an attendance holder listed me as absent. I had proof that I was present. The same class that asked for the picture was the one I was listed absent on. My picture was clearly there, and they even reacted to it. The attendance holder reacted to it. So, I wondered why they marked me as absent when I also recited? \n\nAnd... not to judge, but I had that \"vibe\" from them. They're like the guys who peaked in high school for being popular, though they aren't \"good guys\". ifwjifne I don't know, I'm too judgmental maybe and a bit of an anxious student but I can't help it. I don't want to return to high school. I want to be in a college where they act as professional, mature students. I just don't want to discover the fact that they might hate me or something because that will honestly make me transfer. I don't care if I had to quit, I don't want to be in an environment that's competitive. College isn't even supposed to be competitive... God, I really want to know why they marked me as absent. I chatted the attendance holder yesterday, but she still didn't see my message.
