The semester is over in May, but I just want to close my laptop and never sign on to canvas again. \n\nMy mental health is trash & I feel sad. I just want to sleep or cry. I have zero free time . I work all day, take care of my child and just want to relax. But no I\u2019m sitting here reading about a bunch of dead presidents .\n\nI\u2019m so mad at myself.
