It kinda gives me some kind of comfort knowing it really is normal to feel all of this heavy stress and pressure from college. In my situation right now, I've been grouped in a smart clique and I can't help but feel unnecessary pressure from all of them since they're doing academically well. Considering the fact that I'm also in an online school set up due to pandemic, a freshman who is still adjusting, and taking up a heavy stem degree, I couldn't help but feel... helpless and isolated. With your stories, I'm reminded that everything I'm experiencing right now is quite normal and that I should just do things at my own pace. Thanks for this..\n\nPS. I hope we all get through whatever it is we are going through rn :)", "author": "archieasks", "created": 1630432509, "retrieved": 1632948975, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hb3swa5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pfb3r7/its_in_this_community_that_i_felt_like_i_wasnt/hb3swa5/", "text": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "author": "Emotional-Shirt7901", "created": 1630443618, "upvotes": 3}}}
