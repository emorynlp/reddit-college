You can say there are barely any human basic needs available. I was born into a simple family of a merchant dad and a teacher mother.\n\nI finished high school with a 97% and then went to medical school, my marks have always been good (mostly above 80 and some 90s as well).\n\nIn the first two years the country was not so bad, we got electricity around 12 or a bit more hours a day, we managed to get our basic needs not so easily but things weren't so hard either, I lead a nice life with the money my dad gave me, went on nice dates like any other college student.\n\nThe last three month were the worst, we barely have any electricity (best days we have 4 hours), everything is expensive that we're starting to change our lifestyle and compromise to keep living, I started an online job which pays good money (I make more than my mum now lmao). But if I want to get some fuel to go for a ride and chill a bit I have to put half of my paycheck for some litres which is not a logical thing to do for a car ride but it's the only options. It's not acceptable for a human being to spend their teen years like this while working and studying hard.\n\nNow I reached fourth year and starting the new semester in 10 days. But I'm having second thoughts about living in the first place. I want to get out of this country as soon as possible and the best option is finishing medicine school which will take me three years, and an extra year for preparing any papers for the country I'm going to. \n\nI'm losing the will to do anything, I'm working just because it's paying and that's the only thing keeping me sane. \n\nI was looking for scholarships or any way to run away, if I want to stay in medicine I have to start all over, and any other option would lead to starting all over again. I just can't see a faster way out of my hell.\n\nI saw an opportunity to volunteer in the European corps or whatever they call it i'm not gonna google it now but it's smth related to the European youth portal, and as much as it sounds nice but I would have to postpone my studies and spend a year at smth different than my major so it's a year wasted just for the sake of willing to live like a normal human being with electricity and water privileges.\n\nI'm lost, don't know what to do, I barely have the will to do anything and I could use some help. All my life I spent it helping people and never asked anyone for help but I'm burnt out and I want to take this off my chest.\n\nEnglish is my second language so forgive me for any mistakes.\n\nWHAT SHOULD I DO TO LIVE", "author": "Electronic_Shine7988", "created": 1631831087, "retrieved": 1632948509, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdm7yj2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ppnl2d/help/hdm7yj2/", "text": "Your English is excellent.
