I'm 4 semesters into my computer science degree and I just don't feel smart enough. My skills aren't progressing like I thought they would even when I constantly increase the time I put in. My problem solving skills are trash and I'm not creative at all so coming up with solutions is almost impossible for me. I don't know if its the fact I just don't like coding or if its because I'm not used to fighting this hard to grasp simple concepts. Nothing has ever been this difficult for me to learn. And it upsets me even more to know that this is just the tip of the iceberg. These coding assignments I spend days on are nothing. I just don't know what to do. I planned on graduating next winter so its kinda too late to switch majors and I literally don't have a passion for anything so I don't even know what I would switch to anyway. I'm really trying to be positive but its so hard right now.", "author": "r-e-w-13", "created": 1631418474, "retrieved": 1632948570, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"hclbonp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pmli57/major_problems/hclbonp/", "text": "This makes me so scared...i just started college with a CS major with no prior experience...", "author": "Alwayskawaii33", "created": 1631470898, "upvotes": 2}, "hckqrj3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pmli57/major_problems/hckqrj3/", "text": "In the same boat brother. I feel like I was learning much more while being in online classes cause I had the freedom of using my own powerful gaming machine instead of those clown ass computers they put in front of us in colleges. Wake up LITERALLY like 30 minutes before class, not having to worry about driving or taking the bus or being late. Just getting up and sitting down in the comfort of your own room or space and attending class was just amazing. But any who, for me I slowly started to learn the concept of coding (For all languages) after you learn the real basics. Like for and while loops for instance. I had no idea what those meant or did, but in many programming languages the concept is almost always identical or same. Once you manage to teach yourself (Cause college is NOT gonna do that for you) the real basics and connections between all the languages, then and only then will you master the art of coding (I'm still getting there lol) But yea good luck my g and just remember that there are probably like another 10 million students in the same boat as you.", "author": "Salvationzzzz", "created": 1631462503, "upvotes": 5}}}
