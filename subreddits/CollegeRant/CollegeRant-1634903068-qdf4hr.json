  "text": "I feel like they're so fed up with my incompetency because I constantly forget minor stuff during our return demos. It takes hours for me to process a lecture worth of information but under pressure and anxiety, some minor details are bound to escape my field of focus. Fortunately, I got the major details of the demo right but still, a mistake is a mistake. I understand the college wants to mold perfect graduates but at the end of the day, I feel so bad about myself over that one mistake. My classmate had so many mistakes, as expressed by our prof, but my prof still initiated a casual talk and friendly reminder of the lab report after with them. Me? I just got told I'm free to leave after I was done with the demo.",
