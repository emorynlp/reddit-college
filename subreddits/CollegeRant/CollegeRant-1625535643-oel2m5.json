I thought it would be better than high school, which I really enjoyed, but so far it hasn't. Before I even entered college, I had some experience of taking college courses because of a partnership between my high school and the college campus it was on and I really enjoyed that.\n\nFirst reason why I don't enjoy college: I've felt lonelier than ever. In high school, I didn't have many friends, but since it was a small school (400 students), I knew most people and had some good conversations with them from time to time. In college, when I'm in-person, I've had none of that. I don't know anyone, have no friends, and haven't had any good or meaningful conversations with anyone. I tried making friends at orientation and in a class FB group, but only made a single friendship which fell apart after a few weeks. This loneliness has bugged me so much I've deactivated most of social media.\n\nSecond reason why I don't enjoy college: not being able to move at my own pace. During the fall semester, I have to complete a practicum. I have a plan in place, but if this doesn't work out, I'm worried. I've never even held a job before as I've never gotten past the interview stage multiple times or ghosted completely. I'd rather have done this practicum next year or during my senior year when I likely have a job locked down. With this practicum, I feel like I got to figure out something quickly. \n\nThird reason why I don't enjoy college is more personal: transportation. In college, I have to take the metro since I don't have a car yet. It's not bad taking the metro heading home, but taking it heading to college is brutal in the mornings. Waking up at 6, leaving at 7, and arriving by 8 isn't nice. Now not going in-person for most of last year (especially in the spring semester when I had 1 in-person class) was nice, but now I'll be there five days a week (most likely). It'll suck in the winter as well.\n\nFourth reason why I don't enjoy college: that workload. With me taking the practicum this semester, I'll only have to take four classes. That's great. That workload in college is not fun though. It's not bad at first, but towards the end of the semester it's brutal. I've became better at managing my time though so that helps a lot. \n\nFifth reason: the in-person experience. This was partially due to COVID, but being in-person last year sucked. I loved doing Zoom University for this exact reason. The events seemed alright, but I'd always be done with the college day or didn't have interest in them when they came around. The open gyms weren't open due to COVID either so hopefully that changes as well. Being in-person five days a week may change my thoughts on this well.\n\nWorrying about college debt on top of this doesn't help either. I hate thinking about that. It won't be a crazy amount, but still.\n\nI love my major though and I'm gonna get through college.\n\nJust a long rant. Anyone got tips as to how I can enjoy college more often? I just am not looking forward to going in-person next month.", "author": "SportsMajor", "created": 1625535643, "retrieved": 1632949604, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"h4i00ok": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oel2m5/i_dont_enjoy_college_so_far_and_feel_unhappy/h4i00ok/", "text": "Yea same accept I got academic ally suspended twice", "author": "chicityhopper", "created": 1625767555, "upvotes": 3}, "h4gzpdh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oel2m5/i_dont_enjoy_college_so_far_and_feel_unhappy/h4gzpdh/", "text": "Sameee!!!
