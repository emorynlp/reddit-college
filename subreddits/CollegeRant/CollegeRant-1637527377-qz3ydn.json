  "title:": "College is pointless (not Rose-Hulman specifically, but college in general)",
  "text": "High school basically seemed like a bunch of busy work, and after one trimester in college, college basically seems the same way. I am good at this busy work, so I get good grades, but that doesn't mean I actually care about it. I like the people at college, although I don't know many of them beyond a surface level, and I do like the independence. But I have no idea what I want to major in: I did not even enjoy the class I took in my major. And the primary reason I am even going to college is because the job prospects without any post-secondary education in the United States is not optimistic: there are some exceptions such as several famous CEOs, but with an increase in the number of college graduates, not having a degree from a two- or four-year college closes many doors, and given current trends in the job market, it is unlikely that this situation is going to get better. So college basically seems like a few more years of useless work in order to get a diploma that allows you to get a decently-paying job, which is the start of (probably useless) work in the workforce.\n\nAnd for some reason, because I am good at doing academic busy work, the expectation that I go to college is higher, because there is the idea that if I don't, then I would be wasting my potential, I guess. I am not upset at anyone in particular. I appreciate that my family members are funding an expensive college education, and I appreciate that my college professors want to help me succeed. But something seems off in this system.\n\nAnyone else feel that way? This is a weird metaphor, but it is like running on a treadmill in the middle of the ocean: you aren't going anywhere, but there isn't anywhere else to go.",

      "text": "We work for a diploma to work for a degree to work for a job to work for retirement. That\u2019s the way of life for most of us. \n\nAs I like to see it, college at least helps make working more bearable as it increases the chances of getting a better-paying job. It means not having to live paycheck to paycheck or working arduous hours for minimum wage just to survive. It\u2019s the reason why education is highly valued in third-world countries.\n\nSo while it may be dreadful, at least you\u2019ll only have to endure it for a few more years.",

          "text": "Perhaps I may be a bit idealistic, but I kind of hoped that college would be challenging but enjoyable, since in college, you figure out what you enjoy and would actually enjoy pursuing as a career, so that despite having ups and downs, overall, college and work is enjoyable. It is mildly encouraging that even with a college degree, I will not like working in the workforce much more than working at a minimum wage job, but at least, I will have a higher paycheck to show for it.",

      "text": "I am just finishing up the last of my general education classes and I can tell you that the classes in your first two years of college are just really an extension of high school. The major classes I'm taking now are so much better. I'm actually interested and challenged in my classes. Next semester is going to be even better since I only have major classes. Hang in there, and use this time to explore what you want to do. If you hate the major classes you're taking now, maybe reach out to career services at your school and go talk to someone. There's tons of choices out there that you've probably never even heard about!",
