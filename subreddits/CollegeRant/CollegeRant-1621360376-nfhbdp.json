  "text": "I won\u2019t be able to graduate this summer, because I failed to get an internship and failed to meet the requirements for its substitute class. The substitute class (industry project) was something I thought I could do but it wasn\u2019t disclosed that I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to register for the class until my professor approved. The instructions for the project were vague, I\u2019ve tried for two weeks to get approval but the registration deadline has passed, and I feel like an idiot. I only had 2 classes left",

I got an internship freshmen year related to my major but because it was related to my major I couldn\u2019t count it as an internship until I was a senior (yeah doesn\u2019t make any sense). So I left that internship and got one related to my minor and I was able to get that to count as a sophomore. I tried getting it out of the way asap though so I could intern wherever I wanted as I get older and build the exact experience I want for my career instead of what my college wants",

My boyfriend got a job that\u2019s related to his major but because he got it as a sophomore the school was fighting him about getting credit for it. The job offered him a full time salary position upon graduation and the school STILL wanted him to leave this job and get an internship to graduate. Eventually he went off on his advisor and told him he\u2019ll just drop out and work if the college wants to hold him back in his career and the school president got involved and they finally let him get credit for his work. It\u2019s really crazy what length schools will go to make it seem impossible to graduate.",
