It\u2019s a pain in the ass to meet the requirements for it. I got an internship freshmen year related to my major but because it was related to my major I couldn\u2019t count it as an internship until I was a senior (yeah doesn\u2019t make any sense). So I left that internship and got one related to my minor and I was able to get that to count as a sophomore. I tried getting it out of the way asap though so I could intern wherever I wanted as I get older and build the exact experience I want for my career instead of what my college wants", "author": "cabbage-soup", "created": 1621375043, "upvotes": 8}}}
