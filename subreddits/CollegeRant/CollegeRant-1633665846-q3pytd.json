  "text": "It's my first year in college as an engineering major and it's kicking my ass. I went in with with mindset that if I just dedicate a lot of time and energy to my work, I'll do fine but I'm midway through and I'm just over it. Everything time I start my work, all I can think is \"I hate this\". I've lots all motivation to do my work and I feel like a failure. People tell me \"Oh it's just burn out, relax for a bit and you'll be fine\" but I'm so scared because when I step away from my work, I almost instantly get behind on everything. I can't bring myself to stop working but I hate everything about what I'm doing \nI'm playing on changing it to environmental science so most of my classes won't matter next semester which is another factor that has made me lose motivation but I still want to pass, even if it's the bare minimum \n\nDo you guys have any advice for this kind of burnout?",
