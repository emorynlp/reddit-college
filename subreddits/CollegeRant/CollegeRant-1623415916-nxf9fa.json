  "text": "College isn't what u expected at all, the professors most of them can't explain anything or just don't care enough to explain, they keep throwing out just pages and pages of information and expect us to memorize everything.\n\nIf they are late at finishing it means we will just get 2 lectures at once or just we study it ourselves, a professor just gave us 2 lectures and just gave us the material for the rest of the subject and left and didn't explain anything.\n\nOr other professors who brag about how hard their subject is and how many fail, good job you suck at your job and you are a peice of shit.\n\nI am rly angry that these people get paid for doing nothing, they don't give a shit about teaching or making people understand the subjects and then brag about how shitty they r at teaching.\n\nTL;DR: I am angry that there is professors who don't do anything useful and get paid for doing nothing and then brag about how much they suck at their job and how much people suffer and hate the subjects because of them.",

That means there will be many cases of sacrificing teaching for research. I'd bet 90% of students complaints about professor aloofness is due to this systemic structure. Individual professors are the symptom. The cause is the incentive structure.",

Obviously coordinating 5 people\u2019s schedules as well as finding time to actually do the assignment with that short of notice is difficult, and I work 12 hour shifts on Fridays. I asked if we could please have 48 hours notice before assignments are due because I and other students work and he told me that holding a job and taking his class at the same time was \u2018unwise to say the least\u2019. Lots of professors genuinely do not care about you and are so far out of touch, it\u2019s insane. I\u2019m taking this as a summer class at a community college too, I\u2019d say the majority of students at CCs have to work to support themselves.",

I'm a chem major and tbh like 90% of the stuff I learned, won't be applicable for me in the \"real\" world.

      "text": "Professor here. Three things to say:   \n\n\nOne: you are correct that lots of professors should not be in that job. Remember that to teach in higher education you get a credential that trains you to be a subject matter expert, not an expert at explaining things to other people that are from diverse backgrounds and with many types of learning styles. SOME of us spend a lot of time doing supplemental education, workshops, CEs, and trainings in order to learn how to *teach* better, while also staying up to date on our *subject matter*. Many professors don't do that.   \n\n\nTwo: don't let others' failures determine your trajectory. Seek out the additional resources that are there for you to make sure you can still succeed even though they have clearly failed you. Your university almost certainly has free or cheap tutoring available in the subject matter, they almost certainly have some kind of peer mentoring systems or clubs in place, they almost certainly have student support and counseling services available. What do YOU need to move on from these poor professors without allowing their poor performance to shape your life?   \n\n\nThree: We don't all suck - at least some of try not to suck. For *many* college students, they have a lot of mediocre instructors and a few very good, very memorable ones. Those few often become your advisor, mentor, and write you letters of recommendation. You haven't found your few yet, but it doesn't mean they are not out there.   \n\n\nKeep at it!",

              "text": "In my experience, most people make a decision about where to attend college based on how much college costs.  There are good professors, but you can expect that places that value education will pay their professors better, and that also means you'll probably be paying more tuition.  People who are not teaching full time, working as lecturers and adjuncts,  really are not getting paid much at all.  People who are full-time dedicated teachers cost a lot more to the university.  Education really is a situation where you get what you pay for.  I think that is, in itself, an education.",
