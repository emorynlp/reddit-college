I asked if we could please have 48 hours notice before assignments are due because I and other students work and he told me that holding a job and taking his class at the same time was \u2018unwise to say the least\u2019. Lots of professors genuinely do not care about you and are so far out of touch, it\u2019s insane.

Three things to say:   \n\n\nOne: you are correct that lots of professors should not be in that job. Remember that to teach in higher education you get a credential that trains you to be a subject matter expert, not an expert at explaining things to other people that are from diverse backgrounds and with many types of learning styles. SOME of us spend a lot of time doing supplemental education, workshops, CEs, and trainings in order to learn how to *teach* better, while also staying up to date on our *subject matter*. Many professors don't do that.   \n\n\nTwo: don't let others' failures determine your trajectory. Seek out the additional resources that are there for you to make sure you can still succeed even though they have clearly failed you. Your university almost certainly has free or cheap tutoring available in the subject matter, they almost certainly have some kind of peer mentoring systems or clubs in place, they almost certainly have student support and counseling services available. What do YOU need to move on from these poor professors without allowing their poor performance to shape your life?   \n\n\nThree: We don't all suck - at least some of try not to suck. For *many* college students, they have a lot of mediocre instructors and a few very good, very memorable ones. Those few often become your advisor, mentor, and write you letters of recommendation. You haven't found your few yet, but it doesn't mean they are not out there.   \n\n\nKeep at it!", "author": "OtiksSpicedPotatoes", "created": 1623423354, "upvotes": 48}, "h1en2pj": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nxf9fa/everything_feels_against_you_in_college/h1en2pj/", "text": "You're not alone.
