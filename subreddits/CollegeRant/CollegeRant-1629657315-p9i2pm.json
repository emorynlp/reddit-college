Reading and writing have been passions since I was young. I'd like to work in a museum, or as a professor. I love anthropology and historic preservation. I also love philosophy and economics and would like to work in foreign affairs. I've considered double majoring in English and History, or History and Anthropology, or getting a PPE degree (Politics, Philosophy, Econ) \n\nHow am I supposed to choose between all these majors? I don't know what I want to do with my life. Is it bad to do a double major and minor? Does that look bad to future employers? \n\nTL;DR: I'm having trouble choosing between all the majors in college.", "author": "depressedstudent25", "created": 1629657315, "retrieved": 1632949060, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"h9zftb6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p9i2pm/torn_between_so_many_majors/h9zftb6/", "text": "Not sure about your college, but my college reports the average salary, positions held, and employment % for each major\u2019s alumni, and that really helped me narrow down what I wanted to do. \n\nI\u2019m biased, but I absolutely love being in the Econ program. At my school it\u2019s a BBA degree, and there\u2019s a lot of flexibility to really focus on what you like. I know a lot of people that focus on foreign affairs, finance, public policy, development, and so much more.

Get your money\u2019s worth! Pick the major that you\u2019ve taken coursework in an actually enjoyed. Your whole life will not be defined by this one decision.
