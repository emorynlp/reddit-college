Reading and writing have been passions since I was young. I'd like to work in a museum, or as a professor. I love anthropology and historic preservation. I also love philosophy and economics and would like to work in foreign affairs. I've considered double majoring in English and History, or History and Anthropology, or getting a PPE degree (Politics, Philosophy, Econ) \n\nHow am I supposed to choose between all these majors? I don't know what I want to do with my life. Is it bad to do a double major and minor? Does that look bad to future employers? \n\nTL;DR: I'm having trouble choosing between all the majors in college.", "author": "depressedstudent25", "created": 1629657315, "retrieved": 1632841585, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"h9xt7gr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p9i2pm/torn_between_so_many_majors/h9xt7gr/", "text": "Thank you u/depressedstudent25 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At my school it\u2019s a BBA degree, and there\u2019s a lot of flexibility to really focus on what you like.
