School is damn expensive and it\u2019s expensive just to stay alive. Student mental health is not that great. Life is hard. A lot of people are in college to break the cycle of poverty that so many of us have been plagued with our entire lives. They know all of this. It\u2019s not a secret!!!!! But they act like every student has all the time in the world to dedicate to their studies and don\u2019t have anything else going on. Most employers will give you extensions or lighten your workload if it\u2019s too much to handle. I\u2019ve already been in the workforce and college does not prepare you for it, just like high school doesn\u2019t prepare you for college. \n\nI am just so sick of professors being so stuck up and I\u2019m sick of being in last place just because my parents and I don\u2019t have money.\n\nI wish teachers would just cut us some slack sometimes", "author": "perfectbarrel", "created": 1599587371, "retrieved": 1632950203, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g6dtrhk": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ioycm9/why_do_teachers_act_like_its_1930/g6dtrhk/", "text": "OP I totally agree with you!

Without knowing exactly what your professors are doing or saying, it may be out of their hands.  The [federal guideline](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2019-title34-vol3/xml/CFR-2019-title34-vol3-sec600-2.xml) for a credit-hour for a semester is at least two hours of homework for every hour in class, or at least six hours of homework per week for a three-credit semester-long class. Federal financial aid is based on this, which is why a 12 semester credit load (a 36 hour per week time commitment) is considered full-time. Giving students a significantly lighter workload could technically endanger your school's ability to get federal financial aid, which is not what anyone wants. \n\nObviously, this presents a problem for students who have to work full-time to support themselves. \n\nWe [know](https://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/) that helping students financially helps them to stay in school and graduate. But most schools can't afford to give students the financial help they need.  Is there anything your professors could do to make things better while still observing the credit hour requirements?", "author": "Frankie_Bow", "created": 1599597017, "upvotes": 22}, "g4h5zw7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ioycm9/why_do_teachers_act_like_its_1930/g4h5zw7/", "text": "Especially with the pandemic going on.
