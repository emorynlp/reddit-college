  "text": "I have 3 roommates and even though we all have our own rooms, the place has such thin walls you can hear everything. Roommate 1 always plays music out loud, but its quiet and she isnt next to me so i never hear it. But shes always walking around with her damn airpods in but doesnt have the music playing in them... wtf? Idfk why she just doesnt use her airpods and its so annoying. Roommate 2 on the other hand is right next to me and BLASTS HER MUSIC ALL THE TIME!!!! Were cool so Ill joke with her about it but its starting to really piss me off so I said can you please not play that so loud blah blah why dont you just use your headphones so she got mad at me and roommate 3 because we didnt want her playing her loud music out in the living room at night. Then she precedes to blast it from her room but it makes no difference because the walls are so thin. I have told her multiple times every day to use headphones and she never does. And I know for a fact she has them. It just pisses me off because I dont know why everyone would think you wanted to here their music. I just cant focus with music playing",

      "text": "Sometimes wearing headphones can be taxing on the ears(I wear some typically most of the day so when i get back to my dorm I try not to use them). If they have airpods its constant pressure on the ears inside that can get uncomfortable. If regular headphones then squeezing the ears together and kind of get sore like how when you wear masks for a long time the back of the ears gets sore. \n\nAlso playing music out loud is pretty mucky an automatic audio adjuster as the farther you get from the source the quieter it becomes of course. So instead of having music pushed directly into your ears and head at what ever singular volume you pick it can adjust as you move around.\n\nJust wanted to add that i understand your post though. Not saying they aren't wrong just a different perspective as I assume you guys aren't all home all day.",

I used to be fine wearing earbuds and headphones ALL the time as an antisocial highschooler and IVE only recently noticed that sometimes i just dont want things in or on my ears or on my head after a certain amount of time. People are different. Simple as that tbh",
