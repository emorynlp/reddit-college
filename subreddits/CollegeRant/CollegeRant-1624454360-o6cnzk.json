I just wanted to vent what seems to be a problem so unique to me. You see I have to take some specific classes from specific parts of my major, which is fine and dandy normal I would not complain, but and it's a big old but. My school does not open lessons for those classes, and since I can't attend classes that are not there I can't graduate, but I can't graduate because college refuses to open those classes. I am in this school for four years and I can't graduate because despite there being \"108\" different topics to cover from those lessons, they never open it. I am about to go crazy, which is only more aggravated by the fact that nobody else seems to have had this problem before, which makes me feel extremely lonely\n\nTl;DR College does not open up lessons I need to pass.", "author": "Grahim_Imperious", "created": 1624454360, "retrieved": 1632842180, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h2rjm6g": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o6cnzk/i_am_here_to_rant_and_see_if_other_people_had_the/h2rjm6g/", "text": "Thank you u/Grahim_Imperious for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
