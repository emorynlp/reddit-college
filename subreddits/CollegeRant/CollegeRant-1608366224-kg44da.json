  "text": "hi, so for context, i\u2019m a current community college student that graduated high school this year.\n\nfor some stupid reason i went on to my high school\u2019s instagram page and they have multiple story highlights featuring kids from the class of 2020 and what schools they decided to go to after graduation. i decided to look through the highlights to see where they went and made myself feel incredibly bad looking at where they all went. after glancing through the story highlights, i couldn\u2019t help but hate myself even more. i was supposed to be up there with some of these kids, going to top schools. but me having a bad mental health crisis in my junior and senior years led to me becoming paralyzed which in turn led to declining grades and me nearly failing a couple of my classes so as a result i didn\u2019t really reach my full potential and just. decided not to apply to any universities at all and go to community college because i thought with the grades i had i wouldn\u2019t make it in anywhere (looking back now: i was wrong. my options would have been way more limited, but i somehow still ended up with a 3.5-3.6 unweighted GPA in high school...)\n\ni know i shouldn\u2019t agonize so much about being at a community college right now because i can transfer to a university later on. there are lots of advantages to being at a community college (which i was more than aware of when i registered at my local CC). and i know prestige doesn\u2019t make a huge difference but but i can\u2019t help but just feel like i\u2019m not going to make it in life after finding out where my classmates are going after high school. has anyone else experienced the same thing? how do you stop comparing yourself to classmates that got into top universities? because i feel like compared to them, my future isn\u2019t bright. i worry so so much about me not being able to transfer from my CC to uni and not getting accepted anywhere",

I know so many people who make their lives look amazing on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and etc. They have shit lives and their not happy with what college they went too. Also, if I was you I would get off social media. Take a break and focus on yourself! Start improving your self image and self love. Try new hobbies as well that\u2019s a great way to helping improve your mood. Going to a community college isn\u2019t always a bad thing. It will help you save a lot of money and your not racking up student debt. Stop beating yourself up so much. Take good care of yourself, because you definitely deserve it. You\u2019re doing great at life and good luck!!",

      "text": "I went to a CC straight out of high school first because the tuition was cheaper and the school was closer to my family home. I am so grateful I made that decision because my professors were so much more accessible and pushed us harder (thus making my schoolwork more valuable) then when I transferred to Uni 2 years later. \n\nEveryone's journey is different, there is no guarantee your school mates are doing better or worse than anyone else in your class. After the first year of college things can change, because life changes, and who knows where you all will end up. Some people push through, some change majors, some go part time, some take a break, it all depends.\n\nBottom line: stop comparing yourself and focus on your journey. Delete your socials if you must, or at least stop following accounts that don't bring you joy.\n\n-Masters in Edu and been teaching for 7 years",

      "text": "I felt a lot like you. I was diagnosed with pretty bad generalized anxiety during my senior year, and it became more and more obvious moving away from family and going to a big university was not going to work. I was an honors student, everybody expected me to go to some fancy college. \n\nBut I went to community college instead, and it was truly one of the best decisions I've ever made. There were a lot of people I graduated with that couldn't handle their freshman year in college; were partying, just not doing their work, etc. But my community college experience was so great, and I transferred schools having a solid plan of what I wanted to do.\n\nNow I have graduated and am going to start my masters in the fall! \n\nHigh schools like to show off nice colleges that their students go to, and it's sad they don't encourage community college more. What's important is what's the best for you! Watch the next couple years, I'm sure a lot of those who went to fancy colleges either stress and change their majors 5 times, fail classes, or drop out.",

Nobody at university is having a good time right now, I promise. Maybe this way you\u2019ll actually have a chance to enjoy your college experience and attend in-person classes. Go get that associates degree and then transfer to a big state school in two years when the Pandy is behind us, when you can actually get involved and network at your school. If I were you I would just devote all my time to absolutely crushing my CC courses. You\u2019ll get into a nice school for transfer if you do well. Chin up!! You\u2019ve gone through a lot and everybody\u2019s story is completely unique. I think you\u2019re well on your way to a beautiful, successful life. :)",

I had a harder time with apps and due to the pandemic couldn't go to the school I wanted to and am instead going to a local safety school with an unfulfilling program. I know I can transfer, and am going to do that, but it does hurt, doesn't it? What helped me was just taking a break from social media. I honestly haven't been using it for all of this past semester. I also realized I just have to work with what I have and put my energy into getting as many credits and as high of a gpa as I can to transfer to a better school, instead of comparing myself and not doing anything about it.

I don't miss them. They don't contribute anything to me, so I'm only on once every couple of months or so, and I don't spend a lot of time either.\n\nYour high school peers may look like they're having the time of their lives online, but for all we know, they could be struggling to pass their courses and partying to drown out their stress. My grades are definitely higher once I stopped spending time on social media.",

If you are still struggling with your mental health and it affects your grades your mental health professional could look into the possibility medication/talk therapy. I was in a very similar position last year. I had gone straight to community college and I still struggled with my mental health, and I was obsessively stalking my old high school friend's social media. I saw a mental health professional who got me on the right medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. My grades significantly improved. My community college has certain guaranteed transfers with universities once you get an associate's and that's what I did. Now I almost no student debt, and my friends are complaining that they are already in over 100k debt.",

      "text": "This is a tough problem at any age, but especially at your age when everyone around you views you in terms of what you\u2019re doing and what you plan to do as opposed to who you are. For example, the most common questions I recall are: where are you going to school? What are you studying? What are your career plans? The comparisons between you and your peers never really end at any age, especially from your family, but it gets easier as you define your own path in life and people stop pestering you about it.\n\nThe best thing you can do in my opinion is stop exposing yourself to that as best you can - you don\u2019t need to know what your peer group is doing as it doesn\u2019t have any relevance on what you\u2019re doing. Try to shift your focus onto yourself- what do you enjoy doing? Do that as much as possible. This will help you discover your true strengths and help you find a career path that you will truly enjoy. Community college is the smart way to go for many reasons: you\u2019re still at home with your support system (you don\u2019t have to earn a living to pay rent and buy food so you can focus on you - bonus:you don\u2019t have to live with a bunch of strangers) and it is so much cheaper! Community college is becoming very fashionable- you still get the name of the four-year school on your diploma at a fraction of the cost! Once you\u2019re graduated, no one cares.\n\nYou\u2019re at one of the toughest places in life having to make so many decisions that will affect your entire remaining life. Give yourself a break - get off the computer over holiday break (obviously not Reddit \ud83d\ude0a) and go have fun!",
