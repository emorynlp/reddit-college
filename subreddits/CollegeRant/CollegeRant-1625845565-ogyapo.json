By the end I did not have the will nor energy to finish my assignments or put any real effort in them. \n\nBut what I would say is that try to seek out counseling services your school may have, it has helped me a bunch tbh and I have been feeling better mentally.\n\nAlso, totally up to you but I quit drinking and everything else pretty much, being sober kinda sucks sometimes especially if we have mental illness but at the same time when I drank that shit made me feel worse and smoking eventually didn't do the trick anymore. Again, sobriety is up to you just sharing my experience. For me it has opened up time for me in the day to do things I never had the time or energy to do. Sometimes I just exist, like not doing anything, just hanging out.\n\nLike someone said already, you are most likely burned out too, so if you have the summer free take the time to relax, go for walks, establish a daily routine, or any other thing that you enjoy doing.", "author": "yoyomomma420", "created": 1625855070, "upvotes": 3}, "h4lt8v7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ogyapo/college_is_so_draining/h4lt8v7/", "text": "What up man, im in the same boat, sans \u201csubstance abuse\u201d i mean i smoke a blunt to the face sometimes.\n\nYou are probably just burned out man. Take a break from the substances, get some really good rest, get outside, eat some fruit, i have found that a 5mi walk each day is good for me. I hope this helps.
