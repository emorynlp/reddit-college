My brother is taking 2 extra terms to fulfill  his degree requirement and get a special certification in his major. Sometimes the required classes you need to graduate and the classes you want to take just don't work together and you have to take extra terms. I'll probably have to take an extra term as well since my degree has pretty specific requirements and some of those classes are only offered at certain times. There are also very some very interesting courses I want to take. I could stay in for 2 extra terms with a full course load and have a great time taking fun courses. \n\nThis is your time. Screw the societal  timeline. Screw your mother's timeline. You said the school messed up. Explain that to your mom and if she doesn't like it, it's not your fault. I don't know your mom so idk how she would react but there's really no way to spin this situation that I can think of to make it your fault. The school messed up and now you had to drop a course and push back graduation.
