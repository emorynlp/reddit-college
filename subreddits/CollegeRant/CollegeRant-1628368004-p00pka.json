I lose my scholarships if I drop below a 3.0. \n\nI\u2019ve been babied all my life and I have always had a terrible relationship with my parents, especially my mom. I\u2019m the oldest, I\u2019m supposed to be the most mature, right? \nApparently not. \n\nThey\u2019re so disappointed in me and I take all my anger out on my mom in the form of attitude anytime I\u2019m around her(which isn\u2019t much)\nI have a job but don\u2019t know what it means to really work hard especially when it comes to studying. I want to blame it on anything other than the fact that I\u2019m just lazy and have no ambition. I don\u2019t know what to do. Just today I began to wonder if my poor performance in college is karma for having to never really try for anything before. \nI used to believe I was capable of reaching that goal of becoming a doctor. I still want to become a doctor but I don\u2019t know how to find the motivation it takes to get A\u2019s and make it into medical school. Who wants a doctor like that? I\u2019m disgusted with myself but clearly not enough to put in the effort to make a major change. \nQuite a joke of a problem, am I right?", "author": "Confidentchemist03", "created": 1628368004, "retrieved": 1632841658, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h83e0ve": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p00pka/pathetic_problems/h83e0ve/", "text": "Thank you u/Confidentchemist03 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And so you never learned how?\n\nAs of now - that\u2019s not true anymore, is it? There are some life lessons you don\u2019t learn until your 40s, 50s, or 60s. You happen to be learning this one in your 20s. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late for you to figure this out for yourself and find out just how high you can reach a bar when someone doesn\u2019t set it at waist height for you. \n\nDon\u2019t do this for your parents - they won\u2019t be stuck in your career for the rest of their lives. Try hard and be nice to them because you love them and they probably helped you get here. But pay more attention to poor grades as a sign that you need to try something different than focusing on how they\u2019re a disappointment to your parents.\n\nTell your parents you\u2019re struggling with your own expectations. Apologize to them for regressing back to your terrible teens. Explain to them you need their support and let them know when a certain question or statement causes a strong reaction in you. (For example, it used to make me irrationally angry and defensive when my mom asked me if I was studying or had studied for an exam. I asked her to stop after several fights. It was hard for her but she did and it was one of our first steps to her treating me emotionally like an adult.)\n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t throw everything away because you see Med school getting further away from you. You absolutely still have time to pull up your GPA, but there are also several other professions in the medical field that are worth pursuing (eg they\u2019re desperate for respiratory therapists right now). Maybe it would help your motivation to keep your eyes on Med school but know that you have worthwhile alternatives to work for if Med school doesn\u2019t work out.", "author": "FakinItAndMakinIt", "created": 1628396299, "upvotes": 1}, "h84pg4o": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p00pka/pathetic_problems/h84pg4o/", "text": "I have similar feelings as you, I\u2019m a freshman about to enter.

You've made a major life transition during weird, unstable, and difficult times. Sometimes when you're in the thick of it, it's hard to step back and see what is wrong. Chances are it's not the work. It sounds like you need a break and that this is a mood related issue. College is a huge change (removal) of structure to your life, and the structed environment of primary and secondary school isn't there anymore. It's HARD. \n\nStep back and take a walk to distract your central nervous system. It doesn't have to be long, five minutes makes all the difference. Holding some ice for a few minutes also is a good distraction when you're overwhelmed (seriously!). Then, sit down and write out your worries and difficulties. Break these into small pieces and make a list of the things you can fix and what you can't, then decide what you'll do about them. Is there a common thread here that may need to be addressed?  \n\nWorryTree is a great app for this. https://www.nhs.uk/apps-library/worrytree/\n\nYou're on your own for the first time, this is a lot of responsibility thrust upon someone. As someone that teaches at this level, a lot of us see and understand what you are going through. It's ok to as for help, I promise. Rushing through things bullheadedly will only break you (it did for me, at least!!). \n\nThis could also be a medical issue as well if you find you can't keep up, and your college has a lot of resources for figuring that out, as mine did for me. Sometimes these things don't show themselves until you have to figure life out on your own. \n\nThere's also techniques to study smarter, not harder! The pomodoro technique is often cited, but there's other things like this: https://glean.co/students/ \n\nI was like you once and now I'm finishing my PhD. If you'd like to chat to someone about these things, drop a pm and I might be able to help. I mod r/Adhd_college and have a lot of tools to help get things together, as we especially need them with chronically anxious chaos brains. \n\nYou'll get there, I promise. Academia is a hard road emotionally. You got time. And you have a job, Holy shit, no wonder you're burning out. That's no small feat!!

But this problem is no joke. It sounds like you are under a lot of pressure, which might be causing that low motivation, especially if you are overwhelmed with school. I don't think your poor college performance has anything to do with karma, but rather that you might need to find more effective ways of studying. Have you reached out to any academic resources to help you with the material you are struggling with? Are you taking a large course load each semester? \n\nIt could also be that you're disinterested in what you're doing, in which it's important to remember the bigger picture if being a doctor is truly your goal. What are your reasons for pursuing med school? My classes had tons of premed students (I was bio in undergrad) and many of them were only doing it for their parents or other external factors. I know it is hard to separate from the expectations of others, especially when it comes from family. But also becoming a doctor is NOT easy, and it's unfortunately extremely competitive which means you need self-determination. I'm not saying this path isn't for you, but this is something to consider.\n\nI hope you are taking care of yourself physically and mentally, as this is the most important thing to remember!
