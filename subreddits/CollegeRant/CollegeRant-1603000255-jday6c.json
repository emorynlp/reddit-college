She had said we needed to complete this assignment before Sunday at midnight. She originally said that on Monday, but the assignment never got posted. I even check in the early evening today and never saw the assignment. Worst part is I emailed her Thursday asking where it was since the due date was coming up and she never replied. It was a pretty high point assignment so I\u2019m feeling pretty angry. Some people are asleep at 10:50, how was I supposed to know that\u2019s when she would finally post it, even though it should have been up on Monday?? I\u2019m currently trying very hard to draft a not angry sounding email to ask if I can get a \u201csecond chance\u201d to complete the assignment. I know she\u2019ll say no even though I never even got a first chance to complete it. Sorry for the rant, I just feel like this is really unfair. Any suggestions on how I can convince her to let me make this assignment up would be great. Ps I already tried setting my system clock back to when the assignment wasn\u2019t due, it didn\u2019t work. :(\n\nEdit: Good news guys! She posted the assignment again since a lot of people didn\u2019t get to do it! I just finished it and got an ok score, aside from selecting D from a map with A B C  and D overlaid instead of typing in the country\u2019s name.

If the professor hasn't posted a big assignment  4days ahead of time, email them (which you did). If they don't respond, email again the next day. If two days later they still haven't emailed you back call their phone number provided on the syllabus during their office hours and make sure you leave a message. After that go ham on the emails if you want. You don't have to but you at least have two emails u responded to and can screen shot that you called them and they didn't answer and add all of that into evidence. May seem annoying but I'm that annoying student honestly. I'll send a bunch of emails and ask for meetings like it's nothing if I have to. You're trying to graduate and you're paying a lot of money to do it so if they won't answer timely to politeness go aggressive (in terms of trying to get a hold of them. Make sure the tone is always respectful of course).", "author": "vness1213", "created": 1603019512, "upvotes": 15}, "g96sfq7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jday6c/assignment_posted_at_1050_pm_due_midnight/g96sfq7/", "text": "My advice is that sending emails works most of the time but even if you are intentionally trying to be nice and professional it may not come out like you think it will. I would put in your email that you would like to request a meeting to discuss the assignment. Say something like \"hi prof, I have some questions and concerns about X assignment. Would it be possible to set up a meeting with you to discuss them?\" - note: keep it short, if you write something that's too long, they will stop reading after ~3 sentences. Also save a copy of the email that you originally sent and that wasn't replied to as well as any assignment information you can find (syllabus, assignment guidelines). If it is a really high point assignment and can seriously impact your grade, you may need to take it to the department head so you will need all the evidence you can gather.
