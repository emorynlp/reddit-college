I feel like this constant state of exhaustion is my life. I started school when I was pregnant now I\u2019m 21 with a 2 year old, doing my transfer applications, taking all science courses, and I am T I R E D. I\u2019m doing 15 units of all science classes that are prerequisites for my major. I did not have a summer because I did 13 units. I\u2019m basically a single mom doing everything right now (his dad is in jail so he can\u2019t help me rn). I honestly sometimes get jealous of people who are taking advantage of volunteer opportunities for their major. I wish I could but I can barely function properly with everything I have going on. I\u2019m also terrified no universities will accept me even though I\u2019m applying to about 9 and have 2 private universities as back up. My grandma is super religious so when I was at her house the other day she was talking about how this is the end of times etc and I told her well I hope so and I hope it happens faster because I can\u2019t handle one more chemistry worksheet and my dad started laughing so hard saying \u201cthat was a good one\u201d but I\u2019m being serious\ud83e\udd72 I\u2019m trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel here but all I can see is more homework, exams, and quizzes!", "author": "mxsxc", "created": 1631748543, "retrieved": 1632841047, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"hd0ifhr": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pp1m1d/imploding_sounds_good_right_about_now/hd0ifhr/", "text": "Thank you u/mxsxc for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
