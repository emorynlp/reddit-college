It makes me cringe every time when I see some shitty college ad trying to get people to apply by acting all hip and progressive with shit like \"Hey, we've got the best parties in town!\", and etc. They seem to view the overall consensus of their students to be a bunch of dumb, na\u00efve, money-spending kids with all the free time in the world. While this is sometimes true, the fact that we have educational institutions *enforcing* this behavior is just sickening and incredibly damaging to their futures.\n\nThe whole financial debate is a thing of its own. It's the mentality that really needs to stop imo. I feel like it's a result of college culture in general. \n\n**TLDR**: A very large portion of colleges across the US have little to no respect for their students, and their coy attitude about it isn't helping.", "author": "norman-the-foreman", "created": 1609620623, "retrieved": 1632950231, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 289, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"ghyvzpb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kp5gbo/the_mentality_colleges_have_towards_students_is/ghyvzpb/", "text": "I couldn't agree more.

The people who don't really need to go to college they have inheritance and trust funds and a spot at the multi-million dollar family business to fall back on, but just go because that's what their parents want. The people like Olivia Jade who literally \"don't care about studying and just want to party\"\n\nLike there was one school like that when I was applying. They sent me a decent sized brochure about how awesome their school was. Big name talent coming in for on-campus concerts, an ice skating rink, plenty of student events to keep everyone entertained, therapy dogs for help with stress, a cafeteria to accommodate every diet and food allergy imaginable. You think of it, they probably have it\n\nOf course, going on the academic side of things, it was just ok. Like literally, it wasn't spectacular and on the STEM department, according to students, a good chunk of people end up back home after the first semester because they spent all their time just partying and just flunked out. Not to mention the out-of-state tuition + room and board was way too expensive. Also apparently they had significant issues with basic maintenance (because all the money is going towards useless fun stuff) so many people on the school subreddit were talking about rats and roaches\n\nBut basically that's how the college system works. Lure the students of wealthy parents in with bells and whistle that make the school too expensive for average people that literally need a degree to have a halfway decent life. And with all the money going towards ball pits and paying Chance the Rapper to come do a concert, the parts of campus that won't be on the brochure end up falling apart and departments are severely underfunded\n\nGO CAPTIALISM!", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1609629482, "upvotes": 38}, "ghvd4lg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kp5gbo/the_mentality_colleges_have_towards_students_is/ghvd4lg/", "text": "This is how companies work.
