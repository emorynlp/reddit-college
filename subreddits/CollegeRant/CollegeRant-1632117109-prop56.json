I have one professor that seems to be purposely vague on all of his project descriptions, so we keep having to send him messages. Sometimes he responds, sometimes he doesn't.\n\nIt reminds me of a few of professors I had one semester. I was going out to get laser eye surgery. I was working at the time and I had taken Summer classes so there wasn't really a better time to get it. It was a quiet time of the year for my job, and my pace in the classes was healthy, so I decided \"why not now?\" I looked at our schedule and I was going to miss 1 lab in 2 classes. I asked both of them if I could make up the lab, 1 said yes, the other said no.\n\nBack to the present, I sent in a big assignment 2 minutes late. I look at the syllabus to see what the late policy is (since some professors will excuse a submission that's just a minute or two late... others won't). Buried in a random paragraph, it says \"late assignments will not be accepted\". Now I'm both pissed and panicking, since the reason it was 2 minutes late was because I had to spend extra time uploading. A 98 MB file took 5 minutes to upload to the school's servers. \n\nI know, start earlier, submit earlier. Be a perfect student and this stuff wouldn't happen. The assignment was done well before the deadline, but I spent extra time double-checking everything like an idiot, not realizing that the file was so big that it might actually take a substantial amount of time just to upload.\n\nWhich brings me to the unsavory position of having to email the instructor. I took a screenshot of the loading bar and the time for the message, but I don't know if that makes a difference. I never have any idea what to expect when I have to email a professor, or even ask them a question face-to-face. I might get an answer, I might not. He might grade the assignment, he might not. Who knows? Spin the wheel.\n\nHopefully I'm just overreacting, but there's so little consistency between instructor policies that I just have no idea.", "author": "Net56", "created": 1632117109, "retrieved": 1632840996, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "comments": {"hdk66vs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/prop56/every_time_i_have_to_email_a_professor/hdk66vs/", "text": "Thank you u/Net56 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would reply to you with something like \u201cSorry to see that you were delayed by a technical issue. I will accept the assignment this time. In the future, please try to get things submitted at least an hour ahead of the deadline in the event of technical issues such as this.\u201d To your point, though, it really all depends on the individual as to leniency.\n\nOn the other point about going above the professor\u2019s head, if you do so, it may not work in your favor. You can try escalating to the department chair if the answer is no, but late policies are up to the professor. The chair (and, if you were so inclined to continue escalating, the dean) most likely won\u2019t get involved. Chairs and deans aren\u2019t really professors\u2019 managers in the same sense that you\u2019d have managers at stores and restaurants to whom you can complain if an employee is rude or won\u2019t take your coupon (silly example, I know, but so many nowadays seem to think this is also how higher ed works). They usually cannot force professors to do anything or override a decision unless there was a violation of university policy, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. Hopefully, for your sake, the professor will be lenient and accept it, and there won\u2019t be any perceived need for further action.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1632145269, "upvotes": 5}, "hdkz2vp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/prop56/every_time_i_have_to_email_a_professor/hdkz2vp/", "text": "You have proof that it took longer to upload than expected , if your professor doesn\u2019t accept it for being 2 min late (god forbid) go to the dean and explain your situation.
