Failed my drivers test, and already have annoying group assignments on the 5th week for all the classes . I have had good times of course but I just don't feel the same cheerfulness in me anymore. I entered this course because I had no idea what I wanted to do/study.And,  for some reason I'm being more sensitive about everything lately, how fast time is passing that won't be able to enjoy for long as everyone around me is getting older. I'm also sensitive about this whole change in life and all this work and such even though it's probably not as much as other courses.\n\nI know it can't stay the same forever and I have to grow up but I do miss having weekends and holidays where I don't have to worry about much. \n\nDoesn't mean I'm giving up or anything, just need to blow off a little steam in me..", "author": "AntisocialMeme_Lord", "created": 1621667260, "retrieved": 1632842340, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"gz17ibb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nicya5/just_blowing_off_some_steam/gz17ibb/", "text": "Thank you u/AntisocialMeme_Lord for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
