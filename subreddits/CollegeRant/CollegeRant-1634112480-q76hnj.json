  "text": "I need to ask current students and former students an honest question. Did/ do you feel overwhelmed and loaded with work in an internship? I feel like my current internship is supper tedious / old school and there is no communication between anyone. I am beyond stressed pushing through trying to have this internship for at least a year. However, since I started I feel like time goes by so slow, no one cares I am around unless something last minute pops up or I am behind on work.  I find myself working while in class trying to keep my head above water but it is just making my grades slip. Is quitting a smart move or will this affect my future? Any advice on internships will help.",

      "text": "I think it\u2019s important to consider that basically all internships are tedious. They are meant to be for the newbies coming into the field, doing the busy work no else has time for or wants to do, and experiencing what that workspace is actually like. And this varies between each internship and what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nAlso know that internships are meant as a bridge to your future career goals. So if you want to stop, by all means no one can make that choice but yourself. Think of the experience and QUALITY of that experience that will help make yourself more marketable vs other people.",
