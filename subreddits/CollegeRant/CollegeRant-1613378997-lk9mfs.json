It feels like my writing is never good enough, no matter how hard I try, there's just something missing. Ironically I want to be a paralegal, but legal writing is probably different than dumb college essays... I could just coast, not worry about my grades, but I don't have the privilege of being a C student. I need to maintain a 3.2 GPA to keep one of my scholarships. 4-year college was a mistake. I should've gone into one of those 2-year paralegal programs. I hate this. Especially with online school and stupid deadlines and pressure from my parents... I can't even get a job because I'm too slow and stupid to work and do school at the same time. I just turned in 2 assignments a few hours late late, and I'm just praying the professors aren't too anal about that stuff... I just want to paint and drink all day and go outside and shoot the shit with my friends... And I feel terrible about this because my dad went to law school, however he couldn't use his degree so he ended up with a generic labor job and I need to achieve what he couldn't. He went to fucking LAW SCHOOL and can't even get a 3.2 GPA during my freshman year, and isn't this supposed to be the easiest year? I don't know how people sit and study all day. I suppose I should do that too. \n\n3 more years of this shit. 3 more years of writing. I hate this. I want to transfer to a paralegal program so I can skip this college bullshit but I don't even know if that's possible. I will be emailing my career counselor for this. \n\nI have a friend who's terrible at school, failing every class, probably won't go to college(still in hs) but it seems he has his shit together better than me.

College isn't a scam, it's a tool. And like any tool, there are right ways to use it and wrong ways to use it. You need to achieve what your dad couldn't? What? No you don't? Your dad and his life should in no way affect what you choose to do as a profession. \n\nIt seems you kinda hate writing (if I am wrong, please correct me), so why are you going into a profession that requires a tremendous amount of writing?", "author": null, "created": 1613412743, "upvotes": 5}, "gnk0ex7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lk9mfs/college_really_is_a_scam/gnk0ex7/", "text": "Hi there, as both a practicing paralegal, AND a professor in a paralegal program at a community college, I feel that I am uniquely qualified to comment on your post. \n\nFirst off, if you want to be a paralegal, you need to become very competent at writing, because its literally like 50% of our job - you'll be draft summons, complaints, motions, and a litany of other pleadings, and those documents HAVE to be written well; i.e. informative, persuasive, and factually accurate and cited correctly, just like your college essays. Probably more so, and you wont last long as a paralegal if you submit sub-par work to the attorney that you work for.  \n\nSecondly, you almost certainly CAN transfer from your 4 year college to a 2 year paralegal program, but just be aware, the two year program is going to require a lot of the same prerequisites before you get into the legal classes - i.e. English, math, etc, and for the time being, many of those classes will be online, until we get a good handle on the covid situation.   My classes moved online last year, my students and I both hate it, but as it seems, we're staying virtual for the foreseeable future, unless something changes. \n\nI saw that someone commented and said that you dont have to go to college to be a paralegal - that may or may not be true, depending on your state.  Some states require a certification, some dont.  Also, many law firms require a degree from a ABA (American Bar Association) recognized paralegal program.  \n\nI'm happy to answer any other questions that you might have.", "author": "Tiny_Giant_Robot", "created": 1613411821, "upvotes": 9}, "gnjov2b": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lk9mfs/college_really_is_a_scam/gnjov2b/", "text": "My biggest advice if you stay in college, take one a day week for no homework.

Give yourself time to work and drink and be something other than a student. \n\nIt is a struggle to get though college and I\u2019m one of those who started late. I was never planning to go to college but at asome point I found myself ready to try and I found that it was for me. There are SO many options and career paths and routes to those paths! I HIGHLY encourage asking a career counselor ASAP about changing to a two-year program because, if it\u2019s what you want, that sounds like the most direct path. Be firm and Be direct about questions and concerns to map out how YOU want to do it. Don\u2019t let them try to to steer you because they think they know what is best. I can\u2019t tell you how many times counselors tried to discourage me from my path and at this point I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen to them. \n\nSometimes the kind of break I suggested helps you get your bearings, find your intellectual interests and curiosities and passions.maybe you find you want something totally different. But at least you have time to think without a bunch of academics telling you that \u201cthis is the way it bust\u201d.
