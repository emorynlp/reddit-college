Exhausted.", "text": "I\u2019m in two other 8-week classes, as well. I have to be enrolled in this much so I can transfer on time. I don\u2019t have lectures for two of the classes so I\u2019m legit just reading the digital textbook and taking notes. My eyes burn so badly even though I take breaks & use glasses. I have to read two chapters per week along with other assignments on top of that for history alone and I\u2019ve been trying to get a bit ahead so I can have less assignments to worry about when I visit my grandpa. It takes a full day of driving to get there, so that\u2019s already two days on no work. I\u2019m going to have to fit in time to read/do hw whenever I can there instead of just focusing on spending time with my 99 year old grandpa with worsening dementia. \n\nI know I have a choice and *could* just do nothing while I\u2019m there and let my grades drop, but I\u2019m have anxiety & hate letting people down. I want to do well & show my professors that I care.\ud83d\ude14", "author": "roseyelephant33", "created": 1624119669, "retrieved": 1632842196, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h2c4hk7": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o3jpvv/tying_to_get_ahead_in_my_8week_history_class_so_i/h2c4hk7/", "text": "Thank you u/roseyelephant33 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've noticed that several of my classes so far have allowed it, because they don't ask straight fact questions so much as a combo of fact and interpretation questions. I've had at least one class that utilized documentaries from Films on Demand, which have an option to download the transcripts of the documentaries. \n\n\nMy point is, IF you're allowed to use the text on tests, read through the relevant readings once during the week, and once right before the test. Then, have the digital text open and use the search function in the reading app if you're unsure of anything. This won't work out for you if you don't read and understand the material beforehand though. I just figure it'll save you time and eyestrain on note-taking.\n\n\nSpeaking of eyestrain, look into getting cheap blue-light filter reading glasses from a website like Zenni or whatever. They're amazing.\n\n\nEdit: paragraph spacing", "author": "Daughter_of_Anagolay", "created": 1624150630, "upvotes": 2}, "h2d057l": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o3jpvv/tying_to_get_ahead_in_my_8week_history_class_so_i/h2d057l/", "text": "I agree with eilig.
