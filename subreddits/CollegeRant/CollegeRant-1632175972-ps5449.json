Sept 14, class cancelled after waiting 30 mins after class for him to show. Today sept 20th.. class starts at 8 we get an announcement at 8:15 that class starts at 8:20 today because he\u2019s running late. I give him another 20 mins then I leave. I can\u2019t drop because add drop is over and I don\u2019t want a withdraw on my record.\n\nWhat in the actual fuck is wrong with this stupid mother fucker? How am I supposed to learn if he doesn\u2019t show up to teach?
