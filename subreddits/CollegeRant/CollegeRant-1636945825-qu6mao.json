  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nHi Reddit,\n\nI am currently a junior majoring in microbiology and minoring in music performance. This semester has been the worst one of my life, mentally and academically. I am not even taking any classes in my major, the only science courses I am taking are Organic Chem 2 (with lab) and Biochem. The rest are music classes (and TA'ing for cell biology). Anyway, this semester has been the worst of my college career, both mentally and academically. I have no motivation or drive to do any work. I have random pains in my chest from time to time. I keep forgetting things and I find myself zoning out for minutes at a time. For instance, I have a biochem exam tomorrow but I just gave up on studying because I cannot seem to care about it anymore. I also have an Ochem exam on Thursday that I am nowhere near prepared for. Of course, this not studying leads to me feeling extremely guilty for not caring about my grades and education enough to study.\n\nIt feels like I just cannot catch a break. Whenever I don't have an exam, I either have things to do like grading, practicing my instrument, clubs (I'm an officer for two clubs and in a sorority)... the list could go on. There is always something I feel like I should be doing and I hate that feeling.\n\nI was so determined to have a good school year, but I would be surprised if I ended any of my classes with an A. It is likely that I will have straight Bs for the first time. I would like to go to a good graduate school, and the thought of seeing this horrendous semester makes me even more anxious. Yet the more anxious I get, the less I want to do my work. I just feel terrible because I know many other students (including the ones I see post on here) have much more demanding schedules and seem to do so well... but here I am struggling with my course load.\n\nThis post is all over the place, but I guess I just wanted to rant a little and maybe ask if I am burning out or just lazy. If you made it this far, thank you for reading.",

Maybe plan to take things off your plate for next semester, maybe dont TA, maybe take less than a full courseload. Focus on rest over break. You will be ok.",

I've also been struggling to get the motivation for my classes even though I was so fascinated and motivated to learn before. And you shouldn't feel guilty that you are struggling, we walk our own path and we all live differently. Pain and suffering cannot exactly be compared, it's different for everyone.",

I don't even have time to read or watch netflix and I uninstalled my tiktok account to focus more on classes. I was going to do the same for reddit then I realized that I need to vent every now and then so I came back\n\nI feel like im doing all the boring and stressful adult things but I can't live any of the benefits so my outlook in life is miserable",

For me, I would like to become a research professor and help answer questions about microbio that have long troubled people. Yours is probably different, but I hope that these stressful times don\u2019t make you lose sight of your dreams.\n\nSounds like we both do need a break.",

Go to a party or go to an amusement park with some friends or mini golf or SOMETHING fun. Your brain needs a break from constant stress or things will only get worse. Maybe even a hot bubble bath with some wine would do it, that\u2019s definitely one of my go-to\u2019s for stress relief \ud83d\ude05\n\nI hope you feel better!",
