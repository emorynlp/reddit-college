  "text": "Oh I can\u2019t forget him gaming on my Xbox 10+ hours a day and not letting me play. I had to buy a safe and put it in there so I could play it when I wanted to which wasn\u2019t much. After that he decided to play Fortnite on his phone at 3am with his $299 gamer headphones. Who does that? He then has the audacity after waking me up at 3am during finals wake after yelling after a victory title to deny he was gaming. I literally looked from the top bunk to see him playing to which he responded that he had fallen asleep with his phone on and was sleep talking. He also decided that since my lovely girlfriend brought me cupcakes that he would remove them from my personal fridge to entertain guest and provide food for them. He also thought that I wouldn\u2019t mind loaning my close out to people on my floor , so when I asked where my stuff was I would have to hunt down the people who had my stuff. The cherry on top was when I went to workout with my friend I realized I forgot my blender bottle . I went back and ive gotten good at my door code so I can slap that sucker out Licketty split. So I threw open the door and I\u2019ll I hear is a high pitched anime moan \u201chu ahhhhhhAHHHahhh\u201d to which I responded \u201care you watching hentai?\u201d And he responded \u201cuh no it\u2019s uh sword caster anime\u201d and then sprinted out of the room. This all happened in a 6 month time frame . TL;DR",
