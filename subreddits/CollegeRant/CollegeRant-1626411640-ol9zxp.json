Basically just need to vent. I am in my last semester of my masters program and I have two final classes. These two classes are like capstone classes and I am the only student in my course on canvas for both classes. My teacher is also my faculty mentor. One of these classes I turned in my draft for a paper I have been working on about three weeks ago. The final paper is due on Monday but the syllabus says that the mentor should be the one to let you know if you can submit the final paper/if any revisions to be made. My professor and I also need to have an exit interview. However, I have not heard from my professor at all. I finally emailed her Sunday night (so she could see it Monday morning) letting her know I turned in the assignment. She didn't respond so I tried calling her this morning. (Also I had to look her up using the directory, she does not have a signature in Outlook where most professors have contact info which is odd to me) and she did not pick up. I left a voicemail. I sent her another email and have not heard anything. I wanted to give her time to review the paper but now I feel I should have emailed sooner. I am very nervous, I just really need to graduate. I already told everyone it is my final semester so it will be super embarrassing if this leads to me not graduating this summer. Just wondering how I should proceed if I do not hear back from her tomorrow.", "author": "K_Wil15", "created": 1626411640, "retrieved": 1632949545, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h5dazfe": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ol9zxp/advice_what_should_i_do_if_my_professor_doesnt/h5dazfe/", "text": "That\u2019s really strange and definitely not good news in a graduate level course (well\u2026 any level really). \n\nI would suggest sending an email to your major advisor and letting them know about the issue. They may offer some helpful advice. \n\nOnce upon a time when I was an undergrad, I was the only student in an online class and didn\u2019t even know it. I showed up for the final (it was in person) and the professor wasn\u2019t there. Turns out she completely forgot about the course since I was the only student and I hadn\u2019t emailed her for anything because I didn\u2019t need her help. Is there any chance this professor forgot and doesn\u2019t know who you are? That seems strange but\u2026 maybe?", "author": "bs-scientist", "created": 1626417252, "upvotes": 4}}}
