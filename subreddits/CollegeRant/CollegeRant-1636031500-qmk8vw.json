  "text": "I very much need to rant right now because I find all of this absurd. Sorry for my English as it's not my first language.\n\nThese girls. Oh my God. I'm gonna yell at them one of these days. So I live with 5 other girls, 2 of them are my friends (M and S). The other three (A,Mo and E) are freshmen, while we are well into our third year of university. We got to know each other last year due to us being stuck all day at home because of social distancing so we know eachother pretty well.\n\nThese other three though ... First of all, they got in our apartment before us and completely monopolized the kitchen. Every space is filled with their stuff. We don't go home as often as them, they are here 3 days a week and then get home, so I don't see the point of filling all the kitchen with food that they're not even eating. My friend M and I had to get two little drawers sets to put our food in because the only place left was so high we can't reach it even on our tiptoes.\n\nThen, they don't clean. ANYTHING. Their rooms, I've never heard them use a broom or a vacuum cleaner in two months. Never heard them cleaning their bathroom (mind you all the walls of this apartment are made of paper, so we can hear everything and it is clear they're not cleaning at all. The vacuum cleaner we use is mine, and I know it makes a hell lot of noise when turned on). Never even thought about swiping the floor of the corridor that gets to the bedrooms. They maybe swiped the kitchen floor once. They don't clean the counter not the electric stove after they cook or prepare coffee or milk in the morning. The sink is stinky, and rubbish always piles up in the bins. They don't take out the trash, we always do it because our kitchen smells like a swamp. I got so fed up once, that I cleaned all the kitchen by myself, and it took 2 hours in total.\nYesterday, I was putting my groceries in the fridge, specifically on the shelf of the door, when I noticed my milk had a strange gel-like substance at the bottom. At first, I thought it has leaked and I went to throw it away, moved the ketchup bottle near it and guess what? It was not my milk. The ketchup (whose owner between the three has yet to be found) had expired, leaked on the shelf and got to my milk, which was of course to be thrown away since the ketchup soaked the carton. It had to be there for at least a couple of weeks, if not more. I tried to clean the fridge but it leaked under the shelf and it had solidified, so I just gave up, removed the bottle from the shelf and placed it on the counter. It's been there for 4 days.\n\nThey use plastic cups to drink water from plastic bottles that they leave scattered everywhere. Every inch of the kitchen counter is full of their freaking sh*t. And they expect us to clean for them. I left for a weekend to go and see my parents at home, and when I got back one of them had the audacity to tell me that she found the kitchen dirty and no one had cleaned it. B*tch I didn't use the kitchen that weekend, do I have to clean in for you?\n\nWe never know when they're going home and we risk to get stuck outside the house if we don't have keys because I asked 20 times to make s WhatsApp group, but none of them listens to me. E ALWAYS uses her phone and laptop without headphones, and we can hear it from her room. Even when we have online lessons or we have to study for an exam. She always leaves the door open (even when our other friend, M, is in the room with her) and that room... Oh my gosh, it stinks of feet and sweat because, ladies and gentlemen, this girl DOESN'T USE THE SHOWER, nor she cleans her butt after pooping. My friend had to clean her menstrual blood from the toilet seat because she didn't do it herself.\n\nThey invite friends and boyfriends over, and we don't know if these people are vaxxed or not, they don't use masks and they stay here for hours. They told us their friends live in another dorm and don't have the space for all of them, but I honestly don't give a f*ck. The rules say that NO ONE is allowed inside or they will fine us. I don't want to pay 100\u20ac because of them.\n\nWe talked to them so many times already I'm going insane over this situation. Am I being too tough about this? I have always been brought up by learning how to clean and take care of the house, and my dad is a clean freak so our house is always super clean at home. \nI just can't stand it, especially the not having a clean house.",
