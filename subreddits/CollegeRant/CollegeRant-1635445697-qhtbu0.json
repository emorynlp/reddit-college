  "text": "Ahhhh I have a required class for my major (psychology) and I only missed three classes due to a mixture or transportation issues and one case I just didn\u2019t wake up for it (8 am) her only form of getting points in this class is pop quizzes and role plays not counting the midterm and final. But literally the days I missed we had quizzes. That already dropped my grade with no way of making these back. Then I got Covid pretty bad that made me miss the role play and instead of giving an option to make it up I just gets removed from my grade in general. She didn\u2019t answer 4 of my emails while I was sick and only answered me on the last day. Idk just wanted to rant about this.",
