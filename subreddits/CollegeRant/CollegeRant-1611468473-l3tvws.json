I have two classes labeled as \u201cOnline\u201d, however, I just found out they have optional Zoom meetings and one of them almost overlaps with a \u201cCanvas\u201d class. I understand that the Zoom meetings are optional for the \u201cOnline\u201d classes, but I wished that it was labeled as \u201cCanvas\u201d instead before I registered. I get that it\u2019s not a big deal, who cares if I leave 5-10 minutes early or don\u2019t even bother attending that class, but it\u2019s nice to know this information beforehand, ya know :/ \n\nAnd just for clarification: The \u201cOnline\u201d class ends at the exact same time as a \u201cCanvas\u201d class will start, which is at 12:15 PM\n\n\nTL;DR: Wish that the classes with Zoom meetings, optional or not, listed the time and dates of lectures when registering", "author": "dancinglilypads", "created": 1611468473, "retrieved": 1632842909, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 150, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gki1inq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l3tvws/wished_that_the_classes_with_optional_zoom/gki1inq/", "text": "Thank you u/dancinglilypads for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
