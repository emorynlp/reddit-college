Was I in the wrong here?",

In my experience, they are typically overpaid for the quality and amount of work. It doesn't matter if you have one bachelor's or 12 doctorate's degrees, it's ignorant, unintelligent, and painfully idiotic to suggest that anyone who approaches you should A: already be completely aware of your correct title and B: that they should have some inherent reason to even care about how you chose to spend your time and money.\n\nI dropped out of college to speed up progress in my software dev career, does that mean I should be praised or frowned upon because of that? No, it's the way I chose to take my life and that is my problem and mine alone.",

Like 2 maybe 4 years and much cheaper classes (just because more advanced classes cost more).

      "text": "Yes, you are in the wrong. BUT ONLY FROM AN *ETIQUETTE* STAND POINT.\n\nWhen in doubt, always use the highest title if you are unsure. It is better to give someone too much credit than not nearly enough. While, yes, they do teach, a teacher is very below a professor. Whereas, teachers are not professors. Think of it this way, a senior in high school was once in 3rd grade, but that does not make them a 3rd grader now and it would be very rude to call them such. It's the same here. Teachers are what you call someone teaching 12 graders or lower. \n\nAnyone at the collegiate level is one of these (in order from least to highest academic rank):\nGraduate Student aide, Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor.  As you can see, Professor is the highest academic ranking, whereas teacher is not even on here. Teacher is basically below Graduate Student Aide. Teachers only need a 4 year degree, and since Graduate Student Aide requires you to be in graduate school, they are already at a higher academic rank than a teacher. \n\nSo, while it's okay to accidentally call a teacher a professor, etiquette says calling a professor a teacher is extremely belittling, rude, and ignorant.\n\nThat said, many actual professors will request you just call them by their 1st name because they're not pretentious. Your best bet in the future is just to ask them what you should call them, or incorrectly call them professor accidentally even if they're not, or refer to them how they address themselves in writing.",

If you switch the academian hierarchy to healthcare, teachers are on the same rank as a nurse, whereas a top academician has the same distinction as a highly specialized doctor. \n\nOn a side note, while this professor speaking to OP had every right to be appalled to be called anything less than what they are, I do see their reaction and how they handled making this a teaching point totally rude and wrong. They absolutely could have handled this in a much more professional manner than to lash out at OP and still been able to politely correct the student.",

A full professor has earned tenure so saying teacher or doctor is kinda demoting them in a sense. Tenure is hard to get so when someone becomes a professor in that sense, it's important. Most people don't correct this details because it's not that important, but that's how it works.",

However, I have had 3000-4000 level courses taught by people with grad degrees and 20+ years of experience in the field (mainly technical theatre instructors.) So my advice is to refer to everyone as an instructor/professor unless they refer to themselves as Dr. on their syllabus.",
