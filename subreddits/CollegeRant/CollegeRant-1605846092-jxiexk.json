The 30th. Of this month. 11 days from now. Doesn't matter that we literally haven't had a single break this semester for the first time, doesn't matter that some of us would like to spend time with the little amount of family we get to see, forget about taking a break! Just do this project, where I get to pull my hair out over Thanksgiving break too! \n\nI don't even need this class anymore, since I decided to drop my minor, but I can't withdraw now so I'm STUCK here. I'm about to just fail this whole class, I don't even care anymore.\n\nTldr my professor isn't a human being and has nothing better to do than assign us a giant project due right after Thanksgiving break, basically taking the whole break away.", "author": null, "created": 1605846092, "retrieved": 1632843563, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gcx2kym": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jxiexk/love_thanksgiving/gcx2kym/", "text": "You should organize the class to fuck with the prof", "author": "Jay_Babs", "created": 1605853487, "upvotes": 5}, "gcwyxak": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jxiexk/love_thanksgiving/gcwyxak/", "text": "Ya what is this nonsense?
