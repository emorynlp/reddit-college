The instructor is a very chill guy (let's call him Sam). The student (let's call him Ethan) is currently in his sophomore year and is in a very competitive nursing program (because he cheated the entire freshman year that was online to have a good gpa). All situations occurred in the class with the instructor there.\n\nIn our a&p class, we have to study a question bank of over 400 questions for our first lab exam. Ethan started off with saying \"all the answers \\[to the questions\\] are on quizlet\". Of course, Sam sounded uncomfortable because he did not respond to him, but looked away from him. Sam jokingly says \"I will tell my other students that all the answers are on quizlet\". It is obvious that teachers would never tell their students to cheat. Later on in class, Sam says that \"he hates cheaters\" and \"knows many nurses that were cheaters\". I immediately dislike Ethan because who the heck admits to cheating in front of the teacher! That was just a few weeks ago.\n\nJust a few days ago, we had the first lab exam. A few minutes before the exam started, this dude Ethan boasts about cheating again, but it was more stupid than the first time. He says, \"This was the first in-person exam that I can never cheat on. I cheated on all my other online classes.\" He had this big smile on his face as he was saying it. He was wearing a mask, but you could see the happiness in his eyes and he sounded like he was so proud of himself, just openly confessing that he cheats in school.\n\nTo me, he sounded so ridiculous. I understand that it is hard to not cheat in an online environment and that everyone cheats. But, don't confess it to the world that you are a cheater and make yourself proud of it. That is just so stupid. Not only that, but he is in a nursing program, a very competitive one that only accepts 100 students. Basically, he cheated his way in, which is so disappointing because there are those who studied very hard to get a seat in the program, but it was wasted on him. Knowing that he is a cheater, if I was a patient, I would never want him to be my nurse because I will not trust my life on a cheater like him.\n\ntl;dr: A student confesses that he cheats in his classes and was very proud of cheating in his previous online classes and for this current class (anatomy & physiology). As crazy as it sounds, he then goes onto brag about it in class in front of the instructor.", "author": "No_Investigator9293", "created": 1632516746, "retrieved": 1632840984, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"he4ywjq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pusbs2/student_brags_about_cheating/he4ywjq/", "text": "Thank you u/No_Investigator9293 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if it is infuriating to hear Ethan brag about this kind of stuff, knowing he's taking this spot from someone more deserving, just imagine Ethan in an actual hospital setting.
