They tell you to feel free to contact them if you just want to talk about whatever nd you get misty-eyed as you close out the Zoom meeting\n\n\\#2:  Feeling like you might cry because you managed to make it through this nightmare of a class with the shitty professor that did a terrible job with everything throughout the whole semester. You did not get a chance to bond with your classmates because they shut down the chat to keep everyone \"focused\" and the only reason you managed to scrap by in the class was because of outside free resources that really make you wonder why you paid thousands to sit in a Zoom meeting to watch someone not really explain the course content.\n\nAs you close the Zoom meeting for the last time, you feel yourself smile as you remember that course evaluations are open and you can finally tell the higher-ups what a shitty professor that person is so they'll be replaced with someone competent (they almost never do btw, because the school wants them to do research or whatever so they can say they helped)", "author": "sunnirays", "created": 1607275143, "retrieved": 1632950636, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gezln2c": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k7xpmq/there_are_two_distinct_reactions_to_the_end_of/gezln2c/", "text": "NUMBER 2 IS SO DAMN ACCURATE ITS ACTUALLY FUNNY.\n\nThis is not a joke, this class.... can just not exist (in a very nice sense).
