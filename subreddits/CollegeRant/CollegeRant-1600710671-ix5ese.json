I hate that I\u2019m book-smart and don\u2019t have many other talents. I don\u2019t want to go into a sad corporate job, only to be miserable for the rest of my life. My mom wants me to be a doctor or a nurse. I want to be an artist and a filmmaker.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t care if I\u2019m poor. I would rather live paycheck to paycheck and be happy and travel around the country than work 45-50 hours a week, have all the money in the world, and be miserable. I\u2019ve been unhappy and have been held back from trying things I love for way too long, and I\u2019m sick of it.\n\nThis SAT score is giving my mom more reasons to push me into going to a four year school for the degree she wants me to get. I\u2019m taking art classes at my community college right now, and at this rate, I could graduate with an associates in graphic design and a certificate in film production next year, for only a few thousand dollars. I am only going to community college just to say I went to a college and to learn a little more, but other than that, I don\u2019t want to set foot into another school. \n\nI\u2019ll be an adult next July, and I already have things lined up so that I\u2019ll be moving into a home for broke and troubled young adults that offers therapy and rent for a small price. I\u2019m so tired of being unhappy and forced into this mold of working a 9-5, getting married, having a kid or five, moving to the suburbs, and dying with a load of regrets. \n\ntl;dr: gifted kid burnout wants to become an artist and filmmaker and not attend a four year college much to her mom\u2019s dismay and needs advice on how to get her off my ass", "author": "outfrontsteakhouse", "created": 1600710671, "retrieved": 1632950765, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"g6ar46j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ix5ese/i_dont_want_to_go_to_college/g6ar46j/", "text": "Asian kid here, had to have the awkward talk with my family more than once, can give some advice if you want it. A big part of what my parents were concerned about (and I suspect you mother as well) is your financial security. Stop idealizing the suffering artist so much, it's an unhealthy obsession and I think your mother is quite right to be concerned that you might end up broke and homeless in the name of *\"muh art\"*. My advice? Accept that money can't buy happiness but it can buy you the tools to pursue it. Try finding something that can earn you money while doing what you love like a degree in communication or adverting. You'll be able to apply your love for art and film while learning how to create more meaning in your works. The sooner you can get it through you and your mother's heads that it's ok to sacrifice money for happiness ***without going destitute in the process*** the better. The line I fed my parents was that I know that money is good to have but I also wanted to be happy while earning it, and if it meant sacrificing some money to stay happy then so be it.

Third year I became a music technology student and my grades shot up, I learn invaluable skills in my desired trade and am now doing well because I was passionate about it.  My advice is go to school for film or art if you know you love those things.  You'll be able to be mentored and develop your skill so hopefully you make a career out of doing what you love!
