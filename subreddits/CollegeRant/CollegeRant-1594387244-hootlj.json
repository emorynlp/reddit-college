  "title:": "My School Plans to Reopen and it's Going to End Horribly",
  "text": "Doctors are saying don't reopen. Students are saying don't reopen. Teachers are saying don't reopen. \n\nWhat is my school planning to do? Just that. \n\nThey haven't confirmed it yet, but they've made it very clear they intend to reopen in ~1\u00bd months. \n\nThey are planning to have people check their temp daily, wear face masks, limit gatherings, etc. \n\nHere's my issues:\n\n1) How do people with roommates try and isolate? And if one of them catches it, where the hell are you going to put the other? (Housing is already at capacity in most places) \n\n2) 80% of our school is Greek life. I don't trust for one second that they won't party, and no amount of fines or repercussions will stop them. You could ban Greek life entirely and they'd still find a way to party, and I gurantee you they're not \"social distancing\".\n\n3) The school is providing us one 4oz bottle of hand sanitizer and 2 masks for free, but wants us to pay for the rest. No, not a large expense, but we already knew the wealthy students were going to have an advantage on buying higher quality protection, being able to afford to distance and not have to worry about having a job. This just makes it worse. They also want us to wash our masks after each day. Sorry, most people don't do laundry every 2 days. \n\n4) You can't stop people from travelling. Sure, get rid of our mid-semester break and end before thanksgiving, but that won't stop anyone from travelling on the weekends. Even if they're just going home to say hi to their parents, it's a risk. \n\nI know that this is going to impact the school financially, and as someone who relies on the aid I get from them, I really get why they want to reopen. But it's just not safe. \n\nTl; Dr My school is reopening and it's both unreasonable and unrealistic to assume that all students will do what is needed to make it work.",

I\u2019m honestly worried as well, but I do think it\u2019ll work for my school; we only have around 4,000 students. also, everyone is required to sign a document agreeing to act according to the school\u2019s guidelines. if you are caught not abiding by them, you will likely be sent home. at the end of the day, a lot is still up in the air. I hope everything goes okay for you.",

          "text": "Another huge reason why they can't go 100% online is our government is now saying they will deport any international students who are taking all online classes. At most larger schools in the US that's a pretty significant portion of the student body, and many of those students either can't return home (like there literally are no flights even if they wanted to go home, or their home country isn't safe because of the virus) or if they did return to their home country there's a good chance they wouldn't be able to ever return to the US. Couple that with the number of international students who are part of some kind of research that they have to be here for like working in a lab (most STEM grad programs for example have significantly larger proportions of international students, even to the extent that some of these programs are a majority international students).",

      "text": "What really concerns me is #3. Is your school not going to implement hand sanitizer stations on campus? I know that Georgia public unis are doing that, but I can't speak for other states or schools.\n\nAnd I have no idea how they would address quarantining roommates. At least in my school, all 4 bedroom dorms will only have 2 students living there. It's still on the students to make sure they don't make each other sick inside the dorms.\n\nNeedless to say, I agree with all of your issues you brought up. Fall 2020 is going to be a shitshow.",
