I knew college was going to be expensive and the books were outrageously priced but holy shit do I have a bone to pick with these people. What's with charging almost $300 for textbooks that aren't books??? Almost all of my books came plastic wrapped and three hole punched and I'm expected to go buy a binders for each of these??? How the absolute flying fuck can they charge $300 and not bind the damn book into an actual fucking book? I thought we were supposed to keep these and put these on the shelf later on in our careers. My professor literally told me on the first day of my chemistry class to keep this book because it'll come in handy at times. It's 900 pages of essentially hold punched barely even high gloss paper. This isn't a \"book\" I'd want to keep or be proud to have on the shelf in my office. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive because I'm very frustrated over the cost of school and how much shit I have to print off myself from online resources for classes but holy shit I thought at least I'd get more for my money with the books.", "author": "Parklane390", "created": 1629392375, "retrieved": 1632841601, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h9jxxh5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p7iv4z/textbook_rant/h9jxxh5/", "text": "Thank you u/Parklane390 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
