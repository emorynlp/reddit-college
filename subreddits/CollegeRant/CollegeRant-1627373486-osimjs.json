  "text": "I'm a rising senior right now and I had to take online classes just like everyone else since the pandemic started in March of last year.\n\nI feel really bothered by the lack of social interaction in my classes. For every class, students create and join a Discord server and each one has about half of all the class attendees. The problem is that people rarely ask for help and nobody bothers to form study groups or socialize at all. This even happens in classes of up to 300 students. Even in classes where professors encourage students to meet and talk about the material, absolutely nobody answers and the class feels dead. I contributed a lot to help others and tried talking to people online, but everyone just drifted away or ignored me eventually.\n\nIsn't one point of college to meet people and form a network? No one seems to want to put any effort online, and I'm worried this reflects how students are in real life. (being closed-off from other people) Why am I the only one who thinks this is a problem?",

Before this semester, I actively took on extracurriculars, created study groups, helped teachers, etc. Now, I have too much work to do. Maybe you can mention it in class and they'll be forced to deal with the situation. Just remember that they'll be listening to the one that speaks up. Keep at it, but remain positive.",
