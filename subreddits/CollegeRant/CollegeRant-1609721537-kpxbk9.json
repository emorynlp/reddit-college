I\u2019m now in my 3rd year of biomedical science. I had to repeat the year last year so I\u2019m in my 4th year of college all together. I suffer with poor mental health. I feel as though I\u2019ve overcome the worst of it with a lot of therapy and a hospital admission. But I have to say I feel completely overwhelmed. College is proving really hard I still find motivation a huge issue. Sometimes I just want to fade away. I\u2019m really struggling and I feel like I\u2019m going to fail one of my modules and I can\u2019t face repeating the year again. 6 years to complete a 4 year bachelors. It\u2019s humiliating. I don\u2019t know what to do with my life. A part of me feels like I need the break to continue working on myself but I also don\u2019t want to put my life on hold. I want to be a doctor but I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever make it. I\u2019ve always been above average academically but I thrive when I put the work in. However I feel like I\u2019ve completely lost that drive. I guess I\u2019m hoping to get some advice here. Should I repeat or drop out and try again in a few years?", "author": "fktwine", "created": 1609721537, "retrieved": 1632843456, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 44, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gi254hq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kpxbk9/feeling_like_a_complete_failure/gi254hq/", "text": "First of all, do not feel guilty for taking longer to complete college. This is normal. Adulting is hard. There will be challenges in life, and you shouldn't have to hold yourself to the same standard as let's say a priveledged college kid with rich parents and no mental health issues. You are already facing alot minus the school. You're already on hard mode. It's okay to take a break from school. Again, it's OKAY to take a break from school. Adding the additional stress on top of your mental health will only break you further. Take some time off to focus on your health and find something you genuinely enjoy. Go camping, look at the stars, slow down and try to get perspective. When I'm feeling overwhelmed I think about how insignificantly small we are in the universe. School is not more important than your health and life satisfaction. If you are able to take a semester off, please do. If not, take the minimum amount of credits you need to still stay at school so you didn't waste all the credits and time and money. Please take care of yourself. I know it is really easy to get stuck in this rat race, but it will help tremendously if you slow it down and take some time to enjoy life. Go on a morning walk, watch the sunrise, get some fresh air, listen to the birds, feel the sensations in your body, know that life isn't just about school and work. What's it all for? To exist? Nah. Please listen to me and take my advice. I've been there, spending 8 hours at school, then 6+ hours work and extracurriculars for months on end. It feels incredible to be accomplished and have done so much with the day, but you will hit your breaking point, and I think it will be very soon if you don't take a break. \n\nI thought I wanted to be a doctor until I realized it's 8+ years med school, plus more years of residency, and all the exams and stress. For what? Long work days until you are burnout to the point of suicide. Doctors have some of the highest suicide rates of all professions. It's because there is no quality of life. There is only work. Sure you get a high paying salary, but at what cost? I'm not saying this to discourage you, but to point out that it might not be worth it if you have to sacrifice so so much. There are plenty of other high-paying professions with much less school involved. \n\nIf you only take one thing from this, it would be to find reasons to live before finding motivation to go back to school. Don't be so hard on yourself, college is fucking hard, let alone living with a mental illness.
