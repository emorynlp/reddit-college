i took a lovely page out of my amazing group members book and i signed us up for a time that worked for me since no one else had anything to offer. \n\ni have my own shit to deal with on top of other classes. there\u2019s absolutely no excuse for any of this. if you leave your group members hanging like this, you deserve a special place in hell\u2014especially when 3 out of 4 members are doing it. at least let people know you\u2019re going to slack off. just because it looks like i handle doing an entire challenge/project doesn\u2019t mean you should do this or that i can. i can barely keep my shit together because two of my pets are dying, i\u2019m going through a friendship breakup of 7 years, i\u2019m dealing with this unnecessary bullshit and taking 18 credit hours during a pandemic and online. that\u2019s a tall order for anyone. \n\nso, yeah, i\u2019m snitching because i can\u2019t do this every week. i can hardly do it this week. i can\u2019t wait around by the phone and hope to god someone decides to help me figure out what we\u2019re going to do.\n\ni will note, in my email to my professor, i will offer to do everything (more or less so he\u2019d understand the severity of my distrust and lack of faith in them), but ultimately i will leave it up to him to tell me if he wants me to complete the entire challenge or if he wants to deal with it. \n\ni just. i honestly cannot believe i am in a class filled with juniors, seniors and graduate students and this is how we are going to behave. who does that? who actually does this shit during a time when everyone is struggling with being online for school among many other things. i thought this stopped happening in... third grade? \n\nit would be one thing if it was just one person who decided they weren\u2019t going to participate. *but all three?* leaving me to be the only one to do any of this? nah. i\u2019ve lost every ounce of respect for every single person in this group. like i said, at least have the damn decency to let people know if you\u2019re busy or are simply just not going to do anything.\n\n**update:**\n\nso, good news (kinda lol). two group members did end up showing up in the documents. i did about 60% of the work, they did, well, the rest. i\u2019m really not sure what the other contributed outside of talking to me (which is honestly a big step. \n\nthe third member, on the other hand, didn\u2019t come back until 8PM... when everything was nearly done. their excuse for being absent for multiple days? they \u201chad something to do\u201d. that\u2019s it. they. had. something. to. do. \n\ni did email the professor around five. i waited about nine hours for them to do something. nothing was done by then so i did it. i have my professor a very basic explanation of what happened. then i basically told him i was only saying something because i genuinely believe  it will be a prevailing issue. even now, i still believe that. i told him i\u2019ve handled it for now by setting a boundary with them. i explained that i let them know how much i would do and when i would stop. i\u2019d be available for help but its not my responsibility to do everything. i remained gender neutral and didn\u2019t tell on anyone specifically\u2014which i am glad about since some at least kind of helped. nothing is forgiven because at the end of the day they still waited until today to make any sort of effort. i do appreciate they didn\u2019t leave me hanging.", "author": "analieserae", "created": 1612104995, "retrieved": 1632842866, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"glhfnhp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l9dsq1/im_a_junior_in_college_and_im_really_going_to/glhfnhp/", "text": "Thank you u/analieserae for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I jus refinished a project with a partner where we were supposed to split the work. I ended up doing a majority of it. Partially has to redo what he did because it was wrong. I'm pretty sure the part he did is why we ended up with a C. Not saying my portion was perfect (it was a rough ass class lol) but up until like, the day before it was due he was still asking questions about what to do. I know it was confusing but with projects you just have to sit down and do it and I've found some people get so wrapped up in how much time it's gonna take they end up procrastinating because they feel like they don't have any time for it. I hope youve attached your texts and emails to your professor. It definitely helps. I did my project because it was designed that originally one person could do it. I just thought having a partner who had strengths in areas I didn't would help. Your project is designed for 4 people. That's total bullshit. But I will admit, doing everything yourself wastes a lot less time than depending on people who aren't reliable. I'm sorry for your situation. Hopefully things can get resolved.
