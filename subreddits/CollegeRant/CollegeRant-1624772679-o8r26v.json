I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t go anymore. That is like the only reason I can take from the pandemic I felt good other than that no. The teacher was nice but the class not, we had to dance and I hate dancing, I\u2019m a Sports Major which I found it useless to do dancing, not that dancing is not a sport but I\u2019m going to a field that has nothing to do with dancing. I remember that before spring break, the teacher told us that we were going to dance and she was going to pair us up with classmates after spring break also we had to do a presentation and I\u2019m glad that didn\u2019t happen.", "author": "Rodrigo9811", "created": 1624772679, "retrieved": 1632949643, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
