Online classes are fucking horrible, I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything but simply trying to complete assignments. On top of that I was late to sign up for classes ( literally a week before) because of problems the college was having with my application so I got shitty ass teachers that honestly have the biggest egos in the world and will lash out at you for asking a simple question. I tried my fucking best this semester, I pulled all nighters and I tried to manage my time the best I could and I\u2019m probably gonna end up with a 3.2 gpa but I wanted to do better. The amount of times I\u2019ve actually cried over this shit is insane, and I never cry. Same goes for eating, I haven\u2019t had a proper meal in the past two weeks because I\u2019m stressed as fuck. I feel like a failure somehow and it\u2019s honestly annoying ass hell.", "author": "thatonehispaniccgurl", "created": 1607323326, "retrieved": 1632951763, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gf0ss67": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k8biu3/shitty_ass_semester/gf0ss67/", "text": "3.2 is admirable in these trying times.
