  "text": "Okay, I am in need of advice because I am annoyed and frustrated.\n\nI am in my last year of college and I attend a small campus. I am social but I like to keep to myself and I like my space! This semester I met a guy who is a year younger in two of my classes. He seemed to have a crush on me from the moment that he met me. The second week of classes he said his class got canceled and asked if he could hang out with me knowing I have a two-hour break before our next class together. I said yes and I made sure to mention my boyfriend to make sure he did not create any ideas in his head to pursue me. When I mentioned my boyfriend very casually, I could tell he was not expecting that? and it was really awkward because he was silent for a second so I had to say something else to get rid of the silence and I pretended I did not notice how disappointed he was. He proceeded to snap out of it and play it off and later on I am not sure why we ended up on the subject but he shared a sad story of a girl he asked to prom, and how he gave her real Gucci earrings and a sign saying something along the lines of \"it would be Gucci if you came to prom with me\" and the girl said yes, and later on she said no because she had promised her friends to go with them and not with a date and he mentioned how she never returned the earrings. I am telling this story to give you as much perspective on this dude. I felt sorry for him but he seemed to have believed the girl and that just threw me off, how blind can you be to not understand what she did?\n\nBy this point, he had already asked to be in my teams for both classes that we shared and I had said yes. The following two classes he seemed extremely distant and I even felt like he was trying to avoid me. I am guessing he was coping with the fact that I am taken? No idea. He then seemed to be back to normal and interested in being around me more. Here is where it gets annoying. At this point, he knew everything about my schedule and the places I frequent on campus. After our first class, I go workout at the gym or I go eat at the cafeteria. He started off by walking me to the cafeteria or the gym even though that's completely out of his way. Later on, he started magically bumping into me after my workout or after I was done at the cafeteria and he plays it off by saying \"oh I was just walking this way..\" It would make me cringe too bad if I confronted him saying what do you mean? your class is not this way?\n\nLater on, he also started walking in the same direction after our last class. It was completely opposite from the way he would walk. In the beginning, it was OK but then it started getting to be too much for me. How can I tell him I do not appreciate his company and small talk. Recently, he picked two classes with me for next semester already and he is hinting that we will be in projects for those classes again. That's where I started to get so frustrated because I just want to get rid of him and I really want my space. I am really smart and I am great to be in projects with but I can tell he still has a crush on me. I used to think he was intelligent so I did not mind him but I have come to realize with every idea I come up with and every time I am sharing input about our projects he just stares and nods and sometimes stares at my mouth. He also tells me when I have an eyelash on my cheek. He also has no personality, he tries to be sociable with other classmates and maybe he plays it off but he is just a compulsive person. He says things like \"I would have been so upset if we were not the best team\" things like that and so far my team and my ideas have given him the satisfaction to be the best in every class. \n\nI have another friend who also shares the same classes with me and I do appreciate his company, he is more intellectual and normal. He got the hint faster than the other guy about me being in a relationship.  He and I were talking recently because I saw him at the cafeteria decided to eat with him to vent and he was under the impression that the other guy that won't leave my side and I were super close friends. I explained the situation and he said he would try to walk me when he can so I don't have to be alone with the other guy as much. We left the cafeteria and guess who was walking towards us. The guy that will not leave me alone. He was super creeped out that he always seemed to know where I am even when he does not walk me after class.\n\nI do not like any of the two guys enough to keep a friendship in which we do anything else outside of school but I am thinking I could use my other classmate to avoid talking to the other guy and keep going to the restroom right after every class. Another thing that seemed to annoy me was that the first time I ever avoided him by using the restroom he stood there and was about to say \"oh its okay I can wait for you\" but before he could finish I said \"Alright byeeee\" so he never waits for me if I go to the restroom after class.\n\nIt is annoying but I cannot be mean to him because I need to keep him content so we can finish our final projects without any issues. It is so frustrating to be surrounded by people who do not understand body language, personal space and who are simply not reasonable.\n\nI need some advice please I cannot stand him, he is so random and says some shit that just leaves me confused because he is so weird sometimes. I need advice on how to handle him this semester because my temper is running out and I do not want to be rude and advice for next semester because it will be the exact same schedule all over again. This is my last year but I am still not up for this bullshit. He walks me three times throughout the day and also I think it benefits him somehow and makes him appear more normal to be seen with me and pretend we are cool when we are not cool I am just polite. I say this because some other dudes in our class started to be more receptive to conversations with him in our second class but I could just be making assumptions.\n\nHelp",

      "text": "I don't know the guy, but you got to chill out a little bit. I think of myself as a socially awkward person, I am in a long term relationship and I don't go out chasing people like this, but I understand the struggle of finding and keeping friends. You should maybe try to understand more what's going on his life instead of being frustrated at him and thinking he's obsessed with you. If you really want to get rid of him, you should maybe introduce him to other people, people he will potentially like, and just fade away. Chances are that you're his only friend and you being polite doesn't help at all because he will feel betrayed in the long run when you leave him at the end of the semester. When I was very young I was in this situation with a girl classmate (I'm F20 btw) and it didn't end up well and I somehow regretted not being understanding of her situation. \n\nYour idea of not hanging out alone with him is great. Gradually start ignoring him and maybe introduce him to new people, that's my advice. \n\nAgain, I'm just a random person on reddit giving my idea based off your post and your tone, maybe the guy is like weird in a super creepy way (kind of like Joe from \"You\" lmao) in which case I don't know what to say...But he sounds goofy so I don't think so.",

I appreciate your perspective about trying to sympathize with whatever is going on in his life.. I did not have that in mind. I will just try to avoid him by going to the restroom every time after my classes and be less talkative when he talks to me.",

      "text": "this guy sounds like such a weirdo and I am so sorry you are going through this!! I don\u2019t have much advice besides try avoiding him as much as you can, mentioning how much you love your bf, having that other guy around so you\u2019re not alone with him, etc. Just keep dropping hints and if he still doesn\u2019t stop (which honestly I don\u2019t think he will- guys like him don\u2019t understand no or are dense af) be upfront and just politely say you need space sometimes and stuff. You will literally feel the weight lift off your shoulders. Remember that you\u2019re not obligated to be his friend and that you shouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this; your own mental health is so important. Just be nice about it if you say anything and if he flips out then that\u2019s his problem and telling of his own character, not yours",

This is all a learning experience and I am sure it won\u2019t be my last time dealing people like this so I am glad I get to figure it out in college first",
