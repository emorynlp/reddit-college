Initially I was pretty pissed. There was seemingly no cosmetic damage but a few minutes later the computer froze, after 10ish minutes I had to force restart bc nothing was functioning. And now it smells like something is burning around the middle on the top edge of the laptop. Additionally the kickstand jiggles and the left side is significantly weaker than the right side. \nI didn\u2019t say anything in class bc I was frustrated and didn\u2019t want to be that kid that was inspecting every inch of my computer. Is this worth bringing up to anyone? It\u2019s tough because I feel like there is no visual damage but I don\u2019t want this to be the cause of issues later in the future.

It's fuzzy what the court would say but since you have a detachable keyboard that seems to have just fallen off easily. Unless it was a very unreasonable action of your lab partner it seems like just your fault. I would talk to your lab partner and explain your situation, take it to repair, get a diagnostic ask if they can help pay half. They are totally within right to decline. Next I would bitch to the kickstand people. Next I would bitch to Microsoft. Next I would bitch to the school and see what they can do.", "author": "peepeepoopoobutler", "created": 1632378188, "upvotes": 0}, "hdxijt9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ptnsk8/lab_assistant_knocked_computer_off_desk/hdxijt9/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1632373880, "upvotes": -4}}}
