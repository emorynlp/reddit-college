  "title:": "when and why did slader have a paywall",
  "text": "for literal YEARS this site has been free to use and community driven and now this website has developed a paywall? i dont understand the reason for it if their ads just go through an adblock i'd much rather be forced to turn off my adblock (which i did do for the site) than to pay a subscription fee. Slader having a paywall now makes it the worst college help site because others such as chegg have different resources to help you and this site literally profits off of free work. i cant wrap my head around this.",
