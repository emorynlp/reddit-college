  "text": "MyMathLab has been really helpful in teaching me the problems I need to do on my exams but sometimes I wonder if there is an issue with it. For example, a question might ask you to submit your final answer rounded to two or three decimal places and when you do it correctly, it counts it as wrong. Then you have to do it THEIR way to be counted as right. Maybe I just suck at rounding numbers but I end up confused as to whether to round up, down, or keep the answer the same.\n\ntl;dr: Does anyone else have issues with MyMathLab when it comes to submitting answers ",

      "text": "MML is really finicky. Hopefully all profs give endless attempts before due date. Whenever I\u2019m not sure how to input I\u2019ll put in something like \u201czzxxzzxxsss\u201d and press enter until the prompt shows me it was wrong and what it was supposed to be.\n\nOne thing I can\u2019t stand about MML is the inconsistency across classes. For instance, in my last math class if I was asked for an x-intercept it would have to be something like (4,0); in the class I\u2019m in right now if it asks for x-int it\u2019s simply 4. I lost points on a test because of that. Irritating.",
