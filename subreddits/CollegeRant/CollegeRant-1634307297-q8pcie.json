I got involved as much as I could this year and have been trying new things and joining new organizations every month. I probably wouldn't be alive right now if my school didn't go back in person..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: also my degree is interactive design so I'm adjacent to the CS majors and spend a lot of time hanging out with them. I think all of the CS students I know agree that in person is better. But we also do a lot of hands on projects like with robotics and we run several on campus organizations, so missing out on all of that over the past year wasn't fun for any of them.",
