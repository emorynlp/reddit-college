I think all of the CS students I know agree that in person is better.

That leaves a lot of options for where I go to school! But when you specifically name them, that narrows it down it quite a bit! \n\nImplying that people in Alabama are too dumb to serve you a McDonald\u2019s hamburger is classist, point blank. There are stupid people everywhere. \n\nForgive me, but what point are you trying to make exactly? Why are you arguing with me over the climate of coronavirus at my university? Why do you seem mad that we have it under control despite having low vaccination rates? Please explain.\n\nBetter educated parts of the \u201ccountry world\u201d? Lol.",

Presumably, the 4 students who have reported having covid are quarantining, so I shouldn\u2019t come into contact with them. So again, I likely will not get covid at school at this point in time. When I say that, I\u2019m not referring to any other semester or in the future. But RIGHT NOW, TODAY, my chances of contracting the virus at school are incredibly low. Maybe if more people were vaccinated, no one would have it? Who am I to say? I\u2019m no professional. \n\nSo yes, that is me.",
