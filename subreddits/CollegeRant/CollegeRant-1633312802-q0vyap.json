  "title:": "Taking 6 courses(27 credits) per semester",
  "text": "I'm taking 6 courses per semester at college. This course schedule is not modifiable which means you cannot decide how many courses you want to take per semester. My school is notoriously known for this(extremely fast paced and difficult) in my province. This school expects everyone to learn really fast and do all the assignments and labs in time. 75% of people at least fail one course after they enter this two-year full time program. I'm on my third term and I'm burning out. Life is so cruel.",

          "text": "It's just diploma even though it takes about 120+ credits to graduate from two year program. what's worse, only half of the credits will be accepted if I tried to transfer into University.  I also didn't mention that there is a vacation team project each summer(2 months, 8 credits)..\n\nDespite of all these, a lot of people choose this school because they can learn what they need to know for getting a job in a short amount of time. Our school has huge resources and always communicate with working industry experts to plan classes. idk what to say but our school has some name value. \n\nRegardless, it's like a living hell like you described.",

Are these different than the credits in the us? Bc I spend abt 12 hrs/ week for 4 credits so I don\u2019t understand how all of that would even give you time to sleep.",
