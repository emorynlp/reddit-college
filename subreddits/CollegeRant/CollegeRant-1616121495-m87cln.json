Genuinely curious because I think I've done this. Your suggestion is to make smaller questions that are worth less but include more of them.

The only other comment I'll make is that grading exams is hard. The more questions the harder it is to grade. It's also hard to create questions. Still i think I can strike a balance between number of questions, pertial credit and the time it takes me to grade to make it easier for the students while still providing a way for me to assess how well the students understand the material.", "author": "familyofgorillas", "created": 1616150600, "upvotes": 45}, "grgpylt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m87cln/stop_making_mid_terms_4_questions_long/grgpylt/", "text": "I had one with 6 questions. 3/6 were only worth 1point. 1 point out of 42.
