Can\u2019t see friends either cuz covid and we\u2019re busy with work/school. I could be making new friends but I can\u2019t.

It may not be my place to say, but I've completely turned a 180, and lost all motivation to do anything. I've wasted it binging hours of TV shows and movies, and barely doing any assignments, so I've already set myself up to fail this semester. =/ Not sure how to come back from it when my exams are in 5 days and I got nothing to prepare for it.
