I have been in the same boat, and even now just taking two online summer courses is making me burnout again. What I recommend is avoid doing work or studying at home, the library is the way to go. Throw on some headphones listen to classical music/Lofi music. It takes time and patience. Write down your strengths and weaknesses. Like I used to hate using agendas, now I\u2019ve gotten better at it, and I also tend to make lists with the most important tasks on top to the less important tasks on the bottom. Make those lists realistic and short. It\u2019ll make you feel a bit less overwhelmed. But all we can do is take it day by day.
