I\u2019m a junior and before the pandemic I never had to do introductions. Even my in-person 300 level stats course wants us to upload a picture of ourselves and describes ourselves. It\u2019s kind of strange to me especially since there\u2019s 200 people in this class and it\u2019s not my major. Maybe the professor actually cares and wants to get to know us but it\u2019s strange to me because the last time I was in person my professors did not care at all. \n\n\nAlso, I hope they don\u2019t continue with online discussions because it was never helpful; it was not a real discussion. It\u2019s just a waste of time IMO.", "author": "denver_rose", "created": 1631033240, "retrieved": 1632948693, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hc9vxnb": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pjqvc7/making_inperson_classes_do_online_introduction_is/hc9vxnb/", "text": "Also what\u2019s with having us do weekly online discussions when before we could just hmm idk TALK IN FUCKING CLASS", "author": "AyyyLmao117", "created": 1631248288, "upvotes": 3}, "hc0v6gg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pjqvc7/making_inperson_classes_do_online_introduction_is/hc0v6gg/", "text": "If I only knew then what I know now, I would have made a generic template for each class.", "author": "fractaldesigner", "created": 1631076673, "upvotes": 5}}}
