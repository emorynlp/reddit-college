  "text": "Why do some profs have zero compassion towards students??!! Do they not realize how much bullshit they are asking for??!! What's the point of writing something that long just to get a grade with zero feedback??!!\n\nEdit: it's for my International Business Finance class and we have to do a report about a company, however, the requirements he is asking for on this paper don't allow us to do 10 pages. It's also the prof's fault to not specify more what he expects us to do.",

Sometimes the prof sticks in that \"syllabus is subject to change\" but when it's that crazy of an assignment,, the students need ample time to finish it at least! it also technically depends on the policies of the school. regardless, I hope that op has had enough time to finish the assignment. it sounds brutal! and good luck to you as well if you're dealing with finals rn :)\n\nedit: just saw the edit on the original post lololol. everything is situational! I think if a Prof is being unreasonable, the student has every right to try and fight against that",

This is not an unreasonable expectation for this level of education.\n\nEDIT: typo.",

It\u2019s just hard to tell.\n\nAlso, wanting to challenge students has nothing to do with compassion.
