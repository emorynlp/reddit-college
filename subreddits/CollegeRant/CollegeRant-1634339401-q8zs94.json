I just, it feels like one thing after another after another, and things keep getting worse and worse and worse, like what the actual fuck am I supposed to do anymore? Everything just feels like it\u2019s collapsing and I\u2019m slowly going inwards. Life just feels like shit and I honestly feel like a bad person for feeling that way and not just pushing forward but damn I really just wanna collapse or something",

      "text": "I'm so sorry to hear that about your grandfather, and to top it off I can totally relate to getting your ass kicked by school. Anybody who wants to succeed in college ends up taking a hit but damn, these fkn classes like, and these fkn tests tho it can just all be too much to handle at one point like how tf are we even supposed to process all of this? One thing I've learned throughout college is that it feels like you're in a bubble. Just like back in high school where everything was, well, high school. But in college, it still feels like you're in a bubble where everyone is suffering from school but, guess what, life is still happening outside and shit is still going down. Like with your grandfather, these terrible things happen and wtf are we supposed to do, brush it off? Tf? And also school is a pain in the fkn ass and the ppl in college can be a pain in the ass as well. I hate accepting the fact that oh this is just life, but I never thought it would feel so unfair.\n\nFor you, I think one thing you can do is try to find a support system wherever with whomever it may be, even if it's on Reddit tbh. That, and just know that you're not alone",

              "text": "So, a support system is just anyone, or group of people, who will be there for you in times like the one you're having rn. I think the first step would be making an appointment with an on-campus counselor. I think they'll point you in the right direction plus they can be someone you can talk to as well! That's just my opinion, but you could also look and see if there's a campus-affiliated organization that acts as a support group where students help each other. I know at some universities, and at my university, they have that available",
