  "text": "I went to community college and worked for 3 years in order to sort out my financial situation and to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. During that time, I've saved up enough money to attend university for a year without working. \n \nI expected to spend a semester, maybe a full year acclimating myself to the new environment, so I'm currently unemployed (Well, I'm a research assistant at the moment, but the hours and pay are so meager that it virtually doesn't matter).\n\nI made the decision to spend a lot of time writing scholarship essays, as they would allow me to focus on school without having to worry about my financial situation. If I have to work a job on top of a Chemistry degree, there's no way my grades won't be impacted, and I likely won't be able to get any more research experience. \n \nBut the school I attend is very stingy with internal scholarships. Hell, I was supposed to recieve a transfer scholarship due to an honors society I was in. This scholarship was stated as being guaranteed for any transfer student within this group, meeting certain criteria. I was more than qualified, and yet didn't recieve it. The majority of scholarships go to out of state students. As for the rest, well I haven't seen a single scholarship opportunity for the hard sciences. Technically there are departmental scholarships, but I haven't been able to find a single instance of an undergraduate actually winning one in the Chemistry department. \n \nAdditionally, I've looked for local/state/regional scholarships to no avail. So the only options remaining are national scholarships. And I'm not nearly smart, special, sociable, or pitiful enough to win any of those. I've signed up for about 16 of them, no dice. There are more I need to write essays for, but by this point my motivation is shot. \n \nAhh, I don't know what to do. I suppose worst case scenario, I go back to working minimum wage for a while and save up enough money to try again. But fuck man, I just want my degree. \n \nTL;DR I'm broke, scholarships are sparse.",

In high school they pushed and pushed scholarship application, but I\u2019m a normal person of average intelligence from an okay family who fed and clothed me and had no extracurriculars or volunteering due to several factors out of my hands, so there was nothing for me. \n\nAlso, back when I was applying, I found that most National scholarships are for incoming *freshman.* It was hard to find ones later for the rest of college.",
