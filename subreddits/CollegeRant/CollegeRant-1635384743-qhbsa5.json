  "text": "My main motivation for college was to have a better life with my ex.. It's also why it took me so long to become a junior.. We were together for 6 years and now I just barely know how to get my shit together. I'm making decent grades, but not the best and they could be better. I'm also not working. My discipline is gone.. the fire that made me care so much about finishing my education..  There's no time for me to work so my money is depreciating, & my courses are extremely demanding right now too. I just want to stop and say fuck it!! But I don't want to be a bum with college debt lmao. Help.\n\nWhat do y'all do when you start to loose motivation?",

      "text": "I focused on what I liked, which was friends & clubs. Doing work in them really helped me feel good about myself & like I was doing productive work even if not academic work. \n\nDropped courses to save GPA/invest more time in the ones I thought I could pass. \n\nInternships in the past have shown me I like my intended career as much as I could like work. I know I need a degree to get into it & that a couple sucky years or even just finishing a terrible semester is short compared to years or decades of a better career.",

      "text": "Best thing to do is ask yourself these questions:\n1. What do I care about? What matters to me about this experience?\n2. What about college has benefitted me and can continue to benefit me in the future?\n3. What are my goals? What do I want to accomplish?\n4. What steps do I need to take in order to achieve my goals? What must I do, and what must I not do? What kinds of actions or methods will help me reach my dreams?\n\nWrite it all down. Make a weekly work checklist. Get excited about your tasks. Remember that everything you learn is crucial to the betterment of who you are as a person. Find your passions, and get to work on accomplishing your missions.",
