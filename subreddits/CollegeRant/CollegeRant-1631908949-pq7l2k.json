The only reason why I'm still in college is because she'd never let me see light again if I send those papers.\n\n\nI love her, but I can't wait to move out and have a new identity. Where no one can tell me what to do anymore. Where no one has the fucking authority to criticise me. Boss me around. All my life I've been told to do this and that, people always giving me opinions I don't fucking need. I don't get it, I didn't ask for an opinion so why give it if it's gonna be against me and what I do with my life. I wanna do what I wanna do with MY body and life, so just shut the fuck up. \n\n\nI'm skipping class like crazy so idk man. I don't even know if I'd pass a single module this semester. I hate the education system. I just hate being in a system. I feel all this hate in my soul is gonna make me do some crazy shit someday", "author": "okbokchoy", "created": 1631908949, "retrieved": 1632841021, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hd8xgfd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pq7l2k/i_cant_tell_being_weighed_down_to_stay_in_college/hd8xgfd/", "text": "Thank you u/okbokchoy for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
