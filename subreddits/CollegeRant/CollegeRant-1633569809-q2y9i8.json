  "text": "So I\u2019m a senior in my last semester going to graduate in December and you\u2019d think that would be enough to motivate me to push through just 2 more months but my motivation is at an all time low. I realized I just don\u2019t give a fuck about my major or any of my classes, and they are honestly all complete bullshit. My professors hardly do shit but assign readings, videos to watch, and write endless discussion posts and replies, and papers. This is about all I\u2019ve done for the past year and a half when my school went virtual, and is still continuing even though I\u2019m back in person (hybrid). I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve even learned anything substantial at all. Plus on top of all the work I have to do I have an internship that\u2019s required for my major and a senior thesis to write by the end of the semester. At this point I am completely uninterested in my schoolwork that I can\u2019t even bring myself to do it. But I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll blow it by doing poorly in my classes this semester and not graduating. I don\u2019t even really know how I got this far and I just can\u2019t seem to find the motivation. It feels like I\u2019ve just completely run out of steam. Anyone else dealing with this??",
