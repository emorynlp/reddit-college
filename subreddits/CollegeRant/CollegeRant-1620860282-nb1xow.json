It was assigned to us around a week ago and at least 1-2 people essentially did what the topic is that we CHOSE. We\u2019re doing it on Google slides for all of us to have access to before we record it. Not including the title slide, we have 3 slides, and 3 of which I worked on. We tried to meet but it never happened. I know we all have different schedules, but they know this grade is important. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to work on it today. I even tried to message my group to see if there was anything they wanted me to put in. Didn\u2019t get a response until 20 minutes later when I\u2019m doing something else. The project is due today.", "author": "Best_Bisexual", "created": 1620860282, "retrieved": 1632842492, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gxwvwk6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nb1xow/i_hate_having_a_final_grade_being_a_group_project/gxwvwk6/", "text": "Thank you u/Best_Bisexual for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
