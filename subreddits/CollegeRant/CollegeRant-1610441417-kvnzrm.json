  "text": "I live in the US and college was completely online last semester. I thought I could handle it but I ended up being incredibly anxious all the time, losing a lot of weight, and becoming burnt out.\n\nI\u2019ve been on break for the past month and next semester of class starts in a week. I am taking more difficult classes plus an internship for credit.\n\nI am so anxious about next semester. It\u2019s all I can ever think about. I know I\u2019m going to be overwhelmed. And what makes it worse is that my therapist is taking leave for 6 months so I\u2019m not going to have her to help me.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling so hopeless and I can\u2019t stop crying because all I can think about is how stressed out I\u2019m going to be next semester. I can\u2019t think of 1 positive thing about it. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

Definitely reach out for help when it\u2019s needed, both mentally and academically. \nOne thing I would suggest: enjoy your college life more and don\u2019t rush graduation (if the situation allows). Mental health is not a joke, and I don\u2019t think it worth it to stress yourself out that much.",

I'm about to start my second semester, my courses are supposed to get tougher, I failed a few last semester that I have to retake and I'm scared as hell. Regarding the therapist, a lot of colleges in the US have free Healthcare for students, including mental health. If your school has that, yoy should take advantage of it because you're paying for it! Things really suck this year, but we'll get through it. Try to stay in contact with at least some people. If you don't have people you feel able to stay in contact with, my PM's are open. We can be there for each other even though I don't know anything else about you and you don't know anything about me. I hope this semester can be better than the last for both of us.",

      "text": "The anxiety and burnout are REAL. I thought I was going to have a breeze last semester and oh boy was I wrong. I\u2019m taking more and harder classes this semester as well. Please don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019re alone. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is something my therapist and I discussed a little while ago: try not to stress about the stress. Sounds counterproductive, right? Let me explain. When we go through the stress of something before it happens, then go through the stress of it when it actually happens, we\u2019re just going through the situation twice. Therefore, we start the situation (this semester) with burnout, because all our energy went into stressing about it before it even happens. \n\nThe beginning of the semester is something that is out of our control right now, so let\u2019s think of some things that are in our control! :) \n\nWhat I like to do is SKIM through the syllabi and write down what assignments are due when and separate it by class. I do this on a laptop so I can delete the task when it\u2019s done and it doesn\u2019t look messy. This can help get out of the \u201ceverything is whirling around me and I\u2019m in the middle of a tornado\u201d feeling. If there are any assignments that you can start now, feel free to start, usually, no-lecture-based classes will have opportunities for this. If not, email your professors to introduce yourself! Getting started on the task early may help with the anxiety a little bit and make you feel more in control. \n\nIf you have a white board, you can organize what you need to do per day for ONE week at a time to be prepared. Usually anxiety leads to procrastination and a bigger burnout. We don\u2019t want that. Remember to chop those textbook readings up! Don\u2019t write \u201cchapter 1\u201d 6 days in a row, write down \u201cpages 1-7\u201d Monday, \u201cpages 8-15\u201d Tuesday. You may look at it and think \u201c7 pages? That\u2019s not bad!\u201d \n\nAnother thing you can do is make sure your place of studying is set up nicely. Have your laptop and chargers set up, make sure you have paper, pencils, all the colored pens in the world if you please. Candles and plants for calming purposes, snacks and water for mindless multitasking. I have a nose-shaped-sharpener-gag-gift thing for comedic purposes. \n\nOverall, know that what you are feeling is valid. Don\u2019t hate on your anxiety, your anxiety is trying to protect you from burnout, but it\u2019s protecting you a little bit too much. Anxiety is a fight or flight response and it\u2019s choosing flight. With doing some of the above tasks, you can lean into fight. Alongside, when we are anxious we take short breaths, tricking our bodies into thinking there\u2019s an actual danger. It\u2019s all a loop. To break it, you could try to take some deep box breaths and relaxing one muscle group at a time (especially forehead, jaws, shoulders and butt). That way we are telling our bodies that there is no threat. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that your professors are there for you. They are going through the same weird situation as you. If you\u2019re comfortable, reach out to them and let them know what\u2019s going on. They may be able to relax some deadlines. If not, go to your student center and they can help you get accommodations like extra time and deadline extensions for the anxiety! \n\nFeel free to message me for further discussion! I hope this helps!",

I felt overwhelmed in the first week and a half of school this fall, and now that my classes started I feel the same, but I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re looking over the syllabus. It\u2019s really intimidating to see all the assignments that are going to be due in your classes. Around a week down the road I start to get into a grove of only focusing week to week, and the anxiety goes away quickly.",

      "text": ":(( that\u2019s rough <3 <3 \n\n\u2728One moment at a time\u2728\n\nIt sounds like next semester is looking really difficult, especially since this last semester was hard. That\u2019s very understandable to be feeling that way. \n\nOne positive thing is that you recognize that you are anxious \n\n\nSome problem-solving ideas:\n\nWhen I\u2019m super anxious like it sounds like you are now, doing an \u201cice dive\u201d can help me reset a bit and calm down. I hold ice, a pack of frozen corn, or an ice pack to my face, and it brings my heart rate and breathing down. You could also try splashing cold water on your face, holding a cold, wet towel to your face, or dunking your head in cold water. https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/how-to-calm-down-from-extreme-emotions-in-30-seconds\n\nCan you see a different therapist? I know it can be hard after you\u2019ve built up a relationship with someone, but it sounds like it could still be helpful. I\u2019m sure your current therapist would understand and could probably give you referrals. Maybe there\u2019s someone in her practice that you can see (if she\u2019s in a group practice sort of place). \n\nWhat would make this semester easier for you? Do you want to go back to school this semester? Would you like to take a medical leave of absence? Would you like to take fewer classes? Would you like to join study groups? \n\nRemember to take things one thing at a time",
