  "title:": "If you're going to have late work penalties, grade assignments in a timely manner.",
  "text": "I havent had a single assignment graded in one of my classes for over a month and finals are in like two weeks. I am completely in the dark about where my grade is right now because of it and thats sooo frustrating it's unreal. I emailed her about my grade and what I might do to get my grade higher and not only did she respond in a timely manner, but basically said \"theres not much you can do since these assignments are so late they won't be worth many points with the late work policy and all!\" Even though barely any of the assignments Ive done are even graded yet. All I'm saying is that if you're going to have a strict late work policy you shouldn't neglect to grade anything for months. ESPECIALLY WHEN FINALS ARE COMING UP. ugh. Just very frustrated. this is even more frustrating considering it's an art class and we only have like 7 projects in total.",

I just think deadlines should have a real purpose, and late penalties shouldn\u2019t result in unnecessarily excessive grade loss or no credit if the student put in decent effort.",
