Long story short, a couple years in and I realize it\u2019s not fun and I absolutely hate it and hate living there the most. So I take a semester off to transfer so I can do what I wanna do and commute and be happy. Now my family thinks for some stupid reason I\u2019m gonna be a bum and a drop out (even though I\u2019m not) and I\u2019m getting told If I don\u2019t get a degree I\u2019m gonna be a bum. I\u2019m literally getting a degree though I\u2019m not quitting school, I\u2019m finally doing what I wanna do and they don\u2019t agree. But my closest family is supportive so that\u2019s good, I need them :) \n\nTL;DR: I hated living at college and my current college situation, so I changed and now some of my family thinks I\u2019ll be a bum.", "author": "hehehehehehe9990", "created": 1630956013, "retrieved": 1632841141, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hbucgbh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pj6egj/family_not_understanding/hbucgbh/", "text": "Thank you u/hehehehehehe9990 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then I was panicking because I didn't really have any other interests. Then I realized that I still wanted to be in healthcare but not a doctor and I eventually gravitated towards Pharmacist.\n\nIm a pharmacy technician at a hospital right now and I love it. If a position opens up soon I will be cross-trained as an IV technician.\n\nI feel like I got lucky because what if my interests wasn't even in healthcare? I enjoyed tutoring a lot so what if I said mom, dad I want to be a math professor? They would flip out! At least when I become a hospital pharmacist for a while I want to teach at a pharmacy school and help students during their rotations which they are okay with.\n\nI feel bad for my sister. She is the second-oldest (im the eldest) and she is into digital design and art. Immigrant parents + Art oriented kid= Drama. They try to be supportive but she is a senior and they are trying to convince her to be a Veteranarian since she likes animals. She has high function Austism so learning isn't always the easiest. But between her trying her damn best, parents who don't let her slack and accommodations from the school she can do anything. Just worried she will be pressured into a field she doesn't have an interest in", "author": "TheRapidTrailblazer", "created": 1630961495, "upvotes": 11}}}
