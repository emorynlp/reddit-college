When you get to your third or fourth year, you will be begging to take weeder classes again. Believe it or not, it does get worse after those classes",

In my experience, weed-out courses are hard not so much from the material, but due to the fact they are courses with less hand-holding and more expectation for self-study. After I passed my weed-out courses I found upper level courses easier because through the weed out courses I learned better self-study methods.",

He keeps saying that in the real world no one helps you, and in jobs you are all alone. It is ironic he is saying that because he has been in academia his whole life. His class is definitely a weeder class because he is a jerk. In this university math professors have a bad rep. They love to fail students.",

Your \u201cweeder\u201d classes may have been easy but mine are not. I\u2019m in biology so we  focused on things at a cellular level before going into bigger concepts in later classes.

I would like to say it's because I have better study habits now and I'm more disciplined, but that's not the whole story.\n\nA big part of it is the fact that I'm simply not very good in certain subjects, and I was forced to take those subjects during my first semesters. Since I wasn't actually majoring in those subjects, I had a much easier time after those classes were behind me. Why the heck would I beg to take Chemistry again?",
