  "text": "I am not saying they don\u2019t exist because they do. The fact reality is that most of your weeder classes are still easy compared to your upper docs. When you get to your third or fourth year, you will be begging to take weeder classes again. Believe it or not, it does get worse after those classes",

In my experience, weed-out courses are hard not so much from the material, but due to the fact they are courses with less hand-holding and more expectation for self-study. After I passed my weed-out courses I found upper level courses easier because through the weed out courses I learned better self-study methods.",

He keeps saying that in the real world no one helps you, and in jobs you are all alone. It is ironic he is saying that because he has been in academia his whole life. His class is definitely a weeder class because he is a jerk. In this university math professors have a bad rep. They love to fail students.",
