I switched majors because I wasn't happy or felt supported in my original major but fell in love with my new major but it will take me an extra 2 years. I've had people doubt me for this change. It seems like everyone else has a support system but I lost my family's and my (ex) boyfriends along with everyone else's support because of this and I feel alone. How do you combat this? How do you find a support system?", "author": "grumpypiegon", "created": 1623465541, "retrieved": 1632842237, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 139, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h1h5mfd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nxwm0d/not_graduating_college_in_4_years/h1h5mfd/", "text": "Thank you u/grumpypiegon for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Stuff like this always hurts to go through, but know that not everyone is like that! You can 100% find a supportive community of friends who won\u2019t judge you by your perceived professional potential.

Don't let outside noise bother you. I know this might be an opinionated example, but Elon Musk (one of the most successful entrepreneurs currently) took 7 years while facing multiple challenges to finish his undergraduate degree.\n\nAs a suggestion, I would say maybe try to pile on experience and maybe multiple degrees while you aim at completing your undergraduate degree, You have made it this far so might as well push through and finish strong.
