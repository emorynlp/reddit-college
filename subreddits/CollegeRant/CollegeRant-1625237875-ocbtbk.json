I wasn\u2019t going to tell my family because I had a feeling it would become an expectation. \n\nNow my whole extended family knows because my mom had to brag on Facebook. Now I feel like I have to make deans list every semester or I\u2019m gonna be a disappointment.\n\nI struggle with depression and I have dislexia and adhd. My plan isn\u2019t even to graduate within 4 years because full time overwhelms me but now I feel like if I don\u2019t I\u2019m a loser. Can anyone relate?", "author": "Loner216", "created": 1625237875, "retrieved": 1632949618, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"h3tc3zs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ocbtbk/feel_so_much_pressure_now/h3tc3zs/", "text": "Yea, I don\u2019t announce things sometimes as well because I\u2019m afraid the expectation will lead me to failure. There\u2019s got to be a name for this.\n\nTake your time. Don\u2019t join the rat race. If you need to take longer than 4 years so be it. My counselor told me that most people don\u2019t graduate in 4 years, and that when they try to they end up failing classes from a large class load and have to take them again. Don\u2019t sweat it. Maybe ask your family not to blast your life in social media too.", "author": "Crochitting", "created": 1625239619, "upvotes": 6}}}
