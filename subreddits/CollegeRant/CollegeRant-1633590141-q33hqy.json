  "title:": "I hate my roommate and I feel like I\u2019m going insane from sleep deprivation",
  "text": "I seriously am about to just lose my fucking mind. I am silently crying in bed as I type this because I have reached my breaking point and I feel like I\u2019m going insane. \n\nMy roommate has got to be the most clueless, selfish, unaware person on this planet. I am in shock and awe that something this fucking OBLIVIOUS can actually function day to day. \n\nBasically, I like sleep. I\u2019m a college student. I like to fucking sleep. Well, she fucking doesn\u2019t!!!! She sleeps about 4 hours a night and so that means that I only sleep 4 hours a night!!! I like to go to bed around midnight or so and get up anywhere from 8-9 am. She seems to go to bed around 3 am and get up at 7. \n\nEvery night. Every single night. \n\nShe will stay up and watch videos on her phone with her brightness up all the way, will laugh out loud at them at 1 am when I\u2019m literally asleep, will take PHONE CALLS at midnight. But the worst of all. Is the fucking. Door slamming. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. every time this bitch uses the bathroom, SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. THREE TIMES A NIGHT. SHE SLAMS. THE FUCKING DOOR. SLAM. SLAM. no one on earth could sleep through it. I\u2019ve asked her to stop, and she doesn\u2019t. Imagine you\u2019re sleeping and someone just comes into the room and slams a door a couple times, for fun! \n\nI can\u2019t take it anymore. It takes me about an hour to fall asleep sometimes and then she ruins it and wakes me up within a second. I swear I don\u2019t even exist to her. \n\nI just need to vent. I wish I could break my lease and commute. I hate this person deeply and I will never ever live with anyone again after this. \n\nTLDR: my clueless roommate ruins my sleep every night and I\u2019m going clinically insane\n\nEdit: many of you have said try ear plugs and I do use them every night but they only block out small sounds, and I do use an eye mask which helps somewhat. But the sounds are impacting me more than the lights. If anyone knows something that can block out the sound of a door slamming 7 feet away that would be helpful",

For example, my partner goes to class, go to the gym, goes to work, helps his mother move the house, and takes multiple [prescribed] sleeping pills and he can only sleep for around 4 hours every night.\n\n\n\n\nObviously this doesn't justify your roommate being annoying. I am just saying that the lack of sleep may be caused by mental illness. You should sit down and have a talk with her, tell her that quiet hours are between 12am and 8am and if she wants to use her phone she should go out of the bedroom. You should also try nice canceling headphones, perhaps play some relaxing music all night",

      "text": "Hey! Sleep deprivation is a serious problem that needs to be addressed asap. For most people it's because of insomnia, but this one sounds like your being deprived on purpose. Sleep deprivation can cause you to do some super irrational things and may eventually lead to a psych break. Not trying to scare you but it's serious to not get at least good quality sleep 2 to 3 days a minimum. Below I've put down some solutions.\n\n\nDo you have a car? If you do you might wanna set it up for sleeping in occasionally.\n\nDo you have friends or family who would let you use a couch or a spare room to sleep in for 1 or 2 nights a week?.\n\nIs there a cheap hostile or motel near by? Maybe you could inform your parents of your serious issue of sleep deprivation and theyd be willing to spot you some money for a quick 24 hour stay, once or twice a week so you can get a full night's rest. \n\nMaybe you should buy a tent and a sleeping bag to post up somewhere for a night or two a week. Obviously this last option isn't very safe, but its one possible solution.\n\nHere's the squeeze. You gotta get your sleep. Your roommate is an A hole and won't allow you the one thing that every living human needs in order to function properly on a daily basis. You gotta think outside the box for this one. Sleep is so important that you should do anything, short of snuffing out your roommate, to find a solution to get it.",

I could never fall asleep until she fell asleep (that was hard bc I had most of the early morning classes). She let stuff in her fridge rot and expire and the thing reeked every time she opened it. Any time I have the room dark bc I\u2019m sleeping (early morning or late at night), she loudly walks through the door and flips all the lights on. Her side of the room was cluttered with crap. She did this thing where she talked to herself (she\u2019s Indian, so I could never figure out what she was saying), and I had to listen to that which kept me up. I never really figured it out. Like shes extremely book smart, but is she ever going to be able to function as an independent adult? No. Probably never bc she does have her parents do everything for her. It seemed like she had the mentality of a 12 year old. I could see she had extreme social anxiety or something. It\u2019s exhausting dealing with those people, but it will come to an end soon and it will be a huge relief once it\u2019s all over.",
