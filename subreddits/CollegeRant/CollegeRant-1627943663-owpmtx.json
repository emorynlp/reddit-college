I\u2019ve been stressed out the last few weeks trying to decide if I wanted to do part time classes and get a job, (I thought getting out and doing something, literally being forced to have a schedule might make me feel better) or do full time online classes and literally never leave my room. I found out today that decision is already made for me\u2014I emailed the financial aid office and I can\u2019t get my scholarship back (dropped out for a year bc I tried this already\u2014got too depressed to do my online homework) unless I go full time. Same thing again I guess bc I\u2019m too scared to see my psych. \n\nSo basically I have to do full time online classes when I\u2019ve been feeling my most depressed ever. I don\u2019t know how to get out of this hole and pretend to be fully functioning when I see no point in anything lately (I\u2019ll admit to a lot of self-neglect too I guess). Haven\u2019t enjoyed anything this summer and now it\u2019s already time to go back to the grind of school. I guess I enjoyed my year of literally not talking to anyone outside my family and never leaving my room, though, or I guess I hope I did because now it\u2019s time for stress and perfectionism. I hope maybe the disability office can help me somehow, I really don\u2019t feel ready for this but it\u2019s time to stop being lazy and disappointing everyone.\n\nTLDR: lmao I don\u2019t ever even leave my room. I have to do full time classes even though I hate online classes. I\u2019m really depressed and too scared/ashamed of how I\u2019ve neglected myself I can\u2019t even do anything about it. I tried this last year and didn\u2019t even last a week.", "author": "newsadacc", "created": 1627943663, "retrieved": 1632841684, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h7hf3bw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/owpmtx/full_time_classes_and_depression/h7hf3bw/", "text": "Thank you u/newsadacc for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
