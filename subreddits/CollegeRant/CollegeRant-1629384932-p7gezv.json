I\u2019ve been on campus for 24 hours and I can barely breathe. I have a gut feeling that this is very very wrong and I feel like puking/having diarrhea constantly. I can\u2019t stop crying and the campus is so hot with no air conditioning that even standing up makes me feel more sick.\n\nIs this normal in anyway? What do you suggest?

I\u2019m a junior and have lived on campus for a total of two years (missed one due to last years hurricanes wrecking my campus) and felt the exact same way you did during my freshman year.\n\nIt\u2019s scary, and it sounds like you\u2019re just having a lot of anxiety and fears about the situation, you sound extremely overwhelmed. You said you\u2019ve only been there a day, so I would give it just a few more days before making any sort of rash decision about the situation.\n\nJust know you\u2019re not alone, dorm transitions (especially for those who\u2019ve never lived on campus before) are hard and take some time to get used to. After getting used to dorm life and some time, you\u2019ll feel better about it most likely. \n\nAnd about your mental health, I would really recommend reaching out to your schools counselor or somebody you trust to talk about these feelings with.
