  "title:": "College is sucking out all my passion for STEM",
  "text": "When I was in high school I used to be super excited about everything STEM related. I would talk about physics for hours and hours, read about stuff, watch youtube videos, try to help my classmates when we have coding classes etc... I was also the overachieving kid and felt quite confident when it came to school stuff. Now I'm halfway through my CS Bachelors and I feel like it's sucking all passion out of my system. I started hating physics when I failed my mechanics class. The classes I'm taking are all super interesting but keeping up with 7 of them just makes it less enjoyable. Yes I'd love to genuinely care about algorithms and data structures because it's so cool but it's so intense that I have to skim through a lot of stuff and I feel like I'm on a 5 years sprint without the opportunity to really enjoy myself and with the constant feeling of failure which is very real.",

Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University and (probably) Arizona State University have distance learning programmes where you don't have to deal with lectures and can progress at your own pace.",

The very surface level intro stuff they teach you in high school level class has nothing to do with the actual day to day work of those in whatever field it is they\u2019re teaching. Snappy 30 minute YouTube videos about physics are completely different from the work of actual physicists.\n\nPop science isn\u2019t science.",

(So four 4 credit hour classes or a two 4 hour and three 3 hour classes would be common)  7 stem classes would be over 20 credit hours unless half of them were 1 credit seminars.  \n\nIf you are in an engineering program it could be more intense or if trying to do a double major.  Even so, 7 classes is a heavy load period and if the are science, math, engineering heavy - even more so.",

I guess the question is did you really feel a passion for the subjects per se? Or did you just really like being good at something? \n\nI feel like that's kind of the case with a lot of HS overachievers, that their first brush up with the topics actually being difficult dashes their self-notion of being great at this shit. And that more than anything was what made it enjoyable for them. \n\nI'm not sure I have much in the way of real advice to give other than the fact that you need to re-calibrate your expectations. Yes, it's a struggle, and it's difficult, and it's ok to view it as a slog.",
