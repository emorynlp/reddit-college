  "text": "When I was in high school I used to be super excited about everything STEM related. I would talk about physics for hours and hours, read about stuff, watch youtube videos, try to help my classmates when we have coding classes etc... I was also the overachieving kid and felt quite confident when it came to school stuff. Now I'm halfway through my CS Bachelors and I feel like it's sucking all passion out of my system. I started hating physics when I failed my mechanics class. The classes I'm taking are all super interesting but keeping up with 7 of them just makes it less enjoyable. Yes I'd love to genuinely care about algorithms and data structures because it's so cool but it's so intense that I have to skim through a lot of stuff and I feel like I'm on a 5 years sprint without the opportunity to really enjoy myself and with the constant feeling of failure which is very real.",

The very surface level intro stuff they teach you in high school level class has nothing to do with the actual day to day work of those in whatever field it is they\u2019re teaching. Snappy 30 minute YouTube videos about physics are completely different from the work of actual physicists.\n\nPop science isn\u2019t science.",

There is just a difference between learning about science and then spending a huge chunk of your time doing science and what makes it worse is that you're running on deadlines and exams. So, I can see how one can enjoy their science courses in high school and then completely get tired of it in college.",

(So four 4 credit hour classes or a two 4 hour and three 3 hour classes would be common)  7 stem classes would be over 20 credit hours unless half of them were 1 credit seminars.  \n\nIf you are in an engineering program it could be more intense or if trying to do a double major.  Even so, 7 classes is a heavy load period and if the are science, math, engineering heavy - even more so.",

So if it's an option for you to take it slower and finish in 4 years instead of 3 - it might help with your mental health and appreciation of your science courses.",

I guess the question is did you really feel a passion for the subjects per se? Or did you just really like being good at something? \n\nI feel like that's kind of the case with a lot of HS overachievers, that their first brush up with the topics actually being difficult dashes their self-notion of being great at this shit. And that more than anything was what made it enjoyable for them. \n\nI'm not sure I have much in the way of real advice to give other than the fact that you need to re-calibrate your expectations. Yes, it's a struggle, and it's difficult, and it's ok to view it as a slog.",

I took 8 credits during the summer between freshman and sophomore year and it really burned me out. The summer going into my junior year, I just worked at my non stem job and it really helped me get away from the stress for awhile. Also, try to think about why you started, why you loved it, all the incredible things you\u2019ve learned, and the opportunities you\u2019ll have in the future. I know CS is much more rigorous than my major (molecular neuroscience) but this is my best advice.",
