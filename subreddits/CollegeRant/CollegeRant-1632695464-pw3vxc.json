  "title:": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m currently taking a class with a horrible TA, what should I do?",
  "text": "This TA is always unprepared, gives quizzes on things not discussed in lab, and never answers emails. I\u2019m really worried this is going to hurt the grade I get in the class. He often gives incorrect information but when it comes to the quiz wants the right answer. Should I drop this course? I want to go into the medical field so I know a drop will look bad. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth sticking through and not getting an A. I know a B is not the worst (if I manage to even get that) but I\u2019m already applying to a competitive program with a not so great GPA.",
