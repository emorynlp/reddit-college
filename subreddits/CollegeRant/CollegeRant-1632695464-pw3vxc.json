I\u2019m really worried this is going to hurt the grade I get in the class. He often gives incorrect information but when it comes to the quiz wants the right answer. Should I drop this course? I want to go into the medical field so I know a drop will look bad. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth sticking through and not getting an A. I know a B is not the worst (if I manage to even get that) but I\u2019m already applying to a competitive program with a not so great GPA.", "author": "frijolebunny", "created": 1632695464, "retrieved": 1632840983, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heejbi9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pw3vxc/hello_everyone_im_currently_taking_a_class_with_a/heejbi9/", "text": "Thank you u/frijolebunny for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
