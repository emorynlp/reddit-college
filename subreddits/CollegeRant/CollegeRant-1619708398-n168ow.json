If so go back and review that information. Maybe you missed something.

So that's why I think you should just double check that something isn't missing from your assignment. \n\nAlso you mention lab reports. Is this a science lab? Scientific writing is it's own unique beast that takes A LOT of practice to get good at.

I have a Japanese prof (the prof is from Japan, the class isn\u2019t Japanese) this semester, and she always gives me extremely low scores on grammar.  Thing is, the parts she marked me down for were grammatically correct in the first place.  I work as a writing consultant in my schools English department.  I\u2019ve discussed this with my coworkers there, so I know I\u2019m not at fault.  I\u2019ve talked with my classmates too, and they say they\u2019ve been similarly marked.  We talked to the prof about this, and she admitted to not being a native English speaker.  But she marks us down anyways and refuses to consider reevaluating the scores\n\nMaybe if you reach out they\u2019ll reevaluate their grading?

I have a group report we have to submit as our final and I got the most negative feedback on my section of the paper than everyone else. I'm not sure if it just feels that way or because it's true, but now I feel like the group thinks I'm the weak link and I've procrastinated making the changes because I'm scared of fixing it just to let everyone (and myself) down again. That being said I am working on it right now, just wanted to check Reddit as a break. It might help to ask him for critique? Some professors don't leave feedback because they think students won't value or use it (which does happen). Maybe if you reach out to him and voice your concerns he'll take the time to actually give feedback?
