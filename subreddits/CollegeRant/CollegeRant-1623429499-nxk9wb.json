Basically it is for anyone from film, media writing, animation, advertising, sfx, motion graphics, or game design. It\u2019s a wide major full of a bunch of career paths since it\u2019s basically the chose your own adventure of art majors. Normally professor understand that. This professor however treats us all like we want to make films. She assigned us Mamet\u2019s On Film Directing. Here\u2019s the issue, it is the standard pretentious film student book. There\u2019s a portion where he shits on actors and randomly goes off on how he hates modern art and those who like it should \u201cgrow up\u201d. It\u2019s the worst film book I have had to read. Period. She also only gives us a few days to complete multi page essays. This is a 1000 lvl class. She has no respect for the fact that students have lives outside of class. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s asynchronous yet has assignments due pretty much every day that require hours of work (mostly reading, researching and watching videos or movies to then write papers on). If we say anything critical or negative she will dock us. She treats this class like it\u2019s the only thing that should be focused on and I find it ridiculous. \n\nTL:DR treats us like film students and doesn\u2019t respect our time", "author": "lunchmonies", "created": 1623429499, "retrieved": 1632842239, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h1f50d9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nxk9wb/this_is_not_a_film_major_small_rant/h1f50d9/", "text": "Thank you u/lunchmonies for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
