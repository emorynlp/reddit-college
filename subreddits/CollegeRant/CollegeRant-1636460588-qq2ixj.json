  "text": "So basically I am going to be finishing up the first half of my second year of community college getting my associates and so far It has all been online for me and like someone else I saw in here I feel like I have been robbed of a proper education. \n\nThe current plan is to transfer to a university and get a bachelors in software engineering and I want to be a full stack developer (a person who knows everything there is to build websites from what they look like to the program running them on the servers) \n\nI have had a C++ programming class and currently a Java class but what I learned of C++ last year hardly made sense and I didn't necessarily learn it very well and I am now having the same issue with Java which is making me very concerned with my future plan of being full stack developer and what not. It is hard to learn the stuff that matters to me when im burdened with stuff i don't care about like geography or music appreciation and also when you have professors who just throw assignments at you telling you to just read stuff expecting you to figure it all out on your own, being completely useless.\n\nMy main concern is just learning the coding languages because I have not encountered any classes that cover data structures and algorithms yet.\n\nSO, as a solution I have thought to just get my associates finished (getting all the nonsense classes that \"make me a well rounded student\" out of the way) so that I would not have any extra classes to worry about while I take a 1 year break between finishing my associates and jumping into a university for a bachelors. During this break I would maximize all the time I could learning a few coding languages so that I would be prepared for university.\n\nThis has all been on my mind a lot lately and I thought to get it off my chest and just get some good opinions on it rather than keep it floating in the back of my mind fueling anxiety and stuff. Apologies for the wall of text, I tried to keep it straightforward with enough details to give a good idea of my situation.\n\ntl;dr \nI'm close to finishing my associates where I have not learned any programming languages very well due to difficult conditions, which will be critical in knowing if I'm going to pursue the bachelors/career path I want in the future. I'm not sure what to do about it other than put uni on pause after I finish my associates to take time to relearn them.",
