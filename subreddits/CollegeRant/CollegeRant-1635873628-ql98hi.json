  "text": "I convinced college is a scam... why does a student need to jump through hoops just to learn something that is a \"requirement\" just to get to major specific classes?!?!\n\nI am currently majoring in Accounting and Finance.  \nAccounting, its easy. Record transaction. Simple, plus and minus  \nFinance, easy. Buy low and sell high.\n\nWhy do we need more classes to justify our damn majors? Not only that, what is with professors with a hard on for written assignments?!?!\n\nI feel like I am wasting my life in school... I honestly have no choice... my parents expect me to attend college.... being raised in a time where college actually meant for something... and was WAY cheaper...\n\nAll I literally want to know is how to do my damn taxes.... I don't need any of these other classes....",

General Education classes help you develop skills that can help in your future career: communication, presentation, networking. Knowing how to record transactions is a crucial part of accounting, but so is being able to communicate with clients, organize your workload, and finish tasks on time.",
