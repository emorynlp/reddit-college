Anyways, a couple weeks ago, we took our first precalc exam. I already knew I was going to be in a course with a terrible professor because of all the ratings on rate my professor, but I'm pretty good at math so I thought I could get through the class. There were no other sections to choose from and I needed this course to graduate this semester. Not to mention, I am in dual enrollment as well and I am still in high school. \n\nSo the first test comes along and I studied the formulas and whatnot and I was pretty confident. The test was something else. Like, nothing we learned about was on it and it was nothing like the homework or the review sheets she posted. Almost everyone but 1 person failed. The class average was a 45, and I got a 36.\n\nI thought to myself \"well it was only the first test\" but then I checked the syllabus. We will spend 100 hours on homework at the very least and it only counts as 16% of our grade. We have 6 tests and the average of those tests counts as 84% of our final grade. If it keeps going like this, I'm afraid I won't be able to pass the course. And even worse, I want to apply to medical school in a few years and I worked so hard for my GPA not to plummet. I'm sort of numb to the situation. It's even worse that we are all remote learning and the professor straight up ignores everyone's questions during the class period.\n\nHas anyone had an experience like this? How can I go about it? \n\nI'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this on or whatever, I only use reddit when I need advice.

Check out other professors who teach it on RateMyProf (you should be able to find the other profs by looking at this semester and the past few semesters course catalogues).

The grand or so you pay for tuition to the community college for it as a summer course, taking med school into account, really wouldn't be the worst thing considering your goals.\n\nref: I did that for calc, taking it online from a local community college over the summer instead, and it was leagues better.", "author": null, "created": 1614437126, "upvotes": 19}}}
