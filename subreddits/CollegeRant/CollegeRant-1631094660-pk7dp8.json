I wish this pandemic would just end already. The hospital I work at we ran out of beds in the ER so we used recliner chairs and put curtains\n\nSome of the patients don't have a room so I would see patients sleeping in a hospital bed in the middle of a hallway while im pushing a medicine cart on a delivery round (im a pharmacy technician). Also we would get alerts on the announcements that somebody went into sepsis in the Er lobby. As much as I like my job I don't like how there is a real chance that I could walk past a random patient and they stop fucking breathing", "author": "TheRapidTrailblazer", "created": 1631135898, "upvotes": 1}, "hc269ny": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pk7dp8/online_college_rant/hc269ny/", "text": "May I ask, what country you\u2019re in? \n\nI too did online classes last year for both semesters, for me and this is just me, it worked out great cause I had a job so I didn\u2019t have to worry about driving around as much. \n\nBut now we\u2019re taking in classes, and it\u2019s made me focus more vs online which made me fall asleep a lot. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this, I know it\u2019s hard for a lot of students right now.
