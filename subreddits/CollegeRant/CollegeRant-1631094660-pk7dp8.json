      "text": "Yeah last time I checked the news yall had it real bad. I wish this pandemic would just end already. The hospital I work at we ran out of beds in the ER so we used recliner chairs and put curtains\n\nSome of the patients don't have a room so I would see patients sleeping in a hospital bed in the middle of a hallway while im pushing a medicine cart on a delivery round (im a pharmacy technician). Also we would get alerts on the announcements that somebody went into sepsis in the Er lobby. As much as I like my job I don't like how there is a real chance that I could walk past a random patient and they stop fucking breathing",

I do hope your school soon changes that.",
