Don't give up just yet because this is only the beginning. What helps me is that I sit down, read and highlight the chapter, then create a Quizlet. Make sure that it is thorough and includes lots of details. Study those flashcards day in and day out. While reading your flashcards, make sure to read them out loud and pace back and forth. When you are done studying your flashcards, review them. After that, use the testing portion to test yourself because the format of them is similar to the one that you are about to take. Another thing is to make sure that the room is QUIET! Having distractions such as your phone being on the desk is a huge one! Put the phone away, on silent, and don't take too many breaks. When you're done reading and highlighting, take a five-minute break to use the restroom or a bottle of water. Do the same thing after you're done studying the flashcards. Your mind does need a break, but having too many or too long ones can be detrimental to your memorization skills. One day when you have your college degree, you will look back on this day and be proud of all the blood, sweat, and tears that you had poured into your education. That's what makes it so rewarding! I just got my Associate's and I'm about to transfer to a big university with a 3.8 GPA and a scholarship! You need to have a little bit more faith in yourself! If you don't, then you will not get far in college. The last tip that I'd like to give you is to not analyze the question. Answer it and keep moving on to the next one. Doubting yourself on an exam in college is a huge detriment. Most likely, nine times out of ten, you are correct!", "author": "ItzAllPeachy", "created": 1621731952, "upvotes": 3}, "gz42nwv": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/niquu0/i_feel_like_such_a_failure_i_used_to_be_smart/gz42nwv/", "text": "grades\u2260how smart someone is", "author": "Wowzaitstorii", "created": 1621730253, "upvotes": 6}, "gz3klwh": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/niquu0/i_feel_like_such_a_failure_i_used_to_be_smart/gz3klwh/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1621720418, "upvotes": 6}}}
