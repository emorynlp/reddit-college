I have a history of mental illness and trauma, I took a year off from university because of it. \n\nI\u2019m falling behind. My math class is unsalvageable. I\u2019m three chapters behind. We have a quiz tonight and a midterm next week. I\u2019m dropping it. I am almost positive I have a math learning disability  and I\u2019m going to be tested soon. I have a tutor but nothing helps because my concentration is so shot. \n\nMy writing class is madness. I\u2019ve taken writing classes before but they didn\u2019t transfer. Every single day is torture. I have a thousand templates to fill out and a 9 module student integrity course to complete. He says if we don\u2019t do it his way there is no chance of getting an A. So far I\u2019m behind on a source template that I can\u2019t sit still enough to finish. Due to my trauma and meds I have mild memory loss issues. I have no access to the template that was partly completed by me and submitted and I need it and I\u2019m too anxious to ask prof about it. \n\nI\u2019m also behind on my science class. I need to watch videos of a chapter that she filmed over the weekend. No motivation to do so. We have a quiz tomorrow. I\u2019m so screwed.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to the counselors and academic support Center. I\u2019m going to try again but I just really wanted to get this out to anyone who could relate so I dont feel like such a defective failure.

Last seminar I made the president's list after several semesters on the Dean's list. I cant keep up right now. I'm 9 assignments behind and they're all WE. In fact I'm in zoom lecture right now. I had to reach out to my professors for the first time and in really glad I did. It's terrifying and I cant speak for your college, but at mine they really want to help. Mind you, I'm a history major so I'm in the humanities sector of my college. I'm just really sorry, but you're not alone.

It\u2019s okay. You are making progress. Whether you fail at it now, you still tried and you aren\u2019t giving up right? Worse case scenario, you get a break and lighten up for next semester and plan ahead for how you want to handle things next time. \n\nI\u2019m going through the thought process now trying to salvage my thermodynamics grade but it isn\u2019t looking good. I\u2019m definitely slowing down starting next semester. It\u2019s okay.

I totally understand the memory loss issues, as I myself have those problems (also stemming from trauma but ever since I got COVID this year it got much worse). My advice to you is document, document, document. Not sure if your school has it, but definitely document everything at your schools disability assistance/academic assistance offices. I can't do any of that because I have horrible insurance and can't afford to get the formal neurological testing, but my friends who do have documentation have more assistance and people on their side because of it. For example, if a professor is giving you crap because you need extra time on a test, having documentation can help the disability/academic offices put pressure on them to give you what you need. It can also help you live in an appropriate housing environment if that is an issue for you. They also can point you to people who are familiar with your conditions and provide guidance.", "author": "need477thrwy", "created": 1601485915, "upvotes": 3}, "g76qshu": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j2jr9t/online_learning_and_mental_illness_is_going_to_be/g76qshu/", "text": "Sounds like me, math is a nightmare, always in the teachers office hours and I also have to design 19 web pages in html and I don't even know what I'm doing.", "author": "NoChannel1", "created": 1601483566, "upvotes": 5}, "g76p72x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/j2jr9t/online_learning_and_mental_illness_is_going_to_be/g76p72x/", "text": "Yea, I'm trying to take the easier courses this semester.
