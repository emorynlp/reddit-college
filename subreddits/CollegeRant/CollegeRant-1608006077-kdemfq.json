My SWE professor decided that our Final Exam should be to create a project model similar to the project model that took us an entire semester to make. She's asking for a  minimum of six pages including Gantt Charts,  SDLC model for the system, and multiple functional and non-functional requirements,  etc.  Idk I just think it's too much for a 'final exam' it seems like a  multi-week project at this point. She assigned this to us tonight and it's supposed to be due this Friday. Does it just seem too much or am I just complaining?", "author": "PureFreshMentos", "created": 1608006077, "retrieved": 1632842910, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gfztq6v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kdemfq/professors_with_unrealistic_expectations_for/gfztq6v/", "text": "LOL, I feel this.\n\n Imagine being me and having a cumulative biochemistry exam when you can barely even remember what you did this morning or even the whole day for that matter xD\n\nF in chat for GPA", "author": "Sovyyy", "created": 1608088907, "upvotes": 2}, "gfxx3bs": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kdemfq/professors_with_unrealistic_expectations_for/gfxx3bs/", "text": "Yes that sounds like a lot (probably too much) of work!!
