My professor aka \u201cdoctor X\u201d literally assigns about 15 readings a week. I put in about 16 hours a week for just this class. And today I took an open book quiz and got 15/43. Why.? Because I can\u2019t manage to hold 15 readings in my brain. And not even multiple choice. Everything was select all that may apply and I got them all partially correct. I officially HATE English class.

That is some bullshit, like it's a 100 level class. I could understand the difficulty and amount of work for a 300-400 level, but to expect that of a 100 level course that essentially is an introduction of the fundamentals is absurd. I don't know how you college works, I would either drop the course and take it another semester with a different professor (if that is an option) or see about switching to another section. But since I don't know how your college works, only my own, I don't know how feasible those options are. \n\nIs there an academic advisor or someone above or outside the professor you can talk to for guidance or help with the course?", "author": "masterzorogama", "created": 1612428351, "upvotes": 1}, "glyri3x": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lc7f4w/english_102/glyri3x/", "text": "I am in english 102 and I have about 1-2 hours of reading each week. this doesn't sound right. maybe you could try a different professor", "author": "purple_snails", "created": 1612424849, "upvotes": 4}, "glyoxhq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/lc7f4w/english_102/glyoxhq/", "text": "Not sure if this applies to you because I don't know what you're reading, but Cliff Notes saved my fucking life.
