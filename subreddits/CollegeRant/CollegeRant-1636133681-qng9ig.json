  "text": "I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do at this point. I\u2019m a freshman in college and I basically plummeted in my all my first semester classes. I\u2019ve been dealing with mental health issues. I couldn\u2019t motivate myself to ask my professors for help. They\u2019ve tried to reach out to me but I couldn\u2019t do what they want of me. My grandmother is backed up with rent so I\u2019ve been solely focusing on working since I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s able to help. Now, Spring Term is already around the corner and I was supposed to register for classes yesterday and renew my FASFA. I\u2019m not sure what to do next. College is brutal, and I might as well be dropped. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like college. I love learning and really wanted (and still do) to pursue a career in psychology. It\u2019s my passion to help people but I can\u2019t even help myself first. Any advice on what I should do?",

      "text": "Hi friend! Undergrad is rough sometimes, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this. Let me tell you when helped me: doing two semesters at home, remotely. I needed family support towards the end of my degree and I had to pull myself out and finish at home.\nPlease be authentic and honest with your advisors and professors about your mental health. It\u2019s so important to be as forthcoming as you feel comfortable with, the more you talk with your professors and advisors, the better they can help you. They really only wanna help,  I matter how intimidating they may seem. You still have time in the semester. Don\u2019t give up. \n\nThe day I started seeing a therapist was the best day of my life. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend dropping out but talk to your advisor about your reservations and discuss all of your options, why not just go to part time? There is no rush in finishing. It\u2019s all at tour own pace, just the minimum amount of time of four years. Take as long as you need.",

              "text": "Hi friend, thanks for asking. I was in my last year of undergraduate school- so a four year institute. I failed my senior thesis and decided to retake that class at home. They worked something out with registrar and my advisor and the panel. I met with my advisor three times a week to go over my progress and went back to defend my thesis The next semester. At first I felt like a failure but I just needed support lol \nI began to adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms and therapy and family was what I needed. Your mental health is so important. Only share what you feel you need to but but share enough so they your school can be there for you.",
