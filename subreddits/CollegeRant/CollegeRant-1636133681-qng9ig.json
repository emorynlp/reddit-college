  "text": "I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do at this point. I\u2019m a freshman in college and I basically plummeted in my all my first semester classes. I\u2019ve been dealing with mental health issues. I couldn\u2019t motivate myself to ask my professors for help. They\u2019ve tried to reach out to me but I couldn\u2019t do what they want of me. My grandmother is backed up with rent so I\u2019ve been solely focusing on working since I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s able to help. Now, Spring Term is already around the corner and I was supposed to register for classes yesterday and renew my FASFA. I\u2019m not sure what to do next. College is brutal, and I might as well be dropped. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like college. I love learning and really wanted (and still do) to pursue a career in psychology. It\u2019s my passion to help people but I can\u2019t even help myself first. Any advice on what I should do?",
