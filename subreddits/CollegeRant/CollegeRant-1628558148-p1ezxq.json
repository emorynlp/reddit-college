What I had to do was meet with my advisor and department chair to ask them if I could do an arranged study. When they agreed, I approached professors who I know have taught the class in the past, explained the entire situation (Hey, I need this class to graduate, if I don\u2019t get this credit then I don\u2019t graduate and I\u2019ll drop out and become homeless, please say yes before I start crying etc.) and they said yes, they would recycle one of their old syllabi and go over my work during the semester. Your faculty advisors and department head should have a lot of pull with the higher up offices, so if you could explain the entire problem/dilemma to them first, they also might be able to relay to the Dean\u2019s office in a more persuasive manor.", "author": "kamair43", "created": 1628606951, "upvotes": 2}, "h8de12v": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/p1ezxq/the_deans_office_wont_substitute_a_class_and_now/h8de12v/", "text": "I am curious, is there not even a community college that would offer the credit?
