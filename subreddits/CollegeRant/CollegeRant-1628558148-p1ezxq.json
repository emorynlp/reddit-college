  "text": "Like the title says, the one class I need this semester so I can finally graduate isn't being offered, my last foreign language requirement and the Dean's office isn't budging. I have to complete all my classes before I student teach this spring semester. I can't stay another semester because my loans run out. College has honestly been the worst experience of my life, between being diagnosed with a lifelong disease, type 1 diabetes, to my father dying this whole experience has been a living hell and when I'm just about to finish this happens. I think I'm just done.",

In every case it was either the fact that the student had avoided the language requirement until the very end or that they had bad advisors who didn\u2019t stop this from happening. If the problem was about students avoiding language classes it was hard to have much empathy for their situation. It was easier to arrange a substitute course when the advisor was at fault.",

It\u2019s very easy to blame the advisor, but there are exceptions that can be made in those cases. So when those exceptions are NOT being made\u2026 It usually means an advisor is unfairly being blamed.",

      "text": "My advisor fucked up with my scheduling last year, and I ended up with two classes that I had left to graduate during my last semester (this upcoming one) that apparently are only offered during the spring semester. What I had to do was meet with my advisor and department chair to ask them if I could do an arranged study. When they agreed, I approached professors who I know have taught the class in the past, explained the entire situation (Hey, I need this class to graduate, if I don\u2019t get this credit then I don\u2019t graduate and I\u2019ll drop out and become homeless, please say yes before I start crying etc.) and they said yes, they would recycle one of their old syllabi and go over my work during the semester. Your faculty advisors and department head should have a lot of pull with the higher up offices, so if you could explain the entire problem/dilemma to them first, they also might be able to relay to the Dean\u2019s office in a more persuasive manor.",

My program was already growing too quickly for the school to handle so losing professors fucked up the classes that were offered. Most of the upper levels I need do not exist, or if they do, they're for the Master's students only. I want politely to bash my head on a desk til brain matter comes spilling out my ears.",

It's not even like I'm asking to just not take it, I had a friend who substituted one of his foreign language requirements for an extra anthropology last year.",

Outside of that, I'd suggest talking with the Provost, although at this point, I don't know how much help they'll provide.\n\nGood luck.",
