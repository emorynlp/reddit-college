  "text": "Tldr? Found my calling but I have to start over after already having 2 degrees.\n\n\u2728Good News\u2728\nI feel like my calling is into death work. Problem is my undergrad degree (studio art minor in biology) and grad degree (public health) can't really contribute to formal education requirements for mortuary science or thanatology. \n\n\ud83e\udd9dUgh news\ud83e\udd9d\nI'd have to figure out a way to do a hybrid for preferably a bachelor's degree in mortuary science (ideally not just associates due to pay and I feel like running a funeral home would need at least a bachelor's in said field). Which means I'd have to take out potentially large student loans. \n\nI just hate that I feel like education wise I basically have to start over \ud83e\udd72 I know I'm 27 and still young, it's just frustrating feeling like I have to hit the reset button. My family has the attitude of \"man I wish you realized this before we helped you through your 2 degrees you already have!\" \n\n\ud83d\ude14 Not my fault public health master's degree can't substitute for mortuary science . I've emailed and ask if my classwork can help substitute so it'd be less classes for me to take and the board of funeral services said it's not a valid substitute.",
