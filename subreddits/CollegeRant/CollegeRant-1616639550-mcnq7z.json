When I asked her a question of what kind of classes should I take in college to be in her career, she said to take anything I want to learn about or have an interest in. For writers, it's good to have a lot of knowledge on different subjects and that can give you inspiration for what you may want to write about. \n\nThat story may be for a writing career, but I feel it can apply to any field or anyone who just wants to learn stuff. Knowledge is power, so why not obtain knowledge in a wide variety of fields? I've taken electives in a bunch of different fields because I wanted to get a taste of what they were like.
