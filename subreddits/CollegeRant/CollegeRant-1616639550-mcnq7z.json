  "text": "It's not a part of my degree sure, but classes like pottery or costume construction seem interesting to me, abd it gives me a chance to learn skills and knowledge I may be able to use again. So why am I shut down every time I express interest in them, when I'm the one paying for them? So far my college experience has been rough, and I just wanna explore my interests more and find things I enjoy doing.",

They didn\u2019t want me to take it and I took it off of my list of courses before the drop rule went into place for this semester. They want me to stay on track. \n\nI understand that my parents want the best for me and I\u2019m fortunate that they\u2019re even supporting me. However, I\u2019m only taking my basics and have not clue in what I even want to major in. If I was able to take classes that didn\u2019t involve the plan I\u2019m on, I feel like I would be able to explore some things I might enjoy and potentially help find something to major in, or at least get an idea.",

That way you are not paying a 1000+ dollars for some stupid class like gender studies. Youtube is a great learning tool.",

(At the time i wanted to be a writer but I dont anymore). When I asked her a question of what kind of classes should I take in college to be in her career, she said to take anything I want to learn about or have an interest in. For writers, it's good to have a lot of knowledge on different subjects and that can give you inspiration for what you may want to write about. \n\nThat story may be for a writing career, but I feel it can apply to any field or anyone who just wants to learn stuff. Knowledge is power, so why not obtain knowledge in a wide variety of fields? I've taken electives in a bunch of different fields because I wanted to get a taste of what they were like. Criminology, psychology, women gender studies, philosophy, intercultural communication, etc. I feel like I'm a more rounded person because of it.",

My advice is you could just sign up for the elective classes you want, take them credit/no credit (or p/np) and tell your parents the elective is required by your school for personal enrichment. (Some schools do actually require enrichment electives.) I\u2019m a STEM major and I also try to take some kind of personal interest elective every semester that has nothing to do with my degree, as my fun class, (last semester it was playwriting, this semester it\u2019s bio anthropology, next semester it\u2019ll be an art class). Otherwise the semesters do get very rough.",
