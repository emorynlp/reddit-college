They were due tonight, and believe or not I DID try to relearn the material and finish/complete what I didn't do before tonight, but I couldn't finish. Now tonight at the due date, I'm just jumping between all of the assignments, and all I could do is stare at the screen or do anything else (which is why I'm on Reddit instead of trying to finish as much as I can). I just feel like nothing is going in or out of my brain anymore. :(\n\nI can't bring myself to think anymore, and I just want to go to bed, but I can't even do that with the work on my mind.\n\nI'm just coming to accept that I'll have to take the class over for a 3rd time (no, I'm way too far to change majors, and to drop out--I'm officially a senior credit wise), and just let things be. And you know what sucks about this? It's literally the last week! I couldn't even hold on for one more week. At least I'm passing everything else. \n\nMaybe others won't relate much, but it's nice I have somewhere to type out my feelings without feeling too ridiculed or judged.", "author": "OfficialThrowaway_1", "created": 1618194532, "retrieved": 1632950193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 368, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gub7z62": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mp4zz3/anyone_experience_burn_out_so_bad_you_just_stare/gub7z62/", "text": "Sometimes I get so much anxiety with all my assignments and all the studying I have to do that I just sit there and legit stare at the wall lol", "author": "Sad_Push7215", "created": 1618269507, "upvotes": 1}, "gua6lvi": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mp4zz3/anyone_experience_burn_out_so_bad_you_just_stare/gua6lvi/", "text": "Yup, feel like that with my first final, last Paper and my next final ALL worth 30% So FML! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude2d", "author": "DaddysPrincesss26", "created": 1618252017, "upvotes": 1}, "gu9wie9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mp4zz3/anyone_experience_burn_out_so_bad_you_just_stare/gu9wie9/", "text": "I just googled signs of depression a few days ago.
