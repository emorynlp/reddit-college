WHAT FUCKEN STUDENT HAS $300 JUST FUCKEN LAYING AROUND!?!?!?\n\nNot only this bullshit. The student has to specifically set refunds to go out to external bank accounts... man... I currently have around $1,000 that is a pain in the ass to withdrawal.... I just set refunds to go out to a external account... I am going to eat that $1,000 in the student bank account and accept the damn $2.95 fee.... This is fucken stupid. Doesn't even give students a return on the money...\n\nWhat the fuck is the point?
