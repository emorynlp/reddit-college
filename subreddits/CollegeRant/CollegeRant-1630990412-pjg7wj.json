  "title:": "Student debit cards are highway robbery",
  "text": "It would be fine if the student bank account would allow the student to use the debit card on anything, but not only does it restrict what a student can use the debit card on.... it also has the student deposit $300 every damn billing cycle... or get hit with a fee of $2.95... WHAT FUCKEN STUDENT HAS $300 JUST FUCKEN LAYING AROUND!?!?!?\n\nNot only this bullshit. The student has to specifically set refunds to go out to external bank accounts... man... I currently have around $1,000 that is a pain in the ass to withdrawal.... I just set refunds to go out to a external account... I am going to eat that $1,000 in the student bank account and accept the damn $2.95 fee.... This is fucken stupid. Doesn't even give students a return on the money...\n\nWhat the fuck is the point? How do schools expect students to survive with the restrictions schools set on bank accounts?!!?",

What student has $300 to burn every damn month?\n\nDo they give any form of return for the $300 every month? No no they don't  \nIs there any benefit that justifies this $300 deposit every statement cycle? Hell no.",
