  "text": "I feel like I fall out of the groove of doing my homework and being organized in a matter of days and every like 4 days I have to remind myself that I\u2019m still a student and figure out what I have to do before the stupid midnight deadlines. I knew about some homework I had to do but like procrastinated on it and now somehow it\u2019s a week later and it\u2019s long overdue???",

I work, I\u2019ve kept to a fairly strict sleep/work schedule for months, and exercise. I\u2019ve done all the shit people have told me to do to avoid feeling like this. At this point, I\u2019m just worn down.",

          "text": "I don't know about you but I have been going through this too!! It might be burnout creeping in which is something that needs to be taken care of soon! I actually experienced burnout in my Freshman  year and had to drop out for a bit to recover. It started off the same way and had to switch majors as it was too demanding of my time which it seemed like I was not making progress. I would not be surprised with the current situation that people would burnout from all of this chaos! This and it seems like a lot of professors just give out an unrealistic amount of assignments to complete with little direction whatsoever. Please do take care of yourself. I wish I would have known a lot earlier than I did before and could have avoided some serious issues if I just done something about it sooner!",

If I can suggest a few things, \n\n- get up early and go to bed early\n- Make a rule where you don\u2019t pick your phone up until you\u2019re done with the day unless it\u2019s emergencies\n- Have friends and join discord groups to share the work load and figure this out together\n\nYou got this and remember everyone is going through this! Good luck!",
