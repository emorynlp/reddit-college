I emailed my professor (with a doctors note) asking how I should prepare for the missed labs. Nothing. No response. I went to check the syllabus and lo-and-behold, doctors notes are not allowed and makeup labs are not allowed. You would think in a time of a global pandemic that teachers would be more understanding of students getting sick. While I don\u2019t have COVID, getting sicker is not something that I\u2019m too keen about. I officially have a 25% in the lab, all thanks to missing ONE class. I\u2019ll try and talk to my professor, as I\u2019m also marked absent from a class that I attended and completed the lab.", "author": "kubrickfanclub_", "created": 1632082574, "retrieved": 1632840994, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 178, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hdi8a0a": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/prfkfz/doctors_notes_should_be_accepted/hdi8a0a/", "text": "Thank you u/kubrickfanclub_ for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
