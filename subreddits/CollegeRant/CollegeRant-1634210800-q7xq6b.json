  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college this year and I literally can\u2019t sleep. Me and my roommate have extremely different sleeping schedules. Like complete OPPOSITE. I usually sleep at around 10pm and wake up at 7am. U know what time he sleeps?! Anywhere from 3am to 6am depending on what he\u2019s feeling that day. He usually wakes up at around 12pm to 3pm. THATS 9 HOURS. IM GLAD HES SLEEPING LIKE A KING. Ur probably wondering why I\u2019m having trouble sleeping in this situation. Well I have bad anxiety like REALLY bad. It makes it EXTREMELY hard to sleep with someone else in the room as it is let alone someone that\u2019s awake. Another reason is he usually does homework at night and he says he NEEDS the light on so he doesn\u2019t strain his eyes too much. Have u ever tried sleeping with the room light on? It\u2019s terrible. Now u might be saying \u201caww u can\u2019t blame him it\u2019s college and he probably needs to stay up that late to finish his work.\u201d NO. NO HE DOESNT. Literally I come in after my classes everyday and do u know what this man is doing? HES  PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, PLAYING GACHA PHONE GAMES, OR SLEEPING THROUGH HIS ZOOM CLASSES. WHY TF ISNT HE DOING HIS HOMEWORK AT THAT TIME INSTEAD??? He says he works better at night.... So where does that leave me. An average of 5 hours(very inconsistent) of terrible quality sleep and worsening depression. Worst part is this guy is like SUPER NICE and cool. Like he\u2019s a saint other than this. Makes it hard to hate him. \n\nTL;DR: My roommate and I have different sleep schedules and I haven\u2019t really been able to sleep since August cause of it. \n\nSo overall college dorm life is pretty cringe. Not very cash money. Not very swag.",
