I know if I get accepted, it\u2019ll be worth it, but they have a Spring Transfer Admission rate of around 3.5%. (0-5 of the 35-70 applicants each year).\n\nAll the work I put in ups those odds, but all I need is for some guy who\u2019s been putting in this kind of work since they were a Freshman to come in to take my spot. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this kind of work is worth it. It\u2019s awful. I go from doing one classes\u2019 homework to another, then to Udemy, then to reading some book. I get like a hour or two of free time each day, which I spend stressing out over if this is even worth it. \n\nMy advisor who said they\u2019d help has been very busy all month, so I can\u2019t even get much info from them on my odds. I know they have good info, I just can\u2019t get into contact with them. I\u2019ve been slightly pushy (an email each week), and they said they\u2019d get around to it when they weren\u2019t busy, but each day is another day of stressing over this.\n\nWorst thing about it is, my \u201cbackup school\u201d is still the best school in my state. I\u2019d be completely fine in the future, but I\u2019ve put this pressure on myself to get accepted into this particular school, so it\u2019s very likely I\u2019ll be attending that backup school disappointed in myself. \n\nThis whole thing is killing me. It\u2019s definitely a rant/vent, but I can\u2019t keep this up unless I get some kind of motivation.", "author": "neck_crow", "created": 1600909621, "retrieved": 1632842996, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 98, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g82ykx5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iyn36y/is_suffering_while_youre_young_really_worth_it/g82ykx5/", "text": "Returning to finish undergrad at 24 (now 26 with another year to go) has personally lead to much heavier suffering.

I know many people with supposedly in demand degrees (like engineering, computer science, and medical-related degrees) from highly ranked schools with selective admissions who can't get a job related to their degree, or even a job that requires a college degree.\n\nOn the other hand I went to a satellite campus of a flagship public university in the midwest and graduated with no debt (state schools typically have really awesome scholarships and grants and significantly lower tuition) and have several graduate programs who are trying to recruit me right. Even though hiring in my field was completely decimated by COVID, I am less screwed and can somewhat take a lower paying job temporarily while I figure out what my next steps are.\n\nTo compare it to two other managers at my current job, one went to the best respected engineering program in our area (which is also one of the most difficult in the country) and hasn't been able to find an engineering-related job since he graduated a few years ago. A second manager went to a very expensive private school in our area, majored in some academic major that's in demand (I don't remember what, but it was something in STEM), and now has significant college debt. Guess what? All three of us are basically in the same place right now even thought on paper both of them should be much better off than I am based on where they went to school and what they studied.\n\n**tl;dr:** its not worth it to kill yourself over anything college related because jobs are gotten through who you know not what you know. So you can go to the best and most expensive schools however, if you don't already have those connections before you even start college you will basically end up in the same place as an arts-related major who went to a cheap public school.", "author": "squirrel8296", "created": 1600970384, "upvotes": 1}, "g6fywv3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/iyn36y/is_suffering_while_youre_young_really_worth_it/g6fywv3/", "text": "First thing you should realize is that it isn't necessarily about you getting what you want but the school getting what it is looking for.  The standards are set by the school and the professors; so, even with all of this hard work, when you do your application, they still may not want what you have to offer AND THAT IS OKAY, I promise. It just means that you were not fit for THEIR particular program. The hard work pays off when you find the school that wants your particular talents.  I have a perfect GPA, I have tons of extra talents, tutoring, publishable research, etc and they can still pick someone over me because I don't fit what the program director is looking for.    The goal should be to always work hard and do your best because when you find the program/school that wants you, you will be ready to take the opportunity and will excel not just take classes. Professors love students that go above and beyond.  You will get opportunities that other students don't.

I can\u2019t even talk about that event legally.

Sometimes I cry thinking about having to stay here another year (not to be dramatic).\n\nI\u2019ve been in a good productivity streak too. My dream is to transfer to Columbia, but I think what has really helped me out is just having a backup school in case.
