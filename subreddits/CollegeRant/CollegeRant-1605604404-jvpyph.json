  "text": "My classes are so bad that I\u2019m barely passing by. There\u2019s barely time to study because of the amount of work given. My mental health is at all time low. I\u2019m ridden by anxiety. Once this shit is over I\u2019m going to get diagnosed because I can\u2019t function like this for another semester. I\u2019m forgetting to eat and sleep. Today my meal was a bottle of Mountain Dew and a small bag of Ruffles. And it\u2019s 4AM where I\u2019m at. \n\nI just had to complain lol",

Without any professor giving a fuck and with my time being wasted on a certificate to pass some automated job filter. If there was more security and less social pressure to drop out, I would\u2019ve done it. I couldn\u2019t even watch Toy Story 4 without crying from the amount of stress I have. This shit needs to end.",
