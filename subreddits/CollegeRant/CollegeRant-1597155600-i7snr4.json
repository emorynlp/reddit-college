{"sid": "i7snr4", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i7snr4/im_absolutely_fucked/", "title:": "I\u2019m absolutely fucked", "text": "I started at uni in September, doing a degree that I thought I would enjoy (but I\u2019m not) and which doesn\u2019t have great career prospects. At first I went to all the lectures and classes, but because I have pretty bad social anxiety, I slowly started not going to them. So since about January, I\u2019ve learned almost nothing - I didn\u2019t do any of the reading they set, all I\u2019ve really done is watch the lecture recordings. I also put no effort into my coursework (which contributes to my final marks for my modules), because you only have to get a 40% overall grade for a module to pass the first year, and the first year doesn\u2019t contribute to the grade you get for your actual degree. But now it\u2019s all come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nI just sat some exams back in May/June, and last Wednesday I got an email from the department saying I have to redo one of the essays I did for my coursework, to be submitted on the 24th. Thing is, I get info about my exam results and whether I\u2019ll have to do any resits on the 17th and 18th (most likely I will have to). And the period for taking these resits begins on the 24th. So I\u2019ll potentially have to be rewriting this essay, whilst studying all the materials I should have studied months ago, all within two weeks. Which will be pretty much impossible because I\u2019m dyslexic and my laptop keyboard isn\u2019t working properly either.\n\nThe cherry on top is that I\u2019m stuck working my summer job at the moment. Not only that, but I\u2019m trying to change my degree and transfer to another department. To do that, I have to submit a personal statement, and they require me to have passed all my first year modules. So basically I\u2019m fucked in that respect. I really don\u2019t like the degree I\u2019m doing at the moment, and I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t let me switch.\n\nEssentially, a perfect storm of social anxiety, procrastination, and laziness has culminated in a time (now) where I\u2019m royally fucked. I missed the deadline for submitting a Serious Adverse Circumstances form about my anxiety, so I have no recourse in this. In theory, if I only fail one module, I can still carry on with my degree (albeit a degree that I\u2019m not enjoying), but if I fail more than one, they\u2019ll ask me to leave the university. The deadline to apply for 2020/21 has passed so I\u2019d have to wait until next year, which is when a shit ton of people will be applying, because obviously they didn\u2019t want to have their first year be marred by COVID. But even in that scenario I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to work during that year because of COVID. My summer job wouldn\u2019t be able to hire me for the year, and I have basically no qualifications, so getting any other job would probably be impossible. \n\nI feel like my life is falling apart and I have no idea what to do. Any advice?

Personally for me, I suffer from immense anxiety and I tend to over think things to the point I put it off last minute - but, I've figured out myself and how to organize. \nIf I were you, I'd get a piece of paper and write out all the things you need to get done. Then, like in class, set a schedule on what needs to be done. I.E Paper 8am, 9am tuition, 10am, etc. Make sure you take a 15 min break every 30 minutes to rest your mind and also, you can take a break from the chaos to center yourself. \nFor me, I stay organized with my giant ass whiteboard - I write out every thing that needs to be done that week, and then I set my own schedule on how to achieve that. Yes, the work you produce RIGHT now might not be the best, but you'll learn to manage yourself in time. Just, take it slow, write out and follow a schedule and do what you can.", "author": "boots1994", "created": 1597174775, "upvotes": 11}}}
