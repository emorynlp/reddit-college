  "text": "I started at uni in September, doing a degree that I thought I would enjoy (but I\u2019m not) and which doesn\u2019t have great career prospects. At first I went to all the lectures and classes, but because I have pretty bad social anxiety, I slowly started not going to them. So since about January, I\u2019ve learned almost nothing - I didn\u2019t do any of the reading they set, all I\u2019ve really done is watch the lecture recordings. I also put no effort into my coursework (which contributes to my final marks for my modules), because you only have to get a 40% overall grade for a module to pass the first year, and the first year doesn\u2019t contribute to the grade you get for your actual degree. But now it\u2019s all come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nI just sat some exams back in May/June, and last Wednesday I got an email from the department saying I have to redo one of the essays I did for my coursework, to be submitted on the 24th. Thing is, I get info about my exam results and whether I\u2019ll have to do any resits on the 17th and 18th (most likely I will have to). And the period for taking these resits begins on the 24th. So I\u2019ll potentially have to be rewriting this essay, whilst studying all the materials I should have studied months ago, all within two weeks. Which will be pretty much impossible because I\u2019m dyslexic and my laptop keyboard isn\u2019t working properly either.\n\nThe cherry on top is that I\u2019m stuck working my summer job at the moment. Not only that, but I\u2019m trying to change my degree and transfer to another department. To do that, I have to submit a personal statement, and they require me to have passed all my first year modules. So basically I\u2019m fucked in that respect. I really don\u2019t like the degree I\u2019m doing at the moment, and I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t let me switch.\n\nEssentially, a perfect storm of social anxiety, procrastination, and laziness has culminated in a time (now) where I\u2019m royally fucked. I missed the deadline for submitting a Serious Adverse Circumstances form about my anxiety, so I have no recourse in this. In theory, if I only fail one module, I can still carry on with my degree (albeit a degree that I\u2019m not enjoying), but if I fail more than one, they\u2019ll ask me to leave the university. The deadline to apply for 2020/21 has passed so I\u2019d have to wait until next year, which is when a shit ton of people will be applying, because obviously they didn\u2019t want to have their first year be marred by COVID. But even in that scenario I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to work during that year because of COVID. My summer job wouldn\u2019t be able to hire me for the year, and I have basically no qualifications, so getting any other job would probably be impossible. \n\nI feel like my life is falling apart and I have no idea what to do. Any advice? Thanks, and sorry for the rant, I needed to get this off my chest",

I keep dropping courses because I keep failing them. I think the main problem is anxiety. I feel so stupid because other people don\u2019t have these issues. I think a therapist could help as well!!",

But I think the thing to remember is that it can feel lonely because other people don\u2019t SEEM to have the same issues. There certainly are a lot that do, but you just wouldn\u2019t know: some hide it really well, others might stay in their rooms all the time, so you\u2019d never see them. I\u2019m really sorry to hear you\u2019re struggling too. I wish you all the best, and, if you want to talk or just rant and get something off your chest, feel free to send me a DM :)",

I\u2019ve spoken to a student support officer and they\u2019ve been helpful to an extent, they recommended I fill out an SAC form like I mentioned. However all that does I think is get you an extension for exams and deadlines basically. Other than that, I\u2019m not really sure what else there is that could help me. Financial aid isn\u2019t as big a thing here as it is across the pond, so I\u2019m not aware of that being an option. And a lot of the documentation on the uni\u2019s website to do with fitness to study and taking breaks from studying are pretty bureaucratic and difficult to digest (like I said, I\u2019m dyslexic which doesn\u2019t help matters).

I personally recommend a \"TKL\" without the numpad because its smaller and easier to fit on a desk with a mouse (but if you're really worried about money you can keep using the trackpad)\n\n\n\nEdit: The fact you 'missed the deadline' for Serious Adverse Circumstances seems strange to me, because thats exactly the kind of thing that would happen during those circumstances, so why is there a deadline at all?\n\nI would strongly recommend sending an email to a couple of counselor/advisors and asking for help submitting a Hardship withdrawal/incomplete grade and ask if they know of any other options. Lots of people out there want to help.",

I took my laptop into the store to get it fixed but they said it\u2019d take 10 days, and with all these deadlines I have, that\u2019s not an option. I\u2019ll definitely look into the TKL keyboard. They have a deadline for the SACs because I think it\u2019s supposed to be a concession for exams. So a board has to have time to consider each individual case that they receive. I agree, I think it\u2019s weird, but that\u2019s just how it is I guess. I have reached out, haven\u2019t really received much back but I\u2019m getting there.

Personally for me, I suffer from immense anxiety and I tend to over think things to the point I put it off last minute - but, I've figured out myself and how to organize. \nIf I were you, I'd get a piece of paper and write out all the things you need to get done. Then, like in class, set a schedule on what needs to be done. I.E Paper 8am, 9am tuition, 10am, etc. Make sure you take a 15 min break every 30 minutes to rest your mind and also, you can take a break from the chaos to center yourself. \nFor me, I stay organized with my giant ass whiteboard - I write out every thing that needs to be done that week, and then I set my own schedule on how to achieve that. Yes, the work you produce RIGHT now might not be the best, but you'll learn to manage yourself in time. Just, take it slow, write out and follow a schedule and do what you can.",
