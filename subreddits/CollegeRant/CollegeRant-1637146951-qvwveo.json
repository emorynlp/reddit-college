  "text": "I moved away from home for the first time 2 months ago. The first month seemed to fly by, meeting new people and everything. A family member recently came to visit and they stayed for about 2 weeks. After they left, the homesickness went through the roof. At the same time my newly formed friend group started distancing themselves from me and I suddenly found myself all alone. I met some new people but I've lost my drive to do anything, like school work or go out for a coffee. All I can think about is how badly I wanna go back home for the holidays. And the days don't seem to pass by fast enough. I check my calendar at least 4 times per day, counting down the days until I can go home again and again (31 to go). I don't know what to do. I feel like all of this is overwhelming me and it's never gonna go away. I'm wondering if I was unhappy before the family member's visit, but I was just concealing it cause I was eagerly anticipating that visit.",
