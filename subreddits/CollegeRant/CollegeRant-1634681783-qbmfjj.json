  "text": "I feel like that I'm really done with this bs semester. I wanted to take a gap break but I can't due to having those freaking scholarships. I regret coming here from greedy $50k tuition with a principal/president that doesn't care about students.\n\nMaybe it is just me who has lost interest into some classes that made me fail 1st test.\n\nCan't wait for this fall semester to be over because it ain't it.  :(((",
