However, I need to rant about this lol) \n\nSo this class (International Business) ran for a month during the summer. It was asynchronous and mainly just involved reading a lot. I'm interested in this sort of thing and I have to take it anyway so figured I would get it out of the way. \n\nWe had three exams, 50 questions each, and all together they were worth 60% of our grade. I studied, read the chapters, made my own study guide on top of what the teacher provided us with etc. \n\n1st exam: 86% \n\nOkay, well I'll study harder this time. \n\n2nd exam: 82% \n\n....Wow. Well, there's still a shot, let me go hard for this next exam. \n\nI make this study guide-bibe hybrid and study it first thing in the morning, first thing at night. \n\nI take the exam today. \n\n3rd exam: 78%\n\n... and unless my paper and discussion board knocks the professor's socks off I'm probably getting a C and my GPA is going to throw itself into a volcano. Super disappointed in myself, but I'll just try harder in this upcoming semester. \n\nDid anyone else take an accelerated class this summer or in the past? What was your experience?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \n\nTook a class over the summer that I thought would be easy.
