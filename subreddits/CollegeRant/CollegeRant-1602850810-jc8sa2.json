  "text": "This is part rant part wondering what strategies you all have used for dealing with this... \n\nBasically I'm taking 3 classes online at a community college, as pre-requisites for nursing school. I never attended this school prior to taking online classes. All three of my classes, I feel like I'm just teaching myself. We don't have lectures with the prof, they don't offer office hours. It's pretty much just, read the book, look at these other materials, take this multiple choice test/quiz. \n\nI feel a little frustrated to be paying like $2000 just to learn this material on my own. Anyone have tips on how to get the most out of it? :) I did make some group chat study groups with my peers. And I'm taking some of the colleges webinars on different lifeskills and such as well like resilience, reducing negative self talk and more.\n\nHow have you all dealt with this? Feels like the profs are overworked and don't really want to talk to students!",

My uni is testing online books with built in video for their online courses, and it's a refreshing combination.",

For me I find that I learn best from either trail and error, or analyzing a problem from all angles.\nLike to understand a topic and grasp it I need to know how it all connects together on a practical level.\nIt has to be entertaining too, like youtube has saved my ass.\nLike I struggled for a long time with figuring out what proteins exactly are. Like people were like well they do xyz process, but I was like wtf why.\nFinally I learnt, they are amino-acids. Amino-acids are polypeptide chains. Peptide are made of nucleotides, that are made in the Ribosomes. Nucleotides are strings of nucleoacid.\nSo basically proteins are millions of different molecules that do different things depending on how they were made by RNA protein synthesis.\n Which translates to body functions.\n\nAlso negative reinforcement completely fucks me up, it is the absolute worst way to teach me. I fuck up more from negative reinforcement then anything else.",

I won\u2019t say that I\u2019m enjoying watching everyone struggle the way I have my whole life because I think everyone deserves equal access to education, but man do I feel vindicated. \n\nIt really sucks to have no choice but to try and do well in an environment that does nothing but fight you, doesn\u2019t it? I wish I had advice about dealing with it but given that I dropped out of school twice... I never figured it out. \n\nI just hope the fact that schools were totally unprepared (and are doing a shit job) to offer online learning at this scale doesn\u2019t completely ruin the reputation of distance education since many students rely on it.",

      "text": "I personally don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s much different from in person classes, at least with online classes I don\u2019t have to struggle to pay attention to some monotone lecture. And I always took online classes to be that you are basically teaching yourself - it\u2019s your responsibility to learn the material and have enough discipline to do so. Which, isn\u2019t easy. There\u2019s only so personal it can be. However, some professors suck and make this as difficult as possible whether it\u2019s with shitty resources/material or because they think their class is the only one you\u2019re taking and assign an insane amount of work.  \nAlso it\u2019s weird your professors don\u2019t offer office hours...that doesn\u2019t seem right. There\u2019s got to be at least some sort of offer to chat whether video or through app at the very least! I\u2019d double check your syllabus for each class or contact your professors. Regardless, if you need help you should be able to reach out and get it one way or another. My professors for math and science often hold lectures where they\u2019ll go over the material whether anyone shows up or not, but for other classes you\u2019re on your own (but MOST of my professors make it known again and again that they\u2019re there to help if you need it)\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling or having a hard time, reach out to your professor! Reach out to your class - I\u2019m not sure what system your college uses but mine has a way to message all the students in the class, which I\u2019ve done before when a particular assignment didn\u2019t make sense or I didn\u2019t understand a bunch of stuff and wanted to know if it was just me. Some professors have been extremely helpful with tips and pointers on getting the most out of the class. Others...I may as well not have said anything.\nI find that taking notes is helpful for me, even if the stuff the professor provides are in note form, it helps me learn if I go through and rewrite important stuff. I essentially try to kill two birds with one stone by learning through repetition while creating a \u201cquick\u201d study guide for myself. \nI also use sites like quizlet to not only study flash cards and guides other people made, but to make my own as well. But honestly what you said you do is pretty in line with what I do. Review the material, take a quiz. Review all that stuff, take an exam. Maybe a discussion board or small assignment in between.\nAlso, to be totally transparent I have had classes that were set up horribly and the professor wasn\u2019t the best and I just basically skated my way through and didn\u2019t learn shit.",

I do take notes and utilize most of the learning resources they give us. \n\nThey don't have office hours you can sign up for but you can email the profs to set up an appointment. They don't seem like they prefer you to talk to them so I have been hesitant to bother them since I'm not exactly struggling in the class.  I know they are balancing a lot. I actually like the lectures because it helps me to review the material in a different form so I miss that, I guess it depends on ones' learning style! The last online class I took had recorded lectures and office hours so it was super helpful for me!",
