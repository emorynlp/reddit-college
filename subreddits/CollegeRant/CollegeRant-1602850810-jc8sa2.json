I never attended this school prior to taking online classes. All three of my classes, I feel like I'm just teaching myself. We don't have lectures with the prof, they don't offer office hours. It's pretty much just, read the book, look at these other materials, take this multiple choice test/quiz. \n\nI feel a little frustrated to be paying like $2000 just to learn this material on my own. Anyone have tips on how to get the most out of it? :) I did make some group chat study groups with my peers. And I'm taking some of the colleges webinars on different lifeskills and such as well like resilience, reducing negative self talk and more.\n\nHow have you all dealt with this?

And I always took online classes to be that you are basically teaching yourself - it\u2019s your responsibility to learn the material and have enough discipline to do so. Which, isn\u2019t easy. There\u2019s only so personal it can be. However, some professors suck and make this as difficult as possible whether it\u2019s with shitty resources/material or because they think their class is the only one you\u2019re taking and assign an insane amount of work.  \nAlso it\u2019s weird your professors don\u2019t offer office hours...that doesn\u2019t seem right. There\u2019s got to be at least some sort of offer to chat whether video or through app at the very least! I\u2019d double check your syllabus for each class or contact your professors. Regardless, if you need help you should be able to reach out and get it one way or another. My professors for math and science often hold lectures where they\u2019ll go over the material whether anyone shows up or not, but for other classes you\u2019re on your own (but MOST of my professors make it known again and again that they\u2019re there to help if you need it)\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling or having a hard time, reach out to your professor! Reach out to your class - I\u2019m not sure what system your college uses but mine has a way to message all the students in the class, which I\u2019ve done before when a particular assignment didn\u2019t make sense or I didn\u2019t understand a bunch of stuff and wanted to know if it was just me. Some professors have been extremely helpful with tips and pointers on getting the most out of the class. Others...I may as well not have said anything.\nI find that taking notes is helpful for me, even if the stuff the professor provides are in note form, it helps me learn if I go through and rewrite important stuff. I essentially try to kill two birds with one stone by learning through repetition while creating a \u201cquick\u201d study guide for myself. \nI also use sites like quizlet to not only study flash cards and guides other people made, but to make my own as well. But honestly what you said you do is pretty in line with what I do. Review the material, take a quiz. Review all that stuff, take an exam. Maybe a discussion board or small assignment in between.\nAlso, to be totally transparent I have had classes that were set up horribly and the professor wasn\u2019t the best and I just basically skated my way through and didn\u2019t learn shit.", "author": "trippapotamus", "created": 1602861119, "upvotes": 2}, "g906lm1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jc8sa2/online_classes_anyone_else_feel_like_they_are/g906lm1/", "text": "I started my 1 year masters online this semester and I have 4 classes and I can tell you with full honesty that \n\nClass 1: he gives out so much work it takes up 90% of my time and he teaches like we have phds, so I never know what he's talking about\n\nClass 2: he started off really good with lighter reading and structured notes sheets, but now he won't give us the notes until after so we \"get what we need from the reading without them\" despite all of us saying it helped us.
