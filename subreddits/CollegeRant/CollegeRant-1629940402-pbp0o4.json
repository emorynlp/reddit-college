There are so many kids and the school has clearly not prepared the infrastructure for this. But the point is there are so many new folks here but yet everywhere I look it seems like folks are already part of a group and are walking together and hanging out in their own niche. I swear freshman seem to have more friends in 24 hours than I have had in my life lol. Also for context as I write this I basically spent 4-5 hours today walking around trying to hang out and play volleyball or go up and talk with folks but basically we hang for 10 mins and then they move on or start talking about stuff within their own group so it goes nowhere.\n\nSo I am a transfer student and its been really hard the past few days. I am seriously depressed rn as I write this since I cannot seem to find anyone to hang with or even get to know. I just walk around and kinda float from group to group but never fit in since they all know each other and talk about stuff within their group. This is my dream school and I am really happy to be here but don't want to spend my entire time here as an introvert. Yeah I'm living off campus which sucks but as a transfer I didn't get a dorm. I have tried reaching out to my 3 roomates but they seem more interested in living in their rooms playing video games with the volume all the way up. I'm serious. I leave at 6 am and come back around 7-8 pm and I hear the games being played when I leave and come back. I have tried saying lets hang out and have dinner or go to downtown and they be like yeah and then do nothing...\n\nNow yes I am an introvert but not like scared to talk with folks and I don't really have social anxiety too much. What I struggle with is inserting myself into groups or going up to folks, but if folks start chatting with me I'm good. I will be working in the dining center which hopefully will help and have season tickets to the fb games...\n\nThe problem is the folks who seem to be alone have earbuds in and are on their phones (and tbh I do this also way too much than I should) so its really hard to walk up to them. Even at the dining centers they are sitting by themselves on their pc or phone and so I dont really want to disturb them, but I also feel awkward going up to say 4-5 guys sitting together who obviously know each other and be like \"hey can I join yall\". So it seems I fall into just staring at my phone blankly not really doing anything on it but just trying to pretend like I'm not totally lost and out of it which I really really really hate.\n\nSo this long rant is to basically ask what should I do? I will definitely be signing up for some clubs when we have our club showcase in about a week but I really do want to make good friends here, not just meet folks but have a friend group I can feel comfortable around for the next several years. Last few days I have been on my school's reddit page asking folks if they want to meet for lunch or to hang and I have met a few people but we mainly talk for about 30 mins and then leave.\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated thanks so much for taking the time to read my droning monologue lol", "author": "seantaylornation21", "created": 1629940402, "retrieved": 1632841560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"had9at3": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbp0o4/please_please_help_me_with_socializing_tips/had9at3/", "text": "Thank you u/seantaylornation21 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
