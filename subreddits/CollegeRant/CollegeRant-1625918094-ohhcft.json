  "text": "Hello Reddit,\nThis was March of 2020 when the pandemic was on the rise and people were going into lockdown. I as well as my roommate were dorming when this shit storm was forming in the horizon. Before moving out we tried to get a refund but the server wasn\u2019t working; we were told it\u2019s because lots of ppl were using it. Couple of weeks pass by and we have cleaned and packed everything in our dorms, same results from the server. I woke up at 6 A.M. stayed up till 3 A.M. and still nothing! It wasn\u2019t until my roommate couldn\u2019t use google chrome at their work place and had to use Microsoft Edge that the server works perfectly. When I got the news I quickly tried Chrome, nothing but on Edge perfectly fine. To this day I am still very suspicious about admin withholding this information so that they can get as much money as they can. What do u think? Am I missing something?",
