That was probably more than I was suppose to do, so it seems reasonable that I get this violation.\n\nAnd it's just one grade, not for the entire class that gets the 0. Just that one assignment.\n\nHonestly it isn't that bad, but I'm just making it out to be and I feel so so so bad about it.\n\nIs it bad to be helpful? Too helpful- yeah probably me.\n\nI plan on having a discussion with the instructor about boundaries on Monday, but my spirit is crushed till then and I feel terrible- right after I was starting to feel good about too.", "author": "junkiyard_twinkie", "created": 1631900967, "retrieved": 1632841024, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "comments": {"hd8eqfx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pq520n/violation_over_my_head/hd8eqfx/", "text": "Thank you u/junkiyard_twinkie for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
