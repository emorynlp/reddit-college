From a fellow art student. I thought I was lucky to be in art school. \n\n\nI'm still grateful I'll have a certification, don't get me wrong. I'm literally only here so I get the damn paper. But art school is just not it, unless your school values creativity and truly mean it.\n\n\nBecause my school say they do but they don't. I just fucking hate how art works in schools or anywhere where you don't freelance. I hate rules. Hello this is fucking art WHY IS THERE RULES? \n\n\n1. So expensive. And my school is wasting 1 year to teach me non related shit. So that's thousands of dollars and 365 days down the drain not learning about my course lol\n\n\n2. No freedom. I thought being in art schools would grant me artistic freedom. Nope. I fucking hate how there's a structure to everything. You can't do this and that. This is wrong you are wrong. You are not good enough. Where's your critical thinking skills? Why are you not following the trend? \n\nExcuse me? Why the fuck would I follow a trend. I DONT CARE ABOUT TRENDS let me do wtf I want. I hate mindmaps. I hate how they think we have to be educated and thoroughly research on a topic. They say the right way to do art is to constantly reference other people and artists. They think \"plucking an idea from your head\" is wrong. \n\n\nNo..? I think it's great. It's where originality and fun is. Why the absolute fuck do you think I wanna base my art on some dumbass facts about this shit and that shit and look at this artist and that artist and try to blend everything and then call it my art? No. My art is literally the random shit from my head and I'm vomiting it out on paper so you can feed on it dummy. \n\nWhere's the fun in art if I HAVE to keep referencing?????????? Ughhh every time I'm told to do a mind map I get so mad fuck off fuck off fuck off and let me get ideas from last night's dream because that shit is way more entertaining than life.\n\n\nNothing wrong with getting inspiration but looking down on others for not wanting to think when it comes to art is just moronic. It's good to be educated but it shouldn't be a requirement. \n\n\nI NEVER reference my mind map. I just do it because I'm told to. \n\n\nIt's why I hate art schools. They mark based on their feelings. Just mark based on technicality\n\n\nI get they probably want to prepare me for clients and stuff, and that's why I regret art school. I thought it was the right choice because I liked it, but now that it's a probable career, I feel so constricted. I liked art because it was freeing and I can do whatever. But I know if I'm in it for the money I have to do it a certain way and that shit makes me maddddddd\n\n\nAnd why are we suppose to pick our careers as literal kids????? (16-17)\n\n\nAnyway I'm not saying art degrees are useless because they're not. A lot of art companies would hire people with any kind of art degree (most of them and also depends on how similar). I'm just ranting at how I'm still forced in a box , ik why so don't need to tell me twice just let me be mad", "author": "okbokchoy", "created": 1630600877, "retrieved": 1632948953, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hbclbcq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pglkgj/rant_about_art_schools/hbclbcq/", "text": "I remember after highschool I got rejected from an art school and I thought it was the end of the world, turns out it was the best thing that happened to me.

I know art can only be freeing as a hobby, anything else expect rules just like everything in this shabby society.
