They don't explicitly say this of course, and there are of course some good English professors out there that don't follow this. But why take the risk? This one is probably the worst given these classes tend to be designed around giving YOUR opinion/take on a topic, while simultaneously encouraging students to self-censor so they're garunteed a good grade. I think it creates an insular bubble of ideas in English departments/faculty when English should theoretically be one of the most free expression subjects.\n\nI've had assignments in a class where there were clear bonus points available. Do ___, get +5 points on this assignment. Ok simple enough. And the class also allowed late work for a small penalty. So I do the bonus and turn it in a day late. The hidden requirement on this one being apparently it's just \"common sense\" that you don't get bonus points you earned if it was turned in late. No mention ever of this rule in class, nothing in the syllabus about this. The rule itself isn't that bad, but if you never tell the students that's ridiculous.", "author": "thepurpleapollo", "created": 1610723098, "retrieved": 1632842974, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"gjs2xm6": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/kxwa26/i_hate_hidden_rulesrequirements/gjs2xm6/", "text": "Next time ask during syllabus day. You took this class years ago so learn from the mistake. Bonus work and points should technically be a bonus only if the assignment is turned in on time. So not turning the assignment in on time should disqualify you from the bonus. My professors do this all the time. At least they allowed late work, mine gives 0.   \nAlso if you took this class years ago I'm sure you had classes in between now and then, so make a document of questions to email or ask your teacher on syllabus day. The more you know the better. Now you know that for that class and some teachers turning in work late disqualifies you from extra credit.   \n\n\nYou shouldn't go around calling people names because they are making sense of the late policy rules for not getting extra credit.   \n\n\nThis is almost one of those rules you can assume.
