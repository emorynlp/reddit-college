  "text": "I do online classes thanks to the pandemic. I recently started working night shift and my classes are at 8 am every saturday. Our work needs to he completed by 11:59PM that day. Sense I was still new to nightahift i missed a few assignments towards the begining of class. But the last several chapters I've been doing the majority/all of the work needed. Saturday rolls around and I never get a zoom invite. I messages my classmates and they send me the invite. I enter and she's teaching class like normal. She notices kne of the students was trying to get her attention before to tell her she forgot to send me the link. She didn't realize I was there and told everyone I havent done ANY of my work and that she assumed I dropped out. I never communicated with her that I wanted to drop out and ive completed all the recent work. I should have communicated with her about my situation and gotten more time thats on me I get that. However she had no right to tell the other students about how she assumed that I dropped out and that I wasn't doing the work. I record all my zoom classes incase I need to go back, and I have her saying it recorded as well. I dont know what I should do in this situation. Should I do something? Could I do something? Idk. I just wanted to vent about my situation more then anything. Thanks for your time.",

If they *specifically* said that they *assumed* they dropped and didn't confirm that they dropped then it isn't ferpa. To top that off, the student didn't drop so it's false information. Second, the lack of work completion comment doesn't specifically state a grade so that also inst ferpa.",

      "text": "I had a prof who said that he \"dropped people from his course if they didnt show up to class\"\nIdk if profs have that kind of power since its OUR money, but then he said he had a student once who barely showed up. Dropped her and then she panicked because she waas no longer full time and it was affecting her student loans.\n\nI remember leaving class one day and a guy went to ask him why he gave him such a low mark on his paper and he said it was because skipped class all the time. There was no mention of that being a thing on the first day of class or syllabus. There was a separate mark for participation but not about it affecting other marks.\n\nI hated him. He was racist towards a student on the first day of class and she never showed up after that class/dropped it and heavily favored english majors (it was an english class) and rolled his eyes at anyonr who wasnt an english major.",
