{"sid": "ohbo9s", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohbo9s/i_hate_feeling_so_broke/", "title:": "I hate feeling so broke", "text": "I feel like crap how the students ive met at my college all seem like they come from wealthy rich or decent middle class families. \nHeck even the international kids i\u2019ve met are so loaded and are able to spend a shit ton money without any worries. One of the international students i met, found out they bought themselves a really nice mercedes. \nI know there\u2019s probably students at my college who are poor and not as wealthy just like me. But man, i feel like crying just seeing all these students traveling to places, going out to eat at nice restaurants, wearing clothes from popular stores and having brand named shoes, while there\u2019s me with crappy walmart clothes and ugly clothes that i dont even like but my mom bought cause they were on sale, and ofc my dorm room having 0 decorations cause i cant afford to decorate it at all. I\u2019m sure some of these rich looking kids work jobs to be able to buy themselves these things and be able to do stuff, but it just sucks that I cant do any of that.\nI\u2019m basically just stuck working, trying to save up enough during the summer to pay off some of the cost for college so my parents don\u2019t have to pay as much. \nAnd it sucks that my parents aren\u2019t as rich and wish i could ask them to give me money so i can buy stuff and have fun but I can\u2019t because they\u2019re already spending a good chunk of money for me to attend college, and i know they cant just blow off all their money on me since they need to provide for my siblings and for themselves atleast. I\u2019m grateful they\u2019re atleast paying some of my college expenses though.\nBut man, makes me wish that college was free tbh... probably would be able to have fun atleast if it were free and not have to worry about making sure that i have enough money to pay for the upcoming semester.", "author": "insecurechick4321", "created": 1625890231, "retrieved": 1632949568, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"h517dtm": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohbo9s/i_hate_feeling_so_broke/h517dtm/", "text": "Have you considered connecting with your school first gen/low income group?

I personally feel that I shouldn\u2019t have gone to college because my family and I couldn\u2019t really afford it (took out loans). I worked 2 jobs at one point and was barely scrapping by financially, mentally, and physically. I don\u2019t care about having nice clothes or a car but it does suck seeing people traveling and going out when you\u2019re stuck in the dorm or at home/work. Nice/professional clothes do help you make a good impression as well, especially when it comes to networking or getting internships. No lie, some professors will look at you differently if you don\u2019t dress well", "author": "CantuTwists", "created": 1625913549, "upvotes": 5}, "h4o814b": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohbo9s/i_hate_feeling_so_broke/h4o814b/", "text": "Hey I feel you on that, working class life aint no joke.  College should be free, 100% with you esp if money flow is low.\n\nIts def hard not to care about rich foos who dont have to worry about things but I would just try and find a crowd in a similar situation or folks you can relate to. But also, dwelling on this will def make you feel worse in the long run.\n\nIt's all up to you what direction you wanna go but my advice is that thrift clothes can look great cuz style goes a long way even its not name brand, it takes time but there are really some great gems if you look. I try to go shop alone and dedicate a day to it so I really look through everything to find goodies, if you can do that trust its worth it, DIY decorating is also rad cuz its more personal. Plus thrift stores also have hella frames , mirrors, or other stuff you can spruce up.\n\nI hope things get better. :(", "author": "yoyomomma420", "created": 1625894102, "upvotes": 9}, "h4o6fyk": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ohbo9s/i_hate_feeling_so_broke/h4o6fyk/", "text": "Hey!, I'm so sorry, I'm in the same position but overtime I decided to stop think too much about these. For last the two years, the clothes I got were neutral colours and basic, I've been learning how to paint to put up fanarts of my fav artists on wall, I've been saving up money to get more books. I'm currently doing a part-time that requires me to write a lot for not much money to get a kindle because my parents told me to wait for four months as we cannot afford rn. It feels very bad and I felt insignificant not being able to afford what everybody seemed to have. I'm not trying to impose anything, it could be different for different people but if you are unique about smth, focus your time on it and it'll attract people. You don't even have to do a lot. Just be patient and it's uncomfortable but please go through it. I don't want to dismiss by calling this a phase because we had to borrow money to pay my tution fees only to see rich kids flaunting. Online classes have made this a little bearable but hopefully you'll see there's nothing to all this.", "author": "morals404", "created": 1625892931, "upvotes": 3}}}
