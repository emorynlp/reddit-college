  "text": "I think online is beneficial for multiple reasons **AS LONG AS THE COURSE STRUCTURE IS MADE TO BE BENEFICIAL AND ADVANTAGEOUS FOR STUDENTS.**\n\nI have a professor who is going overboard as well as a professor who is structuring things beautifully. I am inspired to compile a list of things I think should be standard for online courses, feel free to add or rant.\n\n1. **Keep the due date time 11:59.** I'm tired of seeing these 12pms, 5pms, 8pm, etc.   \n\n2. **Upload the resources you intend on being of use.** No more saturated BlackBoard/icollege/etc pages with information that is never used. Only keep the important things that are pertinent to foundation knowledge and exams, pls.  \n\n3. **You cannot be hybrid asychronous/synchronous, pick one.** We adjust our schedules based on your structure, can't having you switching up and then me being accountable for lost information you spontaneously shared and never uploaded for me to know about. Sick of it.  \n\n4. **Please turn the mic up on your videos.** My speakers only go up to 100%, not 200%, not 300%...  \n\n5. **Please start yo class on time and finish on time.** I will not be held captive just because it is online.  \n\n6. **Sessions should be 85% covering material and 15% answering questions.** If I had a dollar for every time an instructor stopped to answer every question, I would not be here right now. I'm tired of only getting through 2 slides of a 90 slide ppt. PLS.  \n\n7. **Do not give break out sessions if the objective was not furfilled.** Its literally just 6 students in a chatroom and silence for like 20 minutes.",

Synchronous lectures hold participation points.\n\nI didn\u2019t sign up to have to log in at a separate date/time for a lecture; I signed up for the one which is suppose to be my lecture + lab. \nWe also have a lot of the work sheets that would\u2019ve been done in lecture due, as well our standard labs due once a week. These are due Friday and aren\u2019t released until Wednesday night.",
