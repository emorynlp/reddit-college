I am inspired to compile a list of things I think should be standard for online courses, feel free to add or rant.\n\n1. **Keep the due date time 11:59.** I'm tired of seeing these 12pms, 5pms, 8pm, etc.   \n\n2. **Upload the resources you intend on being of use.** No more saturated BlackBoard/icollege/etc pages with information that is never used. Only keep the important things that are pertinent to foundation knowledge and exams, pls.  \n\n3. **You cannot be hybrid asychronous/synchronous, pick one.** We adjust our schedules based on your structure, can't having you switching up and then me being accountable for lost information you spontaneously shared and never uploaded for me to know about. Sick of it.  \n\n4. **Please turn the mic up on your videos.** My speakers only go up to 100%, not 200%, not 300%...  \n\n5. **Please start yo class on time and finish on time.** I will not be held captive just because it is online.  \n\n6. **Sessions should be 85% covering material and 15% answering questions.** If I had a dollar for every time an instructor stopped to answer every question, I would not be here right now. I'm tired of only getting through 2 slides of a 90 slide ppt. PLS.  \n\n7. **Do not give break out sessions if the objective was not furfilled.** Its literally just 6 students in a chatroom and silence for like 20 minutes.", "author": "Ether_of_Joti", "created": 1631111345, "retrieved": 1632950312, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"he3fxm9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pkbmah/professors_need_a_damn_howto_online_circulum/he3fxm9/", "text": "6.
