To find who I am and who I want to be. While I\u2019m performing well academically, I feel I am faltering socially, emotionally. I\u2019m falling into old, inmature habits. I came here to better myself and I am failing. \n\nI wish to go to the gym. Get stronger. I wish to expand my knowledge on things that interest me. Get smarter. I wish to learn how to converse more appropriately. Get charismatic. \n\nSo many goals that I set for myself before coming here are quickly slipping away. Last night, I went out on a walk to find some meaning. I didn\u2019t, but the walk was nice regardless. Where do I find meaning? A purpose? What do I need to inspire change in myself? \n\nApologies for the rant. I can\u2019t be the only one who feels this way.", "author": "03kids", "created": 1632160137, "retrieved": 1632948461, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hdn04ik": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/przxx9/losing_sight_as_to_why_im_here/hdn04ik/", "text": "Yuuup. I feel the same way. I love my major, I really do, but recently the people I meet (or the lack-of) and the inadequacies in myself keep adding up.  It might be burn-out, but I felt that last spring. I don't know what I want specialize in directly out of college and it's never bothered me before, but now it's like I have blinders on.\n\nTwo semesters left.

College is a business that sells paper tickets to people that they use to get jobs. Very expensive pieces of paper called degrees. If you don't already have a job you want to do in mind, college isn't worth messing with because a majority of degrees are useless.\n\nIf you're looking to find meaning and understanding in life through college, you'll be left angry, depressed, and disappointed. Understanding life and what you're supposed to do is up to you and it can be daunting. Not everyone has everything figured out and a lot of people just happened to wind up in their current situation. If you want to make changes (like working out, making friends, etc.) YOU have to be your own motivator. You have to discipline yourself to do these things and nothing in life will be able to do that for you.", "author": "Fuck-College", "created": 1632171494, "upvotes": 4}}}
