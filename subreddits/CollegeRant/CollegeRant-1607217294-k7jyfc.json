Not only are we mentally and emotionally exhausted from the semester already, we are expect to work ten times harder then we did all semester.\n\nI don\u2019t have the motivation in me to do 3 100 point assignments, one end of the year portfolio, two exams I have to study hours for, work a full time job and make sure I finish the semester with a 3.0 GPA. \n\nI have cried myself to sleep every night this week and broke down at work to the point I had to go to my car. I cried so hard that I started hyperventilating. I haven\u2019t cried that hard since I was a kid.\n\nThis week I haven\u2019t had any free time. I have had friends asking me to go out and I\u2019m not able to because I need all the free time I have to work on homework.\n\nSo college professors, please don\u2019t make the end of the semester the hardest part of the semester. We are not only kids, we shouldn\u2019t have to be more responsible then most adults.
