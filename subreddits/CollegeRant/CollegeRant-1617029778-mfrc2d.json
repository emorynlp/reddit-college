Many of the students in this program are fresh out of high school. I\u2019m not. I work all week. I have two special needs children. My time is limited. I complete the reading all week, and sit down to do my assignments on Wednesday evenings, and all day Saturdays and Sundays. Assignments aren\u2019t due until Sunday at midnight. Sometimes I don\u2019t turn something in until Sunday afternoon, but still several hours before the due date/time.\n\nSo why is my instructor harping in me to turn my assignments in sooner (generally get an email from her on Thursdays) when I have plenty of time left to complete an assignment?! Not a gentle reminder about what assignments are needed for the rest of the week to the whole class. An email sent specifically to me and me alone where she states she is worried that I\u2019m not able to keep up because my assignments aren\u2019t turned in earlier in the week like my peers (generally younger, with less perceived responsibility).\n\nI asked if something differed between the due dates in Canvas and on the syllabus versus what she had listed on her end. Nope! She just thinks I should be turning in assignments well before the due date and that it somehow relates to my understanding of material (ie, I must not be understanding concepts if I take my time to synthesize the content into assignment objectives). \n\n*eyeroll* Nothing salacious...just annoying", "author": "mother_of_nerd", "created": 1617029778, "retrieved": 1632843454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 46, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gsoyvjx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/mfrc2d/assignment_turn_in_date_issue/gsoyvjx/", "text": "Thank you u/mother_of_nerd for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
