I am currently attending Syracuse, and I want to try to apply to GA Tech again in for the spring or even next fall. But with my GPA currently at a 2.99, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to compete when the average GPA for transfer applicants is a 3.8. \n\nEven if I were to get straight As for the next semester or two at SU, the raise won\u2019t be significant enough. This might sound really dumb, but instead of staying at SU, I was thinking about transferring to GSU Perimeter College (2-year, REPP partnered with GA Tech) to reset my GPA so that it\u2019s easier for me to aim for that 3.8 GPA.

GSU\u2019s coursework is literally a cakewalk compared to GT\u2019s, so be prepared to work a lot harder. besides GPA, do you have any relevant experiences, like internships? i believe those are also taken into consideration. even if you did the GSU-GT pathway, they will require your past transcript from SU and will factor your previous coursework and grades. those don\u2019t disappear.\n\nanyway, i would highly suggest staying at SU. after building your resume, apply to GT for grad school. it\u2019s not worth incurring debt. transfer students hardly get any financial support, especially OOS. if you were in-state with Zell or Hope scholarship, that would be a different story.", "author": "kaytherine", "created": 1624570223, "upvotes": 4}, "h2wpn37": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o74718/transfer_from_4_year_to_2_year_then_back_to/h2wpn37/", "text": "Why not just finish at Syracuse?
