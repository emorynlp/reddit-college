  "text": "I applied to GA Tech with the Talent Initiative Pathway and got denied admission after going through a year of bad mental health while taking online courses. I am currently attending Syracuse, and I want to try to apply to GA Tech again in for the spring or even next fall. But with my GPA currently at a 2.99, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to compete when the average GPA for transfer applicants is a 3.8. \n\nEven if I were to get straight As for the next semester or two at SU, the raise won\u2019t be significant enough. This might sound really dumb, but instead of staying at SU, I was thinking about transferring to GSU Perimeter College (2-year, REPP partnered with GA Tech) to reset my GPA so that it\u2019s easier for me to aim for that 3.8 GPA. What do you think?",

Get your first year or two done at 1/4 the cost with small class sizes and closer relationships with faculty. Start at small schools, build a track record of success, THEN transfer completed areas of classes and finish and get your diploma from Tech, State, etc.",

GPA isn\u2019t as important because colleges understand you\u2019re taking a college course load which is inherently harder than high school. i transferred to a school i never would\u2019ve gotten into straight out of high school.",

      "text": "i\u2019m in-state and my friends and family go to GT. GSU\u2019s coursework is literally a cakewalk compared to GT\u2019s, so be prepared to work a lot harder. besides GPA, do you have any relevant experiences, like internships? i believe those are also taken into consideration. even if you did the GSU-GT pathway, they will require your past transcript from SU and will factor your previous coursework and grades. those don\u2019t disappear.\n\nanyway, i would highly suggest staying at SU. after building your resume, apply to GT for grad school. it\u2019s not worth incurring debt. transfer students hardly get any financial support, especially OOS. if you were in-state with Zell or Hope scholarship, that would be a different story.",
