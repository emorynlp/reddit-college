  "text": "I have a mental disorder and a disability accomodation. My professor knows about this. Last week, I didn't do the readings. The professor decided to check who is and isnt doing the readings by giving out a surprise pop quiz. No surprised, I failed because I didn't do the readings. Most of the class didn't do the readings either because after he looked at the quizzes, he went on a long vent about how if we're not going to do the readings, we should withdraw from the class because the students who don't do the readings are taking up the spots of the students who want to take the class but couldn't get in. I'm a senior and he said \"I have no patience for seniors who can't do a little reading\". He didn't even consider the fact that some of us are going through some stuff and couldn't get the readings done on time.",

      "text": "If you have an accommodation, it usually grants you extra time to complete quizzes and other assignments. However, failing to meet the baseline requirements of the course (completing the assigned readings) isn\u2019t a reasonable accommodation. Your professor expects you and all students to meet these baseline requirements. To expect anything less would be to infantilize you and your abilities. The best advice I can give would be to see if you can work with the Professor to give you time and a half on quizzes. No course is likely to exempt you from completing weekly readings behind the pace of the course, as this puts you behind in class discussion, which makes it impossible for you to participate. Try to see this as a learning experience. One way to way to keep up with the fast-paced nature of any course would be to give yourself enough time during a time of day that you know you are at your best (for me that is usually earlier in the day when I know I am less distracted and emotional) to read the piece over and note anything that seemed important. \n\nAnd as for feeling hurt by this, I understand. However, failing to complete readings for a class is not an issue that is personal in nature. Yes, maybe your professor seemed upset, but they have plenty of reason to. Your feelings are valid, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Professor has a *personal* gripe with you.",

          "text": "It is unlikely that an accommodation would grant OP an extension to complete readings. Completing readings on time is often the baseline of expectations in a course, and most official accommodations that are registered with the Dean\u2019s office have to be \u201creasonable\u201d meaning, they do not exempt students from meeting course expectations. The Deans office\u2019s thinking is that if student has extra time to complete readings, they will fall behind in the pacing of the course and be unable to participate, which is not sustainable. Accommodations that are officially registered with the school are intended to grant students things like reduced distraction environments for test taking, extended time for quizzes and exams, memory aids, preferential seating, or occasional deadline extensions on major assignments. When you need an extension, you often have to prove or show that you are working towards whatever the assignment is. In this case OP simply did not do the reading, which is a different case entirely. \nThe accommodation policy at most colleges state something like: \u201caccommodations should not exempt to interfere with the essential requirements of the course.\u201d",
