My professor knows about this. Last week, I didn't do the readings. The professor decided to check who is and isnt doing the readings by giving out a surprise pop quiz. No surprised, I failed because I didn't do the readings. Most of the class didn't do the readings either because after he looked at the quizzes, he went on a long vent about how if we're not going to do the readings, we should withdraw from the class because the students who don't do the readings are taking up the spots of the students who want to take the class but couldn't get in. I'm a senior and he said \"I have no patience for seniors who can't do a little reading\". He didn't even consider the fact that some of us are going through some stuff and couldn't get the readings done on time.", "author": "No_Stock_6643", "created": 1632274358, "retrieved": 1632948452, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "comments": {"he5zq25": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psx10d/my_professor_hurt_my_feelings_last_week/he5zq25/", "text": "If you have an accommodation, it usually grants you extra time to complete quizzes and other assignments. However, failing to meet the baseline requirements of the course (completing the assigned readings) isn\u2019t a reasonable accommodation. Your professor expects you and all students to meet these baseline requirements. To expect anything less would be to infantilize you and your abilities. The best advice I can give would be to see if you can work with the Professor to give you time and a half on quizzes. No course is likely to exempt you from completing weekly readings behind the pace of the course, as this puts you behind in class discussion, which makes it impossible for you to participate. Try to see this as a learning experience. One way to way to keep up with the fast-paced nature of any course would be to give yourself enough time during a time of day that you know you are at your best (for me that is usually earlier in the day when I know I am less distracted and emotional) to read the piece over and note anything that seemed important. \n\nAnd as for feeling hurt by this, I understand. However, failing to complete readings for a class is not an issue that is personal in nature. Yes, maybe your professor seemed upset, but they have plenty of reason to. Your feelings are valid, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Professor has a *personal* gripe with you.", "author": "luckystrike131", "created": 1632533270, "upvotes": 2}, "hdvsniw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psx10d/my_professor_hurt_my_feelings_last_week/hdvsniw/", "text": "Wait what disability prevents you from reading?", "author": "Spicybooiii", "created": 1632339366, "upvotes": 1}, "hdsq0m9": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psx10d/my_professor_hurt_my_feelings_last_week/hdsq0m9/", "text": "If it he said it aloud instead of saying it directly to you I think he was probably addressing the other students, I don\u2019t think he meant to call you out or anything.", "author": "BoysenberryLatter569", "created": 1632277372, "upvotes": 13}, "hdsorlp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/psx10d/my_professor_hurt_my_feelings_last_week/hdsorlp/", "text": "Did you inform your professor that you would need extra time on the readings?", "author": "tryingyourbest", "created": 1632276760, "upvotes": 3}}}
