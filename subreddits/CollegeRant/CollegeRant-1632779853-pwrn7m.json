Labs are the most stressful class for me and they make me question if I even enjoy this. I\u2019m so scared I\u2019m gonna break something/cause an accident. I have to read the lab procedures like 3 times in a row just to be sure what I\u2019m doing is right and god forbid if I have a partner then I feel like I\u2019m holding them back. Ik most Bio work is lab work and for that reason alone its taking out all the passion/interest I once had. Not sure if this is actually a sign for me to say fuck it and change my major or if its just a rough patch and I need to power through it\u2026", "author": "Harpo1999", "created": 1632779853, "retrieved": 1632840981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heis3pw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwrn7m/labs_are_my_breaking_point/heis3pw/", "text": "Thank you u/Harpo1999 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
