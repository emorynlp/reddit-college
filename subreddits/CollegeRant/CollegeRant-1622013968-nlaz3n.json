When Spring quarter hit, I was suddenly homeless and things were very unstable. Shortly after the homelessness, I got COVID and was down for 2 weeks, unable to work or do school work from how sick I was. I emailed all of my teachers and received extensions on all of my work. I worked on everything I could and ended up having a place to stay so things got better. Then that all tumbled down when I no longer had stable internet or a place to stay. I reached out again and surprisingly my professors were kind and helpful and understanding once again. They gave me an extra week extension. The only problem is I finally found an apartment and have had no one to help me move, so my studies have been neglected. I feel like a total failure! But I reached out again and I am waiting to hear back from my professors. I missed the final deadline tonight and had a total mental breakdown. I want to be in school so badly, and things are just now getting better! But it seems like every time I get better theres something else to push me down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my point here is I don't know whether I should drop out and damage my GPA + lose all that money, or if I should just take the heat from my professors and try to salvage at least a 2.0. The only issue with that is, regardless of which choice I make I'll lose my scholarship for fall quarter.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore and I feel like I have no support at all. The school is kind, but I can't help but feel like my professors are so annoyed with me and are tired of my lack of follow through. I totally understand their perspective if that is the case! I would feel the same as a teacher. But at the same time, I'm a smart student and have done so well up until now. It's literally just my life situation has gotten in the way. I'm so angry at all of this and wish I had just dropped the quarter right when I got covid so I could receive a refund and not worry about my scholarship.\n\nAnyways, rant over. Have any of you been in this situation? If so, what did you ultimately do?", "author": "anthrosaturn", "created": 1622013968, "retrieved": 1632949787, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"gzhmoll": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nlaz3n/im_drowning_in_my_coursework_and_i_dont_know_what/gzhmoll/", "text": "I have no advice, but only condolences.
