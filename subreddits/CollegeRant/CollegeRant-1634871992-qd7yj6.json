  "text": "So to shorten a long story, I\u2019m in my third year of undergrad pursuing a degree in business/economics. During my 2nd year I took an EMT class and got a part-time job as a 911 EMT in my area and now I\u2019m fully enrolled in paramedic school and I\u2019m still part time at my undergrad school. I think that EMS is my passion and I was even thinking about fire service but I was wondering if I should continue towards my degree. Is it worth it at this point? Been really stressed lately from my parents and work and I just want to do what\u2019s best for me I guess idk. I really don\u2019t like my degree and I\u2019m just getting it to please my parents i guess\n\nTL;DR 3rd year in undergrad, currently in paramedic school, should I finish my degree, not having fun",

      "text": "If promotion to a position like battalion chief is something you would like, maybe finishing your degree might be worth it. I know some departments may not require it, but I have seen firefighters/police finishing their degree at my university for promotion reasons. Please correct me if I'm wrong though! I'm glad you found your passion though, choose what's best for you and brings you happiness. There's time to make this decision, try to talk to someone with experience in your field to see what you want",

If it is a small amount or you can pay for it out of pocket, I would say finish your degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. How hard are the classes? If there is a chance of you having to stay longer than the next year and a half, consider stopping. If it's a breeze, I would continue.",
