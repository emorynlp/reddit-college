  "text": " \n\nI graduated high school a few months ago. It's officially time to go to college and I'm just so fucking lost.\n\nI am usually a person who believes in myself and knows what I'm capable of but the world just got too real all of a sudden and now I've realized that I truly am embarking on a journey of my own and I still am not sure wtf to do with my life. I'm a creative; I've always been. I'm going that route but my parents have an inkling that it's probably not the smartest idea because \"creativity is not practical\".\n\nI'm scared of failing in life, I really am. I know it's pointless but I'm fucking terrified. I wanna be successful so bad and I'm ready to be just that, but, I feel like nobody around me really believes in me and it's hard to keep faith in myself if the people closest to me don't feel the same way.\n\nI'm just so fucking lost. And I feel defeated already and I haven't even started yet. Kinda wanna disappear off the face of the Earth for years and float into the abyss mindlessly.\n\nAnyway, this was just a rant that I wanted to share with you guys (for some reason). Merci for listening.",

The only difference was that I didn't necessarily take the creative route nor did I care about how successful my life would turn out post-college. I honestly didn't care about anything.\n\nNow that I finally have a sense of what I truly want to do, I care to the point of being scared for my future and what is to come. But let me tell you, the feeling of being scared beats the feeling of being totally numb and apathetic by a long shot. Just knowing that I have a purpose and something to work towards makes life feel like living.\n\nI live by k.flay's lyric, \"The only thing to fear is never being scared.\" Because in my experience, it's true.",

I personally would continue with your plan to major in something creative. Have you thought about how you might combine creative and practical? For instance, maybe you become an art teacher, something like that. Also, depending on your area, or geographic location, there might even be money in the creative work you do. Maybe you could double major in business and your creative field----business can be quite an easy major, at least one less focused on grades.",

I came to the realization that it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, to put it as simply as possible (for more, look into stoicism).\n\nAll I can say is, make your resum\u00e8 fat early. Do something on the side throughout your years, be it a job, volunteer, organization, build a skill, languages, whatever. The resum\u00e8 is you, and you\u2019ll want to be as confident as possible when giving it and talking about the things you\u2019ve done during your interviews. To start, look at work-study opportunities at the college, that way the job fits reasonably into your schedule. Being the creative-type is awesome and admirable enough, as you could probably have a profitable hobby with that early. But you also need to have work experience alongside that, and the best way is with a position of sorts. Think less about getting the skill, and more about getting the position so you can talk about/build on the experience.",

      "text": "I think most people feel like that a lot of the time. I mean, you go to school from preschool-12th grade. What's that, 14 years? You get jammed with all kinds of information. No time to reflect on what it means to you. In the upper grades there is little to no time spent on how \"subjects\" translate into \"jobs\". What a huge mega-void. Right through 12th grade what happens? Still on \"subject matter\" not on \"real world opportunities\". \n\nThen when you are done with hs you're expected to \"know\" what you want to do? What is it, magic? No. It's crazy. You have your head down all these years to be filled up and now it's \"heads up\" time? Nuts. It doesn't happen like that.\n\nI think maybe getting a part- time job can help you to know what you don't want to do and maybe what you might want to do. You need experiences. A measly paycheck is great incentive to find better and find out what you want. Cause you don't want to work for nothing, doing something you hate forever. It's like wearing shoes that are too tight. All.the.time.\n\nMaybe take some community college classes. Maybe look into technical school. Blue collar jobs pay well and you won't have to do it forever if you don't want to. Once you get a little money travel.\n\nLook into the Occupational Outlook Handbook. [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)   It has a lot of information like occupation bands, work conditions, growth, pay. It's a start. What subject did you like in school? Maybe start there.\n\nThe thing is, you have to look inside yourself now. We aren't really taught how to process all of that information that was thrown at us and apply it to ourselves. We don't know what suits us because we spent our lives with our heads being filled with information. At the end of that education is a chasm between knowledge we gained and principals of reflective application that was never discussed. \n\nAdd to that a pandemic that is up and down and messing with everyone. Yeah. Total stress. But you do have time. Be kind to yourself. You are young. Give yourself time to sort it out. You aren't alone. Not by a long shot.",

Travel around as much as possible \u2014 even if it\u2019s just weekend trips with friends, (assuming it\u2019s safe, pandemic-wise)  see if you can get something going first. Practice making friends and connections outside of a \u201cschool\u201d environment. \n\n\nLike, it may give you an idea of what kind of work you want, or what salary range you want or where you want to be. It\u2019s 100% normal to not be sure of what you want to do with the rest of your life just out of Hs, and even if you were super-super sure, it\u2019s just as normal to change your mind years down the line.",
