It's officially time to go to college and I'm just so fucking lost.\n\nI am usually a person who believes in myself and knows what I'm capable of but the world just got too real all of a sudden and now I've realized that I truly am embarking on a journey of my own and I still am not sure wtf to do with my life. I'm a creative; I've always been. I'm going that route but my parents have an inkling that it's probably not the smartest idea because \"creativity is not practical\".\n\nI'm scared of failing in life, I really am. I know it's pointless but I'm fucking terrified. I wanna be successful so bad and I'm ready to be just that, but, I feel like nobody around me really believes in me and it's hard to keep faith in myself if the people closest to me don't feel the same way.\n\nI'm just so fucking lost. And I feel defeated already and I haven't even started yet.

I came to the realization that it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, to put it as simply as possible (for more, look into stoicism).\n\nAll I can say is, make your resum\u00e8 fat early. Do something on the side throughout your years, be it a job, volunteer, organization, build a skill, languages, whatever. The resum\u00e8 is you, and you\u2019ll want to be as confident as possible when giving it and talking about the things you\u2019ve done during your interviews. To start, look at work-study opportunities at the college, that way the job fits reasonably into your schedule. Being the creative-type is awesome and admirable enough, as you could probably have a profitable hobby with that early. But you also need to have work experience alongside that, and the best way is with a position of sorts. Think less about getting the skill, and more about getting the position so you can talk about/build on the experience.", "author": "Zealomon", "created": 1628122829, "upvotes": 2}, "h7pxcec": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/oxuvu5/i_feel_so_fucking_lost/h7pxcec/", "text": "Take a gap year if you want.

I mean, you go to school from preschool-12th grade. What's that, 14 years? You get jammed with all kinds of information. No time to reflect on what it means to you. In the upper grades there is little to no time spent on how \"subjects\" translate into \"jobs\". What a huge mega-void. Right through 12th grade what happens? Still on \"subject matter\" not on \"real world opportunities\". \n\nThen when you are done with hs you're expected to \"know\" what you want to do? What is it, magic? No. It's crazy. You have your head down all these years to be filled up and now it's \"heads up\" time? Nuts. It doesn't happen like that.\n\nI think maybe getting a part- time job can help you to know what you don't want to do and maybe what you might want to do. You need experiences. A measly paycheck is great incentive to find better and find out what you want. Cause you don't want to work for nothing, doing something you hate forever. It's like wearing shoes that are too tight. All.the.time.\n\nMaybe take some community college classes. Maybe look into technical school. Blue collar jobs pay well and you won't have to do it forever if you don't want to. Once you get a little money travel.\n\nLook into the Occupational Outlook Handbook. [https://www.bls.gov/ooh/](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)   It has a lot of information like occupation bands, work conditions, growth, pay. It's a start. What subject did you like in school? Maybe start there.\n\nThe thing is, you have to look inside yourself now. We aren't really taught how to process all of that information that was thrown at us and apply it to ourselves. We don't know what suits us because we spent our lives with our heads being filled with information. At the end of that education is a chasm between knowledge we gained and principals of reflective application that was never discussed. \n\nAdd to that a pandemic that is up and down and messing with everyone. Yeah. Total stress. But you do have time. Be kind to yourself. You are young. Give yourself time to sort it out. You aren't alone.

Travel around as much as possible \u2014 even if it\u2019s just weekend trips with friends, (assuming it\u2019s safe, pandemic-wise)  see if you can get something going first.
