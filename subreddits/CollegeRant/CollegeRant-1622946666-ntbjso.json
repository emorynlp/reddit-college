Should I report it? *Read desc. for context*", "text": "Hey everyone! This is my first post on reddit. I apologize if my formatting is off.\n\nFor context, I am taking an online class with a new professor. The class is small with only 10 students. My university requires all professors to use Blackboard, but my professor doesn\u2019t know how to use it well. She has us post all of our assignments on the discussion board. We had a case study due this week which was 6-10 pages typed. Responding to others in this class is optional, but I always read other posts to see if there is anything interesting to respond to. In reading others, I noticed one was quite similar to mine, word for word and some words changed around. My writing is quite distinct and I always make it a point to write things in my own words. Moreover, I had a long reference page for this assignment and she did not cite anything. Out of curiosity, I ran my assignment against hers using Copy Leaks. It came back being about 20% similar. (I took a screenshot of the results just in case)\n\n   I was the first one who posted this assignment to the board and hers was last. I have no idea who this girl is. She was able to access my paper because our professor has us post everything to the discussion board. For anyone who doesn't know, Blackboard has a setting where professors can require students to post first before viewing other student's posts. Because my professor does not have this setting, everyone can see what you wrote before they post their own assignment. \n\n  I am super pissed. I also have horrible anxiety and I am concerned that my professor will think that I passed my assignment on to this girl to copy. I am a rising senior with plans to go to grad school and I don't need some entitled, lazy, person to come and sabotage that for me. I have a 3.85 GPA and have been on the deans list every semester since my freshman year. At the same time, I am not sure if I should bring this up to the professor. I don't want to be a snitch or cause any drama. What should I do? \n\nTLDR-Someone copied my assignment from a discussion board. Judging by previous posts, this isn't the first time she has done this. For anyone who doesn't know, Blackboard has a setting where professors can require students to post first before viewing other student's posts. Because my professor does not have this setting, everyone can see what you wrote before they post their own assignment. Copy Leaks said the assignment was significantly similar to mine. I am unsure of if I should report this to the professor or wait to see what she says when she grades the assignment.", "author": "ghostgal127", "created": 1622946666, "retrieved": 1632949742, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h0u7dc8": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ntbjso/someone_copied_my_discussion_board_post_should_i/h0u7dc8/", "text": "Yes, report it now. \n\nIf the professor doesn't understand Blackboard, they may think you copied the other student.

Having a good rapport with professors is also a big deal when later asking for LoR, for example.\n\nBut why not also message her before, when you noticed she was using blackboard wrong? If you are nice about it, and don't tell her publicly of course, but rather in email, then she will likely appreciate the help. Most profs hate when students cheat. Also, if you tell her about the issue first, you will remove any chance at being accused, whereas if she notices first, you're right, you may get in trouble too.
