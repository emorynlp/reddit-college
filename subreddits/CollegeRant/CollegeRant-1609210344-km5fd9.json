Perhaps I\u2019ve gotten comfortable not being obligated to wake by certain times everyday or not having deadlines to dread and slug through. I feel as though opening my school laptop again is accepting that I\u2019m willing to go through all of that again. I don\u2019t know if this is a rant or if I\u2019m asking for help but I needed somewhere to vent and this place seemed close enough.", "author": "TheZarcFiles", "created": 1609210344, "retrieved": 1632950340, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 201, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"ghfyfrg": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/km5fd9/im_scared_to_prepare_for_school_again/ghfyfrg/", "text": "Maybe set a mini schedule on break like going to bed by a certain time and waking up at a certain time.

I havent started reading my readings, research papers and group projects bc i decided to sleep. The only advice i can give you is workout probably 1 hour before starting your academic responsibilities, it clears up the brain fog and the happy hormones is there to pump u up, try to avoid coffee or else anxiety, oh and list down what you have to accomplish, try to finish the easiest? At least you can easily cross that out of the list :)", "author": null, "created": 1609252274, "upvotes": 5}, "ghdygyp": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/km5fd9/im_scared_to_prepare_for_school_again/ghdygyp/", "text": "PTSD\u2014it\u2019s real.

I'm a senior in engineering,  just came back home for break, and let me tell you after this semester, I NEVER want to look at anything school related ever again. However I'm still going to. \n\nYou're in school for a reason right? I'm assuming because you want a good job and set yourself up for a good future. Just keep that in mind because school ISN'T supposed to be fun, ESPECIALLY engineering. It's supposed to teach you how to solve real-world problems like this one. I wouldn't DARE trust an engineer on the field who can't control their emtions simply because it is not safe nor logical. \n\nCut yourself some slack though becuase first, you're a freshman with lots of time and second, covid fucked everyone's education up, not just yours, and professors are equally human and capable of being shitty instructors/people without meaning to. We all were this year. I understand your sentiment, I really do but times like these call for more strength than we can muster unfortunately, hence your anxiety about next semester. \n\nKeep your sights set on graduation and your future. You'll figure it out.
