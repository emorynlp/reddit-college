  "text": "I\u2019ve been on winter break from college for a couple of weeks now and I think it\u2019s about time I admit that I\u2019m anxious about opening my school dedicated laptop and going through my emails and prepping for next semester and the year after that and figuring out apartments for housing next year. Perhaps I\u2019ve gotten comfortable not being obligated to wake by certain times everyday or not having deadlines to dread and slug through. I feel as though opening my school laptop again is accepting that I\u2019m willing to go through all of that again. I don\u2019t know if this is a rant or if I\u2019m asking for help but I needed somewhere to vent and this place seemed close enough.",

It doesn\u2019t have to be super early or anything but making somewhat of a schedule will help. I suggest even just picking up books for fun and getting into the habit of reading again of you don\u2019t mind writing maybe even doing some free writes",

I havent started reading my readings, research papers and group projects bc i decided to sleep. The only advice i can give you is workout probably 1 hour before starting your academic responsibilities, it clears up the brain fog and the happy hormones is there to pump u up, try to avoid coffee or else anxiety, oh and list down what you have to accomplish, try to finish the easiest? At least you can easily cross that out of the list :)",

I'm a senior in engineering,  just came back home for break, and let me tell you after this semester, I NEVER want to look at anything school related ever again. However I'm still going to. \n\nYou're in school for a reason right? I'm assuming because you want a good job and set yourself up for a good future. Just keep that in mind because school ISN'T supposed to be fun, ESPECIALLY engineering. It's supposed to teach you how to solve real-world problems like this one. I wouldn't DARE trust an engineer on the field who can't control their emtions simply because it is not safe nor logical. \n\nCut yourself some slack though becuase first, you're a freshman with lots of time and second, covid fucked everyone's education up, not just yours, and professors are equally human and capable of being shitty instructors/people without meaning to. We all were this year. I understand your sentiment, I really do but times like these call for more strength than we can muster unfortunately, hence your anxiety about next semester. \n\nKeep your sights set on graduation and your future. You'll figure it out. You have to. \ud83d\ude4f",

One thing that helps me with that is to pick a fun piece that I really want to play, something with a bit of a challenge but not crazy hard. I use that as a reward for doing the not-so-fun parts of practice, as motivation to pick up my violin, and to remind myself how much I love playing. Because we all need to be reminded why we do hours of scales. Keep pushing through and good luck future colleague!",
