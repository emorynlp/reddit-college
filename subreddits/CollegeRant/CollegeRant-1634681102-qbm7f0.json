  "text": "im a second year psychology major. growing up i loved school and i was the first person in my family (grandparents, parents, and three older siblings included) to graduate high school. now im the first to be in college and i have no idea what im doing. i feel so lost compared to all of my friends. one of them was already talking about grad school last week and it\u2019s stressing me out. not to mention, i just found out that my financial aid didn\u2019t carry over from last year because I had horrible grades due to a depressive episode and now i have a horrible gpa and have to figure out loans or how to get $12k by next semester. if i don\u2019t have financial aid i am starting to wonder if it\u2019s worth it to put myself so far in debt. i hate school now and going to class makes me so miserable. i can\u2019t drop out and fuck up like the rest of my family. did anyone else absolutely hate college and get over it eventually? im trying to see if this feeling will ever go away. \n\nTL;DR: i hate college and i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ll ever stop hating it.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a freshman so I don\u2019t know a lot, but maybe to relieve some stress and anxiety I would recommend going to a counselor on or off campus. I\u2019ve had a really tough time fitting in and feeling comfortable at the school I\u2019m at and when I went to the counselor they have on campus it really helped me with my anxiety. I still don\u2019t like the school and might transfer but at least the counselor makes it bearable. I\u2019m sorry your having a difficult time.",
