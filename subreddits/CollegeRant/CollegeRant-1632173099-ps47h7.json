Can we get past that?", "text": "&#x200B;\n\nI love my roommate to death. I really do. She's fantastic, probably the best roommate I've had in the almost 4 years I've been in college.\n\nBut shit, like I can't get it through her head that my major isn't hers. She's in a major similar to sports medicine and I'm in STEM. I won't say that mine is more difficult because I feel like there's an elitism already present in STEM that's annoying enough -- for the sake of the post, just know the amount of effort that goes into passing our classes differ a lot. She attends class maybe once per week and does perfectly fine while I'm out of the apartment 5-6 hours of the weekday. No hate, I'm super envious of her.\n\nSince we started the semester she has commented on how much time I'm gone, how long I spend doing homework, ect because she likes to go out drinking. I'd love to go with her, but I can't. It's starting to sound like she's complaining more than just stating the obvious.\n\nIt's been like that for \\*weeks\\*. \"You work too much\", \"skip class today\", \"give yourself a break\". Very nice comments, but I **can't**. Maybe it wouldn't bother me if I wasn't so burned out. This is my second to last semester, so I really can't screw this up. I'm taking my hardest classes and the more she mentions it the more upset I get. It makes me feel like the time I put into college isn't worth it because I'm not doing amazing compared to other people.\n\nThen there are those occasions where I'll vent a bit to her at the end of the day and tell her how much homework I have and she'll try to one-up me by saying she has the same. That's where I think I might be wrongfully resenting her because maybe she's just trying to sympathize by relating to me. Idk.\n\nI just wish she wouldn't be so pushy when inviting me out when it's on the same days I've told her 1000x that I'm busy. The comments I get are always \"oh wow\" or \"that sucks\" or \"I could never do that\". Usually, I'd be totally fine with the sympathy since most of my friends aren't in STEM or work-heavy fields... but the way she says it is like my school work is a detriment to her and it ends up rubbing off on me.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the rant time!\n\n**tldr**; My roommate is comments 24/7 about how much my coursework sucks and how much time I work on it.", "author": "anabsolutebanger", "created": 1632173099, "retrieved": 1632948454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 25, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdn4aml": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ps47h7/i_get_it_my_major_is_hard_can_we_get_past_that/hdn4aml/", "text": "Talk to her about this.
