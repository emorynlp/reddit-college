  "title:": "Respondus Lockdown Browser is Literally Malware",
  "text": "Yesterday, I had my first online test conducted using the Respondus Lockdown Browser. It's absolutely awful.\n\nFirst of all, it's full of bugs. My friend had 30 tabs of Nvidia share opened by running Respondus, and the power options were disabled until he restarted all Windows group policy settings. Now, I've seen some of the source code, and it simply changes many keys in the registry but somehow fails to clean up properly after itself. It changes these hidden configuration settings, but because it's a crappy piece of malware, isn't able to clean up its changes and leaves some of it behind. For people who aren't as savvy, this would literally affect their ability to use their devices normally after running Respondus. How is this not illegal?\n\nSecond of all, I absolutely hate being watched. I'm easily stressed when people watch me do things, and oh boy, this thing watches your every move, probably analyzing your iris movements constantly, gives the entire video feed to your professor, and it stays there until they decide to delete it. My professor said that it's also capable of being a keylogger, although I'm not yet sure whether that is true.\n\nBut guess what? We have no choice. This is how Respondus puts it:\n\n\"If you cease to agree with these Terms, or the privacy and security policy below at some point in the future, you may opt-out by contacting your Institution. **However, opting-out may affect how you will need to complete your course, and your Institution makes no representations regarding how it will affect your relevant course**. As such, we encourage you to speak with your instructor before opting out.\"\n\nDuh. The university will not consider privacy concerns as a valid reason for refusing to use the lockdown browser. It's emotional blackmail - you are free to refuse using the malware and fail the course lol.",

Last time I exported the 10 page paper as images and pasted those images over a document about how their welcome to type my paper manually into turnittin if they want it checked followed by a lot of lorem ipsum.\n\nInstructor never called me on it and idk if he even noticed.

Besides, someone could just hide a phone out of the environment check\u2019s view and it could look like they\u2019re working on a problem on scratch paper.",

My U.S History professor has us use it due to his previous students cheating on tests, completely understandable. However, as soon as I decided to do a bit of digging about this anti-cheating browser, I realized that the browser could look at your sensitive information (if I am wrong, please correct me). That & I absolutely cannot wait to disable this program (if I don't get a professor who makes us use any Lockdown Browsers) and see if my laptop is at risk or not for any viruses/bugs.   \nAlso, I relate to you so much about being watched & getting stressed out so damn easily while doing things. If I were to ever have the slightest movement, a sneeze, for example, I'd be flagged for \"suspicious activity\". Wtf?",

(Teachers not letting students have access to their results so they can't study and improve, subpar tutors, etc).\n\nThe vast majority of causes behind why students resort to cheating are directly caused by the college.\n\nPiracy was a big deal when you had to drive around town in the hopes to get that one CD you wanted or had to go without because it wasn't available in your region. It was a big deal when that one song you liked was only on that one $15 CD full of dogshit songs. Piracy is a result of a service issue on the part of the distributor, which is why piracy rates plummeted when digital distribution became a thing and individual songs began getting sold piecemeal for a dollar or two. You know how you stop piracy? You don't put in anti-piracy software. You make the product more easily obtainable, you change the price to a more reasonable one, and you change how you distribute it. \n\nCheating is the exact same thing: a service issue on the part of the educator. Want to stop it? You don't punish them, you get better at providing that education to the people paying you to provide it.\n\nThere's so much wrong with the mindset behind why they implemented Respondus and it being malware/spyware is just one of many.",
