  "title:": "Needed to log onto blackboard 10 times a week or I fail the class. So I guess I'm failing every class, despite doing the work.",
  "text": "So basically, I don't know why, but it seems like my professors/entire university are going out of their way to make things harder for students. I normally am not a fan of the sort of \"students are always victims\" mentality because lets face it, this is hard work. No one said this was supposed to be easy. But they didn't say it was going to be a never-ending hellish nightmare. \n\nAt the start of the semester, I noticed my professors all had these lines in their syllabi about how if we didn't log on to blackboard, we would fail the class. The wording wasn't the best, and so I figured maybe they meant like, not logging on EVER, to which I was kind of like \"uh, yeah, duh\". I saw some numbers listed, like 180 total log-ins needing to be tracked, and needing to log on four/ten times a week, and I kind of brushed it off, figuring I'd make those numbers once the semester started up. I had never considered how many times a week I go on blackboard, I just assumed it must be a high-ish number.\n\nWell, I'm about 4 weeks away from the end and I just now realized that I have not at all reached those numbers. In fact, I've logged onto blackboard ONCE a week for most of my classes. I typically go on, write down all my assignments and when they're do, and then I don't log back in until I have to submit them! Because why the fuck would I? I'm DOING the work, right? \n\nI checked the syllabus again and saw this for one of my classes: \n\n>\"I expect you connect to the class platform (Blackboard) at least four times/week. If you ignore the class, you may fail this course. If you don\u2019t connect to the class for more than 10 days, you will fail the course automatically. To provide a fair grading system, I will use online activity monitoring tools.\" \n\nand then again in a different class: \n\n> \"Connect to the class platform (Blackboard) at least ten times/week. By the end of the\nsemester, your course report needs to show that you at least connected to the course for 160\nhits.\"\n\nTen times a week....? Are people just living in front of their computers? I had to move back home due to covid and I have to take care of my parents and put up with them. That takes time. I STILL manage to get all my work done and have generally good grades...  but there's no way on EARTH that I've \"connected to blackboard 10 times a week\". Absolutely no way. I've done every single assignment and turned everything in on time. I've gone to every zoom class. But not this. And the thing is, they can and are failing people for it from what I've heard. \n\nI'm a senior. I have one more semester in the fall. and I absolutely hate this school. I am thinking about school nearly constantly, or I'm just not thinking at all. I just have these moments where I feel brain dead. The rest of the time I'm worrying about an assignment. I don't relax on the weekends, I work. I don't relax at night, I work. I can't sleep, and I mean I REALLY can't sleep. I sleep 2 hours, work, or stare at my work, 2 more, work, and then it's time for zoom class. I am not exaggerating, I genuinely don't know how I haven't had worth health issues because of this. I started getting hives, migraines, and numbness and hypotension, I can't concentrate but I HAVE to concentrate, I am angry all the time, but I'm still able to do work, so I must. I don't have time to properly shower, I don't have time to brush my hair, I just have to constantly be at my computer working on assignments, and even then somehow I didn't manage to log onto blackboard ten times a week.\n\nI just need my undergrad and to get the fuck out because this college has taken my mental health, my physical health, and my fucking will to live from me. The only thing I have left is the ability to say \"I have good grades\" and \"I made deans list\" which guess what-- no one gives a fuck about that shit outside college. No one. So that's all this has given me. And if they want to fail me for not connecting to blackboard then I guess they can. I guess I kind of thought I'd hit those numbers, and clearly I misjudged how I was going to handle the work. I got it all done, but no, I didn't follow their arbitrary rule about blackboard, so now I\"m going to fail. And at this point I don't think I could survive a repeat of this semester. If I fail, that's it, I don't want to live. \n\nIt probably sounds overdramatic to some of you but I honestly don't give a fuck. I'm just tired of professors acting like they need to make things harder because things are remote, and I'm tired of putting in so much effort to do my best work only to be penalized for something like this.  \n\nI guess I should probably email my professors and ask if they're going to fail me, but none of them really read emails anyway. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nMy professors are tracking how many times we log onto blackboard. We are supposed to log on 10 times a week for one class, 5 for another, and 4 for another, and the other two just talk about if we don't log on for ten days. I'm taking 5 classes. I figured I'd reach those numbers but I'm realizing now that I really don't think I have. \n\nAnyway I've never fucking COUNTED how many times I've logged on in previous semesters, so I assumed I probably reached those numbers. Ten times a week seemed reasonable until I got caught up in the semester and realized I haven't been. \n\nI guess I'm curious if anyone is in the same boat here and how you dealt/are dealing with it\n\n**EDIT: on second thought yeah give me advice idk what to do**",

      "text": "You can try a few things:\n\n1. start logging in like a mf to try to make up the numbers.\n2. Give someone you know your username and password and get them to log in for you, just ensure they are from a similar geographical area. \n3. If you have any doctors' notes from your parents, or notes from your work or anything you can gather as evidence that you have competing priorities start gathering it together and creating a narrative of your life illustrating your challenges.\n\nDon't give up.  If you fail on this basis, request an informal and then formal review of your mark. indicate that:\n\n1. You have challenges outside the classroom which should be accounted for\n2. You are prepared to take a verbal exam to demonstrate the work is yours and an understanding of the material.\n3. Find out what the academic complaints mechanism is throughout the university all the way to the top. How far up does it go? what evidence do you need?\n\nThese kinds of requirements exist for two reasons. One to catch cheaters, and the other to encourage students to log in. You would be surprised at how many students would claim they didn't know they had to log in t all. Or who never log in and all of a sudden have a perfect paper. \n\nDon't give up, don't under-perform. Keep going. your best argument to beat this is good performance in your classes.",
