  "title:": "Regret going to office hours",
  "text": "I am in some pretty difficult programming classes. I normally avoid meeting a professor during office hours because I have social anxiety and I'm afraid of looking dumb, especially in my programming classes.\n\nI have some tough homework and I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and meet up with my professor during his office Zoom hours.\n\nAnd... my fears came true. I pulled up my assignment and shared my screen with him and the first thing he did was basically laugh at my code and then said it was \"ugly.\"  It definitely made me feel small. I brushed it off and said that I forgot to revise that code from earlier (which was true).\n\nAs we continued going through parts I needed clarification on, he made some condescending remarks. One particular issue I was having did have a very simple and straightforward solution, but he referred  to it as \"kindergarten,\" which definitely didn't make me feel good.\n\nI ended up keeping the visit short and skipping over areas I didn't understand because I felt embarrassed and wanted to get out of that call as soon as possible. It really sucks because I *needed* more help. It's eating me up inside.\n\nI really wish I was better at programming! It's so difficult to me. I am literally a straight A student in every other class that *isn't* programming. I don't know why I chose it as a major because I *do not* have an affinity for it but like... I'm already a senior. No way I'm switching now.",

I recommend you mention in your student evaluation of him that it\u2019s a pretty basic tenet of education that it cannot occur if the learner is feeling denigrated or threatened. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of subject matter expertise someone has if he/she cannot create the conditions for the students to acquire that knowledge. \n\nThis person is clearly not a teacher, which begs the question, why isn\u2019t he programming as a profession instead\u2026?",

There are so many students (including me) who have a bunch of stories about professors acting like this. Do you have a TA or anything like that who can help you? Most TAs are graduate students who are probably going to be more sympathetic to your plight since they identify being in your shoes.",

You never know, maybe that guy is hating everyone and belittling them cuz he knows his time is long gone. He\u2019s maybe jealous of you. He may have had a bad day, etc\u2026\n\nThe point is: you\u2019re the best and others\u2019 opinions shouldn\u2019t change your own opinion about yourself.\n\nBest of luck brother. I know what it\u2019s like to deal with social anxiety. Please know that you took the right decisions. You have to combat your fears by facing them. Eventually, you\u2019ll rewire your brain into understanding that there\u2019s no real danger in those social situations. And it\u2019ll all be gone.",
