I already failed a class (calculus) and im trying my best to B my way throughthe rest bmof my classes but suddenly my brain just doesnt work. I no longer feel energy or motivation. Theres no 'click' or 'zap' inside my head when studying a concept and focusing is so hard. I dont know whats up with me, next semester im transferring to biotech in another university here in spain but in a whole new region and i dont know what to do.\n\nCollege seemed so great but turns out its a mess. I guess im just pouring here, advice other than adderall to focus  and empathy are welcome.
