  "text": "I'm finally in 2nd year, it took me 3 fricken years to complete the 1st one of this 3 year program - yes, there's people I know that graduated while I was finishing up all the exams I still needed to pass.\n\nAnd now that I finally did it, it's my 4th year of college and I'm in 2nd year, I'm just overwhelmed with impostor syndrome. It's been only two weeks of lectures but it's so fricken hard. The workload is enormous, the homework itself takes me hours to understand, and there's just so much exams and project work this year!\n\nI can't help but feel like I've been given a pity pass in some subjects and that it's obvious. Last year I told myself if I didn't pass that year, I'd finally give up and acknowledge that college just isn't for me, not with my current level of focus and not with my self discipline habits. But I still did the year and now I'm in 2nd year - finally - yet I still have the same feelings of wanting to quit it. I'm not in the US, so I don't have student loans to worry about but I am studying in fields where it's quite hard to get employed if you're not the best - and I know deep down I'll never be the best, so it feels like I'm just choosing whether I enter the workforce now and feel that horrible shame of having quit or enter it upon my eventual (hopefully) graduation.\n\nIt's not that my field of study doesn't interest me, I'm just crap at it because every time it feels like I got my shit together, I get hit with a depressive episode that ruins my whole workflow and sets me even further behind.\n\nTLDR: Took me way too long to finish Year 1, now I'm 2 weeks into Year 2 and I find it too hard. Having troubles with self discipline, depression and motivation.",

      "text": "I just realized, why is it not the norm for people to come out of high school and then try to reach for dream job positions and then if they don't have the skill go get the skill at college. It is even more dumb that a lot of skillsets can be learned in a year. Ugh I hate college",
