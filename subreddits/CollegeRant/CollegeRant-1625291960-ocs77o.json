Well, I joined a PA organization and tried to network and talk to people and shadow people and everytime I asked someone for advice I was told that I wouldn't make it or they ignored me because they felt like I would steal their shadowing position (even though I was years younger than them and had no experience). I became a student researcher and changed my career path to be a social and medical researcher and have now gone back to wanting to get a PHD. I felt very depressed in Pre-Med and even in my biology and chemistry classes no one ever lent a helping hand, and if they did it would be very minimal and vague so that the advice they gave you would not be enough for you to get ahead of them. Maybe I am overreacting, but it's discouraging to see these toxic personalities make it into the world of medicine and patient care; you're supposed to care for these people with your utmost knowledge and heart, not belittle your coworkers for not having the same attitude you did.", "author": "AyoMoodles", "created": 1625291960, "retrieved": 1632842140, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"h3w7a74": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ocs77o/ive_learned_that_a_lot_of_people_who_are_entering/h3w7a74/", "text": "Thank you u/AyoMoodles for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
