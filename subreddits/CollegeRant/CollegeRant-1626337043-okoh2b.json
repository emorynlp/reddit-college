She's been doing the bare minimum from the start. Been saying excuses and probable lies to avoid doing things bc she does not even know our study that much \ud83d\ude2d She did not put the needed effort to really study it so she's just basically mostly riding along\n\nThis other member and I are mainly doing the bulk of the work. I am so pissed off. We are going to defend our proposal tomorrow online. I don't wanna involve the professors, ever, bc that would only cause unnecessary troubles I'd rather not go through\n\nAnd I am not confronting her or anything as well because we are sort of in the same social circle. Just don't wanna stress over this more deeply, I guess...so I'd probably just stay quiet though I am seriously irritated. Idk, sometimes I just cannot wrap my mind around how unapologetic some people are.

When I was in a similar situation the other group mates and I went together to confront her because we were not going to carry her to an A.

When you\u2019ve cooled off, meet in person and just say, \u201chey, I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re in the same group together. I\u2019m concerned about -insert one or two excuses-. We both know how important this is, so I\u2019m wondering what we can do to get you caught up with the group. Is everything okay?\u201d\n\nThis addresses the problem, but doesn\u2019t attack them personally. Sometimes, people have a legitimate reason. More often, people just don\u2019t realize they aren\u2019t contributing fully. People generally are shitty partners to be shitty partners, they literally just don\u2019t think about it. Without bringing it up, it just confirms that nothing is wrong with how they\u2019re contributing. If you wait too long, it becomes harder to say anything because they might ask \u201cif this was an issue why wasn\u2019t it brought up earlier?! I\u2019ve always done x this way!\u201d Of course you should reply candidly with, \u201cwe\u2019re friends and I believe in you! I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, so I didn\u2019t want to jump the gun. This is a really important project we want to get a good grade on.\u201d\n\nI hope this helps!", "author": "ta2confess", "created": 1626358521, "upvotes": 7}}}
