      "text": "Bruh you can absolutely pull this off. My cheap laptop crashed and I lost my first engineering research paper when I was 18. We had all semester to do it, I waited 3 days before, and since it crashed, I had less than 24 hours to write a 15 page minimum paper and a presentation to go with it. I bombed the presentation, but I wrote a 24 page paper and I got an 97%. \n\nIf you know how to cite things and quote them in your paper, your paper HAS written itself. Throw in some rewording, and some personal thoughts, and you\u2019ve got it, I promise. Plus I almost GUARANTEE it\u2019s double spaced dude! So it\u2019s only 5 pages! 2-3 of those pages will be your sources, 1/2 a page is your intro, 1/2 is your summary/conclusion. You only need to type a page or 2!! You got this man! Please don\u2019t give up! I just finally got my degree after years of believing I never could, I know you can do it! You got this!!",

Only marked me off for my header.\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t remember what my excuse was but it was probably some \u201cFamily emergency\u201d type shit.
