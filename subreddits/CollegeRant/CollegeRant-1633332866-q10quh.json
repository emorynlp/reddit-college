Worst is, they don\u2019t even reply or just \u2018seen\u2019 your messages in your group chat. I guess what you can do is that you remove their names in your final output or \u2014 straight up tell \u2018em that if they aren\u2019t going to cooperate, you will remove them from the group (if they get offended, then it\u2019s their fault for not cooperating properly in the first place). But you could also ask your professor if you could just do it individually and leave your group voluntarily, although the work is all on you and you have to accept the consequences. At least you\u2019re stressed abt the activity, not your group mates being uncooperative.",

      "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm one of those profs that assign group work - you probably know all the reasons and excuses for assigning such tortures but here's what I suggest to my classes: \n\n1. CC your prof on emails to group - especially those where you're asking where everyone's work is.\n2. Assign roles, know exactly what each person is responsible for.\n3. Come up with a contingency plan in case something happens\n4. Come up with a plan in case anyone ghosts\n\nTalk to your instructor first. If they're assigning group work, they should have a plan on how to handle these common situations. The above list is a small list of corrective suggestions I offer my classes and may not work for you. Obviously I don't know what sort of class you're taking or project you're working on. I sympathize with students whose instructors assign group work w/o taking time to establish some basic protocols and best practices. \n\nMost students that get irritated by group work are those that like to get their shit done early. Which is cool but not everyone works that way - most folks *can't* work that way due to other obligations or issues. On the other hand, their shit shouldn't stink up your room: if you are the type that like to get things done asap, you need to let them know this and work accordingly. \n\n**What's important is not to set a precedent.** A lot of folks will back down if they know someone else is going to handle things. It's not so much being lazy - some lead, others are find being led alright too.",

          "text": "I used to be a teacher and I'm back in school for something different now. There's a lot of truth here, I believe you're missing something: A whole lot of students have cheated their way through to junior and senior level courses and are incapable of contributing, even when given the opportunity. I've run into it more than once, and it's making me crazy. In situations where the only recourse for dealing with a shitty group member is to either do the work myself or turn in honest-to-god word salad or code salad, I'm going to do it myself, because there are plenty of internships in my area that have GPA requirements. I can't let incompetent people tank my grade. I have way too many professors who have decided that non-contributing members are my problem to deal with. Since I can't throw them under the bus to management like I would at a job, there are no peer reviews, they don't do what they're assigned to do by the dates we've agreed upon, and I don't have the time to teach them many semesters of worth of shit they should already know, I'm just going to do the work myself as soon as I realize that they're not capable of doing it. I've got a toddler, a job, and a family to take care of. I can't be fixing incoherent work at 3 a.m. the morning that it's due, but that's what happens about 80% of the time. Group work wasn't nearly this horrible during my first degree. My classmates were at least competent. Something has changed.",

Lol\". If even that. \n\n\nComplaining to tutors or convenors never helps. \"This is what happens in the real world, it's up to you to fix group problems\". So these lazy gits are rewarded and get a free ride all because I actually give a shit about my grades.
