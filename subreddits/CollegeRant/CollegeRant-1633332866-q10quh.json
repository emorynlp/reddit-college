Worst is, they don\u2019t even reply or just \u2018seen\u2019 your messages in your group chat. I guess what you can do is that you remove their names in your final output or \u2014 straight up tell \u2018em that if they aren\u2019t going to cooperate, you will remove them from the group (if they get offended, then it\u2019s their fault for not cooperating properly in the first place).

CC your prof on emails to group - especially those where you're asking where everyone's work is.\n2. Assign roles, know exactly what each person is responsible for.\n3. Come up with a contingency plan in case something happens\n4. Come up with a plan in case anyone ghosts\n\nTalk to your instructor first. If they're assigning group work, they should have a plan on how to handle these common situations. The above list is a small list of corrective suggestions I offer my classes and may not work for you. Obviously I don't know what sort of class you're taking or project you're working on. I sympathize with students whose instructors assign group work w/o taking time to establish some basic protocols and best practices. \n\nMost students that get irritated by group work are those that like to get their shit done early. Which is cool but not everyone works that way - most folks *can't* work that way due to other obligations or issues. On the other hand, their shit shouldn't stink up your room: if you are the type that like to get things done asap, you need to let them know this and work accordingly. \n\n**What's important is not to set a precedent.** A lot of folks will back down if they know someone else is going to handle things. It's not so much being lazy - some lead, others are find being led alright too.", "author": "OfficiousBrick", "created": 1633346383, "upvotes": 4}, "hfc3pyt": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/q10quh/group_projects_are_making_me_insane/hfc3pyt/", "text": "Yep, literally every group assignment I've been given.

Lol\". If even that. \n\n\nComplaining to tutors or convenors never helps. \"This is what happens in the real world, it's up to you to fix group problems\". So these lazy gits are rewarded and get a free ride all because I actually give a shit about my grades. Also, in my actual place of work, if you were useless and did literally nothing or did piss-poor work, you were told to leave.\n\n\nSo yeah.
