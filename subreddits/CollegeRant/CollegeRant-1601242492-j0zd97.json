  "text": "Going to be frank here, I don't want to be in college anymore.\n\nSome background before I begin, I had my doubts about college back in high school and didn't want to enter immediately, but my parents begged and cried that I did because it would be good for me. Sure, why not. First year was pretty mixed, but one event stood out in mind: math class. I began the semester with an F because I wasn't really used to having to keep up with my assignments, and by the end of the semester I'm out of the final exam with a B+ and skipped it entirely. Back then, I had the motivation to improve my grades where I knew I was able to.  \n\n\nI'm a junior now in my first semester of the 3rd year, and I can't stand it anymore. I've had near 0 drive to do any of my assignments and am pretty far behind. I am a graphic design major, and while designing things is fun and lets me work creative muscles, the deadlines, poor communication, awkward learning of new technology on the professors' parts and the fact that many of my projects are analogue (i am notoriously bad with non paperwork or digital assignments), all while being stuck in my house all day, I stopped feeling like being here was worth it, at the very least for the time being. I've had practically no time to figure out exactly what I want to do and how to do it when I had it drilled in my teenage head that I absolutely had to go to college, and now I'm stuck between telling my parents I want to opt out until there's no risk of infection, finishing the semester, and feeling terrible because as unreasonable as I made them out to be, they're doing this because they love me and believe in me and I feel, no, I am squandering their money. I don't want to put myself or my parents in financial troubles, but I know if I tell them I want out they won't agree at all.  \n\n\nTLDR; online classes killed my motivation to continue college until everything goes back to normal due to the back and forth between online lectures with physical projects, but im afraid to tell my parents and feeling like a failure because of the investments ive made so far, and I don't wanna break their hearts.",

      "text": "I feel that. I have no motivation and I was already a pretty poor student even before the pandemic began, and online classes have just made learning at this level much harder. Part of me\u2019s considering dropping out and enlisting in the military for four years just to really develop more as a person, and then finish whatever I have pending for free on the GI Bill.",

And at this point I have no motivation and will to even do better. Especially cause the degree is useless anyways so I\u2019m so close to dropping out.",

      "text": "Same thing for me. Junior for mechanical engineering. last 2 years are in person group assignments about designing and building as engineers do. Well how do you do that online? No one knows.  literally no one. So my whole future while I\u2019m paying thousands is totally up in the air and I\u2019m sick of it. It\u2019s so unorganized and chaotic. Oh hey yeah we will have a meeting today and give you 12 hour notice good luck hope you checked your email on a Saturday.",
