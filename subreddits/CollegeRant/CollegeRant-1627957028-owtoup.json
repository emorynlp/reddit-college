  "title:": "failed two classes, i think i get it now <supportive rant>",
  "text": "i\u2019m a junior.\n\nAs crappy as it sounds, I\u2019m seeing that failing these two classes really opened my mind to something. one of the classes is repeatable while the other is crucial to starting my major, and my school has this sh*tty rule where if you fail a class, you have to switch majors. \n\nI\u2019m disheartened by that just bc I actually liked that major, but I am not fixated on it too much. it\u2019s because I finally absorbed what it means when folks used to tell me success isn\u2019t a straight path. it\u2019s a little cringey to put into text, but it\u2019s so true. \n\nthe only prob is now i have to rethink my major, but after this failure and *certain* life experiences + personalities test, i\u2019m starting to learn myself. \n\nsoo, to anyone whose currently feeling like this is the end or they aren\u2019t good enough. be quiet <3 because maybe you failed that class for a reason, it\u2019s gonna teach you something about self (in most cases). you don\u2019t suck, there\u2019s just something you\u2019re better aligned for. you have options",

However, I agree. But switching schools with my GPA\u2026 I don\u2019t know bro. I just don\u2019t know anymore. I feel like switching schools would be a bad move for me",
