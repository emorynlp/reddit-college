  "text": "I was in the libary with my lab partner in a study room because we needed to study for an exam. The rule says that nobody can eat or drink in the study rooms unless we were by ourselves. She lowered her mask down a bit to take a sip of water. A random libarian walked by and turned around and opened our door and lectured us that she should have her mask up. Then she goes to me and asks me if I loaned out the study room, which I did. She said that I was given a warning because I am responsible for my lab partner and further breaking the rule can result in me loosing my study room privileges. After she left my partner and I were pissed.\n\nI feel that she treated the situation too seriously and she should calm down. I had my mask up and my friend only put her mask down for a few seconds to take a drink. I understand that we need to prevent the spread of covid but we are both vaccinated and what if maybe she had a tickle in her throat or something. Should she walk all the way outside when its cold just to take a sip of water. I don't mind if she reminds us to keep our mask up but I think she went over the top to tell us that I can lose my study room privileges just because not even me, but my lab partner decided to drink for 2 seconds. I understand if she had a five course meal up and start speaking loudly and such. But it was a subtle lower mask slightly to sip and that is it.\n\nI notice that whenever im in a study room she tends to take a quick glance at me while she is walking past the room (she did this before the mask situation) and im pretty sure she does this to other students. It kinda distracting and it makes me self conscious. Like if the other librarians did that maybe then kinda just say hi or do something silly and thats it but this one in particular its almost like she is observing or monitoring people. \n\nIm just exhausted of this pandemic. Im not an anti-masker or an anti-vaccine person or a random trump simp (and neither is my lab partner) but I just tired of the effects of this pandemic and I wish school can be back to normal. 3 out of 4 of my classes are online and im taking all science classes so I feel like im teaching myself the information. Then when I finally come to campus I get looks from staff if I get a little too close to a friend. I feel that its unfair that there are students out there who would throw super spreader parties and their school wouldn't even bat an eye yet a random staff member in the library is threatening to ban me from studying in a study room over something I didn't even do.\n\nIts emotionally exhausting to follow social distancing guidelines and such because not enough people in this country are doing it. I try my best but I always think what is the point, this pandemic will never end because we don't have enough people who are semi-smart enough to sacrifice and vaccinate and wear there mask too. Sometimes im just waiting for anti-maskers and anti-vaccine people to finally die off from covid so we can return back to normal, because nothing will ever convince them, not even a mandate. Im only doing this for my little brother who haven't received a shot yet, and random old people and immunocompromised people, healthcare and that is it. If it wasn't for those reasons I wouldn't even bother. If I die I die, I just wear my mask because it wouldn't be fair if I kill someone else too",

      "text": "Honestly I\u2019m the same way: I do think you need vaccines and masks just I feel like either my college overestimated how bad it was gonna be or they just didn\u2019t care, even if 98% of the school is fully vaccinated specifically because we have a mandate. I do know Covid can spread even if youre fully vaccinated but nothing serious has happened so far. \n\nEverything closes early, I can\u2019t have people over (I think if you\u2019re able to prove you\u2019re fully vaccinated or don\u2019t have Covid you should be allowed), and we can\u2019t use the lounges. I hope next semester they lower certain restrictions, the boredom and procrastination is killing me. The only restriction they changed was we no longer need an appointment to use the gym, but we still had to complete a questionnaire, wear a mask and take a temperature check. \n\nTbh most people at my school don\u2019t follow the social distancing rules. we\u2019re supposed to have masks at all times unless we\u2019re in our dorm rooms or eating and most people only really wear them in class. It was to the point where they had to send out an email reminding us to keep our masks on.",
