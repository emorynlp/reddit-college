Personally, I love the readings but I\u2019m really annoyed with the forced summaries we have to do after every reading. And my teacher said it\u2019s because she wants to know we read. I get that but I\u2019m paying thousands of dollars to not be treated like a child in middle school. Im here to learn. I\u2019ve taken latin for years and this level of Ancient Rome info is literally beginner course stuff so it\u2019s not that hard. \n\nIf students don\u2019t want to read, fine let them not. Then let them fail because they chose not to read. And let them pay to retake the course and maybe their ways will change. \n\nBecause as someone who always reads the books and comprehends the info by just reading ( bc I enjoy it and it often seems like that\u2019s the only time I actually learn anything), Im tired of the bullshit assignments that waste my time and make me dislike the readings bc I know I have to write a summary afterwards. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first class I\u2019ve had that\u2019s done it but I figured by senior year, it wouldn\u2019t be this way anymore.", "author": "Sunshine1813", "created": 1630382136, "retrieved": 1632841353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hb0mjlw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pey8v2/forced_summaries_for_readings_so_they_know_youve/hb0mjlw/", "text": "Thank you u/Sunshine1813 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Imagine your Professor trying to teach a class and no one is even remotely competent of the information.
