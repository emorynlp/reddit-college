  "text": "sooo I have an oral interview in Japanese in a few hours and I\u2019m freaking out!!! Like no joke my heart is racing my palms are sweaty and I honestly want to cry! I got bad luck and was placed with all the good students in class so that alone is making me feel like crap because my Japanese is really not that good \ud83d\ude2d i should be use to it by now but im not! Im sooo worried because i dont know what questions my sensei will ask me and im literally shaking just thinking about it! This is going to be the longest 45 minutes ever! Does anyone have any good tips to help me calm down a bit?? Or what to do if I can\u2019t remember my lines or can\u2019t answer a question because i have no idea what they\u2019re asking me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Take a deep breath. Think through doing the absolute worst yiu possibly could. Then think through the consequences of that. Make space for it. What would happen? Would you fail the class? Have to take it again? Get kicked out of school? Have to find a new life path? \n\nReally consider all of that. Make a plan B if all of that were to happen. I don\u2019t know if that will help you l, but working thorough the worst case scenario helps my test anxiety. Then, as soon as it\u2019s done and I\u2019m waiting for results, I think through what I can do differently as far as preparation goes so that my future self will have less anxiety the next time. Something it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.",
