The class I\u2019m taking right now is molecular neuroscience and it\u2019s a lot harder than I thought. I knew it would be hard, but it\u2019s basically like biochem all over again but even more in depth. I didn\u2019t even think biochem was nearly as bad as I got an A. \n\nThe worst thing is my professor. This is her first time teaching and she\u2019s very smart and it\u2019s almost like she expects us to be as smart. The only resources I have from this class is very vague PowerPoints and a textbook that is very detailed and hard to understand. \n\nNot only is the class material difficult, but we have weekly quizzes and weekly summaries due on top of reading research papers and doing other assignments. In the first research paper I read I didn\u2019t even understand the title of the article. \n\nI have my first quiz due tomorrow and I feel very overwhelmed. I feel like there was so information during lecture that I couldn\u2019t write is all down and I can\u2019t even comprehend the book. \n\nI know now that I need to start better preparing for class and review more often, but fuck it\u2019s so hard. And I feel like my classmates are not struggling as much as I am. And because it\u2019s such a niche topic there\u2019s not a whole lot of the resources such as other articles, quizlet, or YouTube. I know it\u2019s only the first quiz and I don\u2019t know how detailed it will be, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt stupid. This is literally my field and I don\u2019t know how I will ever be smart enough.", "author": "denver_rose", "created": 1632079497, "retrieved": 1632840999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdi0d4r": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/prel72/its_the_2nd_week_of_school_and_im_already/hdi0d4r/", "text": "Thank you u/denver_rose for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Have you been to office hours? May I suggest also reading the book and trying to comprehend it on your own before your next lecture? Even if it doesnt make too much sense to you, Im sure youll understand the topic a hell of a lot better if you expose your brain to it beforehand. Also, try using spaced repitition learning. If its like Biochem theres probably a lot of memorization. Get a software like anki that will help you use spaced repitition to your advantage. Overall, its still going to be a lot of studying and reaching out for help when you need it.\n\nYoure two years into college. Youre cut out for it. Dont doubt yourself or your determination.
