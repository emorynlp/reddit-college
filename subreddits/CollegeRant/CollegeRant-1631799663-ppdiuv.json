I went through a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nSo I'm studying math. I'm not good at it. But I love math and I want nothing more than to study it and get better.\n\nFirst semester ends, I failed Linear Algebra 1. That's alright - we get one chance to repeat an exam.\n\nSecond semester is over - I also fail Linear Algebra 2. Oh boy. Well, no time to give up, sign up for the repeat exam.\n\nBut the LinAlg 1 and LinAlg 2 repeat exams are only one week apart. My dumb ass decides to do both anyway.\n\nI study my absolute hardest. I take LinAlg1 - went pretty good I'm pretty happy about it. Or so I thought at the time.\n\nSurprise - the LinAlg2 repeat exam is actually an oral exam, not written. I was actually rather happy about that since the main reason I failed the exams were simple calculation mistakes, being too slow, misreading instructions etc (I have ADHD). Those all won't be a factor in an oral exam.\n\nI assumed this would be like any other oral exam I ever had. The first exam was open book, so I expected this one to be as well. I expected some time to prepare and then to present my findings. Well... No. None of that.\n\nI walk in, my examinators look at me in this weird way asking \"Are you Firstname Lastname?\" - \"yes, this is my timeslot, right?\" - \"yes but... You failed your LinAlg 1 repeat exam. So... We don't see much sense in you doing this exam now\".\n\nNow for context: I can only repeat an exam once. And I need LinAlg 1 for math. So failing LinAlg 1 means I have to quit. There is a sliver of hope though: the joker. Once over the course of our studies we can repeat one exam a second time. It absolutely sucks having to burn this joker on one of the earliest modules. Anyway\n\n\"Alright... I'd still like to do the LinAlg2 exam\". Which apparently they didn't expect, but they obliged. What I didn't expect was 1) this exam is NOT open book which they never said anywhere (but still stupid of me to just assume) and I had NO preparation time to look at the problems. They just told me to solve it on the board.\n\nSo not only was I caught completely off guard when I couldn't use my precious notes, I was also holding back tears the entire time cause I just found out I failed LinAlg1 repeat.\n\nThe whole exam went absolutely horrible. I was sure I failed. I would've judged my grade at maybe 30% or 40%.\n\nI go home crying my eyes out cause having failed TWO repeat exams meant the end. No loopholes nothing.\n\nThat same evening, my phone goes\u00a0ding\u00a0\"you have new grades available in your student portal\". I check it out. I passed LinAlg2. What.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'll have to burn my joker on LinAlg1 but for now I can keep studying math.
