  "title:": "The worst oral exam situation I ever had (with semi-happy-ending).",
  "text": "Just needed to vent somewhere. I went through a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nSo I'm studying math. I'm not good at it. But I love math and I want nothing more than to study it and get better.\n\nFirst semester ends, I failed Linear Algebra 1. That's alright - we get one chance to repeat an exam.\n\nSecond semester is over - I also fail Linear Algebra 2. Oh boy. Well, no time to give up, sign up for the repeat exam.\n\nBut the LinAlg 1 and LinAlg 2 repeat exams are only one week apart. My dumb ass decides to do both anyway.\n\nI study my absolute hardest. I take LinAlg1 - went pretty good I'm pretty happy about it. Or so I thought at the time.\n\nSurprise - the LinAlg2 repeat exam is actually an oral exam, not written. I was actually rather happy about that since the main reason I failed the exams were simple calculation mistakes, being too slow, misreading instructions etc (I have ADHD). Those all won't be a factor in an oral exam.\n\nI assumed this would be like any other oral exam I ever had. The first exam was open book, so I expected this one to be as well. I expected some time to prepare and then to present my findings. Well... No. None of that.\n\nI walk in, my examinators look at me in this weird way asking \"Are you Firstname Lastname?\" - \"yes, this is my timeslot, right?\" - \"yes but... You failed your LinAlg 1 repeat exam. So... We don't see much sense in you doing this exam now\".\n\nNow for context: I can only repeat an exam once. And I need LinAlg 1 for math. So failing LinAlg 1 means I have to quit. There is a sliver of hope though: the joker. Once over the course of our studies we can repeat one exam a second time. It absolutely sucks having to burn this joker on one of the earliest modules. Anyway\n\n\"Alright... I'd still like to do the LinAlg2 exam\". Which apparently they didn't expect, but they obliged. What I didn't expect was 1) this exam is NOT open book which they never said anywhere (but still stupid of me to just assume) and I had NO preparation time to look at the problems. They just told me to solve it on the board.\n\nSo not only was I caught completely off guard when I couldn't use my precious notes, I was also holding back tears the entire time cause I just found out I failed LinAlg1 repeat.\n\nThe whole exam went absolutely horrible. I was sure I failed. I would've judged my grade at maybe 30% or 40%.\n\nI go home crying my eyes out cause having failed TWO repeat exams meant the end. No loopholes nothing.\n\nThat same evening, my phone goes\u00a0ding\u00a0\"you have new grades available in your student portal\". I check it out. I passed LinAlg2. What.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'll have to burn my joker on LinAlg1 but for now I can keep studying math. Yay.",

So I guess that covers real analysis, we had a bit of complex and multivariable analysis. And LinAlg is LinAlg I guess. \n\nThe upcoming semester I'll do Geometry and Topology, looking forward to that one. \n\nFor me, all my classes are about proofs. Linear Algebra 1 started with set theory, going into group theory. And all we had to do was writing proofs. Then in the last week the prof was like \"oh yeah btw this thing is called a matrix\" haha.\n\nMathematical biology sounds super cool. I'm doing Neuroinformatics as my minor, so I'm also interested in biology and such.",

                      "text": "Yeah, we also had 2 linear algebra & analysis classes we had to take in our major too at my school. I haven't taken a topology class yet, but I read a book & hopefully I can self study that one or take a class (I've been trying to focus on more applied coursework for the classes I'm able to choose, but pure math interests me as well). \n\nTopology is a very general subject, so there's lots of crazy stuff there & subjects like noneuclidean Geometry & differential Geometry seem fascinating as well (then there's the fact that differential Geometry is the language for general relativity as well & deepening knowledge of basic linear algebra w/ multilinear algebra). That's not what a usual linear algebra 1 class is like at all. For us, we eased into things more with linear algebra 1 being mostly computation & also a bit of proof as well since that class would be taken alongside discrete or before discrete to develop proof skills.\n \nYeah, mathematical biology was pretty interesting thinking about population dynamics & epidemiology (which was specifically what we covered in the class I took, though it's obviously much broader like w/ physiological modeling). There are definitely lots of places in neuroscience where math is applied like the Hodgkin-Huxley model (though we didn't look at it in my math Bio class). At my school they offer a math Bio class with deterministic models & one w/ stochastic models. I already took the one w/ deterministic models specifically, but I think it would be interesting to take the one w/ stochastic models as well or a Dynamical Systems class. Of course, math also is quite related to computer science & informatics as well like with software being written using formal languages like math. It's a huge asset to have good programming skills along w/ math skill. \n\nI took three years of biology in high school & 2 quarters in college, so I've studied biology quite a bit. I think it's very important that we understand nature & have an understanding of how our bodies work. I also ended up focusing on applied math, since I could just end up applying those skills to lots of different disciplines as I find it hard to specialize in one thing.",
