Literally had some exams done online in the past, and when they finally get graded, never do I have the ability to look back and see what I did wrong nor was I ever told what I failed on. How could I possibly learn from this for possible future career or even the final (if they combine all lessons together) if I never get to see what was wrong? If you want to lock it during the time it's still open and could be leaked to other students to help them cheat, perfectly reasonable. But don't have it locked all this time so I'm unable to know what I understood correctly, especially on exams with fricking WRITTEN RESPONSES.\n\nThis is specifically on my biology and ethics class, if any were wondering.", "author": "The-Travis-Broski", "created": 1621323853, "retrieved": 1632842364, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gyjm3vy": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/nf4hko/completing_an_exam_getting_graded_and_never/gyjm3vy/", "text": "Thank you u/The-Travis-Broski for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You send a polite e-mail to ask for feedback, they send back some arrogant one-liner telling you that you probably misunderstood the questions (which in my case, I printed them out before handing in the exam triple-checked my answers before writing that e-mail). \n\nYou write back, they tell you to wait until the next online lecture and ask there. Which you do, so they tell you they don't have time and you should ask next week. You wait another week and ask them again, they tell you to let it go you'll do better in the next exam if you study. You write a more direct e-mail telling them that you're pretty sure you got the answers right. You write more e-mails becoming increasingly annoying but managing to stay polite.\n\nYou finally manage to convince them to show everyone what their results were just to shut you up, and  OH NO WHAT A SURPRISE two of their questions were wrong.\n\nI wouldn't even care if it wasn't for the fact that mistakes in those exams subtract twice what the question is worth, which means two bad ones can fail you even if you answer everything perfectly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell anyways it's just that one department and in the end, they always corrected the grade.
