We're all overwhelmed with work from our other classes, abso-fucking-lutely SWAMPED. We asked for a one-day extension for an annotated bibliography that was due today and 9AM, and she told us no and that she wasn't going to act like our \"mommies\" or \"hold your hands.\" We asked for ONE DAY. ONE. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING. I'm up from 7am until 10PM working on assignments nonstop.\n\nI met with the same professor this morning about my paper and the first thing she said was, \"It's clear you have no idea how to write an annotated bibliography.\" SHE PRAISED THE ONE I WROTE FOR MY OTHER CLASS? I DON'T GET IT. I don't have time to read seven 30-40 page articles every single day of my life. I have other classes I have to attend to and other exams I have to prepare for. This woman is FUCKING INSANE. I'm so mad I'm in tears and I have to take two classes with her next semester. I just want to graduate.

Show them all the other works you've been working on as well as proof that oyu're not, in fact, lazy and she's the one that's crazy. And I would talk with the others guys to not hand over the assignment if that's her attitude. What she's gonna do when all of her students refuse to cooperate with her madness? (Edit: Ok maybe she'll just fail you all. Don't listen to my stupid advice about not doing the work. But, seriously, tell someone).\n\n(My class is 50 ppl and our head of department... sent us a not-so-nice message when this whole online mess started. We only let it pass because we're all quarantined, and he's stuck at home trying to deal with three classes, like 250 students AND he's the teaching some courses himself too ... from home, while trying to watch his kids who were stuck home 'cause quarantine. We had some complains and he... pretty much lost it. It was a kinda aggressive reply he sent back to us. Since we only communicated via messages and emails and it was a first, we didn't file a complain about him and he cooled down after and returned to being all nice and sweet to us. But.. yeah it was insulting)", "author": null, "created": 1586023924, "upvotes": 3}, "fmcob59": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/fu9ldn/my_professor_is_taking_her_anger_out_on_us_and/fmcob59/", "text": "I mean, did you ask for a one-day extension the day it was due?
