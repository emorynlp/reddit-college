  "text": "Despite having been in college continuously since 2018 I\u2019m still only a sophomore. How? MY CREDITS NEVER TRANSFER. It\u2019s so frustrating and something needs to be done at the legislative level. I\u2019m a navy spouse so I\u2019ve had to transfer between 3 schools by no choice of my own. It\u2019s ridiculously difficult to transfer between community colleges to universities when the curriculum is exactly. the. same. I\u2019ve repeated so many classes without learning anything new the second time. It\u2019s a waste of money and time and I honestly think it\u2019s just a way for the schools to make money. Sorry about the rant but there needs to be change!",

      "text": "I totally get that its frustrating, Ive had a few credits not transfer myself. But I dont think its an easy fix. To mandate that all bio 101 classes everywhere are equivalent, they would have to have very similar course content. Thats largely the case, but it cant be 80 or 90% equivalent, more like 97+% equivalent. Colleges really wouldnt like having to restructure *all* of their courses, and how do you pick the best one to start with? Youre in a pretty unique situation, people usually can research which courses are pre-approved as being elligble for transfer credit or just email admissions if they plan to go to 2 colleges",

I spent thousands on an associates degree because my advisors told me that is the only way to ensure credits will transfer and they still didn\u2019t. It does not make sense. A job is not going to care if you got your degree from one school or another, all that matters is that you have the degree. If the curriculum for a particular degree is that much different than the curriculum at another school for the same degree, that\u2019s a huge problem that shouldn\u2019t even be a possibility.",

              "text": ">at the degree level those classes should transfer no matter what. I spent thousands on an associates degree\n\nSo youre saying that if you complete a degree, those credits should all transfer? Thats not really any different than on an individual class basis. They would compare your associate classes with required courses for the bachelors, on a class by class basis. \n\nDid you move states? Unfortunately advisors arent always super reliable, and they may have thought that youd be transferring to a college in state in which case standards are more similar. An advisor cant possibly tell you whether your credits will transfer to an unknown university in an unknown state.\n\n>A job is not going to care if you got your degree from one school or another, all that matters is that you have the degree.

But the college cares where you got your transfer credits from. Honestly its partly a money grab, if a course at another school is 95% equivalent to their class, that gives them an out to say oh no you have to take our class ($$$). And, disparities in education *is* a huge issue.",

Its totally normal for them to look through which courses you took and where because equivalency is an issue sometimes",
