  "text": "I took a gap year and I'm excited about college but I feel bad that I'm graduating at 22-23 because I feel like I'm wasting my life or something at college and a year wasted cause I had to take a gap year due to finances. I want to start a small business and work my way up while in college but then I feel like my drive is now suddenly downhill since I didn't start my career at an undecided age. I might have to even do classes in the summer to catch up. Well, not catch up but go graduate at the proper age. Ugh, time sucks.",

I can relate to your worries but there are so many people who graduate later than what\u2019s deemed \u201cnormal\u201d so don\u2019t give up :)",

      "text": "22 is the average age to graduate if you completed college in four years, but most don\u2019t complete college in four years and do it in five. Graduating at 22-23 is completely normal and I wouldn\u2019t waste a second more thinking about that. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m just starting school at 22 considering I worked like many for a few years before college.",

      "text": "I graduated at 23 with my Honours Bachelor of Arts in Law & Legal Studies this past June, AND just went back im September to the same university to pursue a second undergraduate degree, a BSc in Neuroscience. I wanted to be a lawyer my entire life because I literally grew up in a law office and was always surrounded by it, the subject also came naturally to me so that was always a plus. But in my second year I panicked because I felt crushed by damn near everything about being a lawyer: the office environment, the law being very limited in being able to make substantial changes in most situations, the corporate attire even. I started taking science electives (ones I could anyway) and fell in love with neuroscience and medicine. \n\nSo in order to get into the neuroscience degree, and eventually go to medical school thereafter, I completed 2 grade 12 math classes during my senior year of my degree. After crushing those I applied and did the whole application process I did 4 years ago. I finished my degree (on the dean\u2019s list) and graduated in June 2021 and matriculated into the neuroscience program at Carleton University in Canada. I\u2019m hoping to attend medical school in about 3-4 years, at that I will be approximately 28. \n\nMy family doc was 28 when he started medical school and was very adamant about age not being something to stress over. And I\u2019m actually going to look at going into a surgical specialty such as neuro or plastics so I will be in my 40s before I actually start practicing without training wheels. \n\nStop putting all this time pressure on yourself. Society does enough of that bullshit. So do tests and entrance exams. \n\nYou\u2019ll be alright :)",
