  "title:": "it feels like I'm not absorbing or learning the information being taught on zoom meetings",
  "text": "whenever I'm on these zoom meetings i find that rather than taking in what's being taught and taking mental notes, I'm just kind of staring blankly at the screen and only half listening to what the prof is saying. It's hard to fully pay attention when there's such little engagement or activity going on, and at times it also feels  like there's such little incentive to pay attention when they'll just post all the material online later on so I can just brush up on the most important parts while doing assignments. I couldn't remember at least %60 of anything that's covered in those meetings other than the general ideas. Anybody else struggle with this?",

If you\u2019ve been like me and on the Internet for the last year and haven\u2019t practiced focusing, then there is some training you need to work on. It could be more, but likely not.",

Do professors usually have recorded lectures that you can go back over? I'm assuming not, but I don't know.",

      "text": "So I am a teacher and I have found the best thing for a virtual student is lots of graphic organizers. Record your lessons. As you take note anchor important information by making a symbol or prior connection to it. As silly as it sounds if it\u2019s chemistry go find a to it I\u2019ve video about the use for that concept or subject. Learning is all connections to what you already know. As you build these connections your brain will map and solidify the knowledge. I hope this helps. Each class try to mind map the concepts. YouTube has great tutorials for mind maps. I swear by them.",
