It's hard to fully pay attention when there's such little engagement or activity going on, and at times it also feels  like there's such little incentive to pay attention when they'll just post all the material online later on so I can just brush up on the most important parts while doing assignments. I couldn't remember at least %60 of anything that's covered in those meetings other than the general ideas.

Record your lessons. As you take note anchor important information by making a symbol or prior connection to it. As silly as it sounds if it\u2019s chemistry go find a to it I\u2019ve video about the use for that concept or subject. Learning is all connections to what you already know. As you build these connections your brain will map and solidify the knowledge. I hope this helps. Each class try to mind map the concepts. YouTube has great tutorials for mind maps.
