I've been using my phone to do the documents, powerpoints, attending zoom and Google meetings also submitting on google classroom. I also got frustrated when my phone starts lagging during class presentations. I would cry at night because I need to work everything on my phone. I'm incoming 3rd year this new school year and my problem is I don't know if I can conduct a research with just using my phone, this resource I have is not capable enough to advance in a new school year. But still I want to attend the class since I don't want to miss a year just because I use phone. I can't afford the laptops or computers even second-hands but maybe, maybe I can still get through this school year.\n\nI hope so.", "author": "Justkrabby", "created": 1624695848, "retrieved": 1632842172, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h336efl": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o86rwr/hard_life_for_broke_uni_student/h336efl/", "text": "Thank you u/Justkrabby for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In fact, during my last two years of undergrad I rarely used my laptop at all. I enjoyed using the public computer labs so much because the screens were bigger and they were nicer and I wasn't distracted. You could bring a flash drive but my school had one drive so you could save to the cloud and open up assignments anywhere.\n\nSo my advice is to go the computer labs on campus and use the librarys. It is probably going to a better experience than a laptop anyways.", "author": "icedlamps22", "created": 1625245690, "upvotes": 1}, "h3fh1v5": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o86rwr/hard_life_for_broke_uni_student/h3fh1v5/", "text": "This is going to come off rough, but I believe that it is necessary in this case. Quit trying to get a pity-party on the internet and go work a part-time job sweetheart. It's not easy, but if you really want it bad enough, you'll go after it.
