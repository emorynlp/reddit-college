I joined online orientation a couple days ago and had a specific question to ask about the schedule they sent me, I asked the question 3 separate times each worded a different way and I kept on getting the same vague answer from the ppl running the orientation. So I asked a 4th time but they flat out ignored it. \n\nAfterwards I sent an email to my advisor asking the same question and got an automated response saying he was out of the office for 2 WEEKS (good for him enjoying his summer not gonna hate) but did it literally have to be at one of the busiest times for scheduling??\n\nSo basically I scheduled my classes because I was getting worried that they\u2019d fill up quickly and I feel sick to my stomach with worry that I screwed something up. :(((\n\nHe got back to me a week after I scheduled but honestly I didn\u2019t even email him back because I\u2019m low key pissed by the lack of help.
