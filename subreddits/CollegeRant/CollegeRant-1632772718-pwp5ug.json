  "text": "I haven't studied for it at all aside from some practice tests, and some homework. I haven't even read all of the chapters. The test is tomorrow.  \nI couldn't bring myself to study one bit. My brain just wouldn't do it. What the hell is wrong with me?  \nI'd study today, but I have to go to work until 11 pm, it's 2 pm right now and I had to drag myself out of bed for a zoom class after an exhausting day yesterday, so I couldn't bring myself to get up earlier.  \nCollege really sucks. I'd drop out right now if I was able to make a living off the job I have right now.",

It\u2019s pulling hair to even participate in class for me too because my brain is like a static TV and i have no drive to do it. I\u2019m probably going to take a gap year next year to figure out what to do, because life is just so so overwhelming right now. I need a break to just figure out what to do with my degree and relax for a while and just work my current job which I enjoy very much without worrying about school\u2026 until I find what I want to do. \nI will keep in mind that it\u2019s only a grade though.. thank you so much :\u2019)",

      "text": "I know how you feel. I still have trouble studying, but I feel like it is because of my worsening depression since I studied pretty well and often in high school. At this point, I just remind myself that I'm spending X amount of money per semester and it'd be a waste of money if I chose not to study. I have plenty of time to study but I choose not to because my brain is like \"just sit on the couch and do nothing\" lol I'm taking personal responsibility though. I imagine my future and I can't see myself doing anything outside of my major, I don't even have a regular job ffs. I hope you do well though! Go with your gut on the answers...who knows, you could be right",

I used to be good at studying, but now I\u2019m not\u2026 \nThank you for the reminder about money though. I was thinking about withdrawing and stuff since I\u2019m also changing my degree entirely and I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll need this class for anything; (which TANKS my motivation too.) but in the end it does come down to money doesn\u2019t it\u2026 i guess I\u2019ll take responsibility too, even if I fail the test tomorrow\u2026 thank you, that was a really helpful reminder :\u2019) I\u2019ll keep that in mind for the future! \nI haven\u2019t studied at all but I\u2019ll do a lot of practice tests tonight and re-read my notes. I really appreciate it!",
