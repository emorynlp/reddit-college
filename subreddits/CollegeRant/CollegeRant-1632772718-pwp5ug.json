I still have trouble studying, but I feel like it is because of my worsening depression since I studied pretty well and often in high school. At this point, I just remind myself that I'm spending X amount of money per semester and it'd be a waste of money if I chose not to study. I have plenty of time to study but I choose not to because my brain is like \"just sit on the couch and do nothing\" lol I'm taking personal responsibility though. I imagine my future and I can't see myself doing anything outside of my major, I don't even have a regular job ffs. I hope you do well though!
