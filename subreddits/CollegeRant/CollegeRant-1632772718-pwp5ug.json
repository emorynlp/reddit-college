What the hell is wrong with me?  \nI'd study today, but I have to go to work until 11 pm, it's 2 pm right now and I had to drag myself out of bed for a zoom class after an exhausting day yesterday, so I couldn't bring myself to get up earlier.  \nCollege really sucks. I'd drop out right now if I was able to make a living off the job I have right now.", "author": "Isalamiii", "created": 1632772718, "retrieved": 1632840981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"heiclpf": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pwp5ug/i_have_a_science_test_covering_5_chapters_tomorrow/heiclpf/", "text": "Thank you u/Isalamiii for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I still have trouble studying, but I feel like it is because of my worsening depression since I studied pretty well and often in high school. At this point, I just remind myself that I'm spending X amount of money per semester and it'd be a waste of money if I chose not to study. I have plenty of time to study but I choose not to because my brain is like \"just sit on the couch and do nothing\" lol I'm taking personal responsibility though. I imagine my future and I can't see myself doing anything outside of my major, I don't even have a regular job ffs. I hope you do well though!
