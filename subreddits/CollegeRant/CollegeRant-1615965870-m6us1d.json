No matter what your load is?", "text": "I saw some posts here that say as such, but I felt as though they were too old for me to throw anything in, and I just wanted to say that I'm also feeling out of it.\n\nI'm a 3.8 undergrad, and I'm pursuing an English degree. Currently I have only a 9 credit semester, three courses in total. I've done 18 hour semesters, 15 hour semesters, and even 12-15 hour semesters with a job slapped on top of that. Not saying that to brag, just saying it as I'm no stranger to the low-down grind it can all be. \n\nBut what worries me nowadays is that, with my current 9 credit semester, I feel so done with everything. I could only get these courses, they're easy enough, I'm hanging in there *somewhat* but it's inadequate compared to how I used to be. If I was who I am now two years ago, I would have completely failed. I just thank God that even the profs are easing up on what's \"passable\".\n\nI feel tired, despite not doing anything, I feel like I can't even do the work needed for these classes despite them being nothing more than a walk in the park compared to everything else I've faced. And the load itself is pretty decent, actually, the most decent I ever had, but I just don't feel like I'm really doing good, or even wanting to continue despite being okay on paper. I'm not dropping out, but this is one of the most exhausting semesters I've taken despite everything pointing to the contrary. \n\nI don't know, anyone else feeling the same or am I just in a mood at the moment?", "author": "SirWangtheWizard", "created": 1615965870, "retrieved": 1632951508, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"grdgkvd": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/m6us1d/is_anyone_else_feeling_burnt_out_now_no_matter/grdgkvd/", "text": "My god that's me. I'm doing an 8 credit semester (it was 12 credits but I had to withdraw from a class). I've done 15 credit semesters and made the dean's list easy. I'm struggling to get through my two classes this semester. Last semester my GPA (for the semester) was a 4.0 and this semester is the first semester that I am absolutely sucking at this. No matter my work load, I still wouldn't be doing well because I just don't have it in me to do another semester of online work. I'm mad that I'm not doing well because for the first time in my academic career I feel like a huge failure. And my GPA determines how much tuition I'll have to pay when I transfer to my 4 year school. This just sucks and I feel you dude.", "author": "SheaCookieVillan", "created": 1616082266, "upvotes": 2}}}
