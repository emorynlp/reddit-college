{"sid": "jjzrkd", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/jjzrkd/college_has_become_unbearable/", "title:": "College has become unbearable.", "text": "I'm a chemistry major, so my life was mostly studying *before* COVID, but now it's all I ever do. I have two lab classes per week, a weekly oral report in one class, and a 20-page lab report due every week in another. I average about three quizzes per week, and just finished my fifth midterm this week. \n\nI literally don't do anything but work anymore. I'm severely depressed and my friends don't talk anymore because, well, nobody actually sees each other. We have to do a mandatory two-week quarantine in a hotel room if we even come into the same room as a positive case, and I don't think I'll be able to handle the stress of full quarantine plus my course load. Expulsion after the second COVID-related offense. A truly disturbing number of people I know have either attempted suicide or developed serious drug issues in the past couple of months. Social isolation had made me paranoid around other people and my social anxiety has become ten times worse than it has ever been. I feel like this is absolutely ruining me. \n\nI want to help stop the spread, but at what cost to my mental and physical wellbeing? I feel like such a piece of shit because my college's administration *constantly* sends out emails shaming students, telling us we should be ashamed if we don't agree with the restrictions put in place (because it's \"our duty\" to help). One of my weekly COVID tests came back \"invalid\" (meaning an error occured in the analysis), and our health center lectured ME when I called to reschedule, as if it was somehow my fault. I completely agree that we need to do our part to stop COVID, but I'm tired of the shame and threats, because I feel like the restrictions are slowly killing me. Making students feel ashamed for wanting normalcy is the worst possible thing for anyone with a mental illness. \n\nWhat's the point anymore? My college doesn't allow gap years, so I have no choice but to suffer through literal *constant* work and studying, all in solitude, with nothing to break the monotony. I completely understand why the restrictions are important, but it's hard not to feel like it's a little inhumane to keep someone confined to a tiny room for months with nothing but homework to do. Idk.
