I was never able to make any friends, I can't find a job in my field, I'm stuck with all this damn debt. I'm wondering what all of this was for, did I pay all this money just to be miserable for four years and then end up with nothing? I wish I had never gone to college and I had just learned welding like my friends, at least they actually have a useful skill. I was so stupid and naive, this has been such a horrible mistake.
