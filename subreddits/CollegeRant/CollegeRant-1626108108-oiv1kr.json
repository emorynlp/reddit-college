  "text": "It's my first time having an officer role in an organization. Basically, my first time ever being an officer in general. I was appointed the position and had no choice. Im so anxious. I am doubting my leadership capabilities. I just think that everything happens for a reason and that this is the universe's way of letting me explore my strengths and letting me get out of my comfort zone. It was my firat day today and literally everyone has a lot of leadership experience, im the odd one out. Im just super anxious. I hope i can do this.",
