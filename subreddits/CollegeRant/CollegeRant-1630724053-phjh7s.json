One of these classes was through a school in Argentina (think of it like an online exchange program). Anyways, the school in Argentina took too long transferring the credits and now my school is saying I can't graduate until the fall. Does anyone have and idea what I can do about this? My job requires me to be a college graduate so now my livelihood is at stake because of a clerical error that was frankly out of my control. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.", "author": "sexhaver2006", "created": 1630724053, "retrieved": 1632841167, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbixyaw": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/phjh7s/please_help_college_wont_let_me_graduate_despite/hbixyaw/", "text": "Thank you u/sexhaver2006 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
