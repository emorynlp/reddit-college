I hate staring at a computer for so long- classes, assignments, internships and college clubs are all online and it's driving me crazy. Before corona, I used to have a solid 1-hour commute to college and I got so much reading- from physical books that I borrowed from the library- done in that hour. Last march I genuinely thought this online crap was going to last 3 months max. While I'm still getting decent grades it's only because I work twice as hard and force myself to focus and I'm burning out. When I had actual books it was easier to tune out electronics, switch off notifs and get work done. But my college profs update through email and I'm always on my phone and my internship is virtual so I'm always typing stuff and spend  12-14 hours hunched in front of a screen. I don't want to whine too much because I know others have it worse but it'll be easier if I knew when the pandemic will end so ill have a particular date to look forward to.", "author": "Drogo45", "created": 1611566152, "retrieved": 1632842865, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 183, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gkovz8j": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/l4k8no/i_miss_actual_books/gkovz8j/", "text": "Thank you u/Drogo45 for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
