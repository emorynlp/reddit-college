  "text": "Basically, I'm being accused of cheating because I spent too long in the bathroom and had my phone on me. my professor put one of the homework questions on the exam and the answer key was on Canvas. I'm not really worried about this whole situation because I didn't cheat but the one thing I'm slightly concerned about is the fact that I had accessed the answer key an hour before class because I was studying. I'm going to have a meeting with someone from the cheating department and I'm worried that they'll show me some sort of canvas data log that includes the date I accessed the files. so my question is does anyone know if canvas provides these data logs, and if so, how specific are they? do they have the date only? or the time as well? what information would those data logs provide that could be used against me in my meeting?",
