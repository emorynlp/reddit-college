I barely scraped by last semester, I ended with one A, one B, two C\u2019s and a withdrawal because I was failing chemistry ughh. I\u2019m on the verge of failing chem a second time this summer and I\u2019m probably going to make a C in calculus. And so, I definitely feel like it\u2019s time to make a switch. My current plan is to transfer to community college and get an associates degree in Sonography... but I\u2019m somewhat unsure of that. I just have this fear that I won\u2019t like that either and if I get accepted to that program I will have to go through with it. \nI am also living at home with my mom to go to college and if I go to CC I will most likely have to dorm since it is an hour drive away and I will be doing clinicals 3 days a week, and class 2 days a week, the labs last from 8am-3pm. Idk I love my mom so much and we are best friends, somewhat unusual for college students but I really am dreading moving out and she doesn\u2019t want me to either ;_; Ultimately though there are a lot of pros to transferring and entering that program, it feels like it gives me a purpose and I am pretty much guaranteed a high paying job with just an associates... with a bachelors in biology I would be fighting with lab rats just to get a job and end up making a solid 40k :/ I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just so bad at taking control of my life and DOING something, I\u2019ve just been coasting along since high school, the college I\u2019m currently attending I hate sm and I knew I would but I never applied to any other school. \n\nLol I\u2019m sorry this is all over the place but if anyone could give me advice for transferring that would be nice. I would also like to know if anyone has gone through Sonography school and if it was extremely challenging. Also has anyone tried commuting an hour each way? I\u2019m so unsure of myself at this point and the registration deadline is closing in I guess I just want some reassurance because I don\u2019t know what to do with my life.", "author": "kawifuru", "created": 1596268020, "retrieved": 1632951489, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 39, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g0fimd2": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i1ohes/thinking_of_transferring_to_community_college/g0fimd2/", "text": "Weigh the costs. CCs are usually cheaper but if you have to dorm and some other added cost idk if it is more or less than your current college. If it\u2019s less go for it. The best advice I could give to anyone Pertaining to college is to not be afraid to look around at different majors. DO NOT be like me and study Computer engineering for 4 years and then switch majors. It\u2019s super not cool and is much more expensive than if I were to have gone to CC for a bit to figure out what I really wanted.", "author": "digbickjimmy69", "created": 1596624564, "upvotes": 1}, "g07a6yx": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i1ohes/thinking_of_transferring_to_community_college/g07a6yx/", "text": "Yeah I am in CC and I\u2019m really glad I haven\u2019t transferred yet, I feel like being at a commuter college is where it\u2019s at right now with COVID, a lot of the bullshit other places are pulling to try to get money out of housing and food plans and all that aren\u2019t an issue at all.

It helped me a lot and I actually changed my major since I finally decided what I might actually want to do with my life. CC is definitely a good option, I commute though so I don\u2019t know how dorming would be. And even though driving an hour does sound kind of annoying, it\u2019s probably better for you then dorming. An hour isn\u2019t TOO long and you\u2019ll be able to play some nice music or a podcast before school and maybe it\u2019ll turn into a relaxation thing for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine with whatever path you choose, don\u2019t stress over it too much, it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders just keep going", "author": "Skullman212", "created": 1596326162, "upvotes": 4}, "g005p6e": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/i1ohes/thinking_of_transferring_to_community_college/g005p6e/", "text": "While I think community college is a good choice are there any closer to you that offer the program you want?
