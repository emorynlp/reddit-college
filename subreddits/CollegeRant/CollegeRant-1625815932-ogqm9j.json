The kicker- she has to pay out of state for a year. She is super smart and has a 4.0gpa plus a 30 on her act, which would get her a full ride somewhere like Chicago. But not at our college. No, she gets like $3,000 waived but then ha $16,000 a semester left to pay. Her parents won\u2019t help so she\u2019s paying for everything with loans and she doesn\u2019t qualify for any fafsa. I feel like I basically put a noose around her neck convincing her to go to this college, but now she\u2019s signed her lease and can\u2019t leave. I don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s not being offered more scholarships. Are we just being stupid and not understanding how scholarships work? She said she applied through various websites and just got subscriptions to news letters. Her words \u201cWhy am I trying to hard to keep a 4.0 when it doesn\u2019t get me anywhere?\u201d Thanks in advance for reading.", "author": "Rottikinns", "created": 1625815932, "retrieved": 1632841832, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"h4kgdfq": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/ogqm9j/my_super_smart_friend_is_getting_scammed/h4kgdfq/", "text": "Thank you u/Rottikinns for posting on r/collegerant. \n\nRemember to read the rules and report rule breaking posts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d focus more on the scholarships offered through the college, which you can usually find on the college\u2019s website, or talk to student financial aid to get a deeper understanding as to what\u2019s going on. maybe there\u2019s something about being a transfer student that\u2019s hindering scholarships.\n\nher biggest concern should be why FAFSA didn\u2019t offer her any aid. is she claimed as a dependent or is she an independent student? if the student is dependent, FAFSA looks at the financial security of the parents and does or does not offer aid depending on what they find. if the student is independent then they look at the student\u2019s financials. in Illinois (my state) I became independent at age 24 and it\u2019s actually opened up more financial aid options for me.", "author": "WingsofRain", "created": 1625874531, "upvotes": 2}}}
