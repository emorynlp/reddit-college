I have no others plans for myself. I am pursuing a college course that I really don't want. I went back to a place which cause me trauma.

It's OK. But you'll definitely get nothing with envy. Try to not compare yourself with others since everyone has their own path. Try new things, try to change your routine, communicate with people who inspire you - then you'll be clear about your next steps.

I am 26 and have a year left of Undergraduate. I attended a Community College 2 years after High School and ended up taking time off. I was in the same boat.  Not sure what I wanted to do and depressed over a failed relationship.  It took me until I was 24 to figure out exactly what I want to do.  You have time.
