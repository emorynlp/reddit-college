Usually it\u2019s a purpose, a responsibility, or something to the like. Whether it be being a parent, continuing a project, looking forward to a new game or show that\u2019s coming out, or going to classes, it\u2019s a reason for getting out of bed. I feel as though I need to figure an ambition for myself before I can pretend to care about anything else in life; because if you can\u2019t even get out of bed without feeling groggy about what\u2019s to come, then what is the point in continuing to persevere?\n\nCollege is supposed to be all about ambition. At least, that\u2019s what it needs to be about. You\u2019re pursuing a degree, attending classes, participating in clubs, hanging out with people you enjoy being around, and more. But all of these activities seem to lose meaning without the ambition that makes them feel worth doing. Pick a college major without ambition, it doesn\u2019t feel worth completing. Join a club without ambition, it doesn\u2019t feel worth participating in. Hang with friends that don\u2019t make you feel appreciated, you feel alone. \n\nSo the question becomes, what is ambition supposed to mean? There\u2019s a degree, a club, a friend out there that makes the college journey worth it, but how do you find it? How do you find the ambition?\n\nTL;DR: Where do we find the ambition that makes the college journey feel worth getting out of bed for?", "author": "TheZarcFiles", "created": 1623884894, "retrieved": 1632949690, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h22zge1": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/o1i98n/what_is_ambition_supposed_to_mean/h22zge1/", "text": "You find ambition in your \"why.\"\n\nWhy are you attending college?
