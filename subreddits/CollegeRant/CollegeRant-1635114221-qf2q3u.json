  "text": "I normally don't post around, but I need to rant. I am currently on my first quarter of my sophomore year and I'm a computer science major. I was excited at first to learn coding but now it slowly has become boring. The content is unengaging, and I have realized that coding for me is a hobby, not a career. I sometimes wish we had tools such as web assign for coding that could help students improve their skills and help them stay motivated but that isn't the case. I'm not the only one who feels this way. A lot of people in this field of study I know also feel that way. My mental health lately has gone downhill, and my grades have gone down as well. My personality has also changed a lot in the past year. I am a completely different person, and I currently have a job where I work with a lot of people and it just feels good to interact and talk to people. I just love being around people and working with them. My mom works in logistics and management and she talks to me about her career and it sounds amazing. Me, on the other hand, I'm just miserable and even though any type of engineering major is like that, I have realized that I simply don't think I should dedicate the rest of my life to this. I am trying to meet with an advisor this week to speak more about it, but at the moment I just feel like a failure and just stressed in general. I am glad that I'm not the only one feeling this way, but I now understand what is like to feel cornered and being able to pretty much not do anything about if for the rest of the term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I want to switch from computer science to something else because I just don't enjoy it anymore and I feel like a failure.",

      "text": "Hey, you\u2019re definitely not alone! I thought I was gonna major in computer science too, but now I\u2019m looking at sociology. Talk to your advisor and tell them what you\u2019re interested in now, that should get everyone\u2019s gears turning and they\u2019ll help you find something else to do. At least 80% of college students change their major! Good luck!",
