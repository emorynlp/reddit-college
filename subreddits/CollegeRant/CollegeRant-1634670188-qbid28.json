  "text": "Is it just me or do they always give the worst advice? Like they rather you pay more than less. All of them seem jealous that I get Pell grant and try to give me bad advice like \"just do 1 class this semester\" when they know my Pell grant won't kick in until I do at least 6 credits. Or \"take 15 credits this semester\" even though they know Pell grant gives the max amount of aid at 12 credits, so I won't get any extra aid for 15 credits. Or \"just clep out of these classes\" when I obviously don't know enough to pass the test, and will have to pay out of pocket for that. Or \"oh you're an art major, why don't you work in an art museum and get paid minimum wage?\" (I've switched majors since then but yes an \"advisor\" actually told me that). Lately my problem with them has been that I'm trying to transfer to a university and there's a bunch of prerequisites that I'd have to take BEFORE I transfer. So what my \"advisor\" is trying to tell me is that I should just take the 6 credits I have left for my A.A., graduate, then pay out of pocket for the remaining 20 credits in prerequisites.
