{"sid": "pogfc3", "link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/pogfc3/is_it_okay_to_feel_unfair/", "title:": "Is it okay to feel unfair?", "text": " \n\nI'm an architectural student, and this is my last sem before graduating (not sure, because our thesis sucks and the pandemic makes it really hard to pull off). So usually thesis years, we had to choose who will be our groupmates (btw it consists of 3 members). So since we are 6 in our barkada, we divided into 2 groups, but the groupings didn't go as plan. Long story short the 1st sem starts, and my thesis title became our final thesis topic. So since my title passed, I took the initiative to write our book. But as time goes, I already felt that they became dependent on me writing our thesis. I know that it's my title and I take initiative but it's just we are a group and I always remind them to also study our topic and help me to search and think. Still, I'm the only one who always thinks and works on our thesis, the same goes in every consultation, I'm the only one who always answers every question. While I work on our thesis overnight, they are soundly sleeping. I didn't also get a chance to attend all our classes because of writing our thesis to compile in the deadline. I already told them many times that it's hard to do it alone. I always politely ask them and give them tasks. But sometimes I've only become disappointed in their output since it looks that no effort has been exerted. That they even don't understand our topic after the long run.\n\nI've become depressed, I cry every night and to my mom about our thesis. I also neglect myself and my other subject just to compile. My anxiety also gets worst to the point that getting sleep becomes hard for me, as well as eating. But despite that, I continue working since I cannot fail and disappoint my parents especially my mom. The pressure eats me until there's nothing left. I'm so drained. I blame myself for not be able to choose a groupmates. But even though I've been through all of that shit I'm still kind to them, I'm still open-minded to understand them since we're friends for 4 years. And I'm also the kind of person that didn't take credit, since I don't want to brag or anything, and I don't want them to look bad at others. And it still continues.\n\nThe defense took place and our thesis passed. I'm so happy and proud, however when I learned that their grades are higher than mine in other subjects. It just feels unfair. I'm not a grade-conscious type of student but there's something heavy and I don't know if it's valid to feel that. I felt that I've been taken for granted. One of them is the worst. \n\nThis second sem, I've become drained to the point I lost interest in continuing our thesis. But I know I cannot stop because I had no choice.", "author": "feeling_wendy", "created": 1631670130, "retrieved": 1632948549, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
