In Canada instead of Spring Break we have what\u2019s call Reading Break, and while the purpose is supposed to help you catch up on your studies, the real reason is I guess this week had the highest rates of suicide for post secondary students as it was usually the around the time students would be finding out if they qualified for graduation that year...or not, or if they got into their masters or doctorate program...or not.\n\nThe program I took would deliberately overload its first and second years students to weed out the weak ones. We had 12 more credits in our major than average so the first and second year students would take six classes a semester. I was a transfer student so I was able to avoid the grind a little since I had enough credits I didn\u2019t have to do six courses a semester. I ended up cutting my course load down to 4 a semester, did way better, and actually was able to enjoy the experience. \n\nConsider doing that if you can. Real life can wait another year. As someone who was a mature student I don\u2019t get this drive kids have to get their degree by 21. Slow down, live a little.\n\nOr if you\u2019re just interested in your small business maybe you\u2019re in the wrong program? There are a a lot of small business or administration type programs at community colleges. I actually started my post secondary education at this type of program, and completed a one year administration certificate so I could break out of the retail and food service jobs. Then decided to keep going and got a degree but I\u2019ll be honest with you that administration certificate and experience has gotten me more jobs than my fine arts degree has, and has even been a factor in the fine arts jobs I have gotten.", "author": "sweetnesssa", "created": 1607527218, "upvotes": 4}, "gf66x29": {"link": "/r/CollegeRant/comments/k9gsjl/is_college_supposed_to_be_this_stressful_and/gf66x29/", "text": "One thing to consider is, is this your first semester?
