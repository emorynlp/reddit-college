  "text": "Been stress crying for months now because I'm not sure if this is really what I want. I dont want to sound ungrateful but I'm seriously not happy about college... or school in general. I hate conforming to the strict rules and deadlines. Is this really worth it?\nI just want to focus on my small business tbh...\n\n I just feel like a lot of my time is wasted doing hw instead of doing what I want to do. I'm so tired... I wanna quit.\n\nEdit: the fact that almost 200 people agree shows how there's something wrong with the school system. Learning should be fun, not torturous.",

      "text": "The answer is essentially yes. In Canada instead of Spring Break we have what\u2019s call Reading Break, and while the purpose is supposed to help you catch up on your studies, the real reason is I guess this week had the highest rates of suicide for post secondary students as it was usually the around the time students would be finding out if they qualified for graduation that year...or not, or if they got into their masters or doctorate program...or not.\n\nThe program I took would deliberately overload its first and second years students to weed out the weak ones. We had 12 more credits in our major than average so the first and second year students would take six classes a semester. I was a transfer student so I was able to avoid the grind a little since I had enough credits I didn\u2019t have to do six courses a semester. I ended up cutting my course load down to 4 a semester, did way better, and actually was able to enjoy the experience. \n\nConsider doing that if you can. Real life can wait another year. As someone who was a mature student I don\u2019t get this drive kids have to get their degree by 21. Slow down, live a little.\n\nOr if you\u2019re just interested in your small business maybe you\u2019re in the wrong program? There are a a lot of small business or administration type programs at community colleges. I actually started my post secondary education at this type of program, and completed a one year administration certificate so I could break out of the retail and food service jobs. Then decided to keep going and got a degree but I\u2019ll be honest with you that administration certificate and experience has gotten me more jobs than my fine arts degree has, and has even been a factor in the fine arts jobs I have gotten.",

At my school you can get a refund on tuition through like the first week of the semester, so you can likely get your money back for the spring if you paid already. If you take time off, that\u2019s totally ok, just make it purposeful. It sounds like you have something going with your business. That might be a good use of your time right now until the pandemic settles down and you can focus on school when class is in person again. I know people that have taken time off though, only to go to a low paying service job like they had in high school and never return. There\u2019s a lot that someone at your school can help with, just make an appointment with them and I\u2019m sure they can answer all your questions. At the end of the day it\u2019s up to you though",

Again, just talk to an advisor and they can essentially defer you for a semester until the fall. You don\u2019t need to have a big reason, some people do that just to work 40 hours a week at some basic job and get money to finish school. Others are just burnt out and need a break for a bit. Some people finish school quickly and others might take longer, that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s the degree in the end that matters, regardless of when you get it.",

Is your major related at all to your small business idea? Have you gotten passed all the gen ed stuff you have no interest in? If not, try to push forward until you can take electives (based on your major) to see if you still like school. If the work load is to much then try being a part time student, that way you can balance school, social life, etc better.",

      "text": "i understand the feeling. college is one of the largest reasons why im depressed. its honestly so mentally and emotionally grueling for some of us, so i truly get it.\n\nbefore considering dropping out, i would go for more of a middle ground first. you could decide to take the semester or the year off. see how it suits you. if its what you want and you have a reasonable plan of action, you could simply transition from that gap into just dropping out completely. you can always go back to school, so there's truly no rush if you see a better route for yourself.\n\ni would also try to narrow down exactly what's causing you distress. is it your specific major? is it your specific college? is it the idea of a 4 year university? how's community college sound? trade school? this will not only help you make a more informed decision, but make a more confident decision.\n\nwhatever you decide, i wish you the best of luck. remember to take care of your mental health, whatever that means for you.\n\nedit: another possibility you could consider is becoming a part-time student rather than a full-time student, if thats an option your school gives you.",

          "text": "This is a great decision tree. I'll also add this- it's much easier to bear the difficulty of higher education if you're truly passionate about your major. The fact that you're questioning what you want out of college tells me that the light at the end of the tunnel may not be worth the heartache for you. There's no reason to put yourself through this if it's not going to get you where you want in life.\n\nBest of luck OP, we're here for you.",
