      "text": "I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I'm going to say it anyway: buy a laser printer (plus a stapler, 3-hole punch, and a few 3-ring binders) and print the heck out of everything. \n\nIt gives your eyes a break. You can read/study wherever. You're sitting in different position than in front of the computer. You can write/note on the pages. And if you're working with a few different documents, it's like having the most amazing handy \"second monitor\" ever.  And your ability to proof-read will sky rocket once you have things printed on paper.\n\nYes, reading on screen was supposed to replace paper and printing stuff is old school, blah blah bah. But if you're full time school (or work) online, you have to think about your health, efficiency, comfort, and sanity.\n\nAlso, though it's more costly, you might find it worthwhile to buy hardcopy versions of textbooks rather than ebooks, where possible.",
