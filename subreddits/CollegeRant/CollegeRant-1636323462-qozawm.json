  "text": "I initially signed up for three classes. Math, CS, and chem but chemistry was too hard from the first week, so I dropped it. \n\nNow I just dropped out of a math class that I found out I was failing today.\n\nI\u2019m only taking one class this semester now and I feel so pathetic. I can\u2019t even handle being a full time student because of my anxiety. I feel like I\u2019m never gonna graduate and transfer from CC. \n\nSome words of encouragement would be great to hear/read right now. I\u2019m trying not to give up on my education but I\u2019ve also thought many times that I should just completely drop out of college and get a job.",

      "text": "You\u2019ll get through it. Some classes require more attention than others despite how many credits they are. I\u2019m taking Chem II (Lec +Lab), Precalc, Spanish, intro to Bio course. I had to drop my chem lab and I\u2019m failing my precalc course. BUT I\u2019m passing my other three classes. Next semester My main focus will be precalc and my chem lab along with maybe one other class. If I may ask what major are you going for? I only ask because CS AND chem aren\u2019t usually two classes people take for the same major",

      "text": "Sheesh, you took math and chemistry in the same semester? I don't blame you for dropping the class. My brother tried to do the same thing and he ended up dropping the class too so you're definitely not alone. As for only taking one class, I'm doing that right now lol. I was taking one or two at a time because I had to work full time and it was difficult juggling both and getting assignments done on time etc. What helped me was taking summer courses and now I'm about 80% done. So you should look into summer classes to help speed things up and don't feel bad about taking only 1 class because trust me I know lots of people who do that. Finish this semester strong, regroup yourself and figure whats the best option going forward but I will never suggest dropping out of college.",
