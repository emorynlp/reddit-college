  "text": "Does every school have their own portal where you upload things like the srar and transcript after finishing the commonapp application? If so, is it fine if these documents are submitted after the november first deadline? If I have to submit them before november first, would submitting the commonapp applications by october 20th be a good date so I have enough time for the other stuff?",
