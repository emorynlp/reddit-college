  "title:": "Nobody deserves any spot at any private University or College.",
  "text": "College Admissions is like having a crush on a girl. You can be nice to her, send her flowers, write her poems, and she still has every choice to reject you and go for another guy. You don't deserve her love and the guy she picked did not \"steal\" your spot. \n\nShe can pick the guy for any reason at all. Maybe she likes rich guys, funny guys. Maybe all her life, she's been dating athletic guys and wants to date a slim guy or short guy. Maybe she finds Hispanic guys and their culture interesting and what she wants for herself. Don't go writing a whole 7-paragraph essay about how girls don't appreciate \"Nice Guys\"\n\nThat's the same with College (Private). Nobody deserves to get in (even the ones that get in) because the College owes nobody nothing (unless you paid for admissions and have a signed contract but what are the chances of that?) So if the College wants to accept more rich people to help their budget, why not? I'm poor but even I understand the basic economics behind it. So if a College wants to go test-optional and accepts someone with a 1100 SAT, so what? I didn't go test-optional but I understand the basic logic behind it. So if a College doesn't want to be a racial monolith and wants to accept more minority students, so what? Every student will benefit from the diversity anyways. \n\nThe College application process is not perfect and you have every cause to be frustrated as there is so little transparency and you can hardly know anything but this whole, \"unqualified applicants\", \"Stole my spot\", \"Didn't deserve to get in\" rhetoric is redundant. Nobody stole your spot because you never had a spot to begin with, Nobody deserves to get in anywhere cause the college has all arbitrary power to decide who they want and who they don't, Nobody that was accepted is unqualified because who dictates who is qualified and who is not? Not you!\n\nSo yeah, lol. Let's stop acting like babies. At the end of the day, people, justifiably, will use whatever legal means they can to increase their chances in this crapshoot system. It's how life works...\n\nEdit: to those saying that they don't care if that's how life works and they want to work to make it better, go change your Public Universities. That doesn't detract from my point. They are established with the sole purpose of serving you. If you the people don't think diversity or financial ability is important to higher education then go ahead and petition your leaders to make your public universities \"meritocratic\". Do something about it! My plan and hope is to go to a top Uni, become billionaire rich and build a transparent, tuition-free college. What's yours?\n\nEdit 2: giving this comment a pedestal. \n\"For those of you arguing that OP\u2019s post is bad because it says \u201cjust deal with it\u201d instead of suggesting change - well, the point of this post is to call out people whining about losing university spots. And whining was never going to change the system in the first place. If you want to make a difference, if you want to fix the flaws, complaining about how your spot got stolen is *not* doing anything. Read OP\u2019s post, accept that the system wasn\u2019t fair to you (or to most people in general) and accept that others got in instead of you, and go fix it in a productive manner.\"",

Yes, even Ivies receive some government money. This is why the idea of the \u201ctrue private\u201d is a little more evasive than many believe.",

Harvard publicly releases the findings and the government gets the info. Get what I'm saying?",

They are savings but not really cause if colleges saved cash, inflation would destroy their savings so they invest in things like stocks to keep their money afloat. That's the same as being non-profit. Taxing Colleges would harm colleges with more poor kids cause they are the ones that are usually need-aware and need large donations to survive.",

Stuff like Olympic medals, world records, global positive PR, and athletic championships have real and tangible value.  Those two did more for their university than 90%+ of the other students who were admitted alongside them.\n\nShould private schools struggling with finances be allowed to give wealthy donors an advantage in the admissions process?  What if that's the only way for the school to stay open or to provide necessary aid to poorer students?    \n\nShould context be considered in admissions?  What if a student's parents die and their grades drop for a couple months.  Is that just a permanent black mark on the student's record, denying them a chance because they didn't \"merit\" admission?  What if their parents are poor and need them to work part time to make ends meet?  Should that be considered?",

Having a purely meritocratic system is a horrible idea, and if that's what you still think after looking at the logistics of it, then our moral codes *are* quite different. Beyond the brutality of those systems, it rewards the privileged and elite much more than we do (who do you think can afford to study for hours on end to prove their \"merit\" - someone with a perfect family and wealth, or someone who needs to work to feed an impoverished family?).\n\nThat isn't to say we shouldn't have any meritocracy though - like many others, I do agree that the US system should have more meritocracy than it does now, although I don't necessarily have a perfect solution for that. But making the college process just a meritocracy like you're saying is definitely not the solution.",

Your value isn't decided by your education, just like not wearing gucci doesn't mean you don't have fashion. You'll be as successful as you can be of you work hard and make connections \ud83d\udc4f",

As true as this post is, fully accepting colleges' \"arbitrary power\" is sort of an is-ought fallacy. Fleeting and redundant as rants are, at least they show the riddled holes in the system, even if overly biased and subjective. People who \"whine\" ultimately just want the company and the ability to vent their frustration, and ultimately I do not see the issue with that. Offering our condolences is probably is as far as we will go and there is no wrong in doing so.\n\nYes, private institutions can basically do whatever the fuck they want, is it so wrong to *wish* they were a bit different?",

My problem is when these people are not doing it merely out of an aim to improve the system but are trying to shoot down others and ridicule their achievements by attributing their success to the \"faults\" in the system. Regardless, merit-based isn't all Roses and rainbows. As u/ScholarGrade said:\n\n\" \n\nThe issue here is how you measure merit. Do you just give a standardized test? That ends up favoring the wealthy and privileged who can devote 12 hours a day to studying with expensive tutors. Do you consider things like athletic ability in the equation? You can't convince me Andrew Luck and Katie Ledecky didn't deserve their spots at Stanford, especially considering their impact on Stanford's reputation and public image. Stuff like Olympic medals, world records, global positive PR, and athletic championships have real and tangible value. Those two did more for their university than 90%+ of the other students who were admitted alongside them.\n\nShould private schools struggling with finances be allowed to give wealthy donors an advantage in the admissions process? What if that's the only way for the school to stay open or to provide necessary aid to poorer students?\n\nShould context be considered in admissions? What if a student's parents die and their grades drop for a couple months. Is that just a permanent black mark on the student's record, denying them a chance because they didn't \"merit\" admission? What if their parents are poor and need them to work part time to make ends meet? Should that be considered?\n\n\"",

The only advocate we can be is advocates for ourselves and perhaps people like ourselves. While not every rant will merit some sort of drastic change, at least we can examine each case, at least we start to think--\"what if\". \n\nColleges have the difficult job of balancing all of this, but as undefinable merit is, it is still at the core of admissions philosophy no matter how arbitrary. \n\nEveryone who ranted wished the system benefited themselves. While there are toxic people who wish to crush others, most of us agree there are people who certainly have done some pretty backhanded things. \n\nObviously, the questions you gave were meant to be sobering rhetorical and we can infinitely spirl what-ifs. Which is just the different side of the same coin as the people who rant.",

But whatever. \n\nMore importantly, while I agree with your sentiment that \" \"unqualified applicants\", \"Stole my spot\", \"Didn't deserve to get in\" \" etc. complaints aren't good, I think the real problem here IS with the colleges. Colleges aren't like girls- colleges are establishments, many of which manipulate and (imo) abuse students/faculty for profit.  Colleges don't choose \"Hispanic guys... because they find their culture interesting;\" they pick and choose individuals who will provide the most money, effort, and time for their school. \"Every student will benefit from the diversity anyways\" Why? How??? The majority of process' colleges impart aren't for the benefit of the student - it's for the institution. It's a broken system, one we students have barely any control over if any at all.   \n\n\nSo sure, maybe people aren't \"complaining\" in a healthy way (and their frustration should be turned more towards the institution rather than other students), but it's ridiculous to not address that this system exists and students have a right to complain.",

Do you just give a standardized test? That ends up favoring the wealthy and privileged who can devote 12 hours a day to studying with expensive tutors. Do you consider things like athletic ability in the equation? You can't convince me Andrew Luck and Katie Ledecky didn't deserve their spots at Stanford, especially considering their impact on Stanford's reputation and public image. Stuff like Olympic medals, world records, global positive PR, and athletic championships have real and tangible value. Those two did more for their university than 90%+ of the other students who were admitted alongside them.\n\nShould private schools struggling with finances be allowed to give wealthy donors an advantage in the admissions process? What if that's the only way for the school to stay open or to provide necessary aid to poorer students?\n\nShould context be considered in admissions? What if a student's parents die and their grades drop for a couple months. Is that just a permanent black mark on the student's record, denying them a chance because they didn't \"merit\" admission? What if their parents are poor and need them to work part time to make ends meet? Should that be considered?\n\n\"",

Plus, what about legacy admissions? Even if it benefits the college, it does feed into a cycle it being only accessible to certain people. For something as important to economic equality as college education, I think the line needs to be drawn somewhere.\n\nEdit:\nAlso I\u2019ll add I agree with you that people shouldn\u2019t say they specifically \u201cdeserved a spot\u201d since that\u2019s arrogant and entitled. But life should be a meritocracy,  and work should equate to results. So I believe that, in general, people who work to achieve something deserve it more than people who don\u2019t work as hard.",

Good, well-educated, well-read white boys (and later, girls), were necessary for the well-being of the white, and predominantly Christian, race. It helped them keep their superior hold on the rest of the world. Once colleges were made to accept people of color, they reorganized themselves into the business model they are today - forcing people of color and the poorer working classes to *pay* for the privilege to be education. This got exacerbated with immigration. How to get a pie of the immigrant savings pie? Charge them. They want a better life - let them pay for it!\n\nColleges are not in the charity business. Look around all the conditions of nearly every college in the nation today. They are busting to the seams with money - endowment funds, pension plans, administrative costs - they even milk revenue from application fees that can easily go into funding a building per college per year. But colleges won't share that wealth or spread it around. The communities they are located in are predominantly working class - very few good schools are surrounded by equally stellar surroundings. Cities and towns have unspoken contracts - called bribes in layperson's terms, bu that is the condition of pretty much everything everywhere nowadays - to let things rot, as long as endowments go up and up. \n\nWhen kids speak about colleges not having an obligation to accept anyone, they're not completely wrong. Colleges, being a business, can choose who they accept or not. But they fact is they don't sell themselves as a business. They pretend they are doing society a great of good, and that every person must have a college education, otherwise they are the scum of the earth and not worth speaking with or about. And when colleges put that burden on the public - to get educated, somehow, at whatever cost it may be - and to accept nothing less than the \"best\" \"education\" - that is no longer being a business that is open and transparent - that is a conman practicing deceit. \n\nAnd deceitful is where colleges are at today. \n\nThat is something no one should accept. No one.",

The admissions committees have a diverse staff and if all of those races had substantiated claims then the Ives would be overwhelmingly homogeneous. We know that's not the case as my Indonesian friend got disproved. First lesson of life unless historically oppressed and documented, its probably not discrimination and more just being salty.",

People who are interesting, outgoing, funny, and kind, and they don't get rejected (by everyone). Have you ever seen a person say \"they don't deserve them?\" Because I have and it makes sense. People deserve to be with someone they love, and someone that will love them.\n\nIf Harvard can't love me they can fuck off but that doesn't mean I don't deserve someone just as good as them.\n\nThat being said lmao I don't deserve to go to Harvard I'm not that great haha pls take me northeastern",

There's steps people need to take to get there, and people should have to work for it (which is how relationships work btw idk If you've ever been in one). If you spent as much time bettering yourself and talking to people to hone your social skills you'll either find yourself in a relationship, or at least have been presented the opportunity. I was kind of like an incel early on in like late middle school to early high school but I cleaned myself up worked on my social skills and I've been in a relationship/had the opportunity to be in other relationships. The issue with most incels is that they aren't willing to put in that effort.\n\nPeople who work hard deserve to go to a college that will reward them for their effort. Now obviously this doesn't happen because there are plenty of extremely talented people that get rejected from their top choices but they still end up going to college, just not their top choice.

I am saying 'IF' they are not being meritocratic.  the fact is the schools do benefit a bit from people assuming they are more meritocratic than they actually are. When you hear someone is harvard educated, you don't think 'oh they must have rich parents' the most common thought is believed to be 'oh they are smart' or 'oh they are accomplished'. Although that is definitely changing and being eroded as people find out more about the actual processes.",

Legacies are something they should look to remove but the same people who clamor to be admitted want to simply rub shoulders with those legacies and be in their network.
