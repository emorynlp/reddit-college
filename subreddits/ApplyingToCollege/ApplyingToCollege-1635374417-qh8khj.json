  "title:": "Confirmed from an AO that AP scores do in fact matter",
  "text": "An admissions officer from USC visited my school last week. For some reason no one went to the meeting except for me and one other person, so we just asked him a bunch of questions one on one. \n\nGot some great insight, but one of the biggest things that came up was AP scores. I told him that I\u2019ve seen this controversy where some people say AP scores matter while others say they don\u2019t matter at all. He said in general, yes and no but mostly yes. \n\nApparently according to him, if you hear a college AO say that AP scores don\u2019t matter, this is usually under the assumption that the applicant self reported their scores and didn\u2019t send official score reports from college board. In this case, AOs won\u2019t weigh AP scores too much on you since they don\u2019t really trust the self report. \n\nHowever, if you send the send your scores report directly from college board BEFORE the application deadline (and surprisingly some students don\u2019t actually do this), then yes AOs will consider your performance on them when assessing your application. This was also actually confirmed by a Berkeley AO on this subreddit who said the same thing: that good AP scores (especially in the field of interest) benefit applicants. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that bad scores do not hurt you. Scores of 3+ only help you. \n\nAnd this should make sense. He said that people who get 3s 4s and 5s typically worked hard for their scores (not to say people with lower scores didn\u2019t) and they show mastery in the certain subject because the tests are standardized. AOs do recognize this. He said it would be silly if they didn\u2019t. Yes it isn\u2019t the hallmark of the application nor are they required, but they have somewhat influence.",
