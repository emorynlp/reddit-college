      "text": "Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nLarger loans require a parent signature (go against parent credit, accrue interest during college, and repayment begins during college) and are usually *not* reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\n\r  \nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\r  \nIf the need-based estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
