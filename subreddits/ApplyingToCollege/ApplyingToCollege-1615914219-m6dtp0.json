  "text": "It\u2019s bigger than this.\n\nLife, I mean.\n\nIt\u2019s bigger than constantly refreshing your applicant portal because one of your shotgun schools said they would release decisions \u201clate afternoon\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s bigger than your heart dropping at seeing a classmate\u2019s acceptance post on Instagram after you just opened a rejection from that same school.\n\nIt\u2019s bigger than attempting to convince yourself to sleep at 4 A.M., eyes rimmed red over a deferral from your dream school.\n\nIt\u2019s bigger than your essays written about obscure things, bigger than thinking receiving a B in AP Physics 1 would ruin your chances at college, bigger than anxiously waiting for your recommenders to submit their part.\n\nIt\u2019s bigger than confetti on your screen, than accepting a spot on the waitlist, than \u201cWe regret to inform you...\u201d. \n\nSomeone from my school passed away yesterday. And as blunt as that is, that\u2019s exactly how it\u2019s meant to be taken. Sobering. I KNEW them. I saw them in the halls after school, bumped into them in the lunch line \u2014 hell, one of my best friends had a crush on them. I knew them. \n\nI cried to my mother after my University of Chicago waitlist a few days ago. I told her while she was making dinner. She was never one for comfort, but she found it in her that day to tell me that there lies more ahead of me than this singular school (that I didn\u2019t even really care about that much). So, I cried. Cried while she taught me how to cook in preparation for me leaving home soon.\n\nMy father is a kind man. He never let me forget that I would always have a place to call home, even once I left for college or moved out or had my own house. I grew up in a household where, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d was not commonly heard, but he said it a few months ago. I still carry his graduation tassel coin on my car keys. Rusted, coppery, and with his alma mater engraved on the edge. \n\nOccasionally, I see existential posts like this one scattered among this subreddit\u2019s more popular posts about yield protection, a 36 ACT versus 35, and manifesting acceptances. I was all of them. I AM all of them. \n\nWe are the next generation, soon to go onto university (or whatever post-secondary path you may choose). We will replace my mother who comforted her daughter after a T10 waitlist; we will replace my father who gifted me his graduation cap coin in my thirteenth year; we will replace the adults, the responsibilities, the loss, the deaths, the victories, the promotions. We ARE the future. No matter what universities accept you. No matter which reject you. \n\nIt\u2019s bigger than this. I tend to stay away from the clich\u00e9 phrase, \u201cin the grand scope of things\u201d, but it is necessary in certain circumstances. This one included. \n\nSo, all you can do is be the best you can be. \n\nAnd then be a little bit better, because none of us should settle for any less.",

There was nothing there that could have reconciled my feelings, just a void left where a person was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what question never got asked at that funeral? \"Well, what college was he going to go to?\" The truth is that nobody cares. Seriously. Nobody. There is not a soul in the world who will care about where you were \"supposed to go\" if you suddenly pass away. We were all too busy crying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to talk then just reach out OP. Stay safe y'all.",

I was always the type to sleep at 4-5 AM from late-night studying and I ruined my health in terms of physical, emotional, and mental. When I got rejected from MIT, my mom just told me that it's fine because there are other schools and to not worry because it's trivial. A few weeks ago someone in my family had to see a doctor because they were bleeding uncontrollably and I realized then how little where I went to college mattered when someone was in critical condition. Ten years from now, the source of my anxiety and stress won't even matter \"in the grand scope of things,\" and the time worrying is probably better spent with loved ones. \n\nThank you for this post, I appreciated it.

I was leaning towards potentially having a breakdown just to see if ib would work for me for a year but my mom luckily set me in my place. She said that I should prioritize my mental health and in my stress about what my class choices should be I completely disregarded that factor. I find it sad that high school doesn't even seem like high school and people dictate their every move by what looks good for college. I hope the mindset changes for younger generations because I've seen the effects on myself and my classmates and it's breaking us all.",
