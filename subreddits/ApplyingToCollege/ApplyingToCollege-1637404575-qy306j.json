  "text": "Hello everyone, \nI just went on my student portal for my ED school and in the checklist next to the \u201cnon-custodial parent waiver petition\u201d requirement, it said \u201cnot reviewed\u201d with a Red Cross next to it. They updated this information on the 19th. Does this mean it has not been approved? I was a bit thrown off by the little cross because all of my documents have been submitted and the website does not specify if my other documents in the checklist have been reviewed or not and have a tick next to them.",

      "text": "It looks the same on my portal; the cross appeared a week after I had submitted my application. \nI emailed the Student Financial Services Center at the college I applied to, and they told me that it doesn\u2019t mean anything and they will notify me when my waiver petition is approved or not approved. It could differ based on the college, but I would wait until the college explicitly notify you on the status of your waiver petition (probably by email).",
