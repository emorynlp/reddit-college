Due to the pandemic, I started it really late but I\u2019m working on it right now and it\u2019s a huge part of my extracurriculars. I\u2019m not sure if I should put this in the additional info section and describe my entire project or just put it in the activity description for Girl Scouts saying I\u2019m \u201ccurrently working on Gold Award\u201d without describing it since it takes up too many characters.",
