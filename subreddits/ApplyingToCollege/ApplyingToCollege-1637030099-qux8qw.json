  "text": "So I was putting in my SAT scores for UChicago. I indicated that I had a 750 maths section but there's another part which asks for the math score on a scale of 10-40. Whenever I place 37.5 it automatically gets rounded up to a 38. I submitted it like this, should I contact them? Anyone experiencing the same issue?",
