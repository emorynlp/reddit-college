Or do I have a few days to make sure my teachers get them in. \n\n Also, I sent my ACT scores to Umich on Wednesday but I\u2019m not sure how long it takes for the college to receive them. Is it okay if they come shortly after Nov. 1st?",

You can't control this part, try not to worry about it, watch your portal for making sure they are received.",
