  "text": "How do I address my interviewer in email after saying Dear blah blah blah. I don't know whether to use Ms or Mr and I can't find them on LinkedIn. Do I just use their first name? I don't think that's a good idea that sounds impolite. And I've already misgendered someone in email before so I absolutely do not want to risk doing it here.",
