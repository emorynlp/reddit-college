  "text": "Asking for advice/comments last-minute is pointless, as those you seek help from will tell you positive things to avoid making you feel bad about turning in a piece with known issues. If you want a real second opinion, ask with enough time left to make large changes if need be. Even just an outline is fine, because the most serious and difficult problems are usually thematic.",
