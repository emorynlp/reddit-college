  "text": "Currently, I'm an international 12th grader. I am still in the first quarter of the year, but the school seems to ignore some factors of College Application, such as no Projects or activities in any form yet, no AP Physics C or Calculus BC classes(I need them) - there are Calc AB and Chemistry though, and no Honours. It's all about GPA there. I even can't do alot of activites outside the school because of the regular but intensive coursework. What can I do? My profile now is SAT 1210 (First Trial) and 1400 (Planned). That's almost it.",
