  "text": "I go to the school DnD club afterschool, my dad (who's pretty open to my hobbies) usually drives me home.\n\nBut today my mother came to pick me up instead.  First thing she says as she pulls up: \"So I hear you're going to DnD club... How will you put that on your college apps?\"\n\nAnd then she goes on to tell me how much more my peers are doing and my study schedule for break next week.  I'm just done.",

A few weeks back, I had my first d&d session in over two years, which was a 5-hr one-shot session, and my mom got angry cuz \"I could've been working on college apps\" as if I haven't been obsessed with it for like two years and just want to take a break :/ anyway, you could definitely add D&D into your college apps! It takes a lot of dedication and work (especially as a DM) and that's what colleges want to see :) hoping it gets better with your mom though!",
