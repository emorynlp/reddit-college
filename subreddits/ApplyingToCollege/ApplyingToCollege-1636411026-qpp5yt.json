(u probably know this intuitively but i helped think abt my response prior to the interview as i wanted to fit in as much info as i could w/o rambling on)\n\n3) overprepare!!!! it may seem as though u didn\u2019t share enough once the interview is done, however, it\u2019s always better to have too much rather than too little and believe me u probably will have shared enough.\n\n4) have some questions prepared prior to the interview. some may arise while ur speaking, but this is probably one of ur only chances to ask questions to someone who went to the university so use it to ur advantage!!!\n\noverall, ur probably gonna be alright and i wouldn\u2019t stress too much abt it. if it doesn\u2019t go the way u want, j know that it\u2019s not gonna make or break ur application. as soon as i was done w the interview, i was worried that he cut the interview short bc i wasn\u2019t interesting enough, didn\u2019t have enough depth in my responses, etc. but through reflection i know i did the best i could and i was honest which is ultimately what matters. i may not be in university yet, but i believe in the idea that ur gonna end up where ur supposed to so i know that if i don\u2019t get into stanford or u don\u2019t get into harvard, u will get into another amazing school. best of luck on saturday i hope it goes wonderful and please update me i would love to hear how it went!!!",
