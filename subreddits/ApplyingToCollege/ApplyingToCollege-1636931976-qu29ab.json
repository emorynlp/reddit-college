It's way too expensive, but it doesn't have a campus, and it's a very large school in terms of population. And, having NY in it's name doesn't mean a thing. There is the New York Institute of Technology, which has NY in it's name, but it's pretty bad. I personally wouldn't apply to NYU... \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

I realized that comparing the amount of money I would save by going in-state would be insurmountable and would allow me to graduate early since in-state public accepted way more credits, saving both time and money. Granted I miss out on NYC, which has always been the dream, but in not-quite-post-COVID times no city is really feeling quite like itself, so it's a bit easier to stomach. I'll take NYC when I'm getting PAID to live there, not the other way around.\n\nCurrently entering my final semester of college in the Spring, and I do not regret my decision. Whatever your/their decision, just bloom where you're planted, and you won't either.",

Maybe you love being isolated from nature, entrapped in an urban prison block where the sun barely reaches the ground, and with no trivial means of escape.\n\nMaybe you love all that shit.
