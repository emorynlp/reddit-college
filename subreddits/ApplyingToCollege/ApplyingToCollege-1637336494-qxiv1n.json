And im quite scared about all of these news about discrimination to Asians, street fights and crimes against of minorities. Can you tell me those states/universities from which i should avoid?\nP.S. really sorry for my English if there is any mistakes, i'm going to improve it",

      "text": "You need to consider that \u201cstates\u201d in the US (with a few exceptions in the northeast) are fairly large geographically and, more often than not, vary extensively in terms of \u201csafety\u201d within each state. So it\u2019s hard to generalize about the safety of \u201cstates\u201d in general. You\u2019d need to look at specific cities. And even there, you\u2019d need to look at specific neighborhoods within those cities.\n\nAlso, there aren\u2019t really any specific states that would be more or less safe because you are international in general, or Asian specifically.\n\nYes, there are \u201cunsafe\u201d places in the US. But those places are almost certainly unsafe for ANYONE who finds themself there.",

      "text": "probably states with existing Asian communities like California, Massachusetts, Texas would be better. I'm also Asian and my city in Rhode Island has felt very safe with a higher international student population. Besides the UCs and private unis, UT Dallas has a very high international Asian student population if that's something that is important to you.",
