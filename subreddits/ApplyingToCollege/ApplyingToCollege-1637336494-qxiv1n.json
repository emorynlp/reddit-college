And im quite scared about all of these news about discrimination to Asians, street fights and crimes against of minorities. Can you tell me those states/universities from which i should avoid?\nP.S. really sorry for my English if there is any mistakes, i'm going to improve it",

      "text": "You need to consider that \u201cstates\u201d in the US (with a few exceptions in the northeast) are fairly large geographically and, more often than not, vary extensively in terms of \u201csafety\u201d within each state. So it\u2019s hard to generalize about the safety of \u201cstates\u201d in general. You\u2019d need to look at specific cities. And even there, you\u2019d need to look at specific neighborhoods within those cities.\n\nAlso, there aren\u2019t really any specific states that would be more or less safe because you are international in general, or Asian specifically.\n\nYes, there are \u201cunsafe\u201d places in the US. But those places are almost certainly unsafe for ANYONE who finds themself there.",

I'm also Asian and my city in Rhode Island has felt very safe with a higher international student population. Besides the UCs and private unis, UT Dallas has a very high international Asian student population if that's something that is important to you.",

      "text": "Hi! I'm a fellow Asian, personally I've found that most major cities in the US are pretty safe for minorities. If you go down south or to some rural regions people might be more conservative/ you're more likely to run into racists, but ethnic hate crimes are pretty uncommon everywhere. \n\nOne way to see whether a college is safe is to check their percentage of international/Asian students on their websites. A larger minority population generally means that the school will be safer, or at least have more protections into place.",

      "text": "Instead of looking by states, looking at specific colleges would be a better idea as how safety level varies drastically within every state. For example, while both Northwestern and UChicago are in Illinois, one is way safer than the other, same applies to Cornell and NYU. Personally I would suggest you avoid unis in big cities where more or less crime is an issue. A college town with <1h train ride away from a fairly large city would be ideal because you neither run into safety concerns that often nor put yourself in a solitary confinement by being in the middle of nowhere.",

      "text": "Look for suburbs of major cities. A lot of cities like NYC might have the impression of being very international friendly but I think maybe because of the sheer density and population, it can be overwhelming and potentially dangerous especially if you are unfamilar with these cities. IMO you should look the the nicer suburbs or outskirts of these cities. Schools like Princeton, Emory, Rutgers, Swathmore, Tufts, Boston College, Claremon McKenna Consortium, Villanova, Stanford are some I can think of. These areas have a lot of diversity in terms of families as here in NJ, lots of Chinese and Indian families have parents who commute to NYC for work. Rural schools are generally also pretty safe especially state flagship schools in college towns or competitive schools. As a Asian American, hate crimes are a big problem especially now but they are not extreme like the media pictures it. Otherwise, schools like NYU, Columbia, and UChicago would not be as popular as they are now among international students.",
