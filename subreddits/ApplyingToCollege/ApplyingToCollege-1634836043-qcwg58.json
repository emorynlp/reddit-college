  "text": "So I\u2019m a senior, writing my personal admissions essay as one does, and revising and editing, getting help from friends, going to teachers after hours and getting insight, etc. However, I keep wondering if I should shell out the money for a professional editing service to help give my essay that extra edge. The one I was mainly looking at was Wordvice, both their admissions and premium admissions options ($45 and $135 respectively). So my question is, should I spend the money on this editing service, for the potential edge it can give my essay, should I seek an admissions consultant to get more 1 on 1 help with the essay limited by budget, or should I continue to revise and edit with the help of friends and teachers. Any thoughts on the matter help and are highly appreciated.",
