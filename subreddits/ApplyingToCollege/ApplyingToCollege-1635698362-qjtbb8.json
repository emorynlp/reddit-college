  "title:": "i just peer edited some ex-incel's personal statement and it was... interesting",
  "text": "my english teacher assigned us each 3 people in our class's essays to edit and the first 2 were like pretty standard stuff. i get to the third one and i shit you not this man talks about how he used to be an ex-incel (specifically said incel in the essay so i don't feel bad about calling him that) with a masturbation addiction and how being partnered with a girl in science made him appreciate women more and see them as more than objects. wholesome ending i guess but the detail this man went to in the masturbation section of his essay was horrific. i kid you not at least half of the essay talked about him going home everyday and jerking off/degrading whatever girls gave him a weird look at school or whatever. he seemed like a pretty normal guy so i really didn't see this coming, but i was at a loss for words.\n\ni really wanted to tell him he should change his topic or at least not talk about being an incel and describing his jerk off sessions in depth, but we weren't supposed to critique the topic just like grammar and figurative language. i just pointed out the punctuation mistakes and left it i couldn't be bothered to deal with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: forgot to mention the essay did have a lot of spelling and grammatical errors so i don't think it's close to a finished product. i think it's safe to assume he isn't turning this in for early action applications but you never know.",

If society refuses to allow people to change, then they never will.\n\nEDIT: also gonna throw out some input on OP's post. The essay isn't a terrible idea, but the way it's been executed is terrible. I got into UIUC for Computer Engineering with an essay on a similar topic, but with key differences. I was a LOT less explicit (pro tip: no masturbating in your college essays), and definitely didn't go so far as to deeply describe some sort of internalized objectification of women. Even explicitly using the word incel is a bit much. My advice on that essay would be to maybe briefly mention that, but keep the focus more on how they went from being socially inept to an accomplished extrovert or whatever (more along the lines of my personal essay). Also focus more on the post-enlightenment, like maybe a 1:2 split proportionally.\n\nBut hey, maybe they'd appreciate the honesty if it truly does sound like they're pouring themselves out into the essay, but I don't know enough to make that judgement, I'd take the safer route personally.",

I'd rather him acknowledge that it was a thing than try to hide it, because he is writing something that is completely truthful to him. He is misguided into thinking that this sort of brutal honesty would do him favors, especially with how there are so many people out there insisting that colleges love to see honesty, or that he should write something true to himself. \n\nThis was his reality, whether people like it or not. \n\n>I didn't say he had a fetish. I said wither he had a fetish, or was lacking in empathy.\n\nAnd I am trying to stress that this is more of a clueless mistake than something lacking in empathy. I believe OP is exaggerating a bit on the type of writing shown (leading people to assume that he was writing, in a detailed narrative sense, the violent fantasies he had towards women). This sound more like him oversharing the fact that he had this type of misogynistic mindset, not him oversharing what he was jerking off to. I could be completely wrong though, but it's a much more grounded take than him purposefully trying to pull something. \n\nIf it makes any difference, I am also a woman who has dealt with my share of misogynistic men. And I also believe it is unfair, unproductive, and very toxic to think poorly and take away the opportunities of all men despite that trend. Is he genuine or not? Nobody here can say for sure, but it is cruel to assume that he isn't and ruin his chances of education just because he wanted to share his experiences and did not know how to execute them correctly. \n\nHe has a good idea but a horrendous way of going about that. I assure you if he worded this essay more eloquently, it would be a very strong and unique portrayal of his current character. There is no use in denying who he was, but a better way to help him improve. Assuming the worst in men and people who made poor choices as a kid only serves to prove to incels that there is no use in self-improvement.",
