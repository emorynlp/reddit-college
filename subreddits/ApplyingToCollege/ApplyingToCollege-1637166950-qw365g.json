  "text": "I applied RA to a local school in New York(St. Bonnies) a couple weeks ago and I got my response like 3 days later. A couple other big colleges I applied to RA around the same time and I have still yet to hear anything. Like it's been almost a month and I haven't gotten an email or text or anything. I was wondering how long it takes for bigger schools to get back to Rolling Admissions apps, the ones I'm talking about are Michigan State, Clemson, Coastal Carolina.",
