      "text": "I\u2019m of a completely different opinion. Send it. Colleges aren\u2019t dumb. They know racial score gaps exist. I\u2019m not going down the rabbit hole of opportunity gaps, bias, etc. Colleges know they exist. \n\nRegardless: a 1420 is the median at Barnard.\n\nFewer than 1% of SATs completed by Black test takers receive a 1400+ score. Black high school students are less likely to take the SAT as well. It is more difficult (in proportion to the racial composition at T30ish universities and LACs) to find a 1400+ Black applicant than it is to find a 1520+ white or Asian applicant. Colleges are trying to find a representative cross section of applicants (as they should). \n\nThere may be some colleges on your list that are more \u201crace blind\u201d by the numbers. But there are also colleges that will be more \u201crace aware\u201d by the numbers. Statistically speaking, this is actually to your advantage. You\u2019ll be more likely to secure multiple offers for admission this way. Illustration: \n\nScenario A: 5 schools @ 0% chance, 5@40% chance\n\nScenario B: 10 schools @ 20% chance\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to have at least 1 or 2 admissions  in scenario A.",
