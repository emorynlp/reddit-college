      "text": "Not really.  Partly because the various components of a student's application aren't combined in a strictly linear fashion, e.g. a \\* SAT + b \\* GPA \\* c \\* Essays + d \\* LoRs + e \\* ECs, etc.\n\nSome SAT scores pretty much disqualify you from certain schools.  A fairly wide range of scores, for extremely selective schools.  While there are some essays that are probably disqualifying, it's much harder to write an essay that gets you auto-rejected.\n\nLikewise, at less selective schools, an extremely high SAT score can (almost) guarantee you admission.  There is no essay that's likely to guarantee you admission.",

              "text": "For top schools, historically, your grades/rigor/scores put you \"in the conversation\" and then the other aspects of your application are what determines whether you're accepted.  Now that test optional is a thing, you can get yourself \"in the conversation\" based on grades/rigor alone.  However, without scores submitted, the grades/rigor threshold is somewhat higher.\n\nIf your grades/rigor aren't superlative and you're looking at the next lower set of schools, then a SAT score that is much higher than a school's median probably increases your odds more than \"great essays\".\n\nLikewise, a very high SAT score has the potential to translate into hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tuition savings, whereas the same can't be said for essays.",
