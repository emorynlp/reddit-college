  "title:": "College Admissions is getting real real now. Here\u2019s your Mid-October Checklist and Reminders.",
  "text": "Happy Mid-October Seniors (and your parents if you\u2019re reading!),\n\nThis is just to check in with a checklist to make sure you're keeping up.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_1.  Standardized Test Scores:** If you\u2019re sending your test scores, be sure to check on the college\u2019s websites and see if they can be self-reported or if they need to be officially submitted from College Board or ACT.  If they need to be officially submitted, do that now for early applications.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_2.  Interviews:** Be sure to check the college websites and see if you need to apply by a certain date for interviews or if you need to sign up for an interview separately from just submitting your application. Check spam folders. Also, make sure you have your voicemail set up. Often your interviewer will try to leave a message. [Here\u2019s my interview post from last year -- I\u2019ll be updating it in November, but this will get you started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jqi4n7/your_step_by_step_guide_to_online_interviews_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) TIP: Make sure you write a thank you note that afternoon or evening and mention something specific the interviewer discussed.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_3. Update School Counselor/Naviance or whatever admissions platform your school uses:** Check in with your school counselor and update them on the status of your applications. Keep Naviance (or your school platform) updated when you\u2019ve submitted if your school uses Naviance. Stop by and say hello!\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_4. Letters of Recommendation:** Check in with your letter writers and let them know if you\u2019ll be applying early for any of your colleges. Give a gentle reminder about deadlines if you see that they might be behind. Be sure to write thank-you letters later in the fall. [Here\u2019s my Letters of Recommendation Post in case you still need to find out more about LORs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_5. Engagement with Colleges:** Colleges are making virtual sessions and tours more available now than ever before. Be sure to sign up and attend at least one for every school you\u2019re applying to -- especially before interviews and writing your Why College essays. Read the information they\u2019re sending you in emails. If they have a Why College Essay, mention something you learned in the tour/info session and in an email. Other ways to engage and demonstrate interest:\n\n* **\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_EMAIL YOUR ADMISSIONS OFFICERS:** If you haven't yet reached out to the admissions officer for your area from your school, I suggest you do so. Don't be afraid of introducing yourself and asking any questions you might have.\n* **\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_VIRTUAL TOURS:** Another reminder to go on a college tour and info session hosted by the college for every college you\u2019re applying to. Be sure to sign up with your college email. If you\u2019re applying to Plan 2 at UT Austin or other honors programs (especially at UT Austin), be sure to go on those tours too. Mention something specific from the tour in your supplemental essays.\n* **\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_REQUEST INFO:** If you haven\u2019t yet, request info from every college you\u2019re applying to -- also request info from honors programs and specific majors. Use your college email\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n* **\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_FOLLOW COLLEGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA:** Use an acceptable account, preferably with your name if possible (no red cups, no alcohol, no smoking, no racist or misogynistic posts -- be smart) and follow your colleges\u2019 admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter. They put out important information that can be helpful with your application.\n* **\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_CHECK OUT EPIC:**[ **You can go here and connect with admissions officers**](https://initialview.com/epic) by leaving them a short message and you can hear what they have to say.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_6. College Portals:** Make an account on the portal once you\u2019ve submitted your application and received information back from them. Check to make sure your materials have been received. Make a note of this on your big application spreadsheet.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_7. Spam Email Folder:** If you've already started applying to colleges --  or even if you haven't, get in the habit of checking your spam folders regularly. And, make sure that you\u2019ve added any of the email addresses they use to your \u201cnot spam\u201d list. Students often miss important messages from colleges in those folders. Parents, try to help out with this. If you're not on your child's email that they're using for admissions, be sure to remind them to check regularly. Often, they'll send info about specific dates and deadlines that aren't published on Common APP.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_8. Financial Aid:** This is for you too, Parents: If you\u2019re applying for financial aid, both FAFSA and CSS profiles are open. Gather your materials and make accounts. [Here\u2019s a link to a post with all my financial aid information and resources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q455zl/way_too_much_information_and_lots_of_resources/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_9. Essays:** Get organized with your supplemental essays and get going with the personal essay if you haven\u2019t finished it yet. Reach out if you need suggestions to get motivated or you feel lost. For schools that have \u201cwhy college\u201d or \u201cwhy major\u201d essays, be sure you are doing your research (professors \u2014 maybe even reach out to one, programs, classes, clubs, read the school newspaper, school missions statement, traditions, etc... [Here\u2019s a link to my Supplementary Essays Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pv8w4u/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [And here\u2019s my Personal Essay Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ppetbb/hi_seniors_you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_10. Big To-Do List:** Be sure to look through your Big To-Do List, check off, or highlight any tasks you\u2019ve completed. [Here\u2019s a link to one you can use.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m3V2-BK-9sQc-QZPpT_eQNijZ9hbHPcM5MDuUD77nYs/edit)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_11. Common App, Coalition App, Apply Texas, MIT, and other App Platforms you may need:**  Start filling out the basic information if you haven\u2019t yet. For Apply Texas, you only need to fill out the basic info once for your first school, then when you\u2019ve completed that application, you copy it to start your second school to answer the school-specific responses (similar to Coalition and Common apps).\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_12. Activities and Resumes:** It\u2019s time to start getting organized with filling out your Activities sections. Also, check to see where you\u2019ll need to send a resume. [Here\u2019s a link to my How to Fill out the Activities Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pym1dk/what_do_zombies_have_to_do_with_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 13. Senior Year Course List:**  Make sure your senior year course list has all the courses you need for the colleges you\u2019re applying to. Most highly selective colleges like to see: 4 years of English, 4 years of Science (including Bio, Chem, and Physics), 4 years of History or Social Science, 4 years of Math (with Calculus), and 4 years of Foreign Language. If you don\u2019t have these, check the recommended course lists for the colleges you\u2019re applying to. TIP: If you need a course, you could possibly do a one-semester next spring either at your school or at Community College, but you\u2019ll need to be signed up for it to list it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_**\\_14. College List:** If you haven\u2019t completed your college list yet, [here\u2019s a link to my How to Create a College List post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p31sle/seniors_if_youre_feeling_lost_about_your_list_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [here\u2019s a link to My Lists of College Lists post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p871lc/lots_and_lots_of_college_lists_for_you_to_check/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAnd last, but not least...\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_15. Breathe:** Remind yourself to stop now and then, and find stillness and just take a breath. These are crazy times in our world, made even crazier as you apply to college, but it\u2019s all temporary. In less than a year, you\u2019ll be in college and moving forward into the next phase of your life. Take walks. Listen to music. Have dance parties. Keep your balance even as you push through these next couple of weeks.\n\nGood luck! You got this!\n\nxoxoxox \u00a0\ud83d\udc96 \ud83d\ude0a AdmissionsMom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThere is no tl;dr here, but I am offering a couple of Zoom sessions next weekend. See below for info if you're interested. If you'd like to join either session, email me at [admissionsmoma2c@gmail.com](mailto:admissionsmoma2c@gmail.com), so I can send you the link.\n\n**Saturday, October 23, Noon - 1PM Mountain Time: Supplementary Essay Workshop.** We'll review some of my favorite methods for writing these important essays and I'll do some Q and As about supplements. Bring your supplements and work on them, or come empty handed and get started!\n\n**Sunday, October 24, 11AM - Noon Mountain Time: Essay Editing Workshop.** Come finalize your essays. We'll work together on word count and tightening up your essay, so it's ready to go! I'll also have some Q and A time. \n\nI will be doing another Personal Essay Workshop on November 13 at Noon Mountain time, for those of you who are just getting started there -- or deciding to start over.

      "text": ">FOLLOW COLLEGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nI know this is hard to believe, but increasingly students (boys in particular) in our high school are avoiding social media (sans semi-anonymous things like Twitch).  They're being advised that it's not worth putting out a public profile so early in life (and many of them don't care to do so anyway).  I wouldn't be surprised to see this trend gain more and more traction in the years to come (see news on Facebook/Instagram).\n\nSo would you recommend just creating a dummy account, in order to follow school news (vs. trying to create some sort of \"presence\" just for the sake of presence).",

This can be important in two ways \u2014 knowing what\u2019s happening as far as admissions \u2014 and knowing how the school handles current affairs and issues.  Both can be nice ways to understand more about the culture of the school. \n\nI think a dummy account is fine \u2014 as long as it\u2019s appropriate.",

One way I hope to help with our mental health crisis is to educate them about the importance of asking questions when you can\u2019t find the answers. And to be honest, many college websites are confusing.  I spend all day exploring them and looking for various pieces of information and often get frustrated and overwhelmed. I can only imagine how a kid who\u2019s unfamiliar with college admissions makes their way through. \n\nThanks for your presence here. It means a lot to the community.",
