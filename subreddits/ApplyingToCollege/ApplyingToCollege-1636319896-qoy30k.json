  "text": "If I apply to a college in rolling admissions and get accepted and they offer me an amount of merit scholarship, can that amount change if I take the SAT again in December and score higher (assuming they base scholarships on sat score)? Like is the offer of the scholarship final when it comes to rolling admissions or can they increase it if my score gets higher after they already accepted me?",
