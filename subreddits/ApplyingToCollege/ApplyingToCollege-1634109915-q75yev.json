  "text": "So I noticed that if I choose anything related to CS (eg. CS+X or CE) as my first choice major then I don't have any of them as my second choice major. Closest to CS is Systems Engineering which I'm not keen on pursuing, as I was looking more into AI. If I do choose, let's say Aerospace Eng. as my second choice major (because that would mostly be my second choice major, I find it pretty cool), then will it water down my interest in CS? \n\nMy profile is pretty CS+Math directed since that's what I'm applying to every college with, so nothing really related to Physics except one award in the Awards&Honors Section, but UIUC turned out to be an exception. CS is competitive, I get it, but should I put Aerospace Eng. as second choice major to increase (sort of?) my chances of getting accepted, or keep the second choice major empty and focus entirely on my main major?",

      "text": "Systems Engineering is close to operations research -- which is a lot of the mathematical machinery that underlies AI and ML. (Hell, much of ML is just rebranded/stolen OR and stats methodology.) While ISyE at UIUC is not one of their top departments, I would maybe give the coursework a look since it might be closer to CS+Math than you think.\n\nAs for Aero... just realize that you'll need to be a citizen (or maybe Canadian) to get jobs and those are less plentiful since they are mostly at the big defense firms.",
