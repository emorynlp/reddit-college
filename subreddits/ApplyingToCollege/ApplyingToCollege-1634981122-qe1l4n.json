  "text": "Hi yall! \n\nI accepted my offer from the University of Utah, and received my I-20 document. However, I have not received a copy of my admission letter yet. \n\nI was wondering if the U.S visa office will ask me specifically for the admission letter or would the I-20 be sufficient for issuing the visa? I have done my research, and it seems that the I-20 by itself is used as a way to illustrate the admission offer, university information, intended major, and etc.. so it\u2019s reasonable to say the I-20 doc would be enough.. Correct?\n\nPlease if anyone can confirm this or speak from their experience that\u2019d be great!\n\nThanks",
