  "text": "MITES/MOSTEC LOR\n\nI am a junior applying to mites and mostec. The application asked if I wanted to apply to mites or mostec of both, so I checked the \u201cboth\u201d box. I would definitely prefer mites because I don\u2019t want to do online school, but I\u2019m sure both are pretty good for enrichment and as a good EC. I am working on sending my recommenders a brag sheet to aid in writing my letters of recommendation. **What does MITES/MOSTEC look for in application/recommendation?** I want to give them a guide on how to describe me.",

      "text": "MITES \u201819 here. They\u2019re not looking for experts in engineering, but rather kids with a potential for success in those fields that haven\u2019t been afforded the opportunity to explore or learn more about it. So, I think your recommenders should emphasize your character, your skills in foundation subjects like math and physics, and demonstrated passion for engineering/science. I was actually originally waitlisted because i didn\u2019t submit all of my recommendation letters but I emailed them apologizing and stressing that my mistake was not representative of my discipline and work ethic. They said it was too late to submit anything and that same day they gave me an acceptance. They want kids that have strong foundation skills like good work ethic because the mites workload is very intense. You have basically the equivalent of an MIT freshman year courseload so they want kids that are prepared to be challenged but won\u2019t be crushed. Also, back in 2019, MITES and MOSTEC both built lists of college acceptances for all the students (this was a student led endeavor, the programs don\u2019t ask you to tell them anything about college after you complete it) and both lists were on par with each other in terms of HYPSM acceptances and other top schools.",
