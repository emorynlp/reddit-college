  "text": "I think I'm just worrying over early apps but it just crossed my mind that the Yale AO podcast warned against using potty humor and talking about bodily functions.\n\nI wrote a supplement about how the direction of the swirls of toilets change based on the hemisphere they're situated in and connected it with the act of observation. Well, I didn't go 'haha, washroom' but I'm kind of worried now that this would be seen as kind of dumb and immature. I suppose I did submit it so there's not much I can do...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYikes 0\\_0",
