  "text": "I think I'm just worrying over early apps but it just crossed my mind that the Yale AO podcast warned against using potty humor and talking about bodily functions.\n\nI wrote a supplement about how the direction of the swirls of toilets change based on the hemisphere they're situated in and connected it with the act of observation. Well, I didn't go 'haha, washroom' but I'm kind of worried now that this would be seen as kind of dumb and immature. I suppose I did submit it so there's not much I can do...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYikes 0\\_0",

Yes, I've actually stared at my share of flushing toilets, looking for this, but this was well before the time of Google -or even the internet- so I just thought I mis-remembered.  So it's because the Coriolis effect is too weak to be seen in a household toilet or sink.  OP, I'm with you, even though we are wrong - you just picked the wrong vessel - next time, write about hurricanes.\n\n(From Scientific American:  \u201cThe Coriolis force accounts for why cyclones are counterclockwise-rotating storms in the Northern Hemisphere, but rotate clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The circulation directions result from interactions between moving masses of air and air masses moving with the rotating earth. The effects of the rotation of the earth are, of course, much more pronounced when the circulation covers a larger area than would occur inside your bathtub.\u201d\r\r)",
