  "text": "So I haven't taken the SAT or ACT but I'm fairly confident based on practice tests. I didn't register for the December one and the next SAT is in March.  I'd have to travel to another city for either March SAT or any ACT. I could take the ACT in December or Feb. I just haven't done a ton of studying for ACT. \n\nShould I take it and report scores then or does it not matter to admissions by that time anyway since they'll have decided\uff1f\n\nP.s. if anyone knows where I can check how many SATs have been cancelled in a region, please let me know. Thank you!",
