  "text": "Hello. I just want to preface this by saying I am not undocumented, but I have very close friends who are and I've had many conversations with them about their experiences in the college application process. I even wrote an essay on it once. In addition, I am a sophomore in the engineering program.\n\nI promise this isn't promotion, but I would strongly recommend Fairfield University. It is a Jesuit university in Connecticut. I am also not religious, but it has not impacted me negatively on campus. My experience so far has been nothing short of excellent. Most of my undocumented friends are here on ON A FULL RIDE. One of them had a 3.5 GPA, no SAT/ACT test scores (because of the pandemic). However, she did have a good amount of extra curriculars and leadership positions. Her 3.5 GPA was only due to the fact that she lived in another country for most of her life, so her grades didn't transfer properly. However, when she got here in her junior year, she was a straight A student. \n\nI am a person of color, who's also gay and so far, I've had no negative experiences. The PWI nature of the campus can be shocking sometimes, but the community is so welcoming. \n\nFAIRFIELD IS TEST OPTIONAL, VERY CONNECTED, AND LOOKS OUT FOR STUDENTS OF ALL KINDS. There are no supplemental essays and there is about a 60% acceptance rate. In addition, there are about 4000+ undergrad students. This incoming freshman class had about 1300 kids.\n\nAgain, this isn't promotion. I just wanted to give you guys another option, because I really do understand how tough it can be. If you want to talk to me more about Fairfield, just private message me. I won't ask for any private information.\n\n\nAND FOR PEOPLE ON HERE WHO HAVE UNDOCUMENTED FRIENDS, PLEASE SHOW THEM THIS. It could change their lives. \u2764\n\nLastly, I just want to say DON'T LOSE HOPE. YOU CAN GO TO UNIVERSITY. I know it might be tough to think about, but you've worked so hard and if there's a will, there's a way. All I ask is that you look into it.",
