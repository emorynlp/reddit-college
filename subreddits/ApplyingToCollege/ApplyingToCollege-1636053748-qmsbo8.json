  "text": "Hello everyone, today I received a text message from Villanova University (which I applied EA to), saying that my SAT score is missing from my application. However, I got confused because they are test optional and I did not want my score to be considered. \n\nSo when I checked my application on Common App and I accidentally selected that I want my scores to be considered. \n\nWhat should I do???",
