  "title:": "What's my visa number? I genuinely don't know.",
  "text": "I'm an international high school student who came to US under a j-2 dependent visa. Eventually that j-2 turned into h-4 during my stay, and I haven't left the country since.\n\nAnd that's exactly where the problem is. If I haven't left US, then I don't know what my visa number is, as well as the date my visa gets issued to me, because you only get them when you exit the country. \n\nObviously I can't put down my j-2 info because that's not my current visa so I'd be lying. So I crammed in a few words into the visa number column explaining my change of visa status for now. As for the date issued, I just put down the date which my h-4 took effect. I plan to email college as I submit my application if I can't find better alternatives to this. \n\nI'm having a big headache rn and Idk what else to do. I'm going to sleep, but any help would be nice.",
