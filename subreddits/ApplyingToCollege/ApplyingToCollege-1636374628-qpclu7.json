  "text": "Long Story short \nI was a problematic child in middle school\n(couldn\u2019t shut up, impulsive). I was diagnosed at the age of 12. I began going to therapist once each week a year before I was diagnosed. I still do. I do not take any medications, but it takes me forever to finish my assignments and remember to turn them in, which kind of destroyed my relationship with teachers (I guess next year rec letter would be a problem\ud83d\ude05) \n\nObviously I have gone a long way that I don\u2019t hurt anyone or myself or shout in the middle of class. I have not been disciplined administratively, so there is nothing on my high school record. Yet it is still making my life very hard. Should I bring it up or should I just keep it a secret?",
