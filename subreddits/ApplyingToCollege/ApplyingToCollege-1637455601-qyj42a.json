      "text": "I think you're the one that can be picking out colleges, you can be sure that many will accept you. UCs are test blind, so you have very strong (even, dare I say, UCSD is a target) chances. Outside of that, consider applying to colleges that offer generous financial aid and can pay for travel (which can cost a lot for someone living outside the contiguous states). Remember also that your essays and recs make a difference, and if you can excel in these areas, then you are set for a high chance of acceptance at all but two colleges in the entire US. Even though you don\u2019t care about location, I will suggest some colleges with at least mildly similar climate, but feel free to look beyond my list.\n\nTo suggest specific colleges: \nReach: Stanford, Yale (you mentioned taking their courses so it might just give you the edge lol), Harvard, UCLA, UCB, Duke (all of these are self explanatory, T10 Psych, prestige, environment, climate for the most part)\nTarget: UCSD (strong psych + good climate + large Spanish and Korean-speaking communities) UT Austin (also decent Psych program + good climate) NYU (T10 Psych but very expensive and campus is nonexistent)\n\nSafety: UW Madison, ASU, MSU, basically any non T50 that you like.",
