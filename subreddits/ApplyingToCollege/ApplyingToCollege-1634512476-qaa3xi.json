  "text": "I want to figure out my GPA, but my school transcript does not give weighted GPA and also takes into account grades from middle school. I've looked for GPA calculators but they all include credits and some have the A+ 4.3, A 4.0, and A- 3.7, which my school doesn't do. Does anyone know how or a good website to calculate my GPA?",
