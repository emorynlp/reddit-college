  "text": "Hello fellow Vandy applicants, how long did it take for the Vanderbilt portal to get sent to you? I decided to apply like just now, so will I have enough time to get the portal before the Dec 1 merit scholarship deadline? Also, is the Dec 1st deadline like Dec 1st at 11:59 pm or Nov. 30th at 11:59 pm? Thank you so much for your help!",
