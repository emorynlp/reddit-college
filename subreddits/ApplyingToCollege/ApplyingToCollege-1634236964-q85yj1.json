  "text": "I'm an international student studying in the UAE. I'm still in my junior year and I plan to study in the United States.\n\nI've discovered some new information that raised a lot more questions:\n\nIf I have to apply during my senior year, how will I send my senior year grades if I haven't even finished yet? How will I finish my application before getting my diploma? AP exams for my senior year start at May (obviously), and I'll have to apply beforehand. How am I supposed to send them those grades? \n\nI'm panicking.",
