  "text": "I\u2019ve been offered a scholarship for a rather neat school. Although, I\u2019m not sure if I actually want to go or if I\u2019m only interested in the scholarship/prestige of the institution. I don\u2019t think I would have known about it if not for the scholarship but after some research I think I\u2019d like it there(even if it\u2019s in a place in the US I hadn\u2019t considered living before). Additionally, a portion of my family isn\u2019t being supportive about this because they think I can attend a better schools(schools I\u2019m only applying to because they told me to). I\u2019m afraid of both of accepting the scholarship and regretting it and not accepting and regretting it. What are your thoughts?",
