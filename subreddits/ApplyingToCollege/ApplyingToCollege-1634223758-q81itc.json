  "text": "I mean it's almost a convention to make your ECs sound a bit higher in significance and impact than is the reality right? 85% resumes, according to a statistic, have something that isn't the accurate representation of reality. What's the firm line between exaggerating and straight up lying? Would increasing involvement by a single year be noticeable? Educate me please .\\_.",

      "text": "Exaggeration is making subjective things sound slightly better (can be done by using more flowery wording or synonyms that mean the same thing, although it shouldn\u2019t change the facts). Lying is changing objective parts of your ECs, as those are based in fact and aren\u2019t debatable. Doing a year of an EC is an objective thing, so changing it would be a lie.\n\nSubjective example: \nOkay: \u201cMy friends and I raised $500.\u201d\nAlso okay: \u201cI collaborated with a group of people to fundraise $500\u201d. \nThe second one sounds a lot better, but the facts are the exact same. \n\nObjective example:\nOkay: \u201cI ran track for 3 years.\u201d\nNot okay: \u201cI ran track for 4 years.\u201d (when it was actually 3)",
