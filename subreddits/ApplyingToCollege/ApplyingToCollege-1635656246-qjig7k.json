  "text": "One of my supplements says the essay should be around 250 words. However, the Common App text box allows 350 words. \n\nMy essay is 285, and from my understanding the 'around' is meant to give some leeway, though I might be wrong. Is my assumption correct and is my word count stretching it?",
