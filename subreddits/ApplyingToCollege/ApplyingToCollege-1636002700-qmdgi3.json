  "text": "i need help / advice (?) i'm about to graduate high school and i don't know what to do after that, my gpa is too low \u2026 sadly it's a 2.2 so it's making me stress out since i know i wont go to a good college but community college is a option but i also have no clue what career path i want to do like at all. so that is holding me back a lot, that's why i wanted to take a gap year but is it even worth it, i really need help since it's been stressing me out a ton. should i apply to a community college with that low of a gpa while still not knowing what to do or take a gap year?",

Once you have a college degree, literally no one ever asks about your high school GPA.  If you can get better grades in college, you can totally come back from this.",
