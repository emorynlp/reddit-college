      "text": "It only defines your life as much as you choose to let it define your life. Some people go to an Ivy for four years and make it their entire personality for the next four decades of their life. Some people don\u2019t get into an Ivy and make that a domineering insecurity over the rest of their lives. Some people recognize that either option of choosing to let four years of an early period of your life define everything that comes afterward is a dumb mindset to have. \n\nIs there an Ivy you would want to attend, even if it wasn\u2019t an Ivy? Then go ahead and apply RD since deadlines are in January. But if you only feel regretful because of external expectations, there\u2019s no need to be worried.",

      "text": "No you shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had a somewhat similar dilema I guess but just not your standards. I\u2019m a high level student with a number of AP\u2019s, 4.4 weighted GPA and 1420 SAT score and my most competitive school I applied to was Illinois (I\u2019m in state), and I\u2019m going to go to Minnesota which many would probably view it is as inferior to Illinois. I was asked by my many friends as to why I didn\u2019t apply too more \u2018Reaches\u2019 like Michigan or Northwestern or any other private college really and for me it was because of cost and just because I didn\u2019t wanna go there. If you are happy with the schools you applied too because you seriously think you will enjoy your life at that university, then it\u2019s not concerning. I think people that focus on Ivies and all this prestige don\u2019t even really consider factors like social life in the college, Ex. Minnesota which is downtown in a major Metropolitan area versus Dartmouth, a small school located in New Hampshire (Dartmouth is a fantastic school I\u2019m just relaying about social environment and things too do).",

If you believe in yourself and your abilities, you will do great things. The path might be a bit harder, but have faith in yourself and know that you can control where you go and what you do!",

      "text": "No reason to be worried or feel pressured. Not everyone with Ivy stats has to apply to Ivies. As an example, my daughter with stats similar to yours decided early on she didn't want a stressful and competitive environment and realized she really liked LACs. She applied to a few LACs ranging from T15 to T60-ish + our state flagship, got into all of them with nice merit, didn't have to deal with rejections and is thriving at a T30 LAC. She's challenged academically and is surrounded by interesting, motivated people but also has time for socializing with her friends and several extracurriculars. Don't second guess your initial decision--there was a reason why you decided not to apply to Ivies, right? Good luck!",

      "text": "This sub does not represent the student body of America or even the smartest people in America. It represents those who need to work to be accepted to a college because they don't want to go to schools with large acceptance rates.\n\nI go to a state school that legally allows anyone in as long as they pass an equation (RAI from Iowa, about C students & above). If you don't pass that, you just have to write an essay of intent. So basically anyone who takes the prereqs in high school gets in. \n\nIn my specific case, my program is top in the nation, competing with Cornell (Iowa State agricultural engineering). We also have the largest engineering career fair. Along with a bunch of kick ass federal laboratories & partnerships with companies. Most of the smartest & most important business & academic people I've come across graduated from a non-t20. They went to a \"normal\" school.\n\nAll the smart kids from my high school chose to get an awesome education for cheap with merit scholarships than t20. Sure, the average student at my school isn't going to revolutionize the world. That doesn't matter. The top students will. You don't graduate with the average skills from your university, you graduate with your skills.. What you do in college is 100x more important than which one you go to. That's what will define you more. If you want to do cool shit, then do it. There most likely exists opportunities for you, especially at research universities. \n\nI did well in high school. I was awarded so many merit scholarships, it was about 1.5 times my cost of attendance just those alone, so the financial aid office cut me down until I was just above CoA. People asked me why I didn't apply to Ivies either. I told them the truth. Too far away, too expensive, too stressful, & there is nothing I see of significantly more value than what I can get at my land grant.",

      "text": "No. A prestigious school might help you with networking or getting your foot in the door somewhere, but you can easily do that outside of college too. \n\nMy spouse and I both went to a decent but non-US school, and we work in the Silicon Valley tech industry now. We're doing fine with our provincial degrees.\n\nYou could still apply RD, BTW. But don't stress over it. If you are going to college anywhere, you're in a pretty unique group of only 10% of Americans. That's fairly prestigious just on its own.",
