  "text": "I asked a couple of my teachers to submit recommendations for me, which they already did. \n\nI added another school and wanted to ask them to submit it for that school. I went and \u201cassigned\u201d it to the teacher I wanted and it said \u201csubmitted\u201d immediately. As in right away (so they didn\u2019t have to submit) \n\nDoes assigning a teacher to a new school - who has previously submitted a recommendation for another school - automatically send the recommendation they\u2019ve written? \n\nWas going to send him an email asking him to upload but common app says \u201csubmitted\u201d. Wanted to confirm this is designed and working as expected? \n\nThanks!",
