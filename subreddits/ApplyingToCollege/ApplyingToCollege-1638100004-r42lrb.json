  "title:": "CSS Profile Expected amount received from parents questions",
  "text": "Hi, I submitted my CSS Profile as an international student for a need-blind school. For the section where they ask:\n\n\"How much does <OP> expect to receive from the following sources to pay for educational expenses for the 2022-23 academic year\", under \"Their parents\", I indicated 0.\n\nDue to several financial constraints that I had discussed in the \"Special Circumstances\" section, my parents forecast that their contributions for my education will be 0. However, I did not explicitly mention that the value 0 was their forecast (thinking it would be inferred from the special circumstances).\n\nAfter running through my family income information through a net price calculator, I realize that the minimum parent contribution according to that school is roughly USD1630.\n\nWould my initial value of 0 negatively affect my application?\n\nDo I need to request for a correction for my CSS Profile or email the admissions team to explicitly mention that it is kept at 0 due to our financial situation?\n\nThanks!",
