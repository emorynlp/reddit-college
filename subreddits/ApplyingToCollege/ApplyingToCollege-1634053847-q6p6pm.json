  "text": "i\u2019m currently a college freshman at a top 20. college admissions were stressful, especially being surrounded by so many people who feel more qualified than you. \n\n once you get to school, it becomes so much worse. suddenly, every one around you has had incredible internships and has done research and is currently curing cancer. the imposter syndrome is real. \n\n please keep in mind while you\u2019re applying that it doesn\u2019t end once you get accepted and pay your enrollment deposit. don\u2019t sign up for something you aren\u2019t sure if you can handle. \n\nwishing you all the best of luck <3",

      "text": "I don't mean this as an invalidation of OP's experience, but as someone who also went to a T20, this is partly a mentality issue. When you go to a T20 or even T40, you will be surrounded by very high achieving people. I had a lot of friends, including my ex, who had a similar experience. They were top of their class in high school and were suddenly middle of the road students at an Ivy. Much of their self-definition had been founded on success, and once that was gone, they felt lost. No matter how hard they tried at schoolwork, they still got median and it tore them up because enjoying the material and being a decent student at a top-tier school wasn't enough. Remember that even if you're a small fish amongst big fish in a small pond, that small pond is some of the most rarified water around.\n\nWhat OP also touches on tangentially is the importance of finding things you love. I hope you're in college and in a particular major or club for the love of the game. If you look at your peers as points of comparison or people to be competed against, college will turn into another crappy rat race. And even if you're near the top of the heap, you're still going to look at the people above you and wish you were them. I was a pre-med majoring in engineering, and both fields had plenty of people who were constantly looking at medians while missing the sheer coolness of the opportunities around them. Work hard and do things that make you happy and enrich you as a person. College will be a blast",

I know it can feel inevitable, especially if you have parents or other people in your life constantly making comparisons between you and the people around you. But in the end, you can choose how you feel about it. And that doesn't have to be a negative feeling. Be happy for the success of others. Learn from it when you want to. Ignore it when it doesn't impact you. You'll have an easier life.",
