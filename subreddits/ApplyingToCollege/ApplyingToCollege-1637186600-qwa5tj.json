      "text": "I think the better question is how much your parents are willing to spend.  The sad reality is that college is expensive and often the fin aid just isn't enough.  If your parents are willing to spend $25k/quarter, then so be it.  If they can't and you can't qualify for a good aid package, then you have to work within those parameters.  IF they have the $$ and want to spend it on you, then don't give yourself headaches by thinking about it, just do the best you can to have a (hopefully financially) successful career and make them proud.  \n\nAs a parent who is facing possibly $75k x 3 next year, I'm pretty sure that I won't be getting that Tesla for another 4 years, but grateful that we are able to provide for them.  And they know that they'll be working hard to become self-supporting in the future.",

      "text": "For context, my total family income is $160,000 a year.\n\nMy parents said they're willing to pay $40,000 a year (roughly the cost of attending William & Mary or UVA as an in-state student), partially funded by grandma passing away a few years ago. She had college funds set away for all of her grandkids, and I am really thankful that she did that for us. :)\n\nI am personally willing to pay up to $15,000 more a year (so $55,000 total) for a school like UPenn or Cornell. *(Partially through my savings from working for 4 years, and the rest would be a \"family loan\" through my parents, and I'd have to pay them back later.)*\n\nI am willing to pay up to $10,000 more a year for a school like Boston University, Northeastern, or Syracuse. I love those schools, but they're just not worth >$10k more a year if my in-state schools include UVA and W&M. *(I have a lot saved up from working non-stop over the past 4 summers at a landscaping company, so that would cover some of it. My parents would probably cover the rest if it's only a bit over their $40k a year limit.)*\n\nAnd 30-40% of the schools I applied to are safety schools for this exact reason: merit scholarships. If I can have a quality education at a school I really love (campus, location, vibe, etc), I'm totally fine with sacrificing prestige a bit; I don't care about prestige nearly as much as I do my educational experience.",

              "text": "Want to preface with the fact that I am a low income student so right off the bat i was getting very good aid from private universities (still not enough though because they usually expect a student contribution no matter what which is around 3k per semester, namely princeton and stanford, couple others). As for OOS public universities like Gtech and Umich, they did not have very good aid, but I got merit scholarships that covered around 100k total at each school that would make it free. It\u2019s easier to get full rides to instate schools; i got presidential scholarships to the 3 in state schools i applied to. As for the private universities with that small cost to cover, I got the gates scholarship to cover any last-dollar costs. I actually applied to a few of these big name scholarships and this is the one that pulled through. I\u2019m also a questbridge match at my current university so that eliminated any and all costs. Again I know i\u2019m low income so as for private universities it can be hard without big name scholarships. as for the public OOS, that\u2019s just up to your application.",
