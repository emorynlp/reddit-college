      "text": "Personally, I dont really like the city/area itself similarly to SF. Of course the \"touristy\" places are good but dont really like it outside that. Along with that, the campus itself isnt really my vibe (prefer SB and SC). Plus the cutthroat rep it has makes it an area I would hate to be in\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a school with good reputation for the programs (especially Haas) but just not an environment I would thrive in",

Are you looking for validation from HS students who tend to repeat the same mantra year after year about how Berkeley is \u201ccutthroat & competitive\u201d just to justify your feelings?  Most of these students have never been to campus and continually repeat the same info based on reviews from A2C, CC and  YouTube which are mostly from students who have issues with Berkeley.   **Happy people don\u2019t complain.**. Yes Berkeley has issues - plenty of it believe me.  I\u2019ve had my highest of highs and lowest of lows here and now I\u2019m graduating this Spring.   Hardest 4 years of my life but would i change any of it? Nope, no regrets.",

The name recognition is great, but I think you can have a better experience elsewhere.  I haven\u2019t recommended it to my kids.  Other UCs seem nicer, along with other west coast state schools with strong technical programs like UW and Cal Poly.",

Everything else has seemed \u201ceasy\u201d since.\nThe general environment, especially south of campus is another story though.  I can get a similar education without the drug deals and homelessness.  Just my opinion.",
