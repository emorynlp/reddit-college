Along with that, the campus itself isnt really my vibe (prefer SB and SC). Plus the cutthroat rep it has makes it an area I would hate to be in\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a school with good reputation for the programs (especially Haas) but just not an environment I would thrive in",

Are you looking for validation from HS students who tend to repeat the same mantra year after year about how Berkeley is \u201ccutthroat & competitive\u201d just to justify your feelings?  Most of these students have never been to campus and continually repeat the same info based on reviews from A2C, CC and  YouTube which are mostly from students who have issues with Berkeley.   **Happy people don\u2019t complain.**. Yes Berkeley has issues - plenty of it believe me.  I\u2019ve had my highest of highs and lowest of lows here and now I\u2019m graduating this Spring.   Hardest 4 years of my life but would i change any of it? Nope, no regrets.",

The community vibe here on campus and in the city is very uniquely Berkeley.  The food scene is great.  Berkeley is a 20-minute train ride to San Francisco (though i rarely go there these day).   I am surrounded by people who challenge and inspire me to do my best and I absolutely love that about Cal.  Academics is rigorous (you have to earn your grade here; not a perk for some) and the professors here are great (the ones I\u2019ve had).   I once had the honor of learning from a Noble Peace Prize winner and research with a renowned expert in the field - pretty awesome stuff i probably wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity elsewhere (maybe).",
