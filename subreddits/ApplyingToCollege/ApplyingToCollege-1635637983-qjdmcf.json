  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo my school uses Naviance for letters of rec, and I've been having some major issues. One of my letters submitted to all of my schools except for ED one, and in the midst of fixing that issue, I noticed that my teacher's name was misspelled when the letter shows up for the common app, but I emailed her and she said it was spelled correctly from her end. I emailed my gc as well, and she asked if I could fix it which I could not do. Will this misspelling cause any conflict for my applications? I already submitted my applications for a few schools and I'm worried that it will mess something up.",
