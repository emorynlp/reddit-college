  "text": "Imagine: \nIt's 2019. You're a high school senior applying to colleges. You're 17, maybe 18. You're a kid. Your frontal cortex is underdeveloped. \n\nYou take a Test that measures how well you take tests. You don't like your score, you take it again and again. Finally, you have mastered the skill. This massively sought for, heavily rewarded skill - must be crucial to survival right? You come to find later in life you never used it again. \n\nYou sum up your entire existence into 600 words. You delete a hundred of those words to not make it too tedious to read. \n\n\"Tell us why you dare think you're worthy.\" You did your best. You wait patiently to see if you were chosen to put yourself in debt and pay thousands of dollars for a stressful experience. \n\n(I'm just cynical about it today)\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver!",

      "text": "It\u2019s really interesting from my perspective as a person who was once a first gen college student and now has a masters degree and is working in higher education as an admissions representive, to see how some people in this subreddit are overvaluing getting into a top 40 school. I\u2019m really not sure why everyone is hell bent on getting perfect SAT scores, layering ECs, and stressing through 4.0 GPAs. It\u2019s like if your entire lives depend on getting into Harvard, Yale or Brown for some reason, but I don\u2019t get a sense of why anyone here is trying to do that? Is it family pressure? Is it a nagging sense that you have to do it? That your value as individuals depend on whether or not a top university validates you? I would really like to know what some of your long term goals are. What do you see yourself doing after college and why does being in Harvard or any other Ivy League or top 40 university mean to you that you will achieve that long term goal rather than just breezing through a state school. Because I have to tell you there is no more humbling experience than graduating, being in debt and realizing you are no more better qualified for a job than anyone else with a similar degree and zero work experience. \n\nTruthfully what matters more is the connections and relationships you make during your university and no GPA or test score is going to prepare you for that. And what really worries me the most is that studies show that Generation Z more than any other generation has difficulty coping with failure. It\u2019s led to a much higher rate of depression, anxiety and suicide in young people. This has been steadily increasing for a decade and testing culture which prizes your end result \u201cscores/grades\u201d over the amount of effort put in, has contributed greatly to this. I honestly read some of the posts and comments here and feel that it\u2019s the students who want to get into these top 40s and feel like they have to have perfect grades and scores that are at the most risk. What\u2019s going to happen to all of you when you get into the school of your dreams and you don\u2019t get 4.0s in every class? When you struggle and then can\u2019t internalize that feeling of failure in a way that is healthy and productive? And when that same school doesn\u2019t have the resources to support you when you do start to become overwhelmed? Or when you graduate and realize the real world cares much less about your grades that you ever did and you don\u2019t feel prepared for it? Unless you are all planning on getting PhDs and becoming professors (which by the way is a very difficult life track) you are all going to experience it at some point.... and im worried that your current mentalities are setting you up for unnecessary pain. \n\nAs a side note I\u2019m planning on getting my Ph.D and becoming a professor. I got high grades in undergrad and grad school (3.8) and now I am working in higher ed. My masters degree has literally means zip professionally. I don\u2019t make more money and I barely have an edge when applying for jobs. I make whatever money and have to have work experience to move up anyway. So now I\u2019ve decided to continue onto the PhD because honestly I was happy in academia, felt like I was thriving and felt like I was valued for the work I was doing. Honestly that\u2019s what matters. My friend on the other hand graduated with a 2.5 GPA from a private university that wasn\u2019t top 40 but was decent and got a job immediately after college and has just worked for the past decade (has no loans) and makes almost double what I do to do a job that is half the work. Go figure. \n\nSo maybe I\u2019ll turn this into a post because I\u2019m really curious as to what everyone\u2019s motivations are and why",

Learn how to write an essay not according to the written rules on the syllabus but according to the way that professor will *interpret* and then *apply* them.   Learn how to pass an MCAT not by calculating the right answer, but by quickly approximating it \"closely enough\".  \n\n\nThe real rules are much closer to natural law, so the effective rule is:  There are no rules.  You just think there are rules.  \n\n\nSee if you're chosen to put yourself in debt?   You can't be chosen to compel yourself to a voluntary action.   Go to a trade school and get \\*paid\\* to learn a valuable skill, or demonstrate need/merit and go for a scholarship.  Or yes, maybe take out loans if you think the payoff is worth the benefit cost.  Those are all choices.",

But it didn't need to happen in the first place. \n\nThe college essay is supposed to represent who you are, explain your growth and life experiences. Yes, you're writing to an audience, but personally I try my best to always be genuine. \n\nYes rules aren't actually existent, we been knew.

Not everyone's life path is the same. Although I've met a lot of people who've never encountered a serious hardship in their life. I used to think maybe school was designed so that they would have some sort of challenge, I'm still not sure. \n\nI definitely believe in the power of the struggle, but also I realized recently you can still grow from positive change. I'm learning how to do that right now. But I think a big point if college is some sort of growth.",
