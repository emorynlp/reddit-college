  "text": "Contemplating taking a gap year because of a low predicted score\n\nHi all, as the title says I've been predicted lower than I deserve and there's not much I can do about it right now. I have pretty good grades in previous years/semesters and a high sat score, but I know predicted scores are really important. I'm sure I can do well in my actual exam. Now for the question, will taking a gap year hurt my chances at top-ranking undergrad schools? \n\nI'm an asian-american, living outside the us for context. I am applying only to us uni\u2019s. And as for the actual scores, \n\nIB 1/Y 11 scores: 38/42 \n\nPredicted 35/42 with 5/7 (considered B I guess) in my HL\u2019s.",
