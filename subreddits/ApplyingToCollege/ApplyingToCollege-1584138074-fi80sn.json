Talking about it increased emotional attachment. \n\nFor college apps this year, I tried to keep the same vibe - I never told anyone what schools I applied to, also due to like... an inferiority complex but whatever. Frankly, seeing the name of the school would make me cringe. Pour your emotional attachment into your essays and then smother it. I got my first rejection yesterday, JHU, and even though I really liked it, the way I had so isolated myself just made me... not care. It was bliss dude",
