  "text": "I was working on college apps today, and I thought I didn\u2019t self-report my SAT scores to this one college, so I went in and saw it already said they received my self-reported test scores in my application checklist in the portal. However, I just wanted to check I remembered doing it, so I went into the self-report section of the portal and entered in my scores, but it submitted without letting me double check. So, I submitted the same scores twice to the school. \n\nHowever, when I go to my upload history in the portal, all I see is that I submitted my scores tonight, and not the night I did it the first time.\n\nSince I wasn\u2019t really paying attention when I was submitting my scores tonight, I\u2019m also scared I could have made a typo or error.\n\nShould I email the school and let them know I accidentally self reported the same scores twice and I may have made a mistake with the second one?",
