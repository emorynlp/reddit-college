  "text": "So, I did everything right in high school. Great grades (APs/Honors courses too), stellar SAT and ACT scores (back when it was out of 2400!), leadership positions, national debate awards. I got some acceptances to private universities, some rejections. I got three full rides to T100 public universities, and I thought that I was failure. Not only did I think that I'd never be someone *important*, I was convinced that if I went to a public school I wouldn't even be able to get a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGod, I want to smack myself. I'm in my senior year of college now and the last three years have been the most amazing years of my life. I know without a doubt I wouldn't have had the same experience had I gotten into my 'dream' school. I wanted share some of my experiences below for those of you that are fixated on certain schools. \n\n**1)** **If you think it's competitive now, think about what the your dream college will be like**.\n\nDuring college I've been a part of my school's debate society, which is probably one of the most well-funded and well-respected public debate unions in the country. I wouldn't say the college debate circuit is dominated by Ivies, but certainly Harvard/Yale/Princeton regularly send lots of teams to every tournament. Over the years I got to know a lot of them since we see each other almost every weekend. On the surface, they all seem perfectly content, like debating 30+ hrs a week on top of a rigorous courseload comes easily to them. Many (not all) of the people I've talked to are deeply unhappy.\n\nSeriously, think about it. If you go to an Ivy/T20, you're among the best, if not \\*the\\* best at your school. You eat, breathe and sleep getting into \\*this\\* college, because goddammit you're *special*. You're not like any of the other chumps who took it easy their junior year, those losers who aren't doing 3+ extracurriculars at a state or national level, because you're *driven* and *going somewhere.* Probably your entire life you've been the brightest in your class, and you get a lot of validation from that. \n\nAnd when you finally get to this college, you're the norm. Average. Honestly, for most of us, probably below average, or at least that's how you'll perceive yourself. There is always someone with more money, more connections, more national or international awards, more *oh my god you're taking differential equations as a freshman?* \n\nAnd this is where the competition really starts. Competition for finance internships, for campaign staffing, for professor recommendations, for spots on the \\*D team\\* in your college's debate society (yes, even if you went to ToC). \n\nI don't want to hammer this point home too much. My friends at Ivies constantly talk about how competitive it is just to join an extracurricular, the feeling of always being inadequate, the sometimes shallow friendships and transparent social-climbing. And? You still have to compete with people from every other university in the country for the 'good jobs' that you were promised by this institution. \n\nI'm not saying that being under pressure isn't valuable, or that everyone who goes to these schools are deeply unhappy. But for me, going to a university where there wasn't cutthroat competition just to join extracurriculars let me shop around and join things I never thought I would. I felt like I had the latitude to experiment and grow as a person because I was surrounded with friends and professors who genuinely wanted that for me, not waiting to put me down so they had the feeling of getting an edge. \n\n**2)** **Don't get into debt.**\n\nSchool is f\\*cking expensive. It's absolutely ridiculous to be just starting out in life and have $100k+ of student loan debt hanging over your head. *Go wherever gives you the most money*. People say that (most) high schoolers have no conception of money and that it's criminal to lure them into thousands of dollars of debt. As a high schooler, I was convinced that \\*I\\* knew what I was getting into, and that I would willingly pay any price to go to a \"good\" school, because of course it would pay off.\n\nIt's golden handcuffs. When you know you're graduating with debt, the pressure to get a good job skyrockets. No summer to go backpacking with your friends in Europe, you *need* that finance bootcamp so you can work at Goldman Sachs next summer. Going to the bars or a party with your friends? No, the stochastic calculus and corporate finance classes you took requires at least 20 hours a week studying. Can't risk graduating with anything below a 3.8 if you want a finance job. And doing the bare minimum at these jobs once you graduate means working 80 hours a week, minimum. For years. Until that debt is paid.\n\nMore importantly, unless you are literally trying to work for Goldman right out of college, I promise you it matters less and less where you go to school because employers do realize how expensive school is. Internships at boutique finance firms aren't hard to come by and they really don't care what school you go to, and once you have work experience you're golden. Look at the list of schools Harvard and Yale Law accept students from; it's mostly public state universities. \n\n**3) Be a big fish in a small pond, if that's what you really want to do.** \n\nIf you really are Ivy material, and you really do think that you're better than 95% of other students, go to a state school. Think about getting a stellar recommendation from a professor at an R1 (high research) university, vs. competing with *everyone* in your upper-level econ class for a tepid recommendation letter, or not one at all. Think about less competition for research assistant positions, leadership opportunities, conference travel funding. If you're a grad school admissions committee, which looks better? \n\nMost importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end. Think about what you really want out of life. If the only thing keeping you going is the validation you get from the name on your diploma, seriously reevaluate your life. The competition for external validation doesn't end when you get to an elite college, **it only gets more intense.** ",

They might not be the best in everything but hell they\u2019re trying to be that\u2019s for sure.\n\nIf you go to FIU don\u2019t talk about it with shame own up to it.

I wasn\u2019t disparaging the school or the quality of its education at all. I was saying that because it isn\u2019t selective, and because people conflate selectivity with quality, it flies under the radar of many students it\u2019d be perfect for. \n\nIt\u2019s certainly an excellent school and it\u2019s only getting better. \n\n\nAlso, I relate. Except I live in the Jax/St. Augustine area, so FIU would be decently far away from my family ahahaha.",

Not only do you have the opportunity to network and form connections, but it's also incredibly inspiring to learn from each other. Personally, I really enjoy being average and feeling like I belong with people similar to me.\n\nDebt sucks though. ",

I go to an Ivy and even with grade inflation it seems like people are unanimously exhausted from feeling inadequate around here, and networking is looked at as more stressful than anything. Like the culture at Brown is going to be so different from Princeton or Cornell (I imagine).\n\nI thrive off of being surrounded by people who motivate me to be better every day, and so does everyone else. That\u2019s why we came here. But I can\u2019t pretend that most of us don\u2019t have deep seated mental health (and physical health tbh...) issues from the culture of ambition.\n\nEDIT: Alright I see you go to MIT, which makes sense. All my friends who go there are so happy, and I\u2019ve noticed that all the people who get admitted there are genuinely smart and eager to learn\u2014not in it for money or prestige. It\u2019s also one of the only top schools where I haven\u2019t heard of anyone paying to get in. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case for most of the ivies; like, Harvard is on the same level in terms of prestige as MIT and the students are similarly motivated but the culture is extremely different (perhaps b/c of the huge money/prestige obsession)",

I tell prospective students (usually current high school seniors) that in college, you\u2019re actually encouraged to dive deep into subjects you\u2019re interested in. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what an academic major was! \n\nPersonally, I was lazy and obnoxious during high school. I hated most of my classmates and considered myself an outcast. I didn\u2019t come out of my shell until my senior year and it all hit me like a ton of bricks... those were the best years of my life and I wasted so much time being a brat. I was absolutely terrified of and uninterested in college. But I went anyways... to a small liberal arts university. \n\nAnd I THRIVED. THOSE were TRULY the best years of my life. I was motivated and felt challenged by my professors; I partied a little and experienced a variety of relationships; I did an internship that had a direct influence on what I went into grad school for (currently in a MAEd program while working full time as an admissions counselor). \n\nBut you know what? When I started in my desired career and work through the kinks and enter into the best professional years of my life... or when I get married and start a family... or when I see my children grow up, graduate high school, and go on to college... or when I celebrate my 50 year anniversary with my life partner and maybe have some grandkids and great grandkids come into my life... those may become the best years of my life. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is... this is the best yet, but there is so much ahead of you. There\u2019s no need to be afraid or nervous because it\u2019ll all work out in the end. I have faith in that. :) ",

I'd say it's a combination of everything you mentioned.\n\n* I can take classes in material that I actually care about.  Even the generic gen-eds can be interesting if you choose them correctly.  Professors aren't teaching to arbitrary county test standards, so you'll *usually* find that this leads to classes where professors are more engaging and interested in seeing how you solve problems rather than fill in bubbles.\n\n* I have amazing friends who are passionate about what they do, but also enjoy having fun outside the classroom.  They've forced me to become way more social than I was in HS, and I have no regrets.  It's not just about partying or going to game days, but also being comfortable enough as a group to just sit around and talk about random stuff for hours.  \n\n* College is a chance to be exposed to a world where you'll be taken a lot more seriously than in HS.  Some kids here have already had internships, but for most kids, undergrad internships and research are their first chance to see what people in their field really do for a living.  There's also talks and conferences that you can always attend for further education.  College degrees may just be paper, but the connections and opportunities for learning/growth are tangible.  The question is how much you're willing to take advantage of them.\n\nHope that this wall of text answers your question!  Let me know if this isn't clear- it's been a long day...",

          "text": "I could have gone to an Ivy but chose to go to a state school. I'm glad I did because I didn't saddle myself or my parents with huge student loan debts. I have friends who went out of state, and despite being great students with relevant work experience and good jobs, they're still drowning in six figures of debt and huge monthly payments five years out of college, or saddled their parents with those payments. I'm not saying either way is wrong, but I think a lot of high schoolers, and many parents, don't understand what they're signing up for when they take out student loans.\n\nI don't feel that my potential was wasted or that my not attending an Ivy was failure. Due to its size, my state school still had a huge alumni and career network, world-class research, nationally-ranked extracurriculars and competitive classes available with professors who are at the top of their fields.\n\nIf anything, I wish I'd gone to a community college for my first two years, to save even more money. Plus, internships in my small town would have been even less competitive to land, and I would have stood out more to my professors, meaning better recommendation letters and more professional connections (in quality and quantity).\n\nI'm not saying either way is wrong at all. I'm only writing this in case someone faces the same decision I had (Ivy vs. state vs. community college), to have another viewpoint to consider. I've also grown to have a lot of respect for those in skilled trades and the military, but I can't speak for them the same way.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "text": "From someone who is in their 6th year of college with no completed minor, associate's, or bachelor's (yet), I can give some advice I had to learn the hard way as well.\n\nI started at an expensive private school, then went to community college, now at state. It is 100% fine and SMART to go to the \"mediocre\" community college first to get the Gen Eds out of the way. You will pay less, the classes will be easier, and it's a good intro to college life. I looked down on my high school classmates who were going to the community college but here I am 6 years later still in school while they have good paying nursing and mechanical careers.\n\nThe reason it has taken me 6 years is because I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do until 2 years in, and that's perfectly normal. You may think you know until all of a sudden you are introduced to something and your whole life perspective changes. You WILL have that \"OH!\" moment, but it may take some time and trying new things to get there.\n\nIf you need to take a semester off, do it. Taking a break is better than failing all of your classes because you lack motivation or are sick or whatever. Take a break. We are only human. The college will still be there when you are ready.\n\nGo home as much as you can, hug your mom often, and let her know how you are doing. She cares but she doesn't want to bother you because you are \"all grown up now\". This will be your last few years before you are truly all grown up. Tell her you had gross cafeteria slop for dinner, or that you made a new friend. You will make her day just by talking to her.\n\nMy number one piece of advice though is keep in contact with your loved ones. Family, friends, pets, etc, and make time for them. School can wait, loved ones come first. Over the past 6 years of me being away at college I have lost 90% of my friends, all of the pets I loved back home, my grandpa recently that I was \"too busy\" to go see in his final year, and I am clinically depressed because of this. I've lost almost everything I loved from before college because I was \"too busy\". Don't be like me. Never be \"too busy\".\n",

      "text": ">Most importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end.\n\nThese Ivy schools have far better connections. Depending on what you want to do, an elite college can really change the path for your future. (1) is a really good point, though. In a competitive school there are lots of people fighting for some opportunity and it's really luck as to whether or not you get that opportunity, whereas in *very good* state schools, if you're a solid candidate, you've got a better chance at making the most of valuable opportunities.\n\nYet, some singular professor or person you meet (either at an Ivy school, or a non-Ivy) could change the path of your life. It's pretty impossible to know how your future will turn out at either place -- obviously, you could have a shit future from an Ivy, and a great future if you went to a great state school, or vice versa. The US is a good country in the sense that, unlike others, great alumni come from all sorts of schools. In places like the UK, famous alumni come from a select number of schools only.\n\nRegarding debt, sometimes it doesn't matter. Some schools offer great aid, a solid job can pay back whatever debt you have, the issue of funding your education varies depending on your family and the school.\n\nI want to make one critical comment of this post: you didn't get into your dream school (as you say). This doesn't discredit your advice necessarily, but you have no idea how that would've turned out. Some go to their first choice, regret it, others think it was the best thing that happened to them. You only have the perspective of someone who didn't, and made the most of what you had.\n\n\nI think the correct advice for anyone on this sub is: go for what you feel is best, if it doesn't work out then follow where life leads you. You're not doomed to failure either way.",

          "text": "You're by far the most logical person on this thread imo.\nOne thing that really struck me was the whole \"the name on your school doesn't matter\" argument. It most certainly does as more prestigious schools have better connections to real business and alumni. I go to one of the three B's of business schools and every interview for an internship I go on has an alumni from my school. One interview I went on I was interviewed by 4 people and every single one had graduated from my college.\nThe debt argument is also incredibly troubling. This is anecdotal so it doesn't hold much water but every school  my friends and I applied to, whether it be out of state, in state, private, or public, came to around the same price after their merit scholarships so unless you have the choice of living at home for one school, the prices won't vary wildly. Also, unless you have many outside scholarships, debt is almost unavoidable in today's education climate so as long as you're entering a reasonable field, you shouldn't be held back by student loans (unless of course they're excessive). If your future job provides a salary that you can afford to make the estimated repayments, then go for it.\n\nBut completely agreed that the best advice is to do what you feel is best for yourself. You shouldn't let some random person on Reddit talk you out of attending your dream school just because they didn't get into theirs and think they're better off for it. Internally this person is just rationalizing they're decision so they don't feel the dissonance of wondering \"what if\" so they need validation from random people on the internet. You won't know if you'll love your dream school or hate it so just try it out and worst case scenario is you transfer after a year, there's no shame in that. Do what you believe is best regardless of price, prestige, or some random on Reddit looking for karma.",

It is a process to get a degree to move on to the next step of your life. You have to go to a school that you think is best *for you* at this stage of your life. Maybe you do want to go to a top school,  price be damned. Maybe finances is a consideration and you are a self directed learner. Maybe you don't need a top school to do what you want...maybe you learn best in a more intimate, less competitive setting. Or maybe you need that competition.\n\nWhen you go to college (or any advanced education), its all kids who are generally at your level (more or less) and not a geographic selection of kids like in high school. If you progress to more difficult schooling, it will only become more concentrated and more elite. You start to meet people who are crazy smart; they play a gig in their band before a huge test and still set the curve. They don't go to class and get top marks. They can sit and memorize/understand complex issues in great detail in an afternoon. It can be very humbling if your key to success is grinding, and others are just...smart. There will be major adjustments, cultural differences etc. in a university. Some are good, some bad, but mostly it depends what you learn from it. The university is what it is, and its up to you to get what you need out of it. They vary widely in what they can provide, and no school provides *everything*.\n\nIt's very important to know what *you* want in life, and have a flexible plan to get there. \"What you want\" is broad. It may be a specific career, it may be time off, it may be family, it may be early retirement. Everyone is going to be giving you conflicting advice, but you are the one who is going to be living the life. I recommend doing some soul searching and talking to adults (who have lots of insight and are willing to be frank) candidly. \n\nI know many people who went to top schools and are middling to unsuccessful because they didn't really take advantage of it, or didn't learn anything. I know people who went to community college/no school and are fine. I have a job paying very well; people got to where I am from all different ways. Here are some anecdotes, so you can see it truly isn't where you go to school, its what you get out of it, and what type of person you become. College helps you get your first job. After that, no one really cares all that much, although some places do have good alumni network.\n\n-Joined military, took the cash his parents saved, now successful with private job opportunities paying 6 figures\n\n-Joined military, got a terminal degree, now making 6 figures no debt\n\n-Ivy League school, terminal degree, ended up joining military for debt repayment, permanently moving around now with low flexibility and lower than private salary.\n\n-Ivy league school, got a \"normal\" job, making high 5 figures.\n\n-state school, terminal degree, making 6 figures\n\n-state school in great location, made connections, now lives a dream life with less income than others but best lifestyle ever\n\n-top state school, jobless/gig work for years, then top terminal degree, now working abroad\n\n-out of state school, did not sign up for high pressure job, now has a lifestyle job (low pay, awesome hours)\n\n-state school on scholarship, took a government job (as planned) and now has tons of security and no debt.\n\n-community college transferred to top school, worked way up multiple jobs,  (that did not need that top degree), mostly manual labor, recently quit because his own business took off, making 6 figures with potential for 7.\n\n-community college transferred to top school, now banker in midwest, doing well (5 to 6 figures)\n\n-community college, no job (manual labor)\n\n-top state school, no job (random gigs)\n\n-community college, was jobless, lied on CV to get 6 figure job, has been working there for 3-4 years now is up for promotion, that bastard.\n\n-small liberal arts college, joined a startup knowing nothing about computers, has worked way up through multiple jobs to project manager\n\n-top private school, had the same career path as the person above\n",

      "text": "Listen, while I agree with 2 and 3, 1 is a serious overgeneralization. As someone currently enrolled at one of the ivies mentioned, I can say that for the majority of the students here that generalization isn't true. It isn't that competitive, and as someone who is familiar with the debate team here, most of the kids aren't \"deeply unhappy.\" I tried out, got in (I honestly wasn't an exceptional debater, never qualified to ToCs), and chose not to do it and I'm not sure if that was the right choice, I might be missing out. Either way, the university as a whole isn't the hyper-competitive overachieving environment that everyone assumes it to be. Yeah, there's a fair share of kids here that do go crazy and try completing with the best of the best, but that's their choice. \n\nCertain extracurriculars can be somewhat competitive, but most are open to anyone willing to try it. Most of the people I've met here are genuine and honestly passionate about their interests, and for most social groups/interactions there's no social climbing, it's just hanging out with people with similar interests like normal human beings do. You can easily choose to not be competitive and just pursue your interests at your own pace. You certainly can't slack off, but if you graduate with a degree and display passion for what you want to pursue you're still going to be fine. The majority of students here aren't preoccupied with beating everyone else, because in college you start to specialize so much that competition becomes less and less evident as you progress. \n\nI think that the majority of people here wouldn't describe \"feelings of inadequacy\" or \"shallow and transparent friendships,\" in my first two months of being here I've felt welcomed and I've met a lot of fantastic people. It was surprising at first, I also expected this place to be some kind of crazy cutthroat environment, I didn't expect to get on the debate team, and I expected to be way more stressed than I was in high school. But honestly, none of that has turned out to be true. Everyone I've met is supportive, the professors are all helpful and accessible and the idea of a friend \"putting me down to get an edge\" honestly sounds like a ridiculous ivy league sterotype that most actual students would never encounter.

Sure, I had my problems and life wasn't perfect or easy, but I was never worried that my parents wouldn't be proud of me, and I've never come anywhere near depression or suicidal thoughts. I enjoyed all my ECs and still made time to be social and live life, and I look back at high school as a great four years and I don't have any regrets. That's not to say that I did high school perfectly, but by graduation I was satisfied with the choices I had made.\n\nAs a college freshman, I don't feel like I'm living a \"battle,\" and I'm not afraid of falling short of perfection. I'm still working hard, I'm taking several difficult classes (#engineeringlife), and I'm doing well in the assignments/exams I've had so far. I feel like I'm sustaining the work ethic that got me here, and while I want to succeed, I'm not sacrificing my mental health for a chance at prestige.",

          "text": "... so you've only been there for 2 months, is what you're saying? \n\nFreshman year, whilst a hard time full of adjustment for many people, is simply not comparable to what you will experience in your last two years. Yes, we may get used to the workload, but if I really think about it, the work I was doing was *hard*, there was a lot of it, and I felt pressured to perform at my best 100% of the time. \n\nI thought university was full of fun, carefree characters when I started, too. But by the end of the year, the people who just seemed to be chilling out had nearly all dropped out, and what was left were just gradations of \"very hard worker\". \n\nThe simple reality is that many people on this sub are hyper-competitive, type-A's. That isn't going to magically change when they start university, and so if they don't drop out, chances are they're going to want to be one of the best students. \n\nEither they let go of that dream or they suffer, and if they're going to let go of it, they need to do it in a constructive way. You can't just sit back and say \"I'm honoured to be in the presence of all these smart people and to be mediocre at best\". That's a cop-out, and for previously hyper-competitive students, it often signals that they've given up. If you're not going to be acing your classes with ease, you at least need to be hustling for opportunities and networks. Nothing comes to the person who sits around saying \"everything's fine\". It goes to people who seek out challenge and opportunity. ",

As a senior in high school, I was so dead set on getting into an Ivy \u2014 my entire family (parents, uncles, brother) went to Ivies, and all my high school friends were getting accepted to them as well. \n\nTruth be told, I was jealous of them, and disappointed in myself for not having worked hard enough to be accepted. I ended up going to a liberal arts college, and I fell in love with it. Admittedly, my first year was rough, as I felt out of place and \u00ab\u00a0too good\u00a0\u00bb for the school. It was my pride and ego that stood in the way of really enjoying myself. But over the years, I found my groove. I found lifelong friends, became extremely close with professors in both my major departments, and had opportunities that I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten had I gone to a giant university (Ivy or not) with 2000 other students in the same year. My school had 2000 students total across all four years, and that ended up being perfect. I had seminars with only 4 other people, and I\u2019ve never had a class with more than 30, even in the STEM field. \n\nAfter graduating from my small college, I was accepted to Ivies for grad school, one of which I now attend. My high-school self would be thrilled at being here, but only because it\u2019s a name-brand school. My current self is proud because it had what I was looking for to advance my career and studies - it had little to do with name and everything to do with how it fit. It took a small college to appreciate how far I\u2019ve come, and I\u2019m so grateful for that experience. \n\nLong story short, my parting advice: don\u2019t overwork yourself for something unless you\u2019re sure it\u2019s what you want. A college rejection doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t succeed in the future, and don\u2019t feel pressured to go for name and rank if it\u2019s not a good fit for you as an individual. You\u2019ll get to where you need to be, even if the road deviates from what you had planned!",

Anyone going to a competitive school will probably experience a bit of culture shock. Be prepared to be wrong about your assumptions.\n\n2. I went to a top 20 school to avoid debt, but I could have gone to the top school in my field. I wish I took on the debt and went to the world-recognized #1 school. That name on your resume follows you around and puts your resume on top of the pile 15 years later, even if you were last in your class.\n\n3. Push yourself. I was the big fish in the small pond. It was a nice lifestyle at the time and university was relatively easy for me. I now regret not pushing myself to achieve the most I could. See point 2, even if you graduate on academic probation and barely survive, that #1 University on your resume will open doors for you. Finally, networking with people who are at the top school is really valuable. These students will be in all the top jobs after you graduate. Knowing them will get you interviews, jobs, and careers that would otherwise be closed to you.\n\nTo add my own point related to the above:\nAsk for money if you need it. I asked my school, and I got extra grants and loans to cover my costs of living (I had tuition covered). Any highly rated school has money sitting around waiting for people to ask for it. If you write a letter and ask the financial aid office for money, they probably have some for you.\n\nHonestly, just ask for help in general. University is full of people that want you to succeed, but they aren\u2019t your mom and dad watching you every day. People will very gladly help you all through university with every problem if you ask. You aren\u2019t expected to do it all on your own.",

No extracurriculars, few friends, 12 hour days of class and work.\n\nAnd NONE OF IT MATTERS. I hate seeing people stress about competition and the best school and being an ideal candidate. No one cares! You have to be ideal in highschool to get into a good college. Ideal in college to get into grad school. Ideal in grad school to get a perfect job. Guess what? With the exception of very specific career fields, no one cares where you went to school, what clubs you went to state in or if your grades were perfect.\n\nI had a master's degree at 22. I bought my first home at 24. I'm 25 now and make more than most of my department. I wasn't top of my class in highschool. I wasn't top of my class or in any clubs in college. I barely paid anything for grad school because my job had good tuition reimbursement. At no point in my grad school or job interviews did anyone ask me what clubs I was in. They didn't care that I slept 4 hours a night for an entire year taking 8 classes at once.\n\nPeople care about who you are, what you can do, and your work ethic to do it. You can demonstrate that through academic performance or club participation, sure. But once you leave school, no one cares! Your work history and your proven performance will get you way more than your national debate title (again, career exceptions).\n\nSo from someone who killed themselves in academia to get where they are today... Chill out. Take your grades seriously, but don't treat them like they can end you if you get a B. ENJOY your college years, and stop worrying about being ideal.\n\nBe you. Have fun.

Sister M\u2019s college isn\u2019t that prestige, but it\u2019s still miles better than the one I\u2019m going to transfer to. She\u2019s still having to pay off her circa 2009 loan - and she\u2019s not done yet. I don\u2019t know many details about M\u2019s financial solutions. But I do know that both of them are really fucking smart & totally had some scholarships helping them. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been taking as much classes as I can at my community college, living with my family, paying my tuition & books with scholarships & payment plans, and I\u2019ve 100% decided on going to a nearby university with *fantastic* scholarships.

And yeah, living with my overbearing (but loving) family & being poor all the time sucks, but I look at a classmate who\u2019s family literally lives in the same town as the college but still pays for a dorm, and I still fear the scary loans. \n\nMy aunts & cousins are all like \u201comg you should do study abroad! you should live the college life & room with someone!! you should go to any college you want!!!\u201d but I\u2019m all like \u201c....uhh no thanks I wanna enjoy my life right after graduation? I don\u2019t like the idea of graduating with a degree & debt to stress over.\u201d\n\nAnother thing I think is worth talking about - most of my cousins are attending/planning to go to well-known unis, but I\u2019m perfectly willing to ignore the \u201ccompetition\u201d our mothers play & make my experience smooth. Why worry about others when you need to worry & focus on yourself?\n\nI guess my point is I think it really doesn\u2019t matter which college you end up with - unless you\u2019re hell bent on going to This Really Nice College, it won\u2019t hurt to help yourself & save some money and stress in the future.

You're right about the fact that, for the most part, the name of your college doesn't hold you back... but you're naive if you don't think that having Harvard on your resume doesn't immediately make your dick 10 inches bigger in any job interview, and the networking opportunities with disgustingly rich people you get are considerable.\n\nThis is fair perspective, but the inverse is still true.",
