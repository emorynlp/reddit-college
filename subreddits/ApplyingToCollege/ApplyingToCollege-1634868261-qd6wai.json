  "text": "4.0 Weighted GPA, 3.7 unweighted, 1280 SAT, 28 ACT. I\u2019m from NYC. I have a couple ideas on where I want to go but I have no idea how qualified I am in the grand scheme of things. Never in any sports but heavily involved in robotics clubs and stuff. Did some out of school stuff involving robotics aswell and had 2 jobs. Focusing on a career in either CS or computer engineering. I just kinda wanna hear a second opinion in the grand scheme, what do you guys think?",
