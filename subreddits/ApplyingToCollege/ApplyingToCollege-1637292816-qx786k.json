  "text": "So I understand that they take your academics in relation to your school and area, but does being from an underrepresented area serve as an advantage somewhat? or is it just an even playing field when they do a wholistic review, and they don't care where you are from.\n\nIm assuming its just an even playing field or something like that but just wondering.",

      "text": "They want diversity, and that includes states from where they don't get many applicants. Being from a state like Nebraska (and also having a great application) does help. Now if you mean underresourced area, then they consider the location and school in a way that evens the playing field. Taking 2 APs at a school that only offers 2 is more impressive than taking 2 at a school that offers 15 (They make these judgements using the school report provided by your counselor). Or another example, high SAT and GPA in an area where the average SAT/GPA is extremely low comes off as impressive.",
