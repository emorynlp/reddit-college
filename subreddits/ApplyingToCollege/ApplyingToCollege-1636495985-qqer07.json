  "text": "I have my college list finished and am making good progress on my essays/prescreenings (for music school), but every once in a while I can't help but feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I usually get the urge to change my college list completely. Sometimes I feel like I'm applying to way too many schools I have little chance of getting into. Sometimes I feel like I'm not applying to enough top schools. A lot of the time, I dread the idea that I might not like any of the schools that I get into, even if I end up getting into my targets or reaches. Does anyone else have this problem? How have you guys been finding ways to cope?",

      "text": "At least once every day. I tend to cry about it and then put Netflix on or go for a walk outside. In terms of not applying to enough top schools (I feel the same 100%), I just like to imagine if I would actually enjoy my time there or if I would just be surrounded all the time by a ton of work and I think about how the college experience shouldn't just be about studying or practicing or anything constantly. I don't really know if it gets better, but that has kept me going currently",
