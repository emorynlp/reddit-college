  "title:": "CS Major, does it matter what school I go to?",
  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nTo clarify my question a bit more, I am stuck between two major options. \n\nOption #1 go to UTSA (in my hometown which obviously requires less hastle). The pros to this are that the requirements to apply/get accepted are lower, it is in my hometown and i'd be able to stay with family and save, but the cons are that it isn't a tier 1 school.\n\nOption #2 go to UT Austin. The obvious issues here are the following:\n\nIn order just to APPLY to UT austin I need to take I believe up to Calc III/Linear Algebra and university level physics. I currently hold a 4.0 but I hear even students with 4.0's get turned down. I am an Air Force Veteran that served in real world/combat operations so that may help on an application but idk. The university has a fantastic cs program; however, I am unsure how much this matters in the real world and if it is worth going through the hell of taking these additional classes I mentioned above just for a chance to apply. Obvious cons are that I also have to move/relocate and pay more out of pocket to live in Austin (which is completely do-able, but slightly inconvenient). \n\nMy fear is putting in all that effort just to get denied and then end up going to UTSA anyway after the fact that I put in all that effort/time. Or, to find out that nobody in the CS world cares and that where I got my degree didn't provide me with any marginal benefit that was worth said effort.\n\nIf you guys could clarify my confusions i'd very much appreciate it!",

                      "text": "A&M will feel much more like a traditional college than UT-Dallas I suspect.  Historically UT-Dallas had a lot of commuters, but I hear lately they've been building dorms and trying to convert to a more residential style school.  That said, since you're not an 18yo, you probably don't care about that anyway.  If you have a high SAT score (and esp. if you're a National Merit Finalist) then UT-Dallas is known to be generous with non-need-based aid, but I don't know what the situation is with applicants who aren't coming straight out of high school.\n\nOne other thing about A&M:  given how reverential the school is (in general) with regard to the armed services, it's possible they may have some special scholarships just for veterans.  Definitely something to look into.",

UT Austin is a good school with a very good CS program that will open many connections for you. \n\nTo answer your question, no I really don't think it matters which school you go to for your undergrad degree in CS. My aunt works as the Head of a Department of a FAANG company and regularly hires people. I asked her this exact question and she told me they don't even look for the name of your college unless you mention it in your resume. \n\nThat being said, if you like CS, you'll have a more intellectually stimulating experience at UT Austin. And if you don't get in, well... it didn't even matter in the first place.",

It certainly helps to make it past resume screening, but you can get a much higher return on passing this step by simply networking well and asking people for referrals. As a new grad you will also be indexed far more on past internship experience than GPA/pedigree.\n\nAlso, personally, I think college is absolutely worthless for CS other than learning the fundamentals, in which case they usually teach you necessary coursework later in your degree than you should learn it anyway. It is still somewhat of a gatekeep towards getting work experience (for example, applying for an internship) but for the most part, just pass your classes, and focus much more of your energy on personal learning, personal projects that interest you, networking/meeting people in the field, getting referrals, etc.",
