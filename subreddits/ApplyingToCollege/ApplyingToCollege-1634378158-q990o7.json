So, yes, it is \"good enough\".\n\nThat said, a higher score might marginally increase your odds.\n\nIf it's a question of where to spend your time, you could take the SAT again and simply not study for it at all.  If you do worse, then just don't submit that score.  With super-scoring, the odds of you improving your position with a 2nd sitting are pretty good.",
