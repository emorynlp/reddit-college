  "text": "In honor of Transgender Awareness Week and Transgender Remembrance Day today, this post is for our trans, non-binary, genderqueer, and genderfluid friends. Applying to college and trying to figure out a good fit for you is hard enough, but when you\u2019re applying to college and you\u2019re trans, non-binary, genderfluid, or genderqueer, it can be especially tough. And, if you\u2019re in one of those groups, you know that these students face additional challenges at home and at school -- and that certainly extends to college admissions as well.\n\n# Four Quick Tips:\n\n1. **Keep up with the Forms:** While many colleges ask for your preferred name, you may still need to use your birth name, if it hasn\u2019t been legally changed yet so that all your paperwork and files won\u2019t get lost or disorganized.\n2. **Think about Your Essays:** To come out or not to come out? You don\u2019t have to write about being transgender in your essays, but you certainly can if it\u2019s a story you want to tell. If you\u2019re worried that being trans might hurt you in admissions, ask yourself this question: *Do I want to attend a college that would deny me because of who I am?*\n3. **Check State Laws:** I got this amazing advice from a fellow mom of a nonbinary child: \u201cIt\u2019s worth checking the state laws where the college is located\u2014the most supportive campus in the world can\u2019t help your student if the state doesn\u2019t guarantee access to health care, makes name/marker change incredibly difficult, etc.\u201d \n4. **Ask Questions:** Be sure to ask colleges these kinds of questions when doing your research or reaching out or on tours/visits/info sessions:\n\n* Do they have gender-inclusive housing?\n* Do they have a nondiscrimination policy for trans/queer students?\n* Do they allow students to change their names on campus records?\n* What resources and opportunities do they have to support trans/queer students?\n* Do the schools' health clinics and health plans cover trans medical care, if that\u2019s something you are interested in?\n\n# Check Out These Helpful Resources:\n\n* [MIT's Blog: Applying While Transgender](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying-while-transgender/) ([https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying-while-transgender/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying-while-transgender/))\n* [FAQ About Transgender Students at Colleges and Universities](https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-in-college-faq) ([https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-in-college-faq](https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-in-college-faq))\n* [Campus Pride Trans Policy Clearinghouse](https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/) ([https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/](https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/))\n* [Supporting Transgender Transitioning Students in the College Application Process](https://www.sacac.org/supporting-transgender-transitioning-students-in-the-college-application-process/?fbclid=IwAR33ZWtND2zwzKBqROD_VZqyJ5VvrLhMKh-vi7KgzObPiI6cRAlnAj6w4yA)\n* [Recordings from NJCAC LGBTQ+ College Fair and Info Sessions ](https://www.strivescan.com/lgbtq/)\n* [LGBTQ+ Youth - HRC - Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbtq-youth/p2)\n\n# Looking for college suggestions? \n\nHere are some colleges that have been suggested to me or that I've heard have trans-friendly environments:\n\nVirginia Commonwealth\n\nIthaca College\n\nCU Boulder\n\nU Oregon\n\nTufts\n\nRutgers\n\nClaremont McKenna\n\nUC Santa Barbara\n\nPacific University Oregon\n\nOregon State\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\nVassar\n\nWashington State\n\nU Washington\n\nWestern Washington\n\nUConn\n\nMacalester\n\nClark U in Massachusetts\n\nSUNY New Paltz\n\nHampshire\n\nBard\n\nOberlin\n\nNew School\n\nNYU\n\nWesleyan\n\nSarah Lawrence\n\nKenyon\n\nTulane\n\nNorthern Arizona U\n\nWhitman\n\nSkidmore\n\nSimmons\n\nClark\n\nEvergreen\n\nReed\n\nAllegheny\n\nUVM\n\nPitzer\n\nBrown\n\nWesleyan\n\nOccidental\n\nGoucher\n\nLawrence\n\nBeloit\n\nAugustana\n\nKnox\n\nWheaton\n\nWarren Wilson\n\n# Trans Awareness\n\nSome of you may or may not know this about me, but I'm the mom of three amazing kids -- my middle is my transgender daughter.

They even have a housing floor for LGBTQIA students and allies called Stonewall Suites.

For instance, I've gotten emails from colleges my youngest child applied to that used their preferred name and had a student employee call from my eldest's college during a fund drive who used their preferred name.  If you aren't out to your family, you may not want to officially use a preferred name at school.\n\nThe method for asking for gender neutral housing, signing up to use a preferred name, and getting support is different at each school.  In most cases, the best point of contact seems to be the school's LGBTQ+ organization.\n\nAlso, I would highly recommend adding UMass Amherst to your list.  Both the school and surrounding area are very supportive.  My daughter has been able to use her preferred name, have gender neutral housing, get hormone treatments, make many friends, date, get research in her field, etc... while at the school.  It has been a warm welcoming environment.\n\nI'm happy to see both UVM my youngest's preferred school and Washington State University (my college) made your list as well.",

Applying to colleges will be a really big deal for me as college will probably be the first time I can live as a woman in my day-to-day life. Where I live, it's not exactly safe to be trans. College represents not just opportunities for the future, but also the chance to escape an area where I need to be so careful. Of course, I'm a Junior, so I'm not that familiar with the college admissions system.\n\nCan teachers, or really anyone in the school, see what you've put on college applications? Would it be a problem for certain information differing in my listed gender due to only being somewhat out? And, though not as directly related but I couldn't really figure this out, is there any way to get a government ID from the state that your college is in? Louisiana makes it kinda difficult to change your ID so I'd rather one from another state that it's easier to change, if possible.",

          "text": "If you don't want to be outed to your school or family, it's probably better to NOT list your gender identity or preferred pronouns on your application.  As I state elsewhere in this thread, the schools my youngest (currently a HS senior) applied to have sent me emails (\"We're so happy your child applied!\") which use my kid's preferred name (which they put in the \"preferred name\" section of the application).  \n\nAlthough your high school counselors wouldn't see your essay, or other parts of your application, unless you show it to them, it's possible your parent(s) might see it if they help you at all with completing your application.  For instance, I double-checked that my daughter's application was completed properly before paying the application fees.\n\nYou could apply without mentioning being transgender and then request to use a preferred name and get gender neutral housing after you've been accepted, if that is more comfortable for you.  There is no requirement that you conform to anyone else's timeline.\n\nMy eldest hasn't yet gotten any legal documents changed (Covid got in the way), but has had absolutely no problem with having documents that list one name/gender and using another name/gender at school.  I think most state require that you have a permanent home (year round apartment instead of a 9 month dorm) to be considered a resident, so that may delay getting your driver's license changed.  But you could probably get your preferred name on your school id if you change it in the school records... At least, that's possible at my daughter's school.\n\nOnce you've found the best school for yourself, the school's LGBTQ+ resource center would be happy to answer your questions.\n\nIn my experience, the Northeastern US and the West Coast tend to be the most accepting areas for LGBTQ+ people.  Look for both a school that is safe and welcoming and a geographical area that is safe.  As a general rule, the most progressive/liberal areas are going to be the most accepting.  My oldest is loving Massachusetts and my youngest is hoping to head to Vermont in the fall.\n\nOne word of caution:. If you rely on your parents for support for college expenses, or even need them to complete FAFSA every year for financial aid, and you don't think they'll be accepting of your gender identity, it may be best to take that into consideration when choosing your path to transition.  \n\nI highly recommend that you apply Early Action next fall to as many of your schools that offer it.  Both my children found that it reduced their anxiety to work on applications over the summer and know where there were going by Christmas.  It's one potential way to reduce stress in your life.\n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "It depends. Northeast Ohio (the greater Cleveland area) has amazing resources and laws protecting the lbgtq community. Where I live specifically is one of the most gay friendly cities in the nation. \n\nHaving said that the farther south you go, the more conservative you get. My non-binary kid was accepted to a game design program at Shawnee State university. They were super excited until we learned more about the area, it\u2019s super duper Uber conservative in Portsmouth. So that was a big fat no. \n\nOhio State and Columbus are pretty progressive and friendly, I know a lot of people out that way, and many family members went to OSU. OU is SEEMINGLY very friendly. Everyone I\u2019ve known to attend there or work there is very positive about the area. \n\nUniversity of Cincinnati, I\u2019m not sure. I imagine since it\u2019s a \u201cbig city\u201d it\u2019s fine. But stay away from the small rural towns. Wooster is NOT very friendly. The school is but the area is meh. Ashland is very white, very very very conservative. There is no diversity at all there. Toledo is great according to one of the pharmacists I work with, diverse and friendly with good aid packages. \n\nMiami of Oxford, great school, area is conservative. \n\nNotre Dame College is very friendly, which shocked us since it\u2019s a Catholic institution. It\u2019s high in my kids list. Baldwin Wallace is great, friendly area too. John Carrol is friendly as well.\n\nDayton is really awesome too, one of my coworkers is a student there and says it\u2019s great for lbgtq students.\n\nCleveland Institute of Art ( both my kids on the spectrum have an application in there) is amazing for the community. They do have gender inclusive housing as does Cleveland state, OU, OSU, Baldwin Wallace and Bowling Green. Not sure about other schools though.\n\nI\u2019ll update as I can think of more we looked at lol.\n\nIf anyone is need of phone numbers for the center or the lbgtq clinic I am happy to provide them privately.\n\nETA: there is a huge list of friendly schools I nabbed from the mamma bear group I\u2019m in. I\u2019ll see if I can dig it out :)",
