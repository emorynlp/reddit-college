  "text": "My parents are way too involved and I hate it. My dad\u2019s treating it like HE\u2019S the one who went to school and did all of the activities, and everyday he goes \u201cwhere are WE applying\u201d and \u201cwhen are WE going to submit our application.\u201d\n\nI guess it sounds like nothing but he follows it up with action when he just picks what schools and majors I should apply to. My original list was 26 colleges and when I took some off he yelled at me for \u201closing my focus.\u201d Every day is just torture because all both my parents talk about is college applications and college timelines and when I get frustrated they just yell at me even more for giving up and losing everything I\u2019ve worked so hard for (my grades are slipping a lot this year because I feel so burnt out). I just want to feel supported and have someone to vent to instead of being their perfect-daughter puppet to control and work endlessly. \n\nThe WORST part is how they insist on reading and editing all of my essays. My dad hired a professional college essay reviewer, and I feel bad for wasting all that money when I don\u2019t really feel like the reviewer and I see eye-to-eye and constantly feel like he\u2019s stripping away my voice. I also can\u2019t mention this to my dad because he\u2019s going to blow up at me in a way that\u2019ll end extremely badly.When my dad saw an essay on the application I didn\u2019t get reviewed he threatened to delete the whole application because I didn\u2019t listen to the \u201cexpert.\u201d They then both ripped into every essay I wrote, when they\u2019re incredibly personal and mention them so I really didn\u2019t want them to read it. They criticize the content and it kills me for feeling like I\u2019m being judged. They also criticize stupid things like \u201cnot using enough big words\u201d and grammar errors that don\u2019t exist. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? How do I get it to stop?",

I am going through this same thing right now :/\n\nMy dad literally tells me my \"to do list\" or plan every day, and with college stuff not only did he hire the professional college essay reviewer he himself also edits the essays, and blames me for him reading it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only motivation you can give yourself is that its only until the regular deadline, and then you're done with college apps. About the professional reviewer: you need to talk to him about how you can include your voice, and make the essays as authentic as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck, and i'm rooting for you!! if you need to dm, its open :)",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with parents who aren\u2019t respecting the fact that you (as the student) need to own this process. I think the first step is for you to take some time to destress and relax because this level of stress isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s not good that the essay reviewer is stripping away your voice. Also, the reliance on adding \u201cbig words\u201d is terrible advice. If it isn\u2019t a word you would use in conversation, it shouldn\u2019t be in your college essay. The essay reviewer can give advice, but you should submit the essay that you\u2019re comfortable with - which means you don\u2019t have to use all of the essay reviewer\u2019s suggestions. \n\nDo you have a counselor at school or another family member who could sit down with you and your dad to help him understand, value, and respect your position and opinion on this process?",

Having said that, I guess having someone too involved as well takes away the individual experience, but I suppose it\u2019s because they only want the absolute best for you which might explain the harshness. Look on the bright side, this is temporary and once you get in you\u2019ll have a whole new slice of hell called college to deal with instead.",

I want a day where I don't have to be yelled at that my grades are so bad that I am going to be rescinded.\n\nOh, and they HATE my major. \n\nEvery day I feel like my house is a pressure cooker. I recognize that for some students their parents are absent in this whole process but for me? I wish I had more control over this whole process. \n\nanyways small rant over but what keeps me from going crazy in my own house is just...fixating on the end goal. I know it's hard. I am burnt out too. Just thinking of the fun parts of college wherever you end up...for me it's thinking about studying and a lot of iced coffee and going out in the city nearby or where the college is in. \n\nI am with you friend!",
