EA is not, so you might consider applying EA, though you are running out of time.",

              "text": "Large publics may weigh ECs less and rely more on stats, unless they're super selective. Less selective schools of any type don't weigh ECs much. Have some things in the activity section, but don't worry. Your academics are always more important. ECs are important at highly-selective schools.\n\nStart by figuring out your safeties and make sure the schools on your list are affordable. Publics tend not to offer need-based aid to out of state students, and charge them more, but some less selective ones offer big automatic merit for stats and don't care about ECs at all.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re uncertain, then ED/EA offers you no advantage. That said, it\u2019s time to start moving. Now. You will have school work outside of this. That is not a valid excuse. Your peers have the same work and they\u2019re getting things done. Progress you should be able to make in the next two weeks:\n\n1) think about what you want (major, school size, location, selectivity targets, reaches and safeties). You don\u2019t need to have those locked down, but chances are you already have 1 or 2 schools you know will be on your list. \n\n2) just start the process of completing the data entry for the common app or relevant portal for these 1 or 2 schools. Just looking at your old posts to see your stats/location, those might be schools like Stony Brook or Syracuse that you may already be familiar with and know they\u2019re good for what you plan to study. \n\n3) have your parents gather the necessary financial data to run their numbers through the aid. \n\n4) create a crib sheet for your LOR writers. Accomplishments, highlights, what you liked about their classes. This makes it easier for them to reference things in their letters. \n\n5) review your ECs. Make a list. See if you have any gaps you\u2019d like to fill. Is there a project between now and RD deadline you can undertake in a club to fill that gap. \n\n6) brainstorm and outline a personal statement. Review that with someone you trust. Turn that into a draft. It doesn\u2019t need to be good or anywhere near the final product. You need to produce something. This will help you understand the time commitment associated with the schools when it comes to things like supplementals. \n\nThe benefit of RD is learning from the process over time to build a better personal statement, figure out what you\u2019re going to do with supplementals, have financial talks with parents to help you narrow choices, etc. The only way to take advantage of this and to understand is to tangibly begin the process. \n\nYou\u2019re asking the wrong question.  The question isn\u2019t \u201cAm I at a disadvantage by not doing EA/ED?\u201d  The question is, \u201cAm I at a disadvantage by not already preparing for RD?\u201d  And the answer to that question is yes. You have time, but you really need to start do the things I\u2019ve listed over the next couple weeks to take full advantage.",
