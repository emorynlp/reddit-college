If there is a better one, please point me in the right direction. Thank you!",

It doesn\u2019t mean the program is worthless, but only do it if it is something you\u2019re passionate about.",

      "text": "I found a list online. They have a bunch of them, all run through different offices, which makes it confusing. \nThe free ones are of course the most competitive ones (SIMR) and the Summer Humanities Institute was semi-competitive - pre-COVID, some sessions had 30%+ of kids eventually getting into Stanford. I have no idea now, since it's virtual and less than 2 weeks long. \n\nhttps://prepmaven.com/blog/preparing/stanford-summer-programs/",
