  "title:": "POV: You're Applying to College in 2051",
  "text": "Every school offering an early decision program has agreed to revamp their ED agreements. Now, instead of requiring students to withdraw other applications upon being accepted, students are automatically blacklisted from every school other than their ED choice as soon as they apply. Students are no longer allowed to apply RD or EA to other schools if they are rejected during ED. T20 admissions officers nationwide have applauded the move, believing it to incentivize students to demonstrate true commitment to their first choice colleges.\n\nThe Ivy League colleges have refined their academic index formulae. Your \"Ivy score\" is now the sum of your SAT or ACT percentile and your unweighted GPA multiplied by your parents' net worth.\n\nThe acceptance rates for state colleges like Penn State and Rutgers have fallen from the mid-50s to the single digit range, prompting high school seniors to apply to unprecedented numbers of colleges out of uncertainty. To accommodate the exponential increase in shotgunning, the Common Application has expanded the number of colleges you can apply to from 20 to 50 colleges.\n\nStanford became the first college in U.S history to achieve a negative acceptance rate when they began randomly expelling 30% of their student body at the start of each academic year. Rumors have begun to circulate among high school seniors and college consultants that Stanford has actually ceased to exist and that all application fees are sent directly to the Stanford admissions officers' bank accounts.\n\nThe University of Chicago became the first college to achieve a 100% yield rate by eliminating their regular decision and early action programs entirely, accepting students only via EDI and EDII.\n\nHand-to-hand combat between college applicants and alumni interviewers has become standard procedure during college interviews. Admissions officers began to advocate for this practice after theorizing that it would weed out students who lacked the fortitude to succeed in college.\n\nEvery naturally-occurring disease has been cured by overzealous MIT and Caltech applicants. However, creating and spreading synthetic viruses has become a staple extracurricular for high school seniors, particularly among premed students (the most lethal or disruptive viruses are the most prestigious).\n\nEvery single nonprofit, even the big ones like the American Red Cross, is now run by high schoolers. Like clockwork, the major leadership roles in every nonprofit are handed off to juniors after the latest generation of seniors commits to a college in the spring.\n\nU.S News & World Report's list of the top 50 colleges in America now contains 300 different colleges (there are six-way ties for every spot on the list).\n\nElectives, gym, and art/music classes have been eliminated from high school curricula nationwide. They've been replaced with additional reading, writing, and math classes to better prepare students for the SAT and ACT. Science and history classes that do not follow the AP curricula for their respective subjects have been banned.\n\nThe college application landscape has become saturated with nearly every extracurricular possible. Unbeknownst to most seniors, NSHSS membership is now one of the most valuable things you can list on your application because of its uniqueness.\n\nThe prevalence of \"resting bitch face\" among high school seniors has risen to nearly 100%. Coincidentally, the number of college essays about RBF have also soared.\n\nIn addition to exam fees and score sending fees, College Board and ACT, Inc. have instituted a \"score view\" fee. Unlocking a single AP score, SAT section score, or ACT subscore for viewing now costs $12.00 a pop.",
