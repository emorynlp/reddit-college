I had 10/10 rejections too and the feeling really sucks but thankfully I\u2019ve got a place in my home country instead. \n\nCollege admissions in the US is really messsd up and unpredictable. Just remember that rejections doesn\u2019t mean that you are not qualified as a person. Sending well wishes \ud83d\udc95 Do you have any back up plans?\n\nEdit: who would have known my throwaway would get so much karma hahaha. But seriously wishing all the best to everyone out there who\u2019s suffered through the college application process! Failures don\u2019t define us!!",

I only applied to the T10s because of financial aid and also it is just better to attend a school in my country rather than a mid-level school in the US by spending thousands of dollars that my family can't afford and that too for an undergraduate degree. I'm thinking of applying to the US and UK post grad now. All the best for your future!\n\nPS: Love the name. Huge Pokemon nerd here",

Bitter because I can\u2019t help but feel like I did something wrong when I congratulate every single one of my friends for getting into their dream schools while I try to delay committing. Sweet because it\u2019s finally over. I\u2019ve always considered myself a \u201cwildcard applicant\u201d, someone who started as a very, very average kid but grinded their ass off more than anyone else to get to where they are. And you know what? That alone is something to be proud of. I\u2019m not going to lie and say I\u2019m happy, because I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve cried every day for the past two weeks because seeing \u201cno\u201d over and over again from schools I had invested so much love and hope into broke me. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but I\u2019m proud of myself for sticking with it and pushing through. I\u2019m proud of myself for not abandoning ship and holding onto hope, even if it is just by a thread. I\u2019m proud of myself for putting my stories and experiences out there and getting acknowledged by some of the best schools in the world, even if it\u2019s just a waitlist that\u2019s not meant to be used. As good ol Kelly Clarkson says, what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. I might cry a lot and feel sad ~~sometimes~~ a lot of the time but I\u2019ll come back stronger than ever.",

I took a gap year to prepare but the results are terrible. After disappointing for a while, I decided to continue to study in my local college and continuously apply to Fall 2022, which means if I get received in the future, I will start college again at 21, and it's not an easy decision for me cause u know, looking your peers are preparing to find intern or job makes me really stressed and pressured. However, studying abroad is my dream (I'm intl btw) and I realized that it's not too late to pursue knowledge. Maybe this is a good decision because I have a foundation when I study in my local college and when I become a freshman, it's maybe an opportunity for me to be different in the classroom (if u know what I mean) \n\nEverything will be okay, we are still young and this (temporary) fail is not too terrible compared to many people out there. Just be strong and find the way that you feel best about this.",

I live in KSA. Got registered for SAT in oct 2019. Our test got canceled as the paper leaked.Took the test in DEC but never got my score as the test was leaked in Egypt and UAE once again. Devastated, I went to my home country just to take SAT at least for once. Then came Mr. COVID. March and May SAT got canceled. I was supposed to go back to KSA and take my As level exam there, but KSA suspended international flights.Got myself re-registered in my home country so that I may take my As level exams, but right after three weeks, the IGCSE and A level exams got canceled too. On Sept 15, flight operation resumed. My mom and sister returned to KSA while I stayed back to try my luck in oct. luck was definitely not on my side; SAT was once again canceled at a few centers in my city and mine was one of them. Disappointed and agitated, I went back to join my family. In Nov, my mom who is a cancer patient tested positive for COVID and all my family members had to quarantine for 14 days so again SAT was out of question. \nI am also taking a gap year. Will take my A level exams in this May and then SAT in October.",
