  "text": "Everywhere I see stories of accepted applicants they're like winners of Intel science fair, went to RSI,  olympiads, publication awards and idk what.\n\nLet's say theres like 20k spots in the top 10/ivys, that means something like 20 to 30k accepted. How tf is literally EVERYONE super accomplished while STILL at high school.\n\nDo any non hooked, regular kids with competitive grades and scores, normal ecs, get into these top 10s? Or are we wasting our time?",
