  "text": "Everywhere I see stories of accepted applicants they're like winners of Intel science fair, went to RSI,  olympiads, publication awards and idk what.\n\nLet's say theres like 20k spots in the top 10/ivys, that means something like 20 to 30k accepted. How tf is literally EVERYONE super accomplished while STILL at high school.\n\nDo any non hooked, regular kids with competitive grades and scores, normal ecs, get into these top 10s? Or are we wasting our time?",

I was prety lucky to have figured out mine (neuroscience) earlier but lots of people find themselves straddling multiple different passions and are usually not clear what they want to pursue in life. Someone that doesn't have all of their ECs in alignment are perhaps still exploring what they want to study. Some even do that in college (remember, the average American changes their major 3 times)",

However, everyone\u2019s path is different, especially at these elite T10 schools. I\u2019d suggest mainly focusing on building a sort of story/narrative through your essays and letting your creativity/personality shine through as these essays and letters of rec play a crucial role in presenting YOUR individual story. Best of luck :)",

So clearly, most people in Ivys don't have any of those. Assuming none overlap,  around 2000 people have at least one of those ec's which is nothing close to the 20k-30k u listed. and to be accepted into a t10, u have to stand out which u don't need a spike for. u can be super well-rounded, which obviously u need to have accomplished something in those ec's, and get in. for example, being president of some club, treasurer for another, good SAT, good GPA, orchestral activities, plays a sport for fun, volunteered 300 hrs somewhere, and some good damn essays/lors can prob get u into a t10",

Hate on Allen Cheng all you want but he is right- having a spike is the only way to avoid the crapshoot.\n\nAlso keep in mind that hooks don't take everything into account- for instance, females have it much easier than males, and whites have it much easier than Asians, even though they're both unhooked. Your location and which school you go to also matters significantly. If you look solely at unhooked Asian males in CS from a highly competitive school in the Bay Area who got into multiple T10s, he will almost definitely have some major accomplishment.",
