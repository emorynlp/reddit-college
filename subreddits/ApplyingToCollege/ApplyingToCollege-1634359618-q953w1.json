  "text": "My grades are doing terrible. For context, I am a current senior applying to colleges. I have been absent for more than 2 weeks because of COVID-19, and other family items I need to take care of. I have 2 B's, and 1 C. Last year I got all straight A's. Online school really worked for me as I could babysit my siblings and do my schoolwork. In-person school is hard because of the multiple amounts of absences I have, and the formatting in general, its difficult to take tests and monitor extracurriculars in person. \n\nI don't know if my transcript will come off as alarming to the admissions counselor. Sudden plummeting in grades and multiple absences. Please let me know how it would appear to the admission counselors.",
