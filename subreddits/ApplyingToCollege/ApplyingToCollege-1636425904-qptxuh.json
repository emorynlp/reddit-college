  "text": "I have a 4.0 GPA (uw) right now, and have the option to bring up language credits from middle school. However, I messed up and got a B both semesters in Spanish 1. Without it, I will only have 3 years of language credit, and I heard its it's important to have at least 4 years of credit. Should I add the class to my high school transcript?",
