  "text": "When I submitted my early apps, I used my cumulative HS gpa, but on my transcript I just checked and saw that some middle school grades are also included in that average. My cumulative HS gpa without MS grades is slightly higher than the average shown on the transcript (by .1) and I'm not sure whether I've screwed up and submitted a gpa higher than what my transcript shows. Does anyone know if I'm fucked?",
