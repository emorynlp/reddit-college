  "text": "This was posted earlier this week but swiftly taken down by mods who wanted this for Shitpost Wednesdays so I'm reposting this now!! Also, sorry if your school isn't on here, I tried to keep off public schools in particular since there are too many! Hopefully this gives some ideas to people for other schools they can apply to based on their personality types (I included acceptance rates in parentheses too)! Enjoy, and let me know which groupings you like the best/which ones fit your personality the most!\n\n**The Cunning Achievers/City Dwellers (Slytherin)**\n\nHarvard (3%), Columbia (4%), UPenn (6%), Georgetown (12%), NYU (13%), BU (18%), BC (19%)\n\nThese schools are flooded with future finance bros and politicians, and are among the most career-oriented institutions. You will find that many students have a high drive and can network as much as they hang out with their friends, oftentimes using one as a substitute for the other. The surrounding cities at these schools enable students to engage in multicultural and dynamic environments, while also honing their ability to succeed in hectic, fast-paced settings. After four years of bustling about in the city with these go-getters, the world is truly your oyster.\n\n**The Social Achievers/Sports Fanatics (Gryffindor)**\n\nStanford (4%), Duke (6%), Northwestern (7%), Vanderbilt (7%), USC (12%), Notre Dame (15%)\n\nIf you like warm weather, gregarious peers, and dreamy surroundings, these are the schools for you. Most of them have iconic sports teams that yield some of the most rah-rah environments amongst elite schools, creating a culture of high school spirit and morale. Don't be fooled by this inclination for fun and being the life of the party though - these institutions are the stomping grounds for many high caliber students who work hard on their way to becoming world leaders, entrepreneurs, and influential thinkers. Even on big gamedays, you'll find students in research labs, coding, and attending talks by industry pioneers.\n\n**The Bookworm Achievers/STEM Lovers (Ravenclaw)**\n\nMIT (4%), Princeton (4%), CalTech (6%), UChicago (6%), JHU (7%), Cornell (9%), WashU (13%), Harvey Mudd (14%), Olin College of Engineering (15%), CMU (15%)\n\nThese are the academic powerhouses where \"life of the mind\" is taken seriously. If you like grinding your bones dry in the library on a weekend more than going out, these are the schools for you. The majority of these schools are STEM-dominant, so having a passion for quantitative learning and reasoning is a must. While your four years may be highly stressful and slightly traumatizing, if you survive it will make everything to come that much easier, and is a true testament to your work ethic, willingness to embrace challenges, and intellectual vitality/aptitude.\n\n**The Unassuming Achievers/Artistic Souls (Hufflepuff)**\n\nYale (5%), Brown (5%), Dartmouth (6%), Pomona (7%), Swarthmore (8%), Williams (8%), Amherst (8%), Bowdoin (9%), Claremont McKenna (9%), Rice (9%), Tufts (11%)\n\nThese are the schools with heavy undergrad focus, tight interactions with faculty and peers, and predominantly small-town settings. If you're looking for homey environments with a slower pace, these are some of the best choices. The majority of these schools excel in the arts and humanities as well, allowing for interesting intersections between STEM and the arts to be discovered. For the elite liberal arts colleges, they are notable for attracting many students who desire a supportive learning environment without needing the recognition that comes with big name schools like Harvard and Duke - instead, these students give their all to obtaining knowledge and fostering intellectual exploration.",

I think the most fitting Ravenclaws were CalTech, Olin, and Harvey Mudd as they're very academically focused but collaborative and not as back-stabby as some of the others (**cough** JHU and UChicago).",

          "text": "Yea JHU and UChicago definitely could've fit in as Slytherin but the academic intensity at those schools made me give them a nod for Ravenclaw. Princeton had me debating between Slytherin (eating clubs + lots of fboys + nothing more annoying than hearing someone is a \"Harvard/Princeton/Duke/Oxford/Wharton man\"), Ravenclaw (lots of STEM + academic intensity + quarter system + finals after Christmas break + mandatory senior thesis + history of grade deflation), and Hufflepuff (strong undergrad focus + small-town setting) but I overall felt their defining feature was the academic rigor, and they were a little too fboy to put as Hufflepuff. In general I think a lot of schools had arguments for multiple houses (i.e. Rice was really tough to place between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff).",

UChicago was also a tossup between Slytherin and Ravenclaw because they're also in the city with lots of kids in finance (and with a core curriculum like Columbia). But I felt UChicago is slightly more academically inclined and not really great for namedropping (most normal people will think it's a state school) whereas Columbia has a lot of lay prestige, so I ultimately split the two even though both schools are very similar.",
