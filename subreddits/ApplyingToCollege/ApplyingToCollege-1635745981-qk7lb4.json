  "title:": "Yet another pessimistic post about senior year anxiety",
  "text": "The glass isn't half full, the glass isn't half empty, it feels like the glass is broken, I'm the one who broke it and I may not have water again for a long time.\n\nBefore, and even during quarantine I used to be so carefree, confident, and optimistic regarding my passions and my future. I had a great sense of humor and was generally well-liked but now I'm just struggling to get past every day of school. I have 3 fewer classes this year but very few of my friends are in them, the teachers and class environment sucks. I also now feel a need to repress myself and my sense of humor whenever I'm talking to someone. I spend a lot more time alone now at school and I don't remember the last time I facetimed, videocalled, or texted someone for fun. I'm just not myself anymore.\n\nGetting normal schoolwork done is significantly harder than it used to be and I'm afraid I'm spiraling into a hole. I want to enjoy my last year of high school but it feels like I don't know how.\n\nStrangely, applying to college has been a highlight of my year so far. No matter where I go, I know I have a chance to start over and get my head out of this pandemic-induced anxiety. The only concern I have is whether I will feel the same excitement about ideas and activities that used to excite me like research projects and math/cs/tech related stuff.\n\nOn a more positive note, I started learning to dance which has been fun. Also developed an interest in BTS and binged a lot of their dance videos. They've got some crazy skills. Seriously, their hair dances better than me.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to rant about my past few months.",
