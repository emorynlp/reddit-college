  "text": "Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could help me out with this. Basically I currently live in the uk and I completed a level 3 qualification( same as 3 A levels) which in the US is apparently equivalent to Advanced Placement Examination or IELTS I\u2019m not 100% sure but I think it may be advanced placement examination. \n\nI finished that at 17 and just turned 18 now as I took a gap year to work and make money on the side for beginning of uni next September. Now I am highly considering moving to the U.S Instead to study as I was told that if my plans are to move to U.S it\u2019d be better to just do the degree there instead. \n\nMy question is what would I have to do in order to be eligible for \u201cCollege\u201d there and to study and if the U.S has any student loans like the uk does, etc. \n(I was born in the U.S so I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be to difficult to get back there ? I think I\u2019m considered a citizen there I\u2019m not sure lol )",
