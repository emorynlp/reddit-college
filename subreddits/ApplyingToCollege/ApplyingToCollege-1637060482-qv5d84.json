      "text": "Okay so just to make a quick distinction, need-based aid is different from merit-based aid\u2014need-based is primarily dependent on your family's income and what you can afford, while merit-based is based on your competitiveness in a school's applicant pool. You do **not** need to apply for need-based aid to apply for merit aid.\n\nSome merit-based scholarships require a separate application (often an essay), but some don't have any additional materials ie, you are automatically considered for the scholarship when you apply. It's best to check with the school itself.\n\nSome T20s offer merit scholarships\u2014Dartmouth and Vanderbilt immediately come to mind\u2014but most of them only offer need-based aid.\n\nQuick edit: International students should be eligible for most merit-based scholarships.",
