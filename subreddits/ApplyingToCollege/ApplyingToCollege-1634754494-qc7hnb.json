  "text": "Hello fellas; hopeless people, stressed people and the early candidates who still haven\u2019t written their supps. \n\nI have a tiktok account with 70k+ followers, 10M+ views and 2M+ likes. The thing is, it\u2019s a fan editing account; and we all know sometimes can get cringy and weird. The thing is, I\u2019ve spent way too much time in that account, I have viral sounds and even setted trends for the editing community (which is huge). I\u2019d easily call myself an editing influencer on my activities list but I\u2019m honestly scared to do it: What if AO\u2019s find it weird? \n\nI\u2019ll forever appreciate any advice!",

If they can find it by searching your name on tiktok be careful about the content they might see.  I wouldn\u2019t mention it if you have racist, misogynistic, anti- anything stuff.",
