      "text": "This may have changed recently w/ ballooning endowments, but here's the list of schools that supposedly meet full need without loans for all incomes:\n\nBrown, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Chicago, Hopkins, Northwestern, Penn, Vanderbilt, Yale.\n\nIf that list is accurate (I culled it from a cursory google search) then the ones that \\*don't\\* meet full need w/o loans are:\n\nCal Tech, Duke, Dartmouth, WashU, Cornell, Rice, Notre Dame, UCLA.\n\nSeveral of those probably meet full need for students whose incomes are under some threshold.  I think at Rice it's 130k, but would need to research.",

      "text": "For a domestic student, I think all of them are need blind and meet full need other than the UCs (WashU just changed their policy, and was the standout for being need aware).\n\nFor an international student - Harvard, MIT, Yale, Dartmouth, and Princeton. Not all need blind, but they are schools where over half their international students are receiving significant aid. Many others in that range are giving aid to around 25% of their international students - still generous to those students, but being need aware clearly impacts who is getting admitted.\n\n Many LACs are also good for aid both for domestic and international students.",
