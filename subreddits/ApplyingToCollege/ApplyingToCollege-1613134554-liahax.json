  "text": "Now we all know that the pandemic has messed everything up and things definitely look different this year. We've all heard about grade inflation, ECs getting canceled, limited in-person vists/interview, etc, but what I want to know is how does the ***application*** look different from the previous years? Do you see drastic changes in stuff like essays or the competitiveness of an application? or the number of applications?\n\nAnd what are you doing to make a fair assessment of applications? We would all love to hear from admissions folks, who frequent this sub, and learn what's it like working inside the admissions office this year.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your insights. I also wanted to know how the situation has affected international students in particular. ",

      "text": "I've shared my thoughts on my instagram already, but here's a quick summary...\n\n\\-More students are reaching out with very basic questions, which could be because many don't have as much access to their school counselors.\n\n\\-I'm reading more covid statements than I thought I would, but the majority cover things of which we're already aware - virtual classes, cancelled activities, etc.\n\n\\-Some people obviously thought that test-optional would make selective admission less selective. Colleges were always more concerned with transcripts than test scores (we've always said this). Admission didn't get easier at the selective schools. Applying got easier. This also might be due to less access to school counselors.\n\n\\-Regarding the app increase at some schools: We always pulled ridiculous hours at this time of year, but this year is definitely different. It takes weeks to train our temp readers, so there was no way to add to our teams *after* the numbers were known. Those of us who are working from home do gain time back from not having to get ready for work and commute to an office.\n\n\\-Yield season (when we have admitted student events) used to be the reward for all this cloistered work. We look forward to it. The prospect of all those events being virtual again is tough. This field tends to attract social people who love working with students. Many of us haven't visited a high school since Fall 2019 ([I live for school visits](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18002771635218727/) and [group travel](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18039985576176154/)), haven't given an in-person info session in a 11 months, and haven't gone to any industry events since the October 2019 NACAC Conference or our spring 2019 regional meetings. It's a strange existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is on top of worrying about the health of our own families, our colleagues, and our current students.",

Your title sorta included me, so here's my thoughts.\n\n**1)  Application volume is WAY up across the board.**  Students are applying to more colleges.  Students are applying to more selective colleges due to test optional policies.  This necessarily makes almost everything more competitive.  As an example, our honors college has seen a 40% increase in total applications and test optionality is significantly increasing the burden of evaluating these.  We used to use ACT/SAT cutoffs to pare down the pool and we can't anymore, so we've had to explore other ways to review all of these applications.\n\n**2)  Grade inflation is generally more widespread.**  This is mostly anecdotal - I don't have good data on this.  One of my best friends is an Ivy professor and he said he's been essentially giving everyone an A if they put forth any effort at all.  Another of my friends is a high school teacher and he said he's been trying to use all possible means to give everyone the maximum grade he can justify because he feels for the kids and the challenges of online schooling.  That said, any changes to grade inflation would only really impact the last two semesters of grades, so that mutes the overall impact.  Also, some teachers/schools aren't inflating grades.  Some students are seriously struggling to stay engaged or motivated in online classes and some have a really hard time learning or performing that way.  I have seen some really bright students with some rough grades since last April.  If this is you, 1) reach out to your teacher and try to get help.  Let them know what's going on and ask for assistance / extra credit assignments / anything else they can do for you.  And 2) if you haven't already applied to college, talk to your guidance counselor to explain your struggles and see if they can advocate for you in their LOR.  That's way better than a Covid supplement that tries to excuse your poor performance.\n\n**3)  Almost every EC has been impacted.**  I'm seeing this across the board with my clients, and we've had to get creative to come up with ways they can continue pursuing their passions and interests.  It's been challenging to find ways students can stay involved and/or \"get credit\" for cancelled stuff they were planning to do.  It's important to note that things like helping your family still counts (like it always has, and frankly even more so now).  [Here's a post I wrote 7 months ago about Covid and college admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hiqsnt/covid_and_college_admissions_whats_changed_and/) and lot of this hasn't changed much since.  I will say that some of the \"grace\" or \"leniency\" that admissions offices hoped to have seems to have been offset by the increased volume of applications.\n\n**4)  Every college I'm aware of has moved their interviews online.**  This has been relatively seamless and I would say the impact is minor, except that most colleges have been able to do more interviews than in the past because of it.  But there are way more applicants too, so it sort of balances out.  I have heard from several interviewers that they are being asked to do way more interviews.\n\n**5)  Visits are much harder for both students and colleges and that just sucks all the way around.**  I still recommend doing whatever you can to research colleges as well as demonstrating interest (because that still matters to some schools).  Reach out to some current students, go to a virtual tour / info session, etc.\n\n**6)  Applications definitely look different.**  Lots of cancelled internships/activities.  Lots of mediocre replacements/adaptations.  Lots of trite or veiled complaining about Covid impacts.  Lots of strong students who might have had poor test scores making the most of test optional policies and shooting their shot.  I've seen some anecdotal evidence that admissions officers are comparing pre and post Covid performance (across academics, ECs, Awards, etc) to assess the impact and try to ascertain what a student's true nature / capabilities are.  In general, all star students still look like all stars.\n\n**7)  Overall, essays are still essays and most of them are still sort of meh.  Competitive admissions is still competitive or more so.**  Below are a few more places to get some insight on this:\n\n- Episodes 3 and 12 of the Inside The Yale Admissions Office podcast talk about Covid, the impact, and their process:  https://admissions.yale.edu/podcast\n\n- Several posts on the MIT Admissions blog (which is excellent by the way) about Covid, etc:  https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/\n\n- Same with the Georgia Tech Admissions blog.  See this post, as well as several others:  https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2021/01/21/same-kind-of-different/  \n\n- Same with the Tulane Admissions blog.  As with MIT, I'm linking the whole blog because several of the articles are on point:  http://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/\n\n- Our own /u/UVADeanJ commented on this thread too, but her blog is also excellent.  http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/  She's got articles about how Covid has impacted GPAs, SAT & test optionality, their evaluation process, and more.",

              "text": "Mostly that's just tough luck.  Admissions officers try to evaluate things in context, but that's probably too nuanced for them to pick up on.\n\nGrade deflation doesn't tend to help people.  It mostly just satisfies the Get-Off-My-Lawn boomers who feel like education is supposed to be some kind of trial by fire.  Everyone else sort of looks at it and says, \"huh, I guess this student isn't as good.\"  Many of them will pick up on known trends but smaller movements are often ignored. \n As an example, JHU is known for being tough and actively fighting grade inflation.  When their grads apply to graduate schools or jobs, their grades are viewed in context and they are given the benefit of the doubt.  But if you go to a school that has grade inflation, and happen to have a professor who decides it's his personal mission to \"bring back the good ole days\" when half the class failed, you're mostly just out of luck.  Employers and grad schools aren't going to know that this particular professor is so draconian with grading, so they will see your hard-earned C and dock you for it.  They just don't zoom in that closely to see that one grade has an explanation.\n\nSo how do you manage this?  It's really hard, but the best strategy is to talk to your guidance counselor.  Give them hard stats, e.g. the average grade in that class, the number of students getting As, etc.  Explain what's going on and ask them to mention the extra course rigor in their LOR.  That's about the only way to effectively communicate that the teacher was just a miserable stick in the mud about grades.  If you try to explain yourself, you sound like you're just making excuses and there's no way to confirm what you're saying.  If your counselor explains it, then a qualified, professional adult is advocating on your behalf.  It's far more credible and impactful.",

I tended to punt on the past year all together. Like the application itself was due on 3/16/20. I made a pretty clear executive decision early on to avoid most forms of \"Unfortunately I have to wait until after COVID to finish\" or whatever. It was more like a baseball game that a reporter can only write up until the 7th inning because it ran late and can you believe we used to read newspapers?\n\nHonestly, I tried to make applications seem as \"business as usual\" as humanly possible unless there was a damn good reason not to. My hope is an app that pretends nothing has changed might be more palatable to an AO who's every bit as sick of this shit as everyone else is.",

This year, we have gone test optional and made the essay optional as well. Applicants pretty much have to send in the application form and a high school transcript. It\u2019s super easy to apply. \n\nThe COVID essays have been few and far between. A lot of people choose to write about why they\u2019re applying for their particular program, an experience they dealt with at their first job, or their parents divorce. \n\nWe\u2019re seeing about the same numbers as last year, but I have seen people applying sooner than they usually do. I miss the travel and the in person events. When I host a high school visit on Zoom, everyone looks so dead and it\u2019s really hard to engage people. I\u2019m very extroverted so when I don\u2019t get verbal or visual feedback, it can be difficult to get through an info session.",

That shifts the focus more onto HS grades, which were obviously already closely evaluated. But I do think that\u2019s probably leading to higher transcript scrutiny for every applicant because that\u2019s been a big point of training for us this year.\n\nMany people spend paragraphs explaining how they had to become test optional after multiple attempts to sit at SATs or ACTs that were canceled. I don\u2019t need that. I see \u201cTest Optional\u201d and I move on. Colleges aren\u2019t lying when they say it doesn\u2019t hurt you.\n\nEssays actually feel more self-reflective, unless it\u2019s in my head. Some people have spent a lot of time alone or wrestling with their thoughts. Not a comment on the overall quality here, but an observation.\n\nCOVID statements are common and usually discuss things I expect. But there are also many who have lost entire sections of their families to this pandemic. Usually I see those major impacts in a guidance counselor\u2019s letter about someone\u2019s situation. There is trauma from this past year and it can make reading essays especially emotional.\n\nAnd yes, the increase in volume. We are reading. And reading. And reading. We wish each other a \u201chappy weekend, if you can get it\u201d on Fridays. But colleges have adjusted by setting release timelines that give themselves a chance to thoughtfully make it through the process. Everything will be read. You all TRULY will be okay.",
