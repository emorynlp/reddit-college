  "text": "I've submitted my commonapp application to UW Madison which includes my school report thay my counselor did. The school report has my transcript in it. Do I need to submit my transcript to the college privately through parchment as well or do they only need the school report? I'm not sure because for ACT scores you have to submit them privately but idk if it's the same for high school grades.",
