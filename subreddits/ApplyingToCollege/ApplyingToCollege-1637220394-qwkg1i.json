  "text": "Hi all - just wanted to get some advice on my GPA. For context, I\u2019m looking to go into cs in a top school (Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, Stanford, CMU etc.). As of right now (junior) I have a 4.5 weighted and a 3.96 unweighted and 1580 sat. How important will my unweighted be overall, as I\u2019m currently not doing very well in AP Lang? I\u2019m kinda stressing a lot and wondering how bad this will be overall if I get a B.",
