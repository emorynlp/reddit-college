  "text": "I\u2019m a good student, I do all my school work and homework on time. Not as impressive as everyone here, but I\u2019ve always been in advanced, honors, and AP\u2014 I\u2019ve never got below an B in any class since I\u2019ve started high school. All this to say,, I do actually try in this course. Objectively, it\u2019s probably something just about everyone here could do with their eyes closed, but this fucking pre-calc class is the bane on my pitiful existence at this point. I\u2019m a senior, is the fourth year of math really important?? I know I don\u2019t need it, but how bad does it look if I say fuck it in November? I\u2019m not going for any real high-stakes colleges with a 30% or lower acceptance rates so I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m passing with a 69 at the moment (with each test grade coming back lower then the previous) whilst all my other classes are high 90\u2019s so is it worth the hit my gpa is taking at this point?? My gpa is kinda shit, mainly cause your girl has never finished out a school year before having to go on home bound for health and mental reasons, so should I cut my losses or suck it up. ( Also, scholarships are really needed so that is another thing to be considered) Any advice??? \nFrom, \nsomeone on the brink of a nervous breakdown",
