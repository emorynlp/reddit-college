Furthermore, upon looking at people on the editorial board, it lists prof Omer ozturk at ohio state. prof ozturk does not list this journal on his website or CV, so safe to say it's a predatory journal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would stay away from anything without a scopus score or that's not on elsevier/ taylor&francis or some other well-regarded publisher",
