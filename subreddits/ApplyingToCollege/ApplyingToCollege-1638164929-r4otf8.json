      "text": "My nephew was a student there. He dropped out for mental health reasons not related to York.\n\nIt is a decent school, not terrible as some would have you believe. The reason it gets such a bad rap is prpbably because the admin, staff, and professors there tend to go on strike a lot. Not an insane amount, but just enough to make York stand out as being a school that is closed for strikes often, leaving the students without access to their education. It's really not that often. It just causes a lot of grief when it happens. It's a running joke whether they're striking again this year or not. \n\nIt's a fine school for premed. I would probably not do any grad work there, just because the location isn't super great for access to the city. but as an undergrad it's a good school.",
