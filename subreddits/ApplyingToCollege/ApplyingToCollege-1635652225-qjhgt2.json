  "text": "One of the schools i\u2019m applying to requires 4 years of math, but I only have 3. I am very much willing to take calculus I online. It\u2019s self paced so I can finish it within 4 weeks, plenty of time before I apply. My counselor advised me that it will not be put on my senior transcript. I imagine this is bad news. If it doesn\u2019t go on there, how can I show the school that I have 4 years of math, not 3? Is there any way to get around this issue? \nThanks",
