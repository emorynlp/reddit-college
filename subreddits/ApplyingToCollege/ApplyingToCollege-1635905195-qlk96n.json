  "text": "I have 3 top choices (I have a pretty good chance at getting into all 3). One is in state and in a large city (Ohio State), next is out of state in a decent size city (UT Knox), and the third is out of state in a college town (Clemson). What do we think? Pros and cons of big cities or small cities ? Anyone who already attends a school in a big city or college town, or something like UTK getting the best of both worlds?",

Run the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a *need-based* financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nSome public universities offer *merit scholarships* to out-of-state students. (You would need to explore the university's scholarship website)",

It's a lot different than UC-Berkeley, NYU, UW-Seattle, UCLA, etc..\n\nThat being said, it's a great deal in-state, Columbus is a nice town and Ohio State has a better football team than UT or Clemson.",
