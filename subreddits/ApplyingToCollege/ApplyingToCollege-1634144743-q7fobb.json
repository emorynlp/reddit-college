  "text": "Many colleges i am applying to indicate that I must fill out a Self-Reported Academic Record in order to complete my application checklist even though I have already submitted on my common app.\n\nIt asks mostly questions about my grades etc which I am unable to submit either because I don't have them or we never did tests those certain years \n\nIs it absolutely necessary for internationals? If so can I just leave the grades blank or will that be bad? \n\nThanks",
