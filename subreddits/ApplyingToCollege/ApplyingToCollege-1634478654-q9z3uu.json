  "title:": "Choose my last College (MechEng)",
  "text": "I'm applying to 9 colleges, and since I'm paying for my own app fees, I'm willing to make it an even 10. Only problem is, I have no idea where to apply. \n\n**Major:** Mechanical Engineering\n\n**ACT:** 35 (33M, 35S, 34E, 36R)\n\n**UW GPA:** 3.75\n\n**W GPA:** 4.4\n\n**EC's:** People have told me that I've a pretty stacked list\n\nPres of a large Eng club (75+ members)\n\nBoard Member on a local STEM outreach group where I volunteered 3 years prior\n\nVarsity Sailing\n\nLifeguard\n\nMachining Aide @ local manufacturing + engineering firm\n\nExternship/Internship @ Cisco\n\nLead Mech Eng on our AIVD team\n\nCouple Hackathons + 3D modeling competitions\n\n\\*\\*\\* I don't know if this counts, but I made a maker portfolio in the form of a pdf that I'll submit as supplemental material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want my last college to be another \"fuck it\" college (you know, the type of college where you know your chances are minimal so you just say \"fuck it\" and give'em your money anyway).\n\nI'd prefer for it to be private, as OOS schools are expensive af and I already have OOS safeties. Location wise, somewhere on the coast (East or West doesn't matter) as I want to sail in college. Besides that, go nuts with the reccs.\n\nI'll list what colleges I'm already applying to in the comments as I think this post will be deleted if I name them here.",
