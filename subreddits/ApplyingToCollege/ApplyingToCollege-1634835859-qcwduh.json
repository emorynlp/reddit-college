  "text": "I keep thinking about how painful it would be if I get into like uc merced and and uc Irvine (which i don\u2019t want to go to + don\u2019t have major but i\u2019m still applying bc parents). I would think *hm maybe if I didn\u2019t apply to Irvine i could\u2019ve gotten into ucsd or Davis*\n\n I know this makes absolutely no sense and I\u2019m being dumb but I can\u2019t help it.",
