  "title:": "I forgot to add most of my awards onto my college application",
  "text": "I already submitted my application (there's 2 hours until the actual deadline). I filled out 2 awards and was going to fill out the other 8 later but forgot to (most of the other 8 awards are from the same club. idk if that makes it any worse). When I was reviewing my application,  I missed that there were only two awards since I was only checking if there weren't any blank sections. Do I have anything I can do now or do I just sit back and pray for the best. Thanks!",
