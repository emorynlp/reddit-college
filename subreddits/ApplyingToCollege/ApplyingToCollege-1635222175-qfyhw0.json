  "text": "So I have been stressing a lot on what ethnicity to put on my college application. My parents are from Egypt which is in Africa..so I believe that it's reasonable to put myself as African American on common app, and put my background from Africa. But my school consoler is telling me that I am technically considered white and to put myself as white and background as Middle East. Do you think it's fine to put myself as African American? My main concern is that If colleges consider this lying than they will throw my whole application out and I am screwed.",

      "text": "Your counselor is right. On the applications, North Africans are considered White. Ofc, you can specify, so you\u2019re not just White. You\u2019re \u201cWhite-North African\u201d on the application. They\u2019ll see the difference. \n\nAfrican American is not just being a Black American, it\u2019s an entire culture and identity. They have their own issues, culture, food, etc. \n\nMy dad is Black and has American citizenship, but he isn\u2019t African American. His culture is Afro-Caribbean. \n\nWhile both groups come from slaves, our culture still varies greatly (most Dominican food and dance has its roots in the Congo).\n\nIt is  lying if you put African American, and aren\u2019t African American. If you were raised here and identify with African American culture, know about it, etc, sure, go for it. I can\u2019t exactly police you on that. \n\nBut also if you\u2019re not Black, and neither are your parents, it will definitely be considered a lie.\n\nI turned out fair like my mom but my dad is very obviously and undeniably a Black man. Someone could tell me I\u2019m not Black/half-Black and I just bring my dad. My dad is my proof.",

But African American is generally the ethnic term used to describe ADOS (black people in america descended from slaves), so you really should not select it.
