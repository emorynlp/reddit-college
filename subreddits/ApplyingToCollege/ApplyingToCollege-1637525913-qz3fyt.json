  "title:": "Extreme regret about taking gap year",
  "text": "I took a gap year before I attend college in September 2022 and holy shit I'm having so many regrets! I cannot get a voluenteer position at all as all hospitals and clinics are not accepting due to the pandemic,Im stuck at a fast food store with terrible management and a terrible schedule 50hours week with the shifts just being all over the place so it hard to have a life or really plan anything at all. I am incredibly depressed and angry right now and really want to go back to school so bad I have been reading books and getting certificates for my resume (medical terminology,food handlers) to try and keep my mind sharp but I don't think I can do 8 more months of this I miss my friend's (my coworkers are all older and it hard to relate to a 30 year old when your 18 tbh) and I am super bored and feel behind my peer's. I have done some travelling but even then I really do not have enough money for it as I'm saving up for college probably the only good thing about my gap year I have saved up 5 figures during it so far.\n\nIs anyone else feeling the same way I am right now who is taking a gap year ? I'm sure plenty of people had fun but is anyone else having a bad time?",

      "text": "I\u2019m not taking a gap year but you need a hug and some comfort and I\u2019m here to try and give some of it to you. Please sit down, even for a minute. Breathe a bit. You are an incredible human being. Your feelings are valid and acknowledged and seen. I see you. A stranger thousands of miles away, but still I see you and everything that\u2019s making its way  through your life at the moment. You deserve peace, calm and rest. But sometimes we do need the little hard moments like this when you just want to quit and say \u201cto h*ll with it\u201d. I don\u2019t know the initial reason for which you took a gap year, but you are allowed to feel this way and rest. If you have to take a week off work, do so. Say you\u2019re sick. Mental health and you should always come first. It\u2019s a shame that hospitals and clinics aren\u2019t taking any volunteers. Try to email some of them or broad your ratio. I\u2019m sure someone somewhere will have a positive response for you. Meanwhile, hang tight champ.",

Thank you for your comment however it helped me out a lot :)",

Like all my friends from high school \u201care\u201d.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve got to remember and even what you may need to remember is that everyone moves at their own pace and things come to you on their time not yours. Being young is difficult in that we feel the urge to progress but it never seems to be at the pace we like and we start comparing our unique situation to everyone else\u2019s life that we really have little idea about what their situation really is. \n\nYou seem to be doing well and taking strides toward your goals. You\u2019re not sitting idly being lazy. You\u2019re gaining ground and developing yourself the best you can.\n\nYou may not see the results on your time but if you continue your hard work there WILL be results and there WILL be doors opening. Just do your best to be ready. \n\nYou got this! Patience!",

      "text": "I expected my gap year, taken last year, to be boring (I needed to work for the $ for college too). I didn\u2019t anticipate seeing my peers starting college without me to be so uncomfortable mentally (felt like I was missing out, kept questioning my choice etc) but that passed as the year progressed. \n\nI decided to twist the situation back around, figuring if I\u2018m paying such a high \u2018price\u2019 to take a gap year (\u2018missing out\u2019), then I was going to make absolute sure I got maximum \u2018value\u2019 out of it \u2014 I worked the equivalent of two jobs (making sure to advance my skills in one) and started getting ahead by (unofficially) studying for the two weeder subjects I\u2019d be facing the next year in college. \n\nI did other stuff too like deep searches for reviews/data on the exact college courses I\u2019d be taking (\u201ctake organic chem in spring quarter, not winter\u201c, \u201cprepare for grade deflation in this class\u201d etc). I looked at general advice too (\u201cdon\u2019t overload first quarter\u201d). I made an entire four year plan, including where I\u2019d be applying for volunteer work, summer reasearch etc. I looked into grad school requirements. \n\nWhen college finally started, I hit the ground running. I have absolutely no regrets. I\u2019m in a much better place financially and every week I\u2019m reminded how valuable the information I dug up on my college/major is (as I witness people doing things they later regret). The prep work I did in two heavy subjects is already paying off. Bonus, this head start in my heaviest subject this quarter has allowed free time to make new friends and have fun (better to have fun as a frosh than as a gap year student). \n\nIn others words, this will pass but make the most of it. Keep applying for better jobs. If you have the disposition, try starting a small online business or do some other useful skill development (could be random like learning a language or personal finance or a set of psych skills like reducing stress/emotional resilience/conflict resolution). If appropriate in your situation, look to how to better prepare for your college/possible grad school.\n\nI\u2019ll also note that things you work hard for in life can taste a little sweeter when you get your first bite. I suspect I appreciate college a little more than the average student here does (who didn\u2019t have to fight financially for it). I\u2019m grateful to be here, finally, and eager to make the most of it. My gap year wasn\u2019t fun (no travel), but I made it worth it and I suspect it will pay dividends for many years to come.",
