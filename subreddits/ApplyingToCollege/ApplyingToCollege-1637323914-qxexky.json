  "text": "Just curious, do most schools accept self-reported AP scores? As opposed to SATs, some schools allow self-report but others require official results (assuming you are sending scores despite test-optional). When applying, would I need to send my AP Scores to the colleges I have applied to, or only when I have matriculated to X school?\nThanks!",
