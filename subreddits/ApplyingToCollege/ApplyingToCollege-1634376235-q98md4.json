  "text": "I got a 1480 on the August SAT. I registered for the October SAT but my center's got postponed and I just gave the makeup test today. I think I can get like 1550-1570 but I'm not gonna get the score till after my early deadlines. I was wondering how do AOs look at SAT scores. Will they superscore between my August scores and the score I'm gonna send them later on? Does one score of 1570 look better than someone who sent two scores of 1570 and 1480? Also how do you report scores after the deadline? \nIk some of these questions seem a bit unnecessary but I just want some clarity:')",

      "text": "Most colleges superscore/consider your highest scores in each section.\n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app or portal, for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.",
