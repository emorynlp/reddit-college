Also, they are VERY generous with financial aid.\n\nIf you are wondering the admission standards, check U.S. News' college profile, it falls in the same range with Bates college and Colorado College.",

              "text": ">acceptance is like 30%\n\nIt's like 10 for international students, 28% is overall; including athlete recruits.\n\nI know this because the cases of Colgate and Oberlin. While they have around 25 and 40 in overall admission rate, but they state for international students, it's around 8 and 15.\n\nBeing an international students put you in competitve pools at top colleges regardless where you apply, kinda sucks but u know, it is what it is.\n\nI wish you all the best and good luck!",

              "text": "Another thing I didn't mention is that Denison shares an internship programs with Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and Yale in Denver, and lots of CS-related position available each summer. It's highly competitive but I heard if you cold get into one of those positions, the pay is really really great. If you don't want to do internship, Denison pays 4k as stipend and cover all the cost of living to students who choose to stay on campus for summer research. Last, if you got an internship that's unpaid, Denison will compensate you up to 5k. \n\n\\*All numbers are in USD.",
