  "text": "They don't list the courses offered by the school. Not the course level either even though they make a big deal of letting students take courses of the next year. For courses I didn't continue, they put a dash. Understandable. But then they put the dash for courses NOT OFFERED in higher grades. I took AP Biology from grade 9 to 11, each year taking the next year's course (so 10th grade bio in grade 9, 11th grade bio in grade 10 (there's no 9th grade bio)), but it's all under Biology. Not AP Biology or IGCSE Biology, just Biology. I'm planning on doing CS and they don't have Computing in grade 11 and 12. But I have the dash for grade 11 Computing. We have a parallel Computer Science course that's offered for 2 years (9 and 10 IGCSE, 11 and 12 AP ). I took IGCSE in grade 9 and AP in 11, so there's a dash in between even though there's nothing that could be put there.\n\nI'll stop ranting",
