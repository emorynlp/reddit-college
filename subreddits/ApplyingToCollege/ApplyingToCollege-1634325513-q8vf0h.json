  "text": "I am trying to decide between Duke and Georgia Tech. I am 70% sure I want to major in engineering, in which Georgia Tech has a better program. Engineering is much more of a popular major at Georgia Tech as well.I also enjoyed the campus and dorms of Georgia Tech more, and it is far closer to my home. However, Duke has a much better reputation, and I didn't *dis*like the campus. Thoughts?",
