  "title:": "ED to Duke or (semi restricted) EA to Georgetown SFS?",
  "text": "I am interested in Political Science and Public Policy as well as in law and am torn between applying to Georgetown School of Foreign Service where I would major in International Political Economy, or Duke, where I would Double major in Public policy and get the Politics Philosophy and Economics Certificate. I honestly do not know which school I prefer. I would give Duke the edge, but at Georgetown I could intern in DC during the school year. I cannot decide whether or not to ED to Duke as doing so would significantly improve my chances of getting in because, according to my college counselor, Duke only really cares about legacy if you ED. Georgetown does not allow you to EA if you are EDing elsewhere. If I don\u2019t ED to Duke, I would probably EA to Georgetown or restrictive EA to a reach school. My chances of being accepted into Duke regular decision are significantly lower than with ED, so it would become a reach to get in. I have the grades, scores ECs, etc that make Georgetown a match for rd, so I could still get in if I don\u2019t get in ED from Duke. Should I ED to Duke even if I am not 100% sure that it is my absolute top choice, or should I risk throwing away my chances of getting into it even though I am 100% sure that it is one of my top 2 choices.",

              "text": "Good stats.ECs help imo,unique. Didn\u2019t understand the Duke ED statement. Are u saying your legacy for Duke? If so,I\u2019d say legacy plus ED is a great combo. If not legacy,ED is helpful vs RD.\n\nI\u2019d simply think hard which is your best fit and not think about acceptance which may be a less than optimal situation if your going to wonder about being at another school of your first choice. \n\nThe application cycles these last years favor early applications,I\u2019d simply ED,or EA to first choice. \nLastly I\u2019m not sure you have stats for RD Gtown,at least it\u2019s more uncertain these last few years unfortunately. Many students had similar strategy,denied ED then denied RD due to competitiveness. \n\nI\u2019d look on college confidential RD acceptances,denials fo4 last year to see any trends that may give you a better idea of chances.GL. Tough decision only bc ea is highly selective and no guarantees even with  early applicant pool.",
