  "text": "For about 2 years I volunteered as a tutor in some student-run non-profit tutoring organization. I tutored international students in English. However, I was terminated from the organization for being inactive. I really want to put this on my activities list but I'm worried that colleges may try to verify this and then learn that I was terminated. Should I still put it?",
