  "text": "Hello Everyone, \n\nJust a little background...I am an active duty military officer and I will be leaving the service this coming spring. I graduated undergrad back in 2016 before I joined and earned a B.S. in Economics. Over the past few years, I realized that I really enjoy reading and writing and it may be something that I want to pursue as a career. \n\nLeaving the military after four years of service, I now have access to full G.I. Bill benefits and want to start looking into creative writing programs, however, I am beginning to find that most universities will not take me knowing that I already have a bachelors degree. \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way that I might get around this or if there are universities that will look past the education that I already have?\n\nTIF!",
