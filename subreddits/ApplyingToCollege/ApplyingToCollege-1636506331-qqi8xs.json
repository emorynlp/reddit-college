  "text": "The question is \"Tell us about a time you changed your mind about something and why?\" and I wanted to discuss how I changed my opinion on worker cooperatives and socialism.  Would this be too political and could I address a political topic in a way that is appropriate?",

      "text": "You can take my advice however you like, but if the essay relates the topic, i.e. your political theme, back to a core value (resourceful, initiator, etc), then it should be fine. Idk if you will apply to Rice, but many people talk about politics or religion or racial tensions, which are all on thin ice, for the community essay. Most of these people just tie it back to a core value and that's basically the point. Just don't write a diss track for socialists or comment negatively about your coworker and how his gf left him cause he was bald or sm lol. But hopefully that helps",

Soviet Afghanistan was under the imperialist and revisionist USSR so no shit it wouldn\u2019t achieve much. As for Venezuela, (which I don\u2019t even consider socialist) sanctions and multiple coup attempts have caused the country to become unstable. And if Maduro was such a comical villain as he\u2019s portrayed, why hasn\u2019t he killed or at the very least imprisoned Guaido?\n\nMy main point is that anti-authoritarianism is counterproductive because authority is needed in order for a socialist country to exist in a capitalist dominated world. Outside imperialist forces and reactionaries within the country need to be fought and suppressed if you plan to have a stable socialist country.",
