          "text": "The UC's pretty much only offer Junior level transfers though I think UC Davis allows sophomore level transfers for like 2 programs.\n\nMy biggest tip for transferring (not UC specific but helpful) is to plan ahead. Can't emphasize this enough. I didn't consider transferring until after I had started going to college and it was kind of difficult trying to research transfer requirements while going to class and clubs. Transfer requirements are usually GPA, classes, and academic standing.\n\nThe GPA requirement is just a minimum required amount and I'd suggest you keep your GPA higher than that. One example is UIUC CS. They require a 3.0 but the average GPA for an admitted transfer student for CS was a 3.89. I'm not trying to discourage you but yeah it can be hard. (This is CS in Engineering btw, not CS+X or Math+CS/Stats+CS)\n\nThe academic standing requirement is a pretty strict requirement but also pretty simple. Basically requires you to have completed a certain number of credit hours before the term you want to start. So for sophomore transfers, the required number of credit hours would be 30 semester hours and 45 quarter hours. For junior level transfer it would 60 semester hours and 90 quarter hours.\n\nThe class requirement is what requires your planning. This is because for certain programs, you will be required to complete a sequence of classes and unless you know this before you start, it can be hard to incorporate this sequence into your schedule. Planning out your classes is also necessary to make sure you aren't overwhelming yourself with classes. Sometimes taking certain classes together will mean you will have no time to do anything else.\n\nI wish you the best of luck for transferring to Berkeley!",

          "text": "hey man, yeah i can give some insight. so after i got rejected as a freshman, i realized i needed to finesse my way in somehow. instead of going to a csu, i went to a ccc and i changed my major from psychology (lost interest anyway so it was lucky) to english (because english majors have a comparatively higher acceptance rate at ucb and ucla). however at the same time, i was premed; i'm not anymore because depression, anxiety, and a very busy schedule outside of school make STEM harder than it already is, so i withdrew from some courses this semester but not until some math classes fucked up my gpa and brought it down to a 3.42. however, since literally all of my subpar grades were in STEM and i had a 4.0 in my english classes anyway, i assume the AO reviewing my application probably... disregarded my poor grades? not sure tbh, but it definitely helped that i was applying as an english major and not a bio major or something. biggest tip: keep your grades UP for your major prep courses. i also didn't finish one of my major prep courses but i explained to berkeley the situation with that in my berkeley update in january and i guess my explanation was sufficient.\n\nanyway! probably the strongest part of my application were my ECs and personal statements. my ECs involved all things english\u2014tutoring, peer editing, creative writing with a sizable online following, starting a club and then holding a leadership position in said club (this is probably what helped me most in getting in), and some random art stuff that i had local recognition for. i also made sure to list every award and honor i could think of including scholarships and deans list, and i also listed all the school programs im a part of (think stuff like EOPS and MESA) to show i took advantage of resources offered to me. if your school has UCB TAP, *find your TAP coordinator and talk to them*. i also did UCLA TAP and listed the courses i took for honors credit on my application.\n\nas for my personal statements, i catered everything to me being a diligent student of english. i basically talked about how writing and editing and communicating are the things that i feel i'm best at and how i used those skills to better my community and my peers, whether it be through editing papers or tutoring high school students or starting a club. probably this is the way to go when writing your essays\u2014cater everything to how you and your experiences that are associated with your major have helped both yourself and people around you. your major and your prep for it should be the focus. also address shortcomings in your application if you can (where it's relevant) and how you improved later; don't just list hardships. this might seem like an obvious point but i edited quite a few people's essays during this process and you'd be surprised how often this happens on accident!\n\ni also filled out the additional comments section (550 words) COMPLETELY. i had some legitimate reasons for why i didn't preform as well academically as i could've so i explained everything surrounding those circumstances. do not expect the UCs to assume that you have something legitimate to explain poor grades\u2014they don't know anything. did you start medication one semester and couldn't focus? put that. did you take care of a sick relative for half the year? put that (and also put it in your ECs). tell them everything about you that could put your accomplishments and hurdles into context so they can review you completely as an applicant and understand reasons behind dips in your academic record if they are present. i had a lot of \"extenuating circumstances\" to explain some of my dips in my academic performance because, when i had more time to focus on school and homework, i was getting a 4.0. essentially, don't be scared to tell them stuff that happened.\n\ni think that's about it... oh i'm also in state, low income, and first gen, and i finished my IGETC. best part is that you don't have to take the SAT again ;)",

I got a fat reject from UIUC when I applied for freshman admission and they didn't even have the balls to give me a nice rejection letter.

I live in Southern California and will have to move there and I am so nervous it\u2019s crazy. Also I read in one of your responses that you are an English major? I\u2019m an English major too and I was curious to know what you are planning to do with your degree? Sorry for all the questions I\u2019m a little scared about what\u2019s to come so any response would help out. Anyway I hope you excel in your studies!",
