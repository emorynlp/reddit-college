  "text": "Hi y\u2019all. I\u2019m 16 and trying to consider what I want to do for my future. I mostly either want to pursue family medicine or nursing. \n\nHere\u2019s my pros for each: \n\nMedicine: \n- more in depth study of human health \n- ability to create a treatment plan for patients, rather than solely administering their treatment \n- lower level of physical labour compared to nursing \n- higher salary \n\nNursing: \n- less school\n- great work life balance, you don\u2019t bring your work home with you\n- more freedom with the hours you work (being able to choose to work 9-5 5x a week, or 3x 12 hour shifts visa versa)\n- high quality connection with patients \n- less uni debt \n\nCons: \n\nMedicine: \n- med school debt \n- Unpredictable work days \n- Tougher entry requirements for med school \n- Constantly stressing whether you\u2019ve made the right decision or not \n- High possibility for burn out \n\nNursing: \n- lower salary \n- Less in depth study \n- constantly following orders of others higher up than you \n- Being considered \u201clesser\u201d than other professionals in healthcare (doctors, surgeons, etc)\n- Less fulfilling (but also less draining) \n\n\nBasically, I\u2019d love to be a doctor as it\u2019d be more rewarding than being a nurse, but the aspects of the job which make it rewarding also cause more stress. \n\n(E.g: Medicine involves more in depth study, which I want, but more student debt. Medicine will let me have more involvement with the treatment of my patients, but at the potential expense of my well-being due to a higher level of responsibility.) \n\nMedicine and Nursing both have their advantages and drawbacks. Medicine offers way more emotional fulfilment, but at the same time, nursing is way less draining. \n\nWhat would y\u2019all recommend?",

      "text": "Child of a doctor and nurse here. Truly evaluate your financial situation as well as your tolerance of school, as those are your main two barriers for medicine. If you\u2019re able to get scholarships for undergrad or have parental funding, medicine would be fine. However, getting into medschool isn\u2019t a super easy feat, if you\u2019re smart/hardworking and enjoy or don\u2019t mind school, medicine is better. \n\nI think you have a fallacy of nursing being easier. It\u2019s not, it has a lot more physical labor and takes a higher toll on you especially in the long run. Physician schedules are actually pretty light, especially in fam medicine you can normally set your own schedule and you\u2019re not ever on call. And even now, there\u2019s a shift in medicine culture, my dad who used to work pretty much 24/7 in the worst hour speciality now works only half the days of the year and only a quarter of those days he works are actually bad hours. \n\nAnother consideration for you could be a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner, both are in between. They lack the hard manual labor of nursing and award you some of the doctor privileges but require less schooling (but also give you a lower salary).",

      "text": "Well my mom was actually a nurse by background but went into healthcare leadership (she does stuff about preventing errors in care at a system level but tbh I don\u2019t know much more)\n\nIf you are looking to climb the healthcare ladder behind the scenes (so no patient involvement if that\u2019s a bit much for you), going into medicine would be better (or so my mom always tells me) because a lot of the higher-up positions require you to have an MD/DO\n\nThat being said, if you are simply looking for stability and the opportunity to be flexible in your career, I\u2019d go for nursing. If you really want to go into medicine tho you should def do that because it\u2019s also quite flexible (but the issue is that there\u2019s that long continuous schooling).\n\nMy personal philosophy behind why I\u2019d go into medicine is because I would probably pursue a PhD anyways even if I got another degree so really the length of med school+residency+fellowship would only be around 3 more years (of which I\u2019m paid for a bit) and which ends with a very, very well-paying position with a lot more personal satisfaction than if I chose another path and still got a PhD",
