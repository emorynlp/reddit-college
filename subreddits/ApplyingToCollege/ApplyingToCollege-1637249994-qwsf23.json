  "text": "I submitted to YoungArts. This is my first time and I'm so nervous. I emailed them and apparently all finalists were notified on Tuesday (Nov 16). The rest of the winners will be notified in early December (until Dec 9). I am so nervous. I'm not a finalist, but I want to get merit. Obviously, the chances are slim, but I am still holding out hope.\n\nDoes anyone have any more information about notification? Did anyone get finalist? Did anyone else submit in the poetry category?",

Maybe they meant that *most* finalists were announced?\n\nHere is how the exchange went:\n\n>Hello!\r  \n\r  \nThis might be a dumb question, but when will all the poetry finalists most likely be announced? \r  \n\r  \nThank you and have a super good day!!!\n\nReply:\n\n>Finalists winners were notified on Tuesday, all winners will be notified beginning of Dec.\n\nThey could have been more specific. For example, I only asked about poetry finalists, but they just said finalists, implying that all were already announced.\n\nWhat do you make of this? I have sent a follow-up email asking if this extends to all categories, and I'll tell you how that goes.\n\nBut you are absolutely right. They usually stagger notifications. If you hear anything/get any more info, please tell me :)",

I've been trying for half an hour and I need to start my homework.\n\nTry emailing them yourself if you need proof! ([apply@youngarts.org](mailto:apply@youngarts.org)) Or, you could give me an alt-gmail account and I could send the screenshot there (just make sure the gmail account doesn't have your name attached to it...) Also, does reddit have direct messaging? I could send it there if reddit supports images on direct messages. I'm just not sure how to attach it on this thread.",
