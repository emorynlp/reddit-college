  "text": "1. Can I fix a typo I noticed, or would that be dishonest?\n\n2. We had to \u201canalyze the parts of our essays\u201d by highlighting sentences and then writing a paragraph below the actual essay (unrelated to the essay\u2019s content). Can I remove my highlighting and the extra paragraph?\n\nJust as a side note, this paper was written, submitted, and graded totally electronically and I still have access to the copy.\n\nSorry for all the posts. I\u2019m currently working on my Princeton app and none of my other apps require anything like this :/",
