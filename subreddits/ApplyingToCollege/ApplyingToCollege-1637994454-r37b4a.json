  "title:": "Does reading and studying a niche subject count as an extracurricular activity? (UC Applications specifically)",
  "text": "This might be a dumb question, but bear with me \u2014 over quarantine, I started getting into a lot of leftist feminist theory, and I spent a decent amount of time reading works and excerpts from people like Simone de Beauvoir, Andrea Dworkin, Audre Lorde, etc. I know reading in of itself isn't really a hobby, but could research into a specific subject out of sheer personal curiosity be considered a hobby? (This was completely unrelated to any classes I was taking in school, in case it's not obvious.) The problem is, I didn't really do anything with this interest besides read and theorize, so it's not that substantial, but I do feel like it's played a somewhat significant role in shaping me into the person I've become over the past couple of years. Also, I know generally you're not supposed to mention politics in college applications, but feminism is generally associated more with social change than political change, no? I feel like this personal interest reveals a lot about me as a person, although maybe it would be better to incorporate this into the personal inquiry questions instead. I don't know, any suggestions?",
