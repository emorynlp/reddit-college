  "text": "How are you guys picking schools?\n\nI\u2019m asking from an average standpoint I have a 25 on the ACT and I\u2019m from Arkansas w/ a 3.8 with some EC\u2019s so I\u2019m not your highest contender nor am I aiming for you ivys or hidden ivys I\u2019m looking for a good school for me not in the deep south preferably\u2026\u2026 I just feel lost no applications filled out at all!!! I\u2019ve written my Common App so far. Any advice on how to pick schools or just some school suggestions? I don\u2019t have any location preferences just nowhere boring so I guess lively. Also I\u2019m thinking about maybe doing PT or nutrition but I\u2019m really not sure at all so I\u2019m looking for a school that\u2019s well rounded whoever I do decide on what to do as a career.",
