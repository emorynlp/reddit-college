  "text": "Help \ud83d\ude2d I'm applying to my dream school through RD (Nov 1, weird I know), and I plan to take the December SAT on Dec 4. Unfortunately the cut-off date for sending test scores to that uni is Dec 15, and I checked the date and apparently Dec 17 is when it is electronically available to students. I'm wondering if I use that little section in the SAT to send scores to this college for free, can I still make it? Or is it too late... \ud83d\ude2c Please help I'm on the brink of insanity",
