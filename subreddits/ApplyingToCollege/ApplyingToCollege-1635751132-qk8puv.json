  "text": "I'm applying EA and one of my recommenders has not submitted their letter yet. I have seen other people online say they can submit it later, and according to [this post](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ra-deadline-q-a/),\n>Your recommendations do not need to be in our office by January 1. They can arrive and be processed well after this date and you will still be fine.\n\nHowever, on the [deadlines website](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/deadlines-requirements/), it says that two recommendations need to be submitted by November 1. Does anyone know if it can be accepted after the deadline? And if so, how long is the grace period? Thanks!",
