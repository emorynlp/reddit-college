We\u2019ve decided to move some of the ea apps to rd and that\u2019s totally cool. You could do that and take some pressure off \n\nOther hints \n\nLet your brain settle. Stay away from screens. Take long walks. Take long showers. Anything to get your brain a rest so all those thoughts simmering around in there can do their thing \n\nUse the most dangerous writing app. Give yourself a time limit. This works well for those who like pressure \n\nDictate your essay into your phone. Then listen and  write it down. \n\nYou can do this. This is the toughest part of the admissions journey \u2014 but you can make it through",
