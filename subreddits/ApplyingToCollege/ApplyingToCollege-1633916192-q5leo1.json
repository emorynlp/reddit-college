  "text": "\"we allow applicants to use the score choice feature of the SAT and accept only the highest composite score of the ACT, but we encourage the submission of all test scores.\"\n\nI feel like it means that you could submit your highest overall SAT score from one day (although encouraged to submit all), but I wanted to check if I'm misunderstanding.
