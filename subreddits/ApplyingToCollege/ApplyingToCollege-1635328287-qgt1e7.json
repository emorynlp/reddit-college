  "text": " Completely my fault for submitting an application at two in the morning. I\u2019m not even sure how to go about this, but I made two minor errors on my application. I said my parent was a permanent resident of California since birth when they are not. I also selected that I wasn\u2019t apart of a educational program when I was. I didn\u2019t know that it went by a different name. Now I can\u2019t make any changes AT ALL. I\u2019m stressed. What do I do? These are my safeties. Did I ruin my chances of going to college? I\u2019ve only submitted to one school so far.",

      "text": "The only way to edit those things is to email the admissions offices for each school directly. Should you? Well it won\u2019t hurt you if you do. They don\u2019t admit based on impressions. This is their advice: https://help.liaisonedu.com/Cal_State_Apply_Applicant_Help_Center/Starting_Your_Cal_State_Apply_Application/1_Getting_Started_with_Your_Cal_State_Application/00_Cal_State_Apply_Quick_Start_Guide\n\nThe only CSU that I know uses something like participated in Avid as part of their admissions is Cal Poly, but things did change with test scores out the window. See if you can find out how admissions scores are calculated for the schools you applied to. For example this is SJSU: https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/index.php. If the schools you applied to don\u2019t give points for that educational program, just leave it be.\n\nHas your parent been a California resident for the past 3 years? If so that\u2019s not worth fixing either. If your parent is not a resident or has only been a resident for a year, that might affect your residency status. Is your other parent not a resident? If so, better contact your campuses.if it\u2019s not going to change your residency I doubt it\u2019s a big deal but you can contact the campus just so you don\u2019t stress over it. \n\nI think you might be able to edit it for schools you havent submitted to the way you can the common app but I\u2019m not sure. You could try contacting their tech support team if you plan to apply to a few more. \n\nYou should definitely check the points needed for your major on that SJSU site and calculate yours. If you fall above the range there then these schools are probably ok as safeties. But it can be easier for some people to get into a UC in a major like CS or engineering because they consider life stories and extracurriculars. Every spring there are shocked students who were so sure SDSU was a safety that get rejected and don\u2019t understand why people with lower stats got in. It\u2019s all about the major you put down. \n\nPersonally I think the better safety is community college because with the TAG program you can have guaranteed admission to Davis, UCSB or UCI in most majors. And if you have a bunch of AP or dual enrollment credits you can transfer after just a year. https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html\nTransfer admission saves you some money and acceptance rates are a bit higher. https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major",
