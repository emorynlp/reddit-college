  "text": "Okay so I\u2019m deciding where to transfer to from my community college. I finished my 2 years in 1 year and I\u2019m deciding where to transfer for graphic design. Cal Poly has a graphic design concentration under art and design and Davis just has a design major. I really don\u2019t know what to choose/which is better for the major. Davis is closer and Cal Poly is farther but Cal Poly is cheaper than Davis. But to me it all really depends on which is better for my major. If anyone knows anything about this/has personal experience about either of these schools please let me know! Thanks!",
