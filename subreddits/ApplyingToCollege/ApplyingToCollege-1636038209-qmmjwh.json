  "text": " Hi everyone!! I'm having some difficulties making a college list of 8-10 schools that I could actually see myself going to. I was hoping someone could provide some insight :)\n\n**Location:** I'd really love to be in a suburban town... nothing too rural though. I have schools like NYU and BU on my list just because they're good schools, but realistically I don't really like the city life and can't really see myself in a city for college.  \n**Region:** Anywhere on the east coast! I will have family located in NY and FL by the time I'm in college, so anywhere in between would be ideal  \n**Major:** Probably biology to go the premed track\n**Curriculum:** I'm fine with taking general ed requirements. I definitely want a school that offers language classes because the end goal is to be fluent in spanish, mandarin, and ASL one day :)  \n**Size:** Medium sized (5,000-20,000) probably... not too picky about the size  \n**Costs:** I need financial aid... not sure what percentage I need though.\n\nSchools I\u2019m applying to: Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, NYU, BU, and possibly Emory\n\nStats\n\n97.21UW/104.9W  \n1520 SAT (submitting)\n\nPersonal Info:  \nNY Resident  \nAsian Female  \nFirst-Gen",

Do make sure you have a variety of matches and safeties on your list.\n\nRoughly, you are looking for mid-size suburban, or at least a defined campus near urban? Here is a smattering of mid-size universities in settings you might want to explore to see if you might find their settings suitable, some in/near/outside smaller cities.
