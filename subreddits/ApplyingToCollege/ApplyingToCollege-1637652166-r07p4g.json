  "text": "hi guys! i\u2019m actually in class 11th (India) - so the second last year of my school and I already have a lot of quality ECs. however, my academics are a bit hampered since forever because of my course load and lack of motivation lol.\ni want to score amazingly in my last year, since scoring amazingly is also my backup for a few admissions to Indian colleges anyway. \nI wanted someone to go through my ECs and tell me if they\u2019re enough or if they\u2019ve reached a point where I needn\u2019t do ECs anymore, because I have a lot of things left for my college apps still (standardised testing, ofc the essays, a lil publish work etc) \ncould someone help me out w that?\nthanks!!",
