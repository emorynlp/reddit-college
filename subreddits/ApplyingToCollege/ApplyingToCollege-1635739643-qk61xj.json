  "text": "Before the pandemic, I was incredibly ambitious and wanted to move far away from home. Since then I've become chronically ill (partly because of stress due to the pandemic). While I have a good application/ec's on the whole, I still feel like I have no potential the way I am right now. I don't even know if I can feel well on a daily basis to be able to enjoy anything.\n\nIf anyone's feeling the way I do right now (for any reason), I really wish you the best, and hope things get better for you\n\nAnyway, I should stop being dramatic and get back to my early applications. Good luck, everyone\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude2dguys you don't need to recommend therapy to me, I'm well aware I have issues\n\nalso a significant amount of you are downvoting this, which is not what i need rn LMAO",
