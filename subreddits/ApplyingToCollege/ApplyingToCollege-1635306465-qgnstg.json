What is important is that you thank them a lot and remind them that you love them and that you appreciate their help in working towards your dreams.",

ACT prep that I did last year (only 8 hours total; just targeted math practice) was like $450 total. This whole process is quite expensive.",

      "text": "Imo I don\u2019t think any couple should have children unless they are willing to prepare u for success. A part of that is being able to fund ur college apps and paying partially for college. I think that if a couple has a child they should be able to meet the child halfway on public school tuition(15k*4=60k). This means that they should be able to save 60k over 18 years for ur college education. Now making ur parents pay for like MIT is ridiculous cuz that\u2019s 80k a year. But they should be able to at least go 50-50 for instate tuition",
