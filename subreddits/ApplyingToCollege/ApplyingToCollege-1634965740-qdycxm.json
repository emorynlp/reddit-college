      "text": "What Southeast Asian state? I think you have to look at your country's regional context. \n\nHere in Singapore, grassroots/low-level local politics and being grounded isn't that important. We have a weird system where most of our prominent politicians are parachuted in from the top ranks of the civil service, military, police and private sector (big law, consultancy, C-Suite) with little or zero prior political exposure. These people usually hail from prestigious US/UK universities (Ivies, Oxbridge, London etc.), especially for the government sectors since they were most probably state-funded overseas scholars. For instance, almost none of our senior civil servants (Permanent Secretaries), military generals and top police commissioners graduated from a Singaporean university.\n\nSo open up google and start looking into the background of your nation's politicians and other accomplished persons in the public service/legal sphere. See where they attended school and how they rose to power. You don't have to blindly emulate them of course but it gives you a sense of what sort of pathways are \"better\" and what traits are selected for.",
