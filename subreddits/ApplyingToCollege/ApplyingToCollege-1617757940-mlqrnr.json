  "title:": "Why You Should Hate Every Ivy League School",
  "text": "First of all, congratulations to all of those who were admitted to their dream schools today! You guys deserved it, and don\u2019t let anyone or anything tell you otherwise. This post is strictly for those who didn\u2019t get into an Ivy, which probably represents 95% of this sub.\n\nPrinceton - Grade deflation, depression, and stress. Think high school was hard? Princeton is 50x harder. And don\u2019t forget their \u201ceating clubs\u201d, which literally promote elitism and segregation based on income. Their mascot is a tiger, too. Tiger parents love the Princeton Tigers for a reason. Trust me, you lucked out by getting rejected. After all, who wants to go to a school named after a royal position?? Princes are the worst.\n\nHarvard - Ben Shapiro went here. Mark \u201cgreedy\u201d Zuckerberg went here. Harvard is the school of rich kids who got everything they wanted from their parents. Sure, they\u2019re a great school, but the element of superiority there is toxic. Everyone thinks that they\u2019re the next Einstein, the next FDR, the next Obama. They make fun of great schools like BU and BC, even though they\u2019re honestly worse than MIT. They\u2019re also referred to as the Harvard Crimson. A color. How boring.\n\nColumbia - Isn\u2019t that the capital of South Carolina? Wait, never mind. It\u2019s an overrated school in the heart of New York City. New York is in a pretty bad spot right now, in case you haven\u2019t heard. Cuomo is kinda a POS (understatement of the year). Their \u201ccore education\u201d is BS tbh. They\u2019re a bootleg Barnard in my book. \n\nYale - Racist. They\u2019re a racist school full of racist kids. Is that where you want to be?! Yale is literally one letter away from becoming Fail (ok fine, not really, but you get the point). Connecticut is not a great state to live in (pretty dry imo), and New Haven is a pretty suspect city. Not to mention the fact that their soccer coach played a critical role in the Rick Singer scandal. \n\nUPenn - Trump went there. Do I have to say anything else? It\u2019s the dollar store version of Penn State, but with depression and unending stress. And did you read that effortless rejection letter?\n\nDartmouth - They have a horrible culture of sexual assault and misogyny. They\u2019re also located in the middle of nowhere. Where tf is New Hampshire? The West Coast? The South? \n\nBrown - Named after a color. Imagine if a school was named Red, Orange, or Purple. Would you even consider attending that school? Definitely not. So why is Brown any different? The school is located in Rhode Island, which is the definition of irrelevant. Sure, the school is known for grade inflation, but that just seems like a BS method of getting their students into med school without the same amount of hard work and dedication.\n\nCornell - Is Cornell even an Ivy League at this point? I\u2019m starting to think that Ithaca College is better. Cornell, otherwise referred to as SUNY Ithaca, is known for their stressful environment, toxic atmosphere, and grade deflation. They\u2019re also located in upper New York, and they\u2019re constantly mocked as an Ivy League school that should probably give up their spot to Duke or UC Hicago. Overall, the school does not give off good vibes when they\u2019re named after corn. What are they even good at?\n\nIn conclusion, the Ivies are overrated. You know it\u2019s bad when the entire league is named after the last name of a famous porn star. Or a terrible plant. Time to appreciate the other schools that aren\u2019t part of this controversial, elitist \u201cleague\u201d that never wins anything in sports. They didn\u2019t even have a team in March Madness. \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\n\nLet\u2019s prove these schools wrong. Time to change the world ourselves. We don\u2019t need them.",

They're good people not *because* they went to an Ivy, but rather *in spite* of it.\n\nWhich harkens back to the point about Harvard: most of the super successful people dropped out. They weren't successful because they went to Harvard, rather they got into Harvard because they were successful.",
