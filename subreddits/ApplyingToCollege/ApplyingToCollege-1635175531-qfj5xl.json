  "text": "Everything starts last week: I texted & called my best friend that I want to commit suicide and do a school shooting before I commit suicide as a joke. It wasn't my first time talking about it and she knows that I make jokes about it when I'm depressed. (I only make these kinds of jokes in front of her) I know this can't be an excuse for what I've done, but I was having a really hard time taking a bunch of exams, dealing with racism, and looking at the sexual assault going on in our school. That friend was the only friend that I could talk to about those issues that I've been facing, but then I got too emotional that I talked about something very serious.\n\nI KNOW that this is a really serious issue in the states and in other countries, but I'm from an Asian country where guns are forbidden and students make lots of jokes about suicide and school terrorism due to their academic stress. I did that also to my best friend, and you know what happened. She first told her parents about what I said and their parents sent a screenshot of my text to the principal.\n\nThis morning, I was waiting for the school bus and the principal came in front of my house, saying that I can't come to school today. He explained the text he saw and for a moment I was so confused since I didn't know if this would become a serious issue till then.\n\nI came back home, my parents were surprised, and they were very disappointed (obviously). Hopefully, I don't get suspended from school or get records that would affect my college app process. Just for context, I'm a class president of our school, and I always straight As. I'm that Asian girl who teachers love and always pay attention to in class.\n\nI'm so scared watching my whole entire life being ruined and the hard works I put in being destroyed by this stupid mistake. I'm also really disappointed with my best friend... I trusted her so much. She has been my friend since middle school and knows that I'm not a person who would actually do that.\n\nAnyways I'm not going to school today (idk if this is part of a suspension). I just hope everything to go fine and nothing affects my school report and college app process.\n\nI just don't know what to do now.",

I think you are going to have a hard time \u201cexplaining this away\u201d in the additional information section. Your best option is to talk with your school and ask for this to not go on your record. In exchange, agree to get some mental health counseling. Best of luck. \ud83d\udc95",

Then they\u2019re more likely to try and understand where you were coming from and that it was not meant to be taken seriously. Best of luck!",

Maybe get counselling on how to deal with your depression. You could try talking about this in your Additional info section maybe. It's still worth a shot. Maybe get help from a school counselor or somebody on the best way to word it. I wish you the best of luck!",
