      "text": "At UCLA and Berkeley (and maybe others as well) they accept everyone in the college of Letters and Science as undeclared. Some majors are pretty easy to declare, but the most popular are \u201ccapped\u201d - there\u2019s only space and funding for 440 public health majors at Berkeley for example, and there aren\u2019t enough spots for all the wannabe communications majors at UCLA. So you can label yourself (pre) computer science at Berkeley but in order to officially become a CS major you have to go through a selection process. (Berkeley CS is earning a B+ in 3 intro classes though that may be changing; UCLA communications/Berkeley PH are an application with essays and success in intro courses required\u2026.) So the (pre) is to indicate you would be on that path but not officially admitted to the major yet. \n\nThe cruelest (pre) is maybe CSULB pre-nursing. That involves taking a heavy science course load of nursing prerequisites. Then at the end of the sophomore year they open the spots up to anyone inside or outside the university and they choose based on GPA in those classes plus a standardized test. Since the grading at LB in those weeder classes is harsher than in CC not many of the spots go to the CSULB pre-nursing students and they have to find a new major to graduate in or transfer.",
