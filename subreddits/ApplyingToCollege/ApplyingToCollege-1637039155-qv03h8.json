You'd invest the $2M in an extremely risk-averse vehicle, accept the modest returns, then use it to supplement whatever income you earn doing {some work you find rewarding}.\n\nThe problem would be if there is *no such work* that doesn't require a degree.  Or, possibly, if you could find equally-rewarding work with a degree with compensation that exceeds the amount you earn yearly from investing the $2M.\n\nOne other bonus to taking the $2M is that you have a \"floor\" income-wise.  If you lose your job or can't work for whatever reason, or if you just want to take six months off to clear your head, your \"floor\" is considerably higher than zero.",
