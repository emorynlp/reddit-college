  "text": "Earlier today I got a referral in a poor lapse of judgement where in gym 7th period I ran around freshman and sophomores essentially orbiting them while we were running warm-up laps to be funny. The counselor saw this and claimed it could be perceived as an act of harassment and so she gave me a referral.\n\nThis is my second referral year to date and I'm my #1 option right now is U of I for mechanical engineering as it's in state. My counselor was trying to tell me that referrals seriously impact rescinding decisions. Assuming I get in and they see 2 referrals after requesting this year's transcripts, as I will not get any more this year, could my offer be rescinded? \n\nI've heard that stats are taken into account so for context, I'm at a 4.7, 1550+ SAT, very good ECs, and taking diffyQ/linear algebra at a local cc. \n\nThis is not a shit post and I'm genuinely very concerned as to what can possibly happen.",

I get I wasn't making the most mature choice but I quite literally was just running in circles around sophomores while we were running laps and I couldn't contain my laughter as I was trying to explain to my mom when she made me call her how I was getting a referral for \"orbiting sophomores\"",

Is there any sophomore that you know can speak out for you? If it is my case, I will contact the school management and express my concern and get ready to get some legal action if this referral is too trivial. I don\u2019t know of the exact situation.  But If it is a unfair treatment, do let your parents know. They can step in and do it in the \u201cadult way\u201d.",

      "text": "I mean, to be honest, I'm unsure. Colleges do ask about your disciplinary history but only regarding serious infractions. Have you been suspended? Have you cheated or been otherwise academically dishonest? Drugs or other contraband? If not then I don't think minor infractions will affect you too badly. If they do end up showing up on your transcripts you could take the time in the additional info section to explain but I genuinely think that it depends on the severity of the infraction. I wouldn't think smaller things like messing around would ruin your chances completely. (Though it seems like an odd thing to give a referral for ngl. It's a little petty.) If you do decide to discuss it in the additional section, it may be good to talk (briefly) about what happened why it happened and how you've changed.",
