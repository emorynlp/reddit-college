  "text": "Planning to apply REA to Stanford\n\nBeyond the school counsellor and teacher recommendations, I have two additional recommendations from my TaeKwonDo coach and a peer. Stanford only allows one extra recommendation; I feel both are quite good, so have they shown a preference in the type of recommendation?\n\n\nI did write about taekwondo in my activities and talk about it a little in my essays, does this factor affect things?",
