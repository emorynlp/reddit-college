That\u2019s not what you\u2019re competing for; it\u2019s really for the reputation of the school and the opportunities they offer; MIT is going to have the same opportunities as GATech, but for a third or less of the people. That means you have easier access. But trust me, if there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way, and you absolutely don\u2019t have to attend MIT to get an MIT grade experience; you just have to be diligent about it. I went to a T200 school over a T30 school just because I thought I had better opportunities there. Don\u2019t let the rankings fool you.",
