      "text": "PSA, acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate. (From your list, the acceptance rate for internationals to Stanford would be under 2%.)\n\nSome colleges admit by major. CS is among the most competitive majors.\n\nPublic universities offer no *need-based* financial aid to international students and charge them more. (From your list, the following are public: U Mich, UIUC, Ga Tech, UT Austin, Texas A&M.) For internationals needing financial aid, money is the most important factor in the search.\n\nSee also r/IntltoUSA",

You are also an international so that makes it a bit harder. I would say look for a couple more safeties with solid computer science programs just to make sure you have a solid mix of schools.\n\nAlso, are you applying for financial aid?",
