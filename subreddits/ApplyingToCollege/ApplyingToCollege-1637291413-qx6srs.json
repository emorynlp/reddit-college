  "text": "My parents think i'm destined for Harvard or something and basically want me to just apply to t20 schools. My friends think that's ridiculous and it's basically impossible I'd get into schools like that. \n\nIm a junior in the US. I have a 3.9 unweighted GPA and a 4.33 weighted GPA. I think if I actually study for it I'll do well on the SAT since I'm pretty neato at standardized tests. I got a 1340 on the PSAT sophomore year with zero studying idrk how indicative that is of a good SAT score. I play a sport both in and outside of school that I am quite competitive in and am hoping to get recruited or something for. I also do a club sport in school and I participate in another club. Then that's pretty much it lmao I haven't done much that's notable. I pretty much spend most of my time on unnamed sport or just being way cooler than all you nERDS.\n\nSo yeah can someone give me an idea of what type of schools are safeties vs. targets vs. reaches for me? I know it's not that easy since I've still got a whole year to go through before admissions but can y'all give me some sense pls\n\nSorry if this counts as a chance-me post. I just want like a general idea so I'm less completely freaking lost on what schools i could get into",

      "text": "If you are good enough at your sport to compete at a collegiate level, top schools are definitely in reach.\n\nSchools like Pitt or Minnesota are probably reasonable for safeties, especially if you apply early in the admissions cycle.  Nice thing about rolling admissions is you will know pretty early if you got in.",

I\u2019m taking one ap (i can only really take an ap for science this year since my school has no ap history classes or ap English classes for junior year and same thing with math unless I\u2019d skipped a year). Then 3 honors and then my social studies class which doesn\u2019t have an honors option. Next year I\u2019m considering taking two ap sciences. In that case I might not have social studies classes. Then ap french, calc (idk which yet), and English",
