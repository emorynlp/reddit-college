  "text": "I never counted the hours per week and weeks per year so do i just put a random number? we\u2019re we supposed to count? I wasn\u2019t super active in clubs so i was gonna put like 1 hr per week and 5 weeks per year. Like some got cut off due to covid and then idk what to put for my clubs this year? like how am i supposed to know how many weeks i\u2019m gonna have for 12th grade? (i didn\u2019t have any ECs last year because i did school online and most of the kids in my school needed up going back in person)",
