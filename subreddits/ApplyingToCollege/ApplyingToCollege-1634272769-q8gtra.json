  "title:": "High GPA but low class rank?",
  "text": "I go to a semi-competitive public magnet school (1300 avg SAT, \\~40 national merit finalists each year), and I have 1 B total so my GPA is 3.98 UW/4.76 W. At a normal school this would be fine, but the issue is my school hyperinflates grades, so my class rank (based on UW GPA) is around 80-90/330, or just about the top 25%. I'm taking the most rigorous possible courseload (13 APs, plus several more post-APs and magnet classes) as well, but my rank based on WGPA is not much better as nearly everyone else in my school also takes the most rigorous possible courseload.\n\nHowever, looking at the common data sets from top colleges, being within the top 10% of the class is basically a hard requirement for getting into a T10, which really worries me as I'm far outside of that. The only saving grace is that 1) my B was in an AP humanities class while I'm a STEM major, and 2) class rank is unofficial for my school and doesn't get reported to colleges (but I'm sure colleges could tell when they see my 3.98 in sea of 4.0s from my school).\n\nSo I'm just wondering, how would colleges view an application like mine, where I have a high GPA and rigorous courseload but horrendous class rank? People usually say that 1 B doesn't make a difference, but what about in extremely exceptional cases such as mine?",

From freshman through junior year I have AP Calc BC, AP Stat, AP CS A, AP Physics C, AP Lang, AP Econ, APUSH, and AP Gov; in senior year I'm taking AP Bio, AP Chem, AP Lit, and WHAP. So far I've gotten a 5 on Calc BC, CS A, and Chinese, and 4 on Gov and USH. I'm aiming for T10s. I won't say my state for the sake of privacy.",
