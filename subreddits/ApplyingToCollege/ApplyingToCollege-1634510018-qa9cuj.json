  "text": "Basically the title. My teacher wrote a letter of recommendation that is 170 words long. I don\u2019t live in the US, and where I live LORs are not usually asked for college applications, so teachers are not much familiar with LORs\u2026 \nWhat my teacher wrote is nice imo, I mean it is not much specific, but I wouldn\u2019t say it is general. It\u2019s a like in the middle between general and specific, maybe tending a bit more towards general.  \nDo you think that the words are too few? \nWill this be a problem?",
