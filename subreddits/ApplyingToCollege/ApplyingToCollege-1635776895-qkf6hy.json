  "text": "Hi guys. Yesterday I sent my SAT scores to three schools (standard, not rushed), and one of the applications are due today for EA. I know I should've asked this earlier. Will I be fine, or am I screwed? I heard from one of my friends that as long as you self-report your scores, it's okay if you send your scores as late as I did, a day before the deadline (yesterday), because they use your official scores to just verify your self-report. Is he correct on this?\n\nIf you guys need more context, just lemme know. Thanks for the help!",
