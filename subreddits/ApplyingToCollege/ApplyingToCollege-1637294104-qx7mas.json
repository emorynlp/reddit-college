  "title:": "I hate that admissions forces you to be someone you are not to make it",
  "text": "I am a troll, a memlord, an edgelord, a silly and neurotic individual who likes to crack many immature jokes, and yet, I have to have extracurricular activities that force you to be a mature person, teacher relationships where you cannot be yourself if you are undesirable (i am very neurotic about my grades but am forced to hide it) etc.\n\nI simply cannot be a teen. I do NOT want to start a club, but under pressure of my family, I did it and due to my irresponsibility got in trouble with the administration of not responding to their emails regarding my club. I don't care about any of this shit tbh. Im have achieved a lot but it is wearing me down that this is not who I am.\n\nI am an asian male who wants to do neuroengineering and law. But I can't show that, because top colleges hate people like me due to my stem nature. So I have to focus on environment stuff.\n\nTop colleges want \"community leaders\" and people who change the world. If you can't be that, you have to be excellent at something. Now I want to change the world. But I also want to maintain my grades. I am also very stupid.\n\nI am achieving more than the average top student at my school, and yet I am struggling at tests and am as atupid as the average kid.\n\nTLDR: I have to be a kid that is forced to be extremely mature to not piss off the people I am working with to make myself look like a community leader. I am too stupid to be good at anything. In reality, I like rap, hellcats, guns, all the nine yards. I am not a goody two shoes who likes classical music and reads environmental literature in his free time. But I HAVE to be this way. Or else I can just give up and try for berkeley. Its not nice to be a bay area asian male",

Depending on location, your state school should be fairly easy to get into without all these special ecs and activities. Community college is always a great option as well.\n\nThe thing is that in order to get into these insanely selective schools, you do need to be a special person. These are the best universities in the world, so they want the best students in the world. Some kids are naturally this special. They will put in the hours to start these clubs and donate their time because they are passionate about it. Others will force themselves to become this \u201cspecial kid\u201d, which is perfectly valid as well. Sure you love rap and hellcats which is great, but that\u2019s not particularly something that makes you deserving of a spot at one of the best universities in the world.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be super negative or anything, but the fact that you seem like you have to settle for Berkeley shows me that you don\u2019t already realize how good of a student you are. Berkeley is a top 20 college in the nation, the fact that you\u2019re even considering going to this school shows that you are academically an outlier. There are millions of people who don\u2019t even go to college and graduate high school with Cs and Ds which is perfectly fine, just realize that you yourself are already an outlier so don\u2019t feel the need to force yourself to be even more.",
