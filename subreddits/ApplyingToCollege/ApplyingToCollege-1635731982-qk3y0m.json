  "text": "My first SAT has a higher composite (1550) but has a lower math score (780).\n\nMy second SAT has a lower composite (1540) but has a higher math score (800).\n\nI want to go to computer science, so I'd assume that it's weighted more? UT Austin doesn't superscore, so I don't think there's any point in sending both.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nAlso I feel like I'm spamming this sub with questions lol\n\nEdit: SHITTTTT I FORGOT I HAD ALREADY SENT MY 1550. EVERYBODY TELLING ME TO SEND 1540 AND I JUST HAVE SUCH LARGE REGRET LMAO",
