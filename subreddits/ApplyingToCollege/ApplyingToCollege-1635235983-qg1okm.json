  "text": "1. As an international student, can I select the USDA income guidelines option? I've heard that I can from a LOT of people, but I just wanna make sure in case there's any complication.\n\n.........................................................................................\n\n2. If I can and I do the first point, will they still require a letter regarding it from my counselor?\n\n.........................................................................................\n\n3. If you've read my prev posts on this sub, you might be familiar with this one -_-. My bitch of an administrator says that he will send a letter stating my annual income but won't ask them to give a fee waiver in the letter cuz according to him I might be hiding millions of worth of property...\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11. Could this be enough for the unis? Could I mention anything about it in the additional information??\n\n.........................................................................................\n\n(Once again, your opinions will be invaluable u/prsehgal. And everyone else's too ofc.. help me \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude43)",
