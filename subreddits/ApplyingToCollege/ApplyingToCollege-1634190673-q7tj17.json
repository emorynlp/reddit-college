  "text": " \n\nThe prices we see on NPCs are quite close to full pay, even though we can't really pay the amount without emptying my parents' retirement accounts. \n\nBy submitting the FAFSA(and hence asking for need based aid), are my chances of being rejected higher? I read somewhere that they are.\n\nI'm applying to a lot of schools that I think I'm slightly overqualified for in the hopes of getting more aid than the NPC estimates I will. Because of my financial situation, submitting the FAFSA won't hurt my chances of getting the same, will it?",
