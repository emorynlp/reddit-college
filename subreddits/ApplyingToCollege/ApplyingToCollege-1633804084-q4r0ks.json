  "text": "I had an additional LOR that I received from someone who wasnt a teacher last year, and I think it would be a strong addition to my transfer application. I used it when I applied to schools as a senior, would it be okay to reuse it now, and send it to many of the same schools? thanks!",

      "text": "Have the writer \"refresh it.\" Your LOR needs are different as a transfer student than as a first-year. My professional advice, however, is to find a letter writer form your current school. If you need 3 letters, for example, it's fine to include this one as the third. But if you only get 2, 2 LORs from people who now you as a college student already would be better.",
