  "text": "My friends and I were helping to revise each others activity lists, and something that quite a few of my friends mentioned was that my activities are kinda scattered all over the place and that it could possibly hurt me come college admissions. I do have a pretty decent spike in the field I'm planning on majoring in (1st place in a national olympiad for it, research at a university pertaining to the field, and a really unique passion project also related to it), but as for my spike that's basically it. \n\nI have a lot of other high-commitment activities but they're really scattered across the board. I've been working about 25 hours a week for the past few years both in the summer and in the school year, I have a ton of achievements in a martial art, I have earnings in a major fighting game and founded the esports club at my school, and I have over 400 volunteer hours combined at a local community center, but these really aren't related in anyway. I don't want this to come off as braggy in anyway, I know my EC's are really good but I'm just concerned that the lack of focus will make it seem like I'm all over the place and hurt my chances.",
