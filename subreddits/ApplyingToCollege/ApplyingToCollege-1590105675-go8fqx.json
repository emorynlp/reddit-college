  "text": "UCs just dropped test requirements and will go test blind in a few years. Many schools including MIT and Caltech went subject test blind. This year's APs will carry almost no weight in admissions, even less than before. We are finally stepping in the right direction!\n\nEdit: I'm personally not against standardized tests. It's the only thing keeping people from bullshitting their way into top schools. I am just glad that the power is being taken off of collegeboard's hands.",

For instance, my school does not give a rat\u2019s arse about admissions and are focused on test scores because for some reason that\u2019s what their target future students\u2019 parents orgasm on. So they make the tests quite hard, beyond the syllabus sometimes, to \u2018prepare us\u2019. And they grade us lower for increased recognition of mistakes and stuff. But that makes our GPAs shit, even though we\u2019re ahead in terms of comparable numbers. We don\u2019t even use the general thresholds, the bounds are much higher on internal grades. So GPA isn\u2019t fully fair. Nothing is fully fair, but the standardised tests are more than anything else. Essays and ECs are so much worse in terms of what\u2019s fair.",

The same can't be done as easily with the ECs you presented.\n\nThat would also make admissions even more elitist. Sure, a rich student that can afford tutors will have an easier time scoring high on the SAT.

As someone who goes to a low income school with low income students, I can say for a fact that doing ECs are way easier for poor people to do than competing against rich boarding school kids on the SAT. Many of the application based EC opportunities are designed SPECIFICALLY for lower income students and URMs. I think that's way more objective than test scores because the lackluster education of low income schools isn't getting in the way.",

I suggest you read [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/the-activity-gap/384961/)  article by the atlantic in regards to a study conducted by brown. A quote from the article states \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Nicole wound up at this point. She grew up poor\u2014her father worked as a garbage collector, and her mother as a hotel maid and waitress\u2014in a neighborhood that was so dangerous she couldn\u2019t play outside. Instead of hiking trips and and soccer games, Nicole spent her afternoons watching TV at home alone. As a sophomore in high school, after spending her freshman year popping pills with other girls to fit in, Nicole joined the dance team. But that was short-lived: With uniforms and travel for competitions costing $800 annually, she had to quit after a year because her family couldn\u2019t afford it. She eventually wound up pregnant by a man who later became abusive.\u201d Its people like Nicole who this policy hurts. People like Nicole might not be able to buy those new dance clothes, but they can sure as hell go to the library and borrow a prep book, and go there for a few hours every day, or study at home. Of course it isn\u2019t perfect, but its a lot more feasible to try and study for the SAT than participants in extracurriculars, which are often very expensive. Thats my point.",

Your essays are a lot easier if you\u2019re rich, as you can just hire someone to essentially write them for you. While yes, I understand that the SAT is not perfect, and the CB doesn\u2019t make it any better, it provides a standardized, objective measure of ones college readiness. Of course the SAT favors rich people, like everything else, but its the one part of your application you can change, without being extremely privileged.\nEdit: objective",

It would make sense that this could be a response to having to overcome a more hostile climate.\n\nThere\u2019s another interesting theory that due to europe being wider as opposed to africa and the americas height, europeans were able to share agricultural techniques with more people on a similar latitude as them which could have allowed for more cultural sharing and information sharing across the continent. Not totally convinced by this but definitely a cool idea.\n\nOverall, the way I see it is a mix of chance combined with subtle advantages and disadvantages of different locations that led to people in certain regions developing better technology faster than other regions (through intermediate causal steps)",

They show no indication of ability as student but show other traits like passion and determination and leadership). GPA and SAT show commitment, drive, and most of all persistence. You can have one hit wonder ECs but colleges care that you have a high gpa (why? Well because they are admitting you as a four year student and they want you to have four years of committed effort also. Not to mention colleges are mostly academic institutions, so being smart and academically qualified is kind of a given.",

Most standardized tests aren\u2019t rocket science. They cover things you\u2019ve learned in school. A high GPA and low test scores from multiple applicants at the same school shows grade inflation. A low GPA and high test scores from applicants at another school shows rigor. Without standardization, there\u2019s no way to detect grade inflation. As for your point about being sick and nervous, that applies to test taking anywhere whether it\u2019s in college or testing for grad school. \n\nI agree with the part about not being able to afford taking tests multiple times or affording a tutor, but that\u2019s kind of the same for ECs. Not everyone has hours and hours to spend on ECs. Not everyone can afford to go on overnight trips with the debate team or take private sports lessons.",

The kids who actually get chosen for a second round are ones who have accomplished something significant. Just like with standardized testing, kids with resources and connections get research papers published, work with professors over the summer or get impressive internships. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that NOTHING in the application process is objective. From grades to tests to ECs, there\u2019s a problem with everything. At least standardized tests (whatever the UC decides to use) provide some basis for comparison.",

First of all, valedictorians who have good test scores and GPAs are always in the running. This shows that they can handle college level work and that they match up to their peers on the national scale. One of the reasons they get rejected from top schools is because their essays suck. If you\u2019re a valedictorian and you have decent ECs and essays, you\u2019ll probably make it into T20s. \n\nECs are not a reliable way to measure a student\u2019s success. The quality of ECs available varies wildly from coast to coast. I\u2019ve said this twice. The college admissions game favors people who have resources and connections. At least for the SAT, you have khan academy, free practice resources, online websites, and a chance to take the same test that millions of other kids are taking no matter where you are or what school you go to.",

This is the dumbest decision I've heard... ever.\n\nBy removing the only objective metric in admissions, you are allowing colleges to admit unqualified students or forcing colleges to admit only those who can afford to inflate other factors in admissions.\n\nThe other factors? Extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, essays, and GPA.\n\nGPA is so subjective that it's RIDICULOUS. First, inflation. And you think GPA isn't as easily bought? Tutoring someone in a class subject and doing their homework is 100x easier than tutoring someone into improving their standardized testing score. Everyone knows SAT/ACT scores can be improved through practice. Unless you resort to the tactics exposed in the admissions scandal, I believe the SAT/ACT is a good metric. The data from the investigation and the UC professors agree with me.\n\nLook, obviously the SAT/ACT is not perfect. Ideally, standardized testing would be given by the government and not some stupidly greedy \"nonprofit.\" HOWEVER, can you imagine college admissions without some sort of standardizing factor? What the UCs should do is work on creating their own standardized testing... WHILE KEEPING THE SAT/ACT FOR NOW.\n\nIt's not like those of weaker socioeconomic means are going to benefit from this either. Extracurriculars require MONEY. Sports, speech and debate, robotics, competitions of any kind... MONEY.\n\nYou know who DOES benefit from this \"equalizer\"?\n\nThe WEALTHY.\n\nThe WEALTHY have class tutors. The WEALTHY can pay for sports, mission trips, new organization start ups. The WEALTHY have college counselors to write up essays and the WEALTHY can create support for a kid to get in.\n\nI personally have taken the SAT and done relatively well because I practiced daily on Khan Academy.

I\u2019ve noticed a lot of middle class folk get crap about it, but frankly it\u2019s probably a much higher economic level that\u2019s doing all that. Tutoring is VERY EXPENSIVE, especially in high income areas. Think $100+ per hour. With Khan Academy available, there\u2019s not a very good need to spend all that money, unless a kid gets a bad score and wants to try again. Even in that case, if you do badly enough, tutoring isn\u2019t a silver bullet. People act like a rich kid with a 1100 is magically going to get a 1500 with a tutor. If there are stats to prove it, not just a one-time anecdote, I\u2019ll believe it, but otherwise, I think the benefits of paid tutoring are overblown.",

Only the wealthy know professors who they can \"research\" with. Only the wealthy can pay for rowing, golf, other expensive 'niche' sports. Only the wealthy can pay for their essays to be written for them. Only the wealthy get the money to be a 'founder of a non-profit\". EC is the most easily manipulated aspect of college apps, and it is the most likely to be affected socioeconomic differences. At the very least, SAT and AP has at least ways for poorer students to get ahead. Many schools and im pretty sure CB themselves have fee waivers so students can get free/discounted AP/SAT tests. There are plenty of free sources to help study like Khan Academy. It is a standardized aspect (unlike GPA and EC), so everyone is graded the same. It is as accurate as a test can be at determining someone's college readiness. Yes, wealthy kids have SAT tutoring, but they have tutoring for everything else anyways. At least SAT gave the rest of us some kind of chance. Also I just studied my ass off this year for my 6 APs, it just sucks to see my work and $720 (my months paycheck from work) to go to nothing",

Crazy, I know. This system **does** favor the rich because it is elitist. These top-tier schools are all elitist, in a sense, as prestige = elitism (in most cases). My college counselor treats getting into college as an entire class distinct from anything else. I have many deadlines, I meet with her live once a week, she wrote me a CV, got me letters of recommendation (really great ones) from people I have barely interacted with, and outlines what possibilities there are for me. She has access to my grades, she rereads all of my assignments and compares it to the rubric before I submit it.... she helps me on my \"independent projects\"...  it isn't fair.",

Shouldn\u2019t that weigh in the most for colleges when you\u2019re deciding the next leaders of the world? \n\nI spent all of last summer cramming for SAT and I got a decent score but I still regret it because I gave up an internship for it. I applied again this year and got in,  just to have it be cancelled by COVID. If colleges relied less on the SAT and ACT, I think they are more likely to find successful well-rounded students that can thrive on their resources than weighing their SATs and ACTs.",

It feels like everyone is a President of something, everyone has started a nonprofit, or published a book of poetry.

I would much rather concentrate on studying and spend my free time on a simple hobby without trying to impress anyone.  If your sole objection to SAT is that they favor the rich, I hate to break it to you, the ECs can be padded as well.  I know countless people who \"started tampon distribution company in African village,\" \"founded their own literary journal,\" \"curated art exhibition to benefit the homeless,\" etc., etc., all using their parents resources and support, not to mention getting prestigious internships through parents' connections.",

Wouldn't it make more sense for students to work together to make a change, instead of every student founding their seperate  \"non profit organisation.\" But noooo, colleges prefer \"initiative,\" and expect every person to show \"leader ship\" qualities.

If you\u2019re economically disadvantaged and get a 1400 that 1400 actually looks more impressive than a rich white suburban kid with a 1400 from a feeder school. I just think that numbers and one test should not determine whether someone could thrive in college or not. And yes, it is unrealistic to be so put together and EC\u2019s have gotten crazy and out of hand but Ivies and other T20\u2019s aren\u2019t just looking for people with national success stories. Schools are looking for people wirh genuine care and engagement in the community. I know people that have gotten into Ivies just for turning their hobby of baking into a charitable cause. They mentioned it during their interview and in essays. At some point when everyone is president of something, colleges will begin to look for things other than that. EC\u2019s is partly a measure of success but it also demonstrates your passion and the kind of person you are. \nMy school is science oriented and holds titles in science competitions. I\u2019m a humanities kid but that didn\u2019t stop me from finding places outside of school to get involved in. \nJust like colleges weigh in environment when they look at your SAT scores, when it comes to ECs they just wanna see you made what\u2019s best of what\u2019s most available to you.",

Shouldn\u2019t be a fixed major through college though. The truth is that nobody gives a fuck about your personality. Through UK, you cut out bs and it\u2019s about how motivated and interested and driven you are, through clear cut examples. No transcripts involved, your grade on standard IGCSE/GCSE/iB or whatever exams matter. It cuts out the scope for bullshit, which is much worse a problem.",
