  "text": "Hey! So, quick question. Like a lot of you, I\u2019ve been shotgunning a crap ton of universities and app fees and SAT/ACT reporting fees are def piling up. I\u2019m an international student, so I don\u2019t qualify for most fee waivers - and I\u2019m not poor enough to be eligible for a CommonApp fee waiver. I was wondering if y\u2019all knew about any universities that will give me an app fee waiver if I email them with an explanation and that I\u2019m applying for fin aid (privates). I\u2019m open to private and public unis.\n\nThanks for the read!",
