  "text": "I want to major in cs and I honestly like my common app essay and got them reviewed by cousins and family friends who go to t20s and they liked it too. But it\u2019s not specifically about my interest in cs and most of my supplements cover the \u201cwhy I want to do cs\u201d part effectively. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m applying to schools like northeastern and university of Maryland that do not have supplements. So will I be okay applying for the cs major without  mentioning interest in it in my common app essay which is the only one they will be evaluating? I have a couple of ECs related to cs .",
