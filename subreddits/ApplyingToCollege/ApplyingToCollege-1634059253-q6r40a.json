  "text": "I want to major in cs and I honestly like my common app essay and got them reviewed by cousins and family friends who go to t20s and they liked it too. But it\u2019s not specifically about my interest in cs and most of my supplements cover the \u201cwhy I want to do cs\u201d part effectively. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m applying to schools like northeastern and university of Maryland that do not have supplements. So will I be okay applying for the cs major without  mentioning interest in it in my common app essay which is the only one they will be evaluating? I have a couple of ECs related to cs .",

          "text": "Respectfully disagree.   \n\n\nYou're applying to college and t20s want to see that your passion for intellectual pursuits aligns with the mission of college and your goals.   \n\n\nFor example, you write about how you're a world-class figure skater and how that passion drives you and makes you the best version of yourself. Then why are you applying to college? Go pursue your passion for figure skating.\n\nHow is college suppose to help you achieve your goals? What are your goals?  \n\n\nBut NE and U of MD aren't that competitive so probably not important that your essay isn't about why you're going to college.  \n\n\nFor the \"why college\" essay, you should know that college extremely well and know what course fit into your future plan. You're spending 4 years and a lot of money, would you buy a house and not have all the amenities met your basic needs.  \n\n\nThe \"why your major\" essay, would be elaborate on what is so fascinating about your field and your future plans a bit more. Maturity in creating your plans (even though they may change) is part of what they are looking for.",
