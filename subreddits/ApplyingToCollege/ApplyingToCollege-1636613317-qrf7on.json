  "title:": "Need Urgent Help with Section in CSS Profile",
  "text": "Hi! First, thank you so much for electing to read my post and, hopefully, help me. So, I'm basically 99% done with the CSS Profile, but I'm having trouble filling out only *TWO* fields. By the way, my parents didn't have to pay taxes. You should know that our main source of income is a small businesses which my dad owns.\n\nUnder the Parent Income Details, in the Parent Non-filer tab, it's asking for many things, but only pertain to our financial situation. The first is my dad's income from work. When I click on its field, the yellow guiding box indicates I should report any earnings he received\u2014including from a self-employed business. The second question is net income from business or partnerships. Currently, I put the same figure in both of the fields. \n\nHere are my concerns:\n1- Am I mistaken for inputting the same amount of money in both fields even though they're asking for the same thing?\n2- Does the Profile/the institution receiving my app going to add ALL reported income in order to get a total income? In other words, will they combine the number in my dad's income from work field and number in net income from businesses or partnerships together? I am concerned cuz if that's the case, then our income would be doubled, which brings me to my next question.\n3- Should I only report the figure in one of those fields. If yes, then which?\n\nThank you for helping out! I highly appreciate it.",
