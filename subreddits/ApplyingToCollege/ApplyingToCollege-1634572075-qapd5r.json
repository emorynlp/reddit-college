  "text": "Aight look I\u2019ve been fighting back and forth with my head I\u2019ve been thinking about going to college to start a business I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s actually needed for that particular reason or if it would help me in other ways but also going to college would help me with my social life as well since it\u2019s lowkey dead and the only downside is that I have no way of paying it off or don\u2019t know anyone that would be willing to pay it off for me so I\u2019m on my own I just want a 2nd opinion like deep down I want to go to college but at the same time money is an issue nobody at my high school had a sit down talk with me about college so I\u2019m kinda dumb on all this I feel really bad right now ngl I just want my life to get better I am 19M almost 20 I was class of 2020 btw if that matters\n\nTLDR: Is college needed to start a business? Would it benefit me in other ways besides that? And also I have no way of paying it off\n\nMy bad if this is the wrong subreddit to post it on if there\u2019s any other subreddit right for this plz let me know",

Get some work experience, take a few community college classes on operations management and accounting and you should be good to go. And if you want go to a 4 year college later, you can transfer a lot of the credits",
