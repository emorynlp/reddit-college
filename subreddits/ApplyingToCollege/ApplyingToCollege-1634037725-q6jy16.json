      "text": "Hi! I just wanted to clarify since you are international: In the US, a portion of the taxes you pay go to the federal government and a portion goes to your own state government. Public unis are one of the things your state tax supports. In this system, the unis want to make sure that the families who have been paying to keep the school running are the ones who get to attend the school. It\u2019s also why out of state students pay more in tuition, and why you can\u2019t \u201cmove\u201d to the state a month before classes start and then try to get the in state tuition rate. Hope this helps!",
