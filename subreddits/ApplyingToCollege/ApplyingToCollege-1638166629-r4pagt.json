  "text": "hello! i'm currently a junior and i'm deciding between more volunteering hours or a part-time tutor/retail/barista job. assuming that both will be the same time commitment, which one should i choose?\n\ni've listed some of my reasoning below but i still can't choose. i'm not in a tight spot with money, but i spare cash on hand would be appreciated. i have satisfactory stats, but extremely lacking in ECs. i'm aiming for T20s and morally speaking it's a little shitty that i'll be basing my decision off of how it looks to colleges, but yeah...\n\npros for volunteering:  \n\\-community engagement  \n\\-more meaningful to colleges ig \n\ncons for volunteering:  \n\\-i don't have volunteer opportunities planned out yet  \n\\-would not be something major like thousands raised for charity\n\npros for work:  \n\\-$$$ (california min wage \ud83d\ude0d )  \n\\-real life experience  \n\\-already have a few offers\n\ncons for work:  \n\\-weak story to build around this EC  \n\\-might be temp/seasonal positions",

      "text": "Personally I\u2019d go for the part time job. Ideally something that won\u2019t be too short, even if it\u2019s temporary. Actual job experience is a good place to get a lot of experiences that can come in handy when writing essays and answering interview questions imo. If you\u2019re concerned about how colleges will see it, many top colleges will like seeing an actual job on your application. Spare money is a nice bonus and the fact that once you\u2019re in college, if you\u2019re interested in applying for on-campus jobs, I\u2019ve seen multiple (at least at my college) that require/strongly desire previous job experience of some sort, often related to customer service.",
