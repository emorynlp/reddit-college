  "text": "I\n\nScholarship decisions just came out for Baylor.  I didn\u2019t get the good ones and I just assumed it was because my friends that did apply have slightly better test scores and grades (I have better ecs) but one of my friends thought I might be being yield protected. I\u2019m hesitant to think that because what if I\u2019m not and I just didn\u2019t meet the scholarship criteria and end up being wildly disappointed with future college deicisions. I am spiraling.",

      "text": "yield protection doesnt usually happen for scholarships since the whole point of scholarships is to attract candidates who may have gone elsewhere \n\ndon't fret - just because you didn't get the ones you wanted doesn't mean youre a bad candidate, just means you didn't meet this specific scholarships reqs. like someone else said below, some scholarships are more based on pure stats, while others (Jefferson @ UVA, Robertson @ Duke/UNC) require a far more holistic approach. so you just weren't the right fit for this scholarship, but don't let it affect you too much.",
