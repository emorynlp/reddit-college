  "text": "(Sorry if this question has been asked before or if this is the wrong sub to post this, I'm new here) Long story short, I am applying to a college that wants me to officially report my SAT score and if they don't get it by the deadline (Nov 1), my application will be considered incomplete. I just requested to send my scores today (I already submitted my app a while ago). Will 6 days be enough for colleges to get it? Does it depend? Sorry if this is a dumb question",
