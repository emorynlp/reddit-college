  "title:": "PSA: It does not take weeks or even days to write a student rec.",
  "text": "On this sub, I see posts where students are upset (!?!) that a teacher submits a recommendation quickly. This is insane.  As someone who has written probably a hundred or so excellent recs for HS and college students, recommendations take me between 2 and 3 hours to write--and I'm a slow writer who then revises the rec the next day.\n\n The reason you ask a teacher weeks or months ahead for the rec is so they can schedule their time--since they have work, lives, and perhaps dozens of other recs to write. When you ask someone for a rec, they don't set aside their whole summer to craft it -- it's not their personal statement. \n\nWhen a teacher submits a rec quickly, go thank them -- don't complain about it on Reddit.",

          "text": "Yeah, we lose track, so I think it's nice to ask 2 weeks before the rec is due if there is any info you can give them that would make the rec easier to write. Then again a couple days before.\n\nI usually submit recs exact when they were due, but a reminder isn't a bad idea at all.\n\n(On this subreddit, though, close to the deadline often means three months before the deadline.)",
