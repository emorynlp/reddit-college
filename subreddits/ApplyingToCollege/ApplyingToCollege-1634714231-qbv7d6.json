  "title:": "PSA: It does not take weeks or even days to write a student rec.",
  "text": "On this sub, I see posts where students are upset (!?!) that a teacher submits a recommendation quickly. This is insane.  As someone who has written probably a hundred or so excellent recs for HS and college students, recommendations take me between 2 and 3 hours to write--and I'm a slow writer who then revises the rec the next day.\n\n The reason you ask a teacher weeks or months ahead for the rec is so they can schedule their time--since they have work, lives, and perhaps dozens of other recs to write. When you ask someone for a rec, they don't set aside their whole summer to craft it -- it's not their personal statement. \n\nWhen a teacher submits a rec quickly, go thank them -- don't complain about it on Reddit.",

          "text": "Yeah, we lose track, so I think it's nice to ask 2 weeks before the rec is due if there is any info you can give them that would make the rec easier to write. Then again a couple days before.\n\nI usually submit recs exact when they were due, but a reminder isn't a bad idea at all.\n\n(On this subreddit, though, close to the deadline often means three months before the deadline.)",

He churns out LOR in 30 min to an hour. \n\n\nHe\u2019s a well respected alumni at our local state school that a lot of students go to and helps students get in there and another state school all the time. \n\nBut he never ever lets students read his LOR. But if you\u2019re asking him for one it\u2019s because you have a good relationship with him. \n\n\nI\u2019m thankful he gets his LORs so quickly, my English teacher takes 99 years to start",
