      "text": "The process itself depends on the school. But basically, you get assigned a \u201cregistration time.\u201d The time is typically determined by class standing/number of credits. The classes themselves generally have a total number of \u201cseats\u201d that can register. If you try to register after that, you\u2019re put on a waitlist. \n\nIt can be pretty stressful for a few reasons. Prior to registering, it can be pretty difficult to make your schedule so the classes/discussions all fit together (plus logistical annoyances like avoiding 8am\u2019s, having more than 10 minutes to walk across campus etc). If one of your classes fills up and you don\u2019t get it, there\u2019s a pretty real possibility that you have to remake your schedule. \n\nThen there\u2019s the impact on your graduation timeline. If a class you need as a pre-requisite fills up, then in the worst case scenario it can delay your graduation by a semester/quarter. \n\nKeep in mind this is *typically* more of an issue at larger public universities, although I\u2019m sure some public universities have solved it, and some private universities still struggle with it. But yeah, that\u2019s most of it that I can recall.",

              "text": "Like the comment above mentioned, it can depend on lot on how big the school is (usually also correlated to public vs private). The private school I attend does not do registration on a first-come-first-serve basis, so it\u2019s pretty chill. Once you get your schedule, there\u2019s another period called add/drop, and adding classes then is done on a first-come-first-serve basis. But many bigger colleges do registration on a first-come-first-serve basis, which can make registration super competitive and stressful. I have a high school classmate who\u2019s attending Berkeley who faced that for fall semester this year and couldn\u2019t get any of the sections with labs that he wanted. Some colleges will do registration for everyone at the same time, some will give different time slots for different people, possibly based on your year.",
