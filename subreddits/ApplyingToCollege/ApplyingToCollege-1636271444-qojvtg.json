It says not to report SAT IIs if we reported them on the  CA, but I\u2019m not sure if this also applies to SAT I scores.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: NSFW removed, not sure why it was marked as that. Also pinging [u/skieurope12](https://www.reddit.com/u/skieurope12/) because he seems to know what he's talking about most of the time",

      "text": "Most admissions portals will indicate whether or not scores for SAT/ACT were received, and often what type (official vs self-reported). Sometimes it takes a few days for that to process. If you submitted scores in the app, I would expect them to show up in the portal eventually. If you don't see an indication that scores were received by next week, I'd consider self-reporting in the portal.  (If the college purposely is not showing scores received in the portal, that kinda defeats the purpose of the portal and they deserve whatever phone calls or extra self-reporting they get...)",
