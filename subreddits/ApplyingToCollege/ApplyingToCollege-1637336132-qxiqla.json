  "text": "I have a 70 in AP calculus AB. I have failed every test and thanks to the new grading policy, I only get to retake a test once every 9 weeks so I was able to retake one test for a 79. I have also failed more quizzes than passed. I study all the time for this class and have switched tutors twice. My teacher called me in to tell me how disappointed she is in me and berate me because I am taking our test after Thanksgiving break instead of this week so I can study more (I had a field trip for the past two days, have to use the other periods to retake stuff, and I missed her class first period because of a dentist appointment). I have never done this bad in a class and this is my last year of high school and I feel like I\u2019ve killed off any chances I have in the colleges I applied to. I am mad at her but more than anything I\u2019m mad at myself. I\u2019m mad for doing so bad in this class, I\u2019m mad that I haven\u2019t been able to improve, and I\u2019m mad that it feels like this one class is defining my senior year.",

As long as it's not failing, I think you can explain to colleges your situation, how you're working to do better, etc. if you really think your grades will have a significant impact. Other than that, if you have disc, we can study together maybe?",

I think whats helped me is distancing myself from people who always talk about grades (especially the ones who make a huge deal out of getting an A instead of an A+ and etc.) because sometimes people like that can create these unrealistic views on grades and success. The truth is, most people aren\u2019t going to pass every class and have straight A\u2019s or even all A\u2019s and B\u2019s for that matter. As long as you\u2019re trying to do what you can to improve is what really matters not only for yourself, but to colleges as well.",
