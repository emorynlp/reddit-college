  "text": "I have a 70 in AP calculus AB. I have failed every test and thanks to the new grading policy, I only get to retake a test once every 9 weeks so I was able to retake one test for a 79. I have also failed more quizzes than passed. I study all the time for this class and have switched tutors twice. My teacher called me in to tell me how disappointed she is in me and berate me because I am taking our test after Thanksgiving break instead of this week so I can study more (I had a field trip for the past two days, have to use the other periods to retake stuff, and I missed her class first period because of a dentist appointment). I have never done this bad in a class and this is my last year of high school and I feel like I\u2019ve killed off any chances I have in the colleges I applied to. I am mad at her but more than anything I\u2019m mad at myself. I\u2019m mad for doing so bad in this class, I\u2019m mad that I haven\u2019t been able to improve, and I\u2019m mad that it feels like this one class is defining my senior year.",

As long as it's not failing, I think you can explain to colleges your situation, how you're working to do better, etc. if you really think your grades will have a significant impact. Other than that, if you have disc, we can study together maybe?",
