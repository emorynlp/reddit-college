(75 words or fewer)  \n*- Your response should be a list of items separated by commas or semicolons.*  \n*- Items do not have to be numbered or in any specific order.*  \n*- It is not necessary to italicize or underline titles of books or other publications.*  \n*- No author names, subtitles or explanatory remarks are needed.*  \n\n\nI have 3 questions about this:\n\n1. Is it ok to include the subtitle if it's necessary to understand what the book is about? because I don't expect the AOs to look them all up\n2. Could I put books I read for a research project in required readings? Because a lot of my teacher-assigned history course readings (which were some of my favorite required readings) were made by teachers and IDK how I'd put those. Likewise, can I put books I chose to read for English papers?\n3. I can include articles, correct?",
