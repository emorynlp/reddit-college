  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI need help for filling out the coursework section of the common app. It says I should be filling out the courses I'm taking this year, but my school has a weird system in which in the last year of HS, we have 2 different math classes. In 1 of them we take Calc/Pre-Calc, while at the other we basically go over all of the Math lessons we have taken over HS (this is made to prepare us for the National exam at the end of HS.) Should I be putting in my coursework everything starting from Algebra to Calculus, or just Calculus.\n\nSecond of all, we work with Cambridge A-Level books, however we do not take A level exams. Does this mean I have to choose the course level as Cambridge A Level or rather as regular.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help",
