  "title:": "Question about GPA in the CommonApp",
  "text": "Okay basically, my school doesn't do gpa out of 4. We get a score from 0 to 100 each unit and term(It goes 1st unit, 1st terminal, 2nd Unit, 2nd Terminal). And I'm confused what to put into the GPA section (out of 100). I just finished 1st Unit of 12th grade. Do i enter 11th grade 2nd Term marks (which i have a report card of) or the 12th grade 1st Unit marks( dont have any report card to prove it yet). Please help me out before EA deadlines",
