  "text": "My parents made a mistake when filling out the Profile. My dad has a business. Our income is the net income of this business. He miscalculated the total expenses of the business, which in return reduced our income (SMH). I want to send a correction to the college that received my app, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I've already sent a correction for another issue which was not my fault. It was CSS Profile's mistake. Do you think that the financial aid office would get skeptical to see TWO correction requests on ny file???",
