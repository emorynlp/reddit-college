  "title:": "Discord Certified (Literally) Moderator on Common App????",
  "text": "No this is not a joke. Yes I know it's not Shitpost Wednesday. I'm (quite literally) a certified moderator on Discord. [Proof](https://imgur.com/oNLW4ou), excuse the blocking out of details.\n\nI'm kind of at a loss for other awards to toss on my Common App so I'm really considering listing it, but I'm worried it'll sound stupid. As far as I know, only \\~700 people on the platform of over 350 million people have it. So like, 0.0002%. I'll probably explain a bit more about it in the Additional Info area. I'll say something about how it's \"only awarded to those who show exceptional leadership and community skills\" or something like that.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on how to make this sound less stupid or want to warn me against doing this, thanks.",

I'm just worried that online community moderation stuff might be seen as a bit weird by AOs, especially having \"certification\" because discord mods are a bit of a stereotype, lol. Or maybe having actual certification will make me fall less into that stereotype and look more legitimate.",
