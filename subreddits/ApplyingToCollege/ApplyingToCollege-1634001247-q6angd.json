  "text": "So I\u2019m a sophomore in high school and in Texas, you only need to take 2 years of a foreign language. I completed my first year of Spanish my 8th grade year and my second year of Spanish my freshmen year. I opted out of Spanish 3 because I was not interested in it under any circumstances and I instead wanted to pursue Japanese. I\u2019ve been self teaching myself Japanese since my freshmen year (learned the basic writing systems in 6th grade so I already had a pretty good background). So far I\u2019ve learned almost 400 words in the past few months, > 100 kanji and can understand 80% of kids shows (7 and under). My school only offers Japanese 1 and has no AP Japanese class so I was thinking of just taking the AP Japanese test my Junior year to show that I am still pursuing some form of a second language. I do plan on fluency by the time I graduate (hopefully I can pass jlpt 1 or 2).\n\nWill colleges see it as a bad thing that I didn\u2019t take a language class past the requirement? I still plan on continuing Japanese well into my adult life, but I want a realistic view on how colleges will view this.",

      "text": "It might make a you a bit less competitive for elite institutions but it\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker as long as you have good grades and took challenging coursework otherwise. I would definitely take the AP exam if possible or at the very least put that you are studying Japanese on your own time somewhere in you application or CV. That definitely shows interest and initiative and would separate yourself from other applicants. Do you plan on majoring in eastern studies? Or something like that",

              "text": "As someone said in another comment, when colleges 'recommend' something, it's usually a good idea to do that thing. This is not to say you'll be automatically rejected if you don't have 3-4 years of a language, especially if the rest of your application is strong, but I would definitely recommend putting some information in your app about your study of Japanese.",

If you have proof that you can reach an understanding of the language that roughly equates to 3 years worth, then it won't be TOO much of a problem.\n\nSo you want to look at SAT language tests, AP's (are there AP language exams?), to \"prove\" your capability, and expand on it in the additional info section",

      "text": "Most highly selective/rejective colleges like to see at least four years of one language in high school.  \n\nHere\u2019s my copy pasta:\n\nWhy Take a Third or Fourth Year of Foreign Language?\n\nGood question. I\u2019ve asked that myself a lot and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.\n\nIt shows a willingness to learn something beyond what\u2019s comfortable. You learn a language to be forced to think beyond your native language\u2019s thought structure.\n\nLanguages flex your brain in different ways and make it work in another functional way\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard admissions officers and counselors say:\n\nThey value the commitment of students who continue to persevere with language if it\u2019s available\n\nThe study of language helps with cultural competency\n\nLanguage study teaches an appreciation of other cultures and helps develop an understanding of how language affects our ability to think and express ourselves. Selective colleges want students who delve deep into another language for its inherent value.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the language. It\u2019s about the way of thinking and learning a new skill set.\n\nIt\u2019s considered a matter of \u201chorsepower,\u201d allowing you to think differently and grow your ability to empathize, understand other cultures, and stretch your mind.\n\nAlso, studying other languages allows you to really understand English and grammar because you\u2019re being forced to go through a complex analysis of how grammar and language work.\n\nKids who go to fancy prep schools are advised to take at least one language all four years, and often two. For example, my kids all took Latin all four years, and then also took Greek as seniors, and took either French or Spanish for 2 or 3 years. This is all in high school. Not including the Spanish 1 or 2 or Latin 1 or 2 they did as middle schoolers. And they aren\u2019t uncommon \u2014 especially for humanities majors.\u00a0 If you\u2019re a stem major, it matters slightly less.\n\nOf course, students are accepted without the fourth year of language bc they do look at what\u2019s offered to you and what you have taken, but I encourage all my students to stick with their fourth year of language.\u00a0 So I just share whatever advice I give my private students with y\u2019all here.\n\nHere\u2019s what Yale says though, for example: \u201cYale does not have any specific entrance requirements (for example, there is no foreign language requirement for admission to Yale). But we do look for students who have taken a balanced set of the rigorous classes available to them. Generally speaking, you should try to take courses each year in English, science, math, the social sciences, and foreign language.\u201d (https://admissions.yale.edu/advice-selecting-high-school-courses)\n\nAnd colleges are definitely aware that different students have access to different opportunities in high schools and some schools only offer two years. They will be aware of that.",
