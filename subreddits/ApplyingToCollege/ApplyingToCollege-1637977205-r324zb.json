  "text": "Started reflecting on this because my English class had us write personal statements and my teacher's advice just sounded so wild to me. The example topics were family illness/death, divorce, and sports. Not saying there aren't *good* essays about those but when they gave us a sample essay that legit started with \"Sweat beaded down my forehead as I kept my eyes on the basketball\" I could feel my soul leave my body\n\nAnd then another one of my teachers was talking about how early decision \"trapped\" their kid because they'd have to commit to one of the *four schools* they applied to before hearing back from RD and I was like \"...oh no...\"\n\nHonestly, for all the brainrot A2C has given me, I'm glad I know what I know, at least",

      "text": "I have relatively recently joined this group and overall have been impressed with the insight and sharing of information. I do worry about the advice of some high school counselors. For example, my daughter\u2019s high school counselor recommended that she write her Common App essay on a service trip she was planning on taking to South America (ultimately cancelled by Covid). I just cringed when she said that. We were sending her for the experience, but it was never going to be a cornerstone of her college application and certainly not the subject of her essay and how those two weeks changed her outlook on life/the world.",

                  "text": "TBH I don\u2019t buy that. It is literally their job. \n\nHer counselor didn\u2019t know about diversity fly-in programs and we had to explain it her. And they didn\u2019t know they had to sign an ED agreement and was asking my daughter what other schools she was applying ED (she had to explain that you can only apply to one). She lead a group session on filling out the Common App, when the students asked questions, she in front of the group asked my daughter to answer because she didn\u2019t know. \n\nSince my daughter\u2019s freshman year I have been so disappointed in the support given at the public schools. I get that they have a ton of students, but the advice is horrible. I know that there are bright kids at her school from families whose parents didn\u2019t go to college and don\u2019t understand the system. I wanted to work with the school to find a way to mentor a group, but the public schools are not open to having parents come in and do things outside of the system.  I think it is one of the reasons that I gravitate here because I know how bad the support is. I know the level of information and support I am giving my daughter, and recognize the huge disparity.",

                      "text": "Ask her how many classes about college access were part of her M.Ed. It will be somewhere between 0 and 1. A counselor has about 100 jobs, and college access is way down the list. Schedule changes and compliance paper work and intakes/withdraws and credit recovery and violence risk assessments and homeless kids and abuse reports and a million other things come first.\n\nLook, I've worked with 20 counselors over the years and 18 were terrible and 1 was ok. One was fantastic. I am not defending the profession. But it's a true fact that they get little or no formal training in college access. It's just not part of the curriculum, and very definitely wasn't 20 years ago. It sucks that they are terrible at it, but it's a structural problem, not an individual failure.\n\nAsk the principal how much Professional development they have provided on college counseling for the counseling staff. Ask them how many hours a week they think the counselor should be spending on college access . . .not just helping kids, but writing letters and researching the field.  It's probably less than a half day a week.",
