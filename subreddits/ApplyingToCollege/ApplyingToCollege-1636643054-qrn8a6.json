  "title:": "Was taking the IB a mistake? Is it even worth it to finish it at this point?",
  "text": "My councilor keeps advising me to apply to schools with an acceptance rate of over 75% like Drexel... Don't get me wrong Drexel looks like a great school I've just been spammed emails from them practically begging me to go, offering thousands in aid.\n\nI go to an all IB public school, basically first 2 years are standard classes non-IB then you finish your junior and senior year with all 7 classes being IB HL or SL + TOK. I tested out of language and into a higher level math class but each of which only made my GPA suffer while I could have been acing regular classes. Instead, getting a C average in Spanish because of a crappy teacher and a B for math.\n\nNow I'm taking HL Math, Physics, and Chemistry. As well as SL English and World History. I know what you're thinking, why would I ever double HL science PLUS math, but I actually don't find the subject work to be that difficult. Minus HL Math, fuck HL Math. Its really just a lot more tedious work, and I enjoy it. \n\nThat being said, Covid really raw-dog fucked me over. I started my IB classes all online. My GPA unweighed sophomore year was a 3.5, after junior year it dropped to a 3.1. The harshest grade being in Math which got to a point of almost failing. My school is really competitive and looking at the other people in my class I can't help but feel like what I thought would be impressive, isn't. \n\nIt might sound snobby but idk, I feel like I've done so much work, put in the hours and its all kind of a waste. Like I didn't need to work myself to this extent. I spent all the time working on my resume: I took a class at the community college, I got an internship at a prestigious research institute, and I even managed to get my first term grades for senior year to honor roll (3A's 2 Bs)! \n\nI have my own stupid bias that no matter who I talk to, I can't not believe. I don't see a point in college if it isn't rigorous and selective (For my major, chemical engineering). It doesn't have to be an MIT or a Yale, I think those schools are overrated anyways and I have NO shot of getting in, but like and RPI or UBC or BC. I feel like anything less would be dooming myself to a future of a middle school chemistry teacher.\n\nSo if I have barely any chance of getting into those schools like my councilor says, I don't see a point in finishing the IB at all. I keep thinking, if this is what I'm doomed to, going to a school where I'd probably pay something like 20k a year for a mediocre degree that got me a office job that would have me paying it off my the time in 40, I might as well just not go. Part of me has always just wanted to run some surf shop in some deadbeat tourist island town. I would be happier there. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "You need a wide variety of schools on your list. There is a long continuum between RPI/BC and Drexel.\n\nBC is a big reach with a 3.5, very unlikely with a 3.1. BC is in reach-for-all territory due to low acceptance rate. RPI is more reasonable, but 3.1 will hurt. Apply (hopefully with test scores!) but be realistic. \n\n>I feel like anything less would be dooming myself to a future of a middle school chemistry teacher.\n\nNow is the time to correct this misperception. You are overfocused on the importance (or lack thereof) of prestige for your major/field.",

Rhode Island to Umass Amherst to Loyola Marymount Uni. to Northeastern. I know I am going to get a lot of no's but my pride isn't so weak that I don't think I shouldn't apply at all.\n\nI get that prestige isn't everything but you can't deny it plays a role.",

You are asking yourself to do the impossible and your spring will be rough if you don't learn more about the options you will have and your path is likely to look like from the schools that you are likely to be admitted to. There is more than one way to skin the cat.\n\nIf it's true that prestige is so important, then take a longer view, go to grad school somewhere more prestigious.",
