  "text": "OK I have a BUNCH of questions.\n\nDo I include my interests or ignore since it's already a part of the application?\n\nDo I include contact details? Like phone no. and Email?\n\nDo I just copy paste most of the stuff from honors/EC section and maybe add a few more?\n\nDo I select a visually appealing template or a bland one w/out formatting but with plenty of space for text?\n\nDo I include my academic record?\n\nDo I include standardized/English proficiency tests as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Sorry these may come off as stupid but I've never made a resume before...***",
