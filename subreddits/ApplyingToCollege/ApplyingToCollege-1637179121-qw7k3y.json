  "text": "I applied to University of Washington Seattle yesterday, and I read that the transcripts of U.S or International schools weren't needed, and that you could submit the grades manually, so I did that, and continued the application since it seemed that there weren't any problems according to Coalition. But the thing is that in 9th Grade I went to a school in another country with a foreign curriculum that was not international and I didn't submit the transcript of that year in the Coalition app. I just realized that I was supposed to submit the transcript of my year at the foreign school and submitted my grades manually and now I am scared that I screwed up my application. Will my application still considered by UW Seattle?",
