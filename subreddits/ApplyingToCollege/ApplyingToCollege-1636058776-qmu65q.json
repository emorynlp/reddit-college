  "text": "Hello, my school calculates GPA on a 6.0 scale and does it [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KRh6USu0jzXFZZszPADww1Y6LhdiUMok680It8pDhLU/edit?usp=sharing) way. (they only report the weighted GPA) Would colleges most likely recalculate it using the [standard](https://pages.collegeboard.org/how-to-convert-gpa-4.0-scale) method or how my school does it?",

I'm pretty sure that all the places you apply to get your transcript and high school profile (a document that should explain things like the grading system & GPA scale that the school uses). So whatever way they look at it, your GPA being out of a 6.0 scale won't be counted against you",
