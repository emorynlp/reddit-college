Backup colleges are a important thing bc rejection happens BUT just because you got rejected once doesnt mean you cant just reapply for the next term (literally a few months later not a whole new year) & a lot of major universities do a sister college program where they have a community college near by to them that they accredit and once your their for a few classes or semesters you can just go strait to your uni! Also as much as it will suck sometimes staying in state will be a better option for you guys in terms of financial saving but dont turn down offers because of that take any ride you can and go for it.",
