  "text": "I have my application ready but common app isn't letting me submit my Viterbi 14 Challenges essay! I know a couple people who submitted their essays a while ago, and it let them submit, but for some reason, it's not letting me submit. I'm under the word limit, and I've tried on multiple browsers. There's a little red exclamation mark next to this question, so I know that there's something wrong with it. I have one other friend who's facing the same problem, but we don't know what's wrong. I've tried typing just a couple characters in but there's still a a red exclamation mark next to the question.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is anyone else facing the same problem?",
