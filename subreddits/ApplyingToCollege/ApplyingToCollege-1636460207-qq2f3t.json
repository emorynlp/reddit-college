Colleges spend a lot of money convincing you that their brand is worth the money. Most colleges in the US are luxury brands aimed at higher net worth consumers.

Flexing to your \"in the know\" friends is not an ROI. \n\nThe sad truth is that only a few schools have the name recognition to provide real ROI over a cheaper state school.",

Dartmouth and Brown are pretty much unknown outside the US except in academic circles.\n\nThe assumption with the global rankings is that anybody looks at them outside of applicants and their families. Certainly, most employers won't know that John's Hopkins is #12 according to THE.
