Yes we should definitely be completely selfish actors that are only together for the convenience of the moment.

I\u2019ve sat and thought about this for awhile. For anyone in my position, it might make sense to go to a university close to their SO. It is worth the sacrifice to many people. To many, breaking up with their SO or creating instability in their relationship by trying to pull of a LDR is far worse than not going to the college of their dreams. If you end up going to a college close to them and you end up breaking up anyway, so what? You did what you thought was right in the moment. There\u2019s nothing more you could have done. Move on. Make do with what you have. You have to weigh all your options obviously, I\u2019m just saying that choosing your local college over Stanford when both cost the same might make sense to some. I\u2019m not saying to go 100k in debt for your SO or anything. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s not idiotic to factor one\u2019s SO into college decisions. It\u2019s all about hedging your bets and weighing the options.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not going to a university close to my girlfriend just because it wouldn\u2019t make sense financially.",

                              "text": "Like I said, hedge your bets. Your situation seems like it was much more risky than mine. In your case, hedging your bets might have been a dumb idea. And no one is saying to go home every weekend. I\u2019m not saying everyone needs to do this, but if you\u2019ve been dating someone for 4 years and you really love the person and want to marry them then maybe it\u2019s something to consider. And I don\u2019t want to assume anything about your relationship, but the fact that you guys broke up might be an indicator that there are other relationships that are more stabile and \u201csuccessful\u201d than yours. I haven\u2019t broke up with my girlfriend yet. We have been dating for a long time (long enough that if we were in our 20\u2019s I would have asked her to marry me already) and neither of us are going to break up with each other before college. We have both decided on riding out a long distance relationship. We are probably more committed to each other than you were in your relationship (I could absolutely be wrong with this assumption,  but I\u2019m just using it as an example). If you and your SO are committed as much as me and my girlfriend are, it might make sense. It\u2019s risky, no one is saying it isn\u2019t. But if you\u2019re both committed enough it might just be worth the risk. It\u2019s something to think about for a long time and something that you should both talk about. It\u2019s absolutely not something to just decide on a whim. However, if you have both been dating for years and you both agree that the relationship is as serious as you think it is, it might be worth it. Just realize it\u2019s a risk.\n\nSome people just think the other person is worth the sacrifice, and like I said I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s okay if other people don\u2019t agree. I\u2019m just saying that, in my opinion, it\u2019s okay to take that into consideration. Just realize that you\u2019re hedging your bets. Life is full of decisions. Some people think that making the risky decision for someone they love is worth it. Some don\u2019t, and that\u2019s okay\n\nThat\u2019s just my philosophy on it. It\u2019s risky, but all you can do in life is try your best. You don\u2019t have a crystal ball. All you can do is think long and hard about things and discuss things with your SO.",

Additionally, saying that your relationship is more stable than others because you haven\u2019t broken up is silly. You could say that about all relationships 1 day before they end. \n\nUltimately the reason why people say you shouldn\u2019t make decisions about where to go to college based off of high school relationships has to do with experience and maturity. Everyone grows up a remarkable amount in college, and priorities and whatnot always shift. As a result, almost zero long distance relationships last through even the first few months of college.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this will happen to you, but it\u2019s a possibility. I guess my only piece of advice is that if you do decide to stay with your girlfriend throughout college, make sure it\u2019s for the right reasons, and the same goes for if you decide to break up. I wish you the best of luck!",

But those cases are usually ones that can withstand long distance. I graduated college this weekend. I've seen couples make it from high school -- they all went to colleges in separate places, and chose to prioritize their own lives while also valuing their SO. That's such an important part of being an adult and being in a healthy relationship. You have to both grow. Shaping your life around another  isn't a good plan. \n\nThe reality is that if you plan your college choice around another person, and you end things, you will regret it. It's not a \"so what?\" moment. It's something that radically influences the path that your life takes. I truly hope things work out for your relationship, but I'm comfortable saying that in general, you have to decide college based off of yourself.\n\nedit: I kept thinking about this. I know couples from high school who are engaged from LDRs. I also know couples who did the long distance thing, conspired on university choices, broke up and now have such complicated social lives because of the overlap. College is wonderful!! In an ideal world, you can have it all. But you can compromise by having a LDR and if it's worth it, it will work out. If you give up a better opportunity, you're going all in. One lets you attempt to have both, one will result in so much heartbreak.",

To me, if you makes the wrong decision you made the wrong decision. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re screwed now that you didn\u2019t go to a certain college. Make do with what you have, and move on.

Nobody was sure if he'd go to college but he eventually got into Tulane and went bc it was his girlfriend's dream school. Fast forward to this year, his girl also got into Tulane, they're attending together, and they're both almost straight A students.",

Within a couple of weeks he had me trying cigarettes (which I didn't stick to) and weed (which I did).\n\nHe tried to clean up his act. He tried to quit smoking about 6 times but would get so stressed that he just couldn't do it. He applied to university and got in. He cut the drugs down to weed, but once we got to uni and I was too busy with classes to be his personal conscience, he got into nangs and psychedelics. It got to the point where even when sober, he was dull and slow and not the person I started dating. He stopped going to class.\n\nDealing with all of his personal shit dragged me into depression. My grades were slipping and I started planning my suicide. Eventually I just bit the bullet and broke up with him, after which he cried and threatened to kill himself. \n\nLast I know, he dropped out of uni, is working a minimum wage job loading fish onto pallets, and takes more drugs than ever. \n\nI couldn't save him. I was stupid to think that I could, I almost killed myself trying, and he is now worse than he ever was. Don't try to save people.",

Listen to that fuckfaces' rhetoric and the way he talks to her. It is SO easy for an older person ESPECIALLY during high school to be coercive. It doesn't matter what one's intent is. The issue is that it can lead to abuse. Thus it is never okay. This is the same reason why most universities have rules against relationship with students. There's a power imbalance that will always exist and is almost never conducive to healthy relationships. \n\nAlso, age difference in highschool is MUCH different than any other age. One's maturity and brain development is so vastly different at those ages. The maturity difference between a 15 year old and a 17 year and a 28 year old and a 35 year is really really huge.\n\nAlso, like what kind of loser do you have to be to date a freshman/sophomore? Can't you get someone your own damn age to like you??",

                              "text": "You have a very good point. However, without calling any sort of abuse legitimate or excusable, it does seem like most if not all relationships are prone to abuse and manipulation. It is so easy for any person to pick out someone who is lonely or emotionally starved and feed them rhetoric to coerce them. This is what can lead to abuse. There is a power imbalance that will always exist, with the emotionally starved on the bottom, which never leads to a healthy relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do agree with the second paragraph, there is a large maturity difference, assuming you generalize. I do not mean this to say there is no such maturity difference, but to say that there is a .1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, I think there's a disparity in this logic. At the risk of sounding SUPER pretentious, I would say that I am not a serial dater. I don't ask girls out on a whim (which is definitely not helped by some social anxiety), meaning that I can't just start dating any girl. Personally, I wouldn't want to ask someone out based on some sort of physical or mild attraction. I would prefer to genuinely want to spend time with that person, without it feeling like some sort of obligation. Thus, I can understand how some people would not be able to or want to go out with someone their own age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAttraction and \"love\" and all that stuff is incredibly subjective, meaning that it is incredibly difficult to generalize. I do agree that these sorts of relationships can be prone to abuse, but all relationships are prone to abuse, making them no different in that regard. There are always outliers to anything, making it impossible to say never or always.",

Once people surpass 18, they will be willing to date people like five or six or more years older than them.\n\nIt also depends on the maturity of each person and whether or not that are having sex(especially if the sophomore is under 16).",
