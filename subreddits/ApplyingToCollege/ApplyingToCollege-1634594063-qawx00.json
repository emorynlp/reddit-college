  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nSo today hasn't been a great day for me. 11th grade results came out, and apparently I failed but they just gave me extra marks to pass me. 182 out of 550 (33% is the passing grade).\n\nI expected a not-so-great result but not to this point. I just don't know what to do. I did pretty well in 9th grade (got an A) and 10th grade exams were cancelled so they just took our 9th grade result and added 3% to them. I'm not going to make any excuses, but the biggest factors for my terrible performance was war (I'm from Libya) and health reasons (literally have extreme fatigue for no reason, random headaches and stomach aches and vision problems) and all that affected my studies deeply. \n\nAt this point, I really don't know what to do next in regards to applying to colleges in the US. I had a bunch on my list, high-tier ones and medium ones but now I don't think any college would accept me with my 33% grade in 11th grade. I have an option to improve my grades in an improvement exam but that would mean that I would probably get my results after the college application deadline and thus I will miss a year.\n\nSorry really, just don't know where to talk about this.",

It is most certainly a reason behind the drop in your performance. Also? Please go to a doctor- anxiety can cause many of your symptoms but so could a virus. Take good care of yourself. Wherever you choose to study will be lucky to have you.",

Like the other comment said, I would recommend visiting a doctor if you are able to. Your health and well-being should be your first priority, not your grades right now.",

I wish you the very best and hope your health issues subside. \n\nOn the topic of US colleges, there is a whole additional info section on the common app to explain situations like yours. It is a very valid reason for your dip. You definitely still have a chance at the colleges you were looking at, don't lose hope. Bounce back, if possible, and secure good marks in 12th grade. Like the other commentators said, your health and well-being should be your first priority.\n\nGood luck and stay safe!",
