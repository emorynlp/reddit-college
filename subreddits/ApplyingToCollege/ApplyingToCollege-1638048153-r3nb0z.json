      "text": "I mean Ik everyone is saying write down why u wanna go, and there is truth to that. U should label down legit reasons why u want to go to umich. U shouldn\u2019t have trouble coming up with those reasons. Now structurally I would have 2-3 reasons maybe related to your major and interests that would help you achieve your specific goal at umich. Other than that, find fun and educational reasons as to why umich is a school u like. It can literally be as complex as a professor and research there or as stupid as watching football and wearing a umich shirt. Write whatever u want but just be creative with how it helps you and supports why umich should accept u",
