  "text": "So what happens when I invite a teacher recommender? I have her permission; when I put in her contact information and click 'invite', will something be sent to her as a guideline for her to write the letter? I understand that she would be sending a letter to the Common App, where I then assign letters from teachers to each school I apply to. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Nothing is really sent as a guideline. They just get a link to make an account (or log in if they already have one) and then they are asked to complete their recommendation. \n\nThey ask you to explain how you know the student, words that you would use to describe the student, and then there's space to either write a letter or you can upload a doc or PDF. \n\nI would explain this to your teachers. Ask them if they've done it before and if not, just give them that info.",
