  "text": "So what happens when I invite a teacher recommender? I have her permission; when I put in her contact information and click 'invite', will something be sent to her as a guideline for her to write the letter? I understand that she would be sending a letter to the Common App, where I then assign letters from teachers to each school I apply to. \n\nThanks!",
