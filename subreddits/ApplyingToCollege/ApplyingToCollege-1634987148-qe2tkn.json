What do I do ? After 2 years studying liberal arts, will I be apply to take engineering in 3rd year ? Or do I have to apply in engineering program? If so , should I do engineering in the liberal arts college",

So, I guess in a way, your decision is not wrong. \nJust be aware that if you do end up wanting to study chemical engineering, you MIGHT have to spend 1-2 years extra at another school. Lots of LACs have 3+2 or 4+2 engineering programs. You might want to look into LACs that have those programs.",
