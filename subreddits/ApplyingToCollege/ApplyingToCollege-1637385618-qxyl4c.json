  "text": "I am currently in my Fall Semester of my Freshman year at community college. I am currently working on my IGETC requirements and will be ~50% done with it by the end of the semester. \n\nI was taking this semester to figure out what I really wanted to major in and I decided on Computer Science. \n\nHowever, I am afraid I'm behind on my math courses. The last math class I took in highschool was Precalculus and it was quite easy. For my major I am required to take Math 3A (Calculus). Can I take the class next semester? Do you think I can still transfer within my 2-year community college window?",
