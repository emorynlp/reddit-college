  "text": "I am still waiting for my ED result to come out, but recently, I have been thinking about if I really like my ED school. \n\nI wonder if I got in and enrolled, would I be able to choose not go to that school and study in a college which is outside the US? Does it have any bad influence if I decided that way?\n\nIt is not like I don't like my ED, I just keep questioning myself thesedays about my decision. But all of this is just hypothesis since my ED has not came out yet.",

I also heard rumours of being placed on a worldwide blacklist should you fail to respect the ED agreement.\n\nAnd also, this would accompany you throughout your whole life. If you really don't like your ED school (I wonder what makes you think that way), then transferring is the only way out.",
