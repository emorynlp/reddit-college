  "text": "Hey everyone! So I was featured in Grade 10 in the local media for some scientific work, and I\u2019d like to send the article to colleges. I\u2019ve maxed out the character limits on my activities lists and I\u2019ve also filled up my honours section with some more impressive ones. How else can I submit the article? Can I submit it as a supplemental material? Or is there another way to link them? Thanks in advance.",
