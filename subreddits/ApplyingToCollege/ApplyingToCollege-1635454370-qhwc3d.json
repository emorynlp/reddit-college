      "text": "I got into and am attending my favorite school.\n\n\nBefore applying, I would have said Brown was my second favorite. The open curriculum and general flexibility in their curriculum  is and was the best single thing in any school ever. However, my aid package from brown was horrid and it kinda soured me on the school. \n\nDon\u2019t have a clear second favorite then at that point. The one I keep talking about the most to people is Gustavus Adolphus. Good school, solidly in the safety range, most aid I received from a safety ( other than my state school), good programs, no app fee, no supplements, solid personality.",
