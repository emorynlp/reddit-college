  "text": "I know a boy in AP Physics who had half our class write down all the classes they\u2019ve taken in high school and their grades in them for his \u201cAP Euro Research Project\u201d to \u201ccompare US high school courses to British ones.\u201d In reality, everyone found out he was calculating our GPAs to compare them to his lol. We don\u2019t rank, so he was trying to make sure he was in the top percentile. He said he spent hours making a spreadsheet. Gotta love college insanity lol. What\u2019s your crazy story?\n\nEdit: Wow, there\u2019s some maniacs out there lol.",

      "text": "Many years ago, a kid from my HS was accepted into MIT for the first time in ages. One of their teachers thought \"this can't be right, so-and-so isn't that smart\" and called up the admissions office to see just how amazing this kid's application really was. The AO basically said, \"you would know- you wrote a recommendation letter!\"\n\nOf course, this teacher had not written a rec letter... so the investigation began. Turns out, near *everything* in this student's app was faked. Their admission was rescinded, which, given the rigor of MIT, was probably for the better. My school then called up all the other schools this student applied to and got their admissions rescinded at other places. No idea where they ended up or what they're up to, but I hope they're a little more honest now.\n\nEdit since this has gotten a lot of attention: In college, I was once part of a committee that heard student appeals for plagiarism cases and determined guilty/not guilty verdicts. You really don't want to wind up in that kind of hearing, so please be honest with yourself and others going forward.",

There was the story of the UPenn applicant who wrote a moving essay about his mother's death but after admissions officers called his home and his mother picked up the phone, Penn rescinded his acceptance. There was the Grinell student athlete who told the dean of admissions that he was being recruited by other colleges without realizing the dean knew the coaches the student mentioned and quickly uncovered the lies. There are also plenty of stories about colleges doing random checks when things don't add up and/or to prevent people from lying on their applications. They can't catch everything but if you get caught then you're admissions will be rescinded and depending on the lie you may have some legal issues on your hands. Don't lie on applications. You'll have plenty of time after college to lie on your resume.",

Absolutely, this experience is what has allowed me to garner better leadership skills, as these children were reliant on me for their education and well-being.\n\nOf course I'm laying it on thick, this is flat out satire, but still you could totally turn two nights babysitting into a \"job\" on a college app that offered you experience, especially if you don't have an actual job to check off that box. If you did it twice but they were spanned apart by 6 months, you could say that you babysat for half a year. Technically true.",

She would buy used textbooks and fill notebooks up with \"notes\" on her supposed studies so that her parents wouldn't be suspicious.

I'd argue that it's one of the cultural identities of Asian parents to be super overbearing.\n\nIn fact in the story, I would have assumed it was the result of an Asian household unless specified elsewhere. If I was telling the story to someone else, I would mention explicitly if they weren't Asian. \n\ntldr: To each their own but I really don't see it as any sort of issue. It's an appropriate context clue if you don't want to look up the reason she was driven to do all of that.",

Our valedictorian was nothing short of brilliant so they never would've caught up to him, but the sal definitely used people and teachers - relying on certain people for a lot of classes (not cheating but playing the game), planning every class to be the least amount of work with the most APs to inflate weighted GPA (they would brag about taking x amount of APs even though they were taking most of the easy ones), and they had a system with teachers too to where they would play the teacher's favorite to get good grades without having to work hard, and even go back through old tests to \"explain to teachers how they knew how to do the problem just made a mistake\" for partial credit. They weren't even a great student, they were just really good at manipulating and memorization (which you can use to coast by and cram for a lot of hs and AP classes) Almost nobody else compared about ranks, at least competitively.\n\nAlso can't forget when our rank 3, only by hundreths of a point per sources, took Comp Sci Principles twice bc the class, even though nothing in the material had changed, had changed from Honors (+7 weight) to AP (+10) just to boost their GPA.",

My major was Geography, at my school AP Human Geo, AP Psych, and AP Physics (and folks in geography adjacent fields) had us seeing a ton of 1-semester geographers who would transfer or drop classes they thought would be easy passes. The GIS requirement and Physical Geography courses would weed a ton of people out also (we started with 15 people in my class year, 3 of us graduated on time, around 50% have changed degrees or dropped out (average for my school)).",

Basically, when you apply to your school, your guidance counselor (or equivalent) also submits materials, of which include a school report. This basically has the entire curriculum on it. I imagine in the case where there was a limit they would include that information. For example, I\u2019m an engineering major and it would have been helpful if I had taken AP physics C in terms of scholarship opportunities\u2014but this wasn\u2019t offered to me, and the school report reflected that and colleges definitely took that into account (I could go into my personal experience in regards to this but it\u2019s a long story) \n\nYou can request to see this before it is sent and make sure this info is included (I imagine it would be). Likely if you are applying to prestigious schools/scholarships (private or even at a state school) your high school will want to help you out as it looks good for them when you get into an elite school or receive a scholarship.\n\nAnother option to consider would be to ask your guidance counselor to include that you took the most rigorous curriculum possible in their letter of rec. \n\nGood luck with  your upcoming apps!",

As a result however I realized that classmates that were CLEARLY not as good of students as me were surpassing me and that the VAST majority of kids were cheating. I went an entire semester struggling super hard in AP Physics before realizing that the reason everyone was doing so good was because they got the banks from last year. Too many people get away with it and it really screws class ranks and contributes to unnecessary toughening of test material",

Because the only people who really know won\u2019t bother to call the colleges they got accepted into, a lot of these kids might have gotten away with lying about creating a fake non-profit.

I literally hate being asian because of these people.",

I have to work twice as hard as other Asians and the stuff I do accomplish is shit on by other Asians for not being as good as them or if I am as good as them they say oh why are you proud of it that\u2019s so easy. And to add onto it affirmative actions kicks me in the ass too so really being an asian who\u2019s not rich and from a minority asian country isn\u2019t very helpful. It just makes me more mad that Asians do this idk. I kinda went on a rant there sorry to anyone reading lmao",

Asian parents prioritize education because it wasn\u2019t their ticket to the US, but because it is often the ticket to success ANYWHERE. On top of that, because of these ideals and the steadily rising income of Asian families, Asian students work harder and harder to do what they do best- study- because it is the only way they have a chance at succeeding. We have to work our asses off to be held at an equal standard to other students (from what I can see). However, now, I believe new immigration policies are expecting Asian students to come for education first rather than work because I suspect some may be upset that they came in with \u201cno expenses\u201d. I\u2019m not trying to rant, just clear up something that I feel applies to a lot of Asians. (obv I could def be wrong)",

I had no fucking idea how the school admin agreed to let him send out the Google survey but he was luckily instantly exposed. Some of my friends also hated the guy and decided to troll his survey results making them completely useless anyways. The stupidest move he made however was afterwards; the assistant principal told him he had to go to Saturday school for a while as punishment and this incident would get cleared off his record, but he refused and his dad instead threatened to sue the school district. He\u2019s going to UCSD for data science this Fall",

One of them got accepted while the other did not. The one who didn't get accepted leaked a bunch of inappropriate pictures of her to the admissions office. My English teacher said it was pictures of her drinking, but a lot of people have told me it was a lot more than just that.",

      "text": "I was an active member of my school's English Honor Society and really loved the subject, so I was considering running for a position senior year.  I asked the current Presidents at the end of my junior year how to run, and they gave me an application.  I filled it out as soon as possible and turned it in weeks before it was due because I really wanted the job.  Eventually, however, I came back in the school year and our sponsor was unfortunately ill, so there was no one I could talk to.  I tried to reach out to the past Presidents to see what had happened, and both of them told me they had no idea and that I should ask my sponsor, who wasn't there anymore.  In addition, my English teacher had no idea what happened.  About a month after senior year began, I noticed there were signs for a interest meeting, and I was confused.  I went to it and realized that the President was the younger sister of one of the former Presidents also in my grade, who never came to one of the meetings last year.  I ended up reaching out to her and asked if I could help her with the leadership, and she pretty much said no.  I wanted to help, however, so I asked her if I could help her and decided to help her, but she just ended up taking credit for the ideas I gave.  On the bright side of things, I'm happy the events went well as it seemed like the people involved in it with me really enjoyed it.\n\nThere was another case when I was a freshman where a senior year student stole the answer key to the AP Calc BC final exam, and he tried to AirDrop it in class to his classmates.  However, he accidentally airdropped it to his Calc teacher as well and was caught for it.  That same year, we had a senior get into Yale for the first time in ten years, but it was later discovered that she cheated a lot on her tests routinely.  She didn't get rescinded, though, but I truly hope she's learned from her past.\n\nHave a nice day!",
