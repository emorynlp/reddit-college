And little secret, I started writing my Personal Statement less than 5 days before the deadline and it all turned out fine.\n\nFor the vast majority of people, the essay isn't what gets you in. As long as you write something of respectable quality, you'll be fine",

It\u2019s ok to take some time off because that\u2019s what you need right now. Go easy on yourself. I know this is a stressful time especially given that your last essay is for your ED so you probably are putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Take some deep breaths, talk out essay ideas with friends, family, teachers, advisors or anyone you feel close to. Since you\u2019re struggling to come up with ideas, don\u2019t frame it in terms of writing for a supplement- just try to look deep into yourself and the things you enjoy and want out of your college experience. You obviously chose your ED for a reason because it fits what you want out of college. So just think about what important to you and then take what you\u2019ve learned about yourself and apply it to the school. I think most schools just want people with passion, drive and vision so they want to see that you have passions and goals and that their school will get you there by doing xy and z. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard all that stuff before and since you\u2019ve written 8 other supplements I\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to the format and are already and old pro. Just try to be nicer to yourself and I think that will take you far. I don\u2019t know what the last supplement\u2019s prompt is - if it\u2019s one of those quirky prompts like \u201cif you were an ice cream flavor what would you be?\u201d Or something similar like that then those are usually a little harder. But again use the time that you have to reflect on who you are and what drives you because at the end of the day that\u2019s what most of what these prompts are asking. \n\nLastly, and I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record, BE KIND TO YOURSELF!!! You\u2019ll be a lot more successful if you get out of this toxic admissions mindset that is often propagated on A2C that you should constantly be doing something and if you aren\u2019t then you\u2019re behind and not good enough. U said u were starting to feel burnt out - so take a break and enjoy it you don\u2019t need to feel guilty about taking 2 weeks off. Trust this whole college process will go a lot smoother if you just become a little kinder to yourself and remember you are enough. This is just one part of the process, decisions are the other and trust me your going to want to have adopted this mindset before decisions come rolling around.",
