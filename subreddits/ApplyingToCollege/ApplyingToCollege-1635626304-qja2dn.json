  "text": "Hey guys I'm looking to expand my list and any help would be appreciated.\n\nUndecided major in the liberal arts. Things that are important to me:\n\n- campus and surroundings good for walking and biking/good transportation (not rural)\n- good music and arts programs, ensembles\n- good food\n- financial aid\n- clubs like debate, Model UN\n- dorms\n\n\nPros but not required:\n\n- open curriculum\n\n- not freezing weather\n\n- good library\n\n- campus architecture\n\n- don't want to be somewhere overly stressful but don't want to be at a \"party school\" either\n\n- east coast\n\n- left leaning\n- gardening club\n\nSo far my top colleges are American University and Binghamton University. Won't throw up all my stats here to keep it short, they're above average but not insane",

      "text": "LOL I was just about to suggest American, then I saw you already have it on your list.\n\nI'd look into Emory, Georgetown, UVA, GWU, Drexel, Fordham, Santa Clara, Seattle University, U of Denver, CU Boulder, Boston College, BU, Tufts, Northeastern, NYU, URochester, and Brown.\n\nObviously, these schools vary in selectivity, geographic location, size, weather, academic offerings, etc. But they all fit a majority of your factors, meaning that each school ticks off like 75% or more of your boxes.\n\nBest of luck. :)",

      "text": "I highly second all of Toyota 2003's wonderful suggestions, but I also recommend checking out Wesleyan in Middletown, Connecticut and Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York.  They both have the open curriculum and are in the East Coast.   Unfortunately, these schools are all in areas where it can get pretty cold outside the summer, but if you're fine with looking past that, they meet everything else you're looking for.  Great campuses, great music/arts programs, great food (Wesleyan ranks as having one of the best dining halls in America), great dorms, great financial aid upon acceptance, etc.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",
