The yield rate alone is so crazy it might be a typo. For comparison, the next highest is Harvard at 85%.",

      "text": "Random thoughts, let's compare to prior years:\n\nClass of 2025\n\nTotal Applicants: 55,471 - 10k increase in apps due to test optional\n\nTotal Admits: 2,190\n\nTotal Enrolled: 2,126\n\nClass of 2024\n\nTotal Applicants: 45,227\n\nTotal Admits:  2,349\n\nTotal Enrolled:  1,607\n\nClass of 2024 may have had lower than normal yield because Stanford's campus was closed due to COVID. Notice that Stanford accepted 259 of the 707 people on the waitlist for class of 2024.\n\nMore normal year: let's compare to class of 2023\n\nTotal Applicants: 47,498\n\nTotal Admits:  2,062\n\nTotal Enrolled: 1,701; accepted 8 out of 580 on the waitlist.\n\nStanford accepted more for 2025 than for 2023. Using 2023 as a typical year, *unless Stanford is purposely trying to grow (I haven't heard),* it looks like their yield algorithms were wrong - assuming this is true, 425, or 25%, is a pretty massive overenrollment where practical logistics like dorms are concerned. 2024 was only underenrolled by about a hundred.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is the low yield for 2024. Obviously covid, but still. 2023 yield 82%, more typical.\n\nIf I were Stanford: I would be thinking about accepting far fewer for 2026 if my target enrollment is around 1700. Applicants admitted test optional are more likely to enroll = higher yield.\n\nI wonder if they published the % of the class who applied test optional.",

More likely than not, those are 400 deferrals. \n\nThe only school that messed up materially on their enrollment target was WashU. And their over enrollment was <200. They\u2019re also downstream from about 10-12 other schools. When admissions rates at those 10-12 tumbled, the extra rejections had to go somewhere. \n\nI can\u2019t see that happening at Stanford, because there isn\u2019t anything upstream.",
