There are a lot of decent colleges that take anyone with average entrance exam scores/rank and average board exam marks as well. Thankfully.",

And even in terms of freshman admissions, taking the UC and Cal State system as a whole there are plenty of opportunities to get into decent and sometimes world-famous schools in CA without having a crazy high school career.\n\nSo even though I was among the people who stressed out tons in high school, I consider this condition somewhat self-imposed, and so have a hard time mustering up criticism of it. Let a couple dozen private schools have crazy high bars for admission; what they do is barely a blip on the radar of the whole US education system.",

In China, everyone has something called a \"hukou\" limiting access to jobs and education in the area outside where you live. That means if you live in a rural area, you (or I guess more accurately, your parents) can't go to the city for your education; you're essentially stuck wherever you go. and you have to compete with people who have had more money and more preparation resources their entire lives. Not to mention that universities reserve more spaces for students from cities than those in the countryside, meaning the qualifying score for someone in, say, Beijing or Shanghai might be lower than someone from outside those areas, despite them also having the best schools.\n\nIt's not *all* bad; from a quick search, they're piloting a program to change the gaokao to something more like A-levels where you can take tests one at a time in your last few years of high school, and also introducing ways for more well-rounded and creative students to get into universities instead of just the ones who crammed the most on tests. Still, replacing the current system (as flawed as it is) with China's system is a terrible idea.",

                  "text": "the reality of the test based method is worse than the real version of the holistic method period. Are they both flawed? For sure, but the consequences of the flaws in the test based method are a lot lot more worse than the flaws of the holistic method and here's why. The test score isn't taken in context. Here is an extreme example. Take Student A: Student A lives in China and his entire family died in a car crash in his senior year. This pushes him into depression and he isn't able to study for the GaoKao, so he does bad on the test. But me as an the admissions officer don't see the trauma he had to go through and how hard it was for him to get himself through a year without his family. Take Student B: Student b lives in America and his entire family died in a car crash in his senior year. This pushes him into depression and he isn't able to study for the SAT/ACT and does bad on the test and his grades also dip. The difference is that in holistic admissions if Student B chooses to, can talk about his trauma in his personal essay, and if not he can explain this in the additional info section to explain his grades and test scores. The AO can take this into account and evaluate him. Take student C: She lives in China and is poor so she has to help take care of her younger siblings, and cook for her family. This leaves her with no time to study for the Gaokao and does bad on the test, but the AO doesn't see the hardship she went through. Take Student D: She lives in America and is poor so she has to help take care of her younger siblings, and cook for her family. This leaves her with no time so she ends up getting bad grades, can't participate in EC's and has bad test scores. The difference is that in holistic admissions if Student D chooses to, can talk about her hardship in her personal essay, and if not she can explain this in the additional info section to explain his grades and test scores. In addition, taking care of her siblings and other work she does counts as ECs, so she isn't as disadvantaged in the admission process.  The AO can take this into account and evaluate her. In addition programs like QuestBridge exist to help her. \n\nI'm just really pissed at how people think systems like JEE and Gaokao can even argued to be better when they're literally causing suicide rates to increase, not to mention the economic inequality they fail to take into account.",

You can say that it can go to financial aid, and for the small chunk of poor students who get in that's true, but that money is also going to inflated administrative costs, and if a serviceable building is replaced by a new one, how much does that really benefit anyone?",

      "text": "Went on a bit of a research rabbit hole on the gaokao \ud83d\ude05, there's some really interesting findings when compared with the US. According to [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/world/asia/china-college-education-quality.html), a Stanford study reported that Chinese students entering college have far stronger \"critical thinking skills\" than their American counterparts. However, after two years of college, American students significantly surpass Chinese students in the same metrics.\n\nApparently that discrepancy is due to a combination of lower quality in Chinese higher education and lack of motivation for post-gaokao students, which is probably a good indicator of how insanely stressful it is.\n\n**Limitations:** the study does not examine people who aren't in college, looks exclusively at people in CS and engineering programs, and doesn't measure creativity. I wasn't able to find the study itself, so idk about sample size. (My Google-fu isn't the best, so I will love you if you find the study. \ud83e\udd7a)\n\nMore recently, [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/business/china-graduate-school-white-collar.html) reported that a lot of Chinese college grads are having trouble finding jobs, so they're going to grad school instead. Not super relevant to gaokao, but it's interesting to wonder whether kicking the jobs problem four years down the road will help (along with more debt lol).",

Imagine to win gold in the olympics all the contestants who were from swimming, track, and other sports all had to compete in one event for example maybe archery. That\u2019s my problem with the education system, it seems to undermine other non traditional careers. For example more hands on careers like welding, and those trade job careers are valued so horribly while those people make decent money and live decent lives. The culture I grew up in suggested that only doctors and then maybe engineers are worth anything and the rat race will weed out the losers. Well maybe life success isn\u2019t about making a million bucks and maybe it can be you doing a decent hard work to pay the bills and live and have time for hobbies and family.\n\nBut thankfully my household has improved their thinking and my mom now says that whatever you do be excellent and seek the highest level of education in that respective field. I respect that ideology a lot more. Hard work and higher education is very important but it doesn\u2019t all have to be competition in one sports category, explore more things and find what is natural for you and aim for the stars there. Even if you don\u2019t a good honest living is still good.",

One where your chances at going to a good college are not excessively determined by the amount of opportunities offered at your High School and your income (I know, I know, these systems can have the same inequality problems if not even worse; but the US solves this by subjective metrics, which may still leave a lot of people out) and so on and so forth.

      "text": "Disclaimer:  I'm an education consultant based in Pittsburgh, an expert of Gao Kao Admission, a Gao Kao taker years ago.  Also, my daughter is a high school senior.  She enjoys spending time on reddit admission posts.  \n\nI'm glad people compare Gao Kao.  No taking sides, just provide some background about Gao Kao for this thread. \n\nGao Kao is a **super high-stake** test.  It has a lot of shortcomings, such as super-high pressure, no individual college admission evaluation, etc,  In China, there are students who commit suicide over Gao Kao, but such tragedies are not exclusive to Gao Kao.  In there U.S. college student suicide is the highest reason of student death as well.\n\nTo criticize/praise Gao Kao, we must know **why this system exists**.\n\nThe first reason is **social equity**.  To many Chinese students, GK is one of the most effective ways of social equity.  A student with high GK scores will be able to go to the best colleges, without worrying about tuition costs as much as their U.S. peers.  And the Chinese universities are fine with this score-based ranking admission process.  \n\nThe second reason is the most **cost-effective system** for college.  In 2020, 10+ million students took GK tests in 2 days. This is 5 times of all high school graduates in the U.S. All students are individually ranked by one **single** GK score.  All college freshmen seats are allocated just relying on this score through the computer.   Compare to the U.S. process, the money spent on multiple SAT/ACT tests, and the time spent on the application review, the national college exam is the lowest cost solution.  Therefore China, India, Korea, Japan use this single test college placement system.  While China is the most advanced in test management.\n\nAny Chinese passport holder must have GK score to enter any Chinese college.  Some wealthy/fortunate students can choose to go to colleges outside of China.  But the average income Chinese students cannot opt-out of public track for international education.\n\nIf you want to know more about Gao Kao, search  \"Gao Kao or No Gao Kao\" whitepaper. \n\n  \nHope it helps.",

They are simply expressing their wish to get a CLEAR VIEW of admission result and a CLEAR PREDICTION of their chances, which is understandable. I don't see anyone saying \"I want to take a test to determine the college I go to\". People complain about the unfair ASPECTS of US system and liked the fair ASPECTS of foreign systems. No one is directly taking the two systems together and saying \"test is better than holistic.\" \n\nGao kao is NOT designed for kids who have the money to do extracurricular and live in the areas that have these opportunities. It's targeted at kids who don't have the resources to do ec at all, and that's a pretty large percentage of the population.  Whereas in the US, even the worse high schools probably has some form of clubs and sports. \n\nMaybe before drawing conclusion, we should think about our family income level and the region we were born into. If I were a kid born into such poor areas where anything besides books is barely available, I probably don't want the US system that gives me 0 opportunity to succeed in EC as a result of resouces that are physically unavailable, unless I can confidently put farming/taking care of family members on my application and know the AO will value them as they value the fancy ec.",

              "text": "First of all, using languages like \"horseshit\", \"bs\", and \"lmfao\" is not the most respectful way of communicating. It's indeed rare to see such aggressive comments on A2C. \nYour point doesn't contradict what I was saying. Gao kao is the way it is because people can't do ec, and the other entrance tests are the way they are also because people can't do ec. If ec was taken into consideration, the kids from privileged schools would have done a billion times better because the underprivileged literally can't do anything. \nWhile I agree that there's huge gap between rural and urban that makes it hard for rural kids to get in, you should realize that EC will be affected much more than test scores. Yes rural areas don't have as much prep, but when it comes to EC, they will have 0 ec no matter how hard they try. There is a difference between some and none. Someone is able to study with a textbook, but that same person is not able to do activities when there's literally none available AT ALL. \nMy parents also went to college in China, and I grew up there until half of middle school. I'm not sure how much you know about China nowadays because it's policies are constantly updating to try to give people from poor backgrounds access to good education, such as different score standards for different regions and ethnic minorities (I'm pretty sure it's not without flaw, so don't need to educate me on that). \nI'm really glad that you were able to go to Northwestern. But \"no universities nearby to do research at, nowhere to intern, no mock trial, no model UN, no olympiads of any sort\" isn't even that bad. What about clubs, sports teams, student council, volunteer, number of APs you can take, etc? My current high school also has none of what you said above, and even worse. I can see a lot of people working their hardest with what we have, but my school barely sends anyone to t20s in past graduating classes. \nwhat do you think it's going to be like if such EC was taken into consideration in China? We have one type of students from urban areas doing ECs you mentioned, and another type of students from rural areas literally unable to do anything. I'm not advocating for one-test-determines all for the US because even bad high schools like your high school has some form of ec, but that's not the case for China. \nThat might be why a lot of wealthier parents are sending their kids to places like the US for high school or go to international high schools, because then, they don't compete with others in the same system and can do ec to help them to get into top schools abroad. \nWhat about the ones who can afford to do some ec, but can't afford to go abroad? As far as I know, the colleges in China now also offers early or special admissions similar to EA based on your special talent (such as academic and other special competitions). They also lower admission score standard (by quite a lot) for those who apply as art students (acting, singing, painting, etc...) and athletes. Some top universities offer spots to different high schools, letting the most (academically) well performing students be admitted directly without taking the Gao Kao. Some provinces are also spreading out the gao kao for different subjects into different times of the year and even giving opportunities for retakes. In short, the system is changing to adapt to the changing socioeconomic.",

(Imagine the chaotic roads in Italy along with those small paths between buildings, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like but with gravel roads) The city (in this case referring to ShenZhen), is rlly rlly full of life. Being one of the cities that was developed a bit later, many of the structural designs r more modern, it\u2019s built for comfort.\n\nFood is great dude. Each \u201cprovince\u201dhas their own unique food culture. There\u2019s just so much options that you won\u2019t ever get tired of it (Pizza Hut and KFC r so much better in China imo)\n\nBe prepared to be squished by ppl on the metro, park, etc. Everywhere u go ull see ppl. Ppl r generally quite nice, but if ur going out shopping, it\u2019s better to bring a native friend cuz it\u2019s likely that u WILL get scammed with all the tiny shops along the street. People r also more reserved in their beliefs (although it\u2019s changing) so there\u2019s more things that u can\u2019t do freely in public compared to Western countries.\n\nIf u get a chance, u should visit. 5000 years of history is packed into this country, but bring enough money cuz it\u2019s more expensive than u think.",

          "text": "Well, truly poor people/FGLI do benefit from \"holistic admissions\" because their ability to participate in extracurriculars, take APs, or receive test tutoring is taken into account. I can't speak from experience, but both my parents were FGLI and wound up attending T10s for their undergrad, so there's that.\n\nIt is true that top schools are composed disproportionately of wealthy/upper-class students, since students from those income brackets have access to better education and resources on average. But this isn't exclusive to the U.S; inequity in admissions is an issue in China too. To do well on the GaoKao, you sort of *need* to pay for test prep, and the quality of school districts varies depending on where you live. So switching to a test-based system wouldn't solve the inequity in the U.S system. It would likely make it worse, as test scores alone don't give admissions officers any context regarding your socioeconomic status or the opportunities you had available to you.\n\nTrust me, if you're low-income and from the middle of nowhere, you aren't going to be held to the same standard as an upper-class kid from Princeton (rightfully so, in my opinion). And before anyone asks, I'm personally harmed or at least not a beneficiary of holistic admissions (upper middle-class Asian male in STEM with high test scores) but I still see their benefit. It's definitely not perfect, but it probably is the best system.",

So it \"seems\" that a lot of URM get admissions boosts despite being well-off vs. ORM that are poorer/lower-middle class (which is also debatably a racist POV since it assumes URM aren't capable in their own right of high achievement and held to a lower standard, but that's another issue)\n\nagain, i like holistic admissions in principle, it's just that sometimes it leads to illogical outcomes and doesn't always help the people that truly need it",
