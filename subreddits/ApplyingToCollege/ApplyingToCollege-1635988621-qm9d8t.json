  "title:": "How Important is the Common App Community Disruption portion?",
  "text": "Just submitted my Common App application for a college (ED) a few days ago. I realized that my community disruption (the \"COVID essay\") isn't really as solid as the other essays- additionally, I also mentioned some other stuff in there that wasn't really COVID-related (ie. family deaths, etc.) I'm not sure if this will make or break my chances of getting in. I'm probably just paranoid, but how important is this section? I heard it didn't exist until the last year or so for the Common App. Thank you!",
