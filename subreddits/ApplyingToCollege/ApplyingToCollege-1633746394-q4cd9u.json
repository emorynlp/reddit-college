I'm stressing about my ED and EA apps too which are due in a few weeks. On top of that, I got a 2 out of 20 on a math test. I know it for sure that I got most of the questions correct so I'm pretty sure my math teacher just checked my paper wrong (it was a MCQ test btw and she is notorious for messing grades up). \n\nSo I'm in my hospital bed terribly sick, worried about ED/EA deadlines and missed classes while cursing my math teacher.",

I mean our parents pay like 30k annually and the education we get is literal shit. I learned more from Youtube and individual tutoring than at school. Is that a common thing? Dunno if I'm the only one that feels like this system is fucked. My AP Cal teacher rn doesn't even know what he's teaching and he's fucking proud of it. Like \"I don't know the quotient theorem\" and the bitch is fucking PROUD. I stg one day I'm going to break down and actually stab him or smth. And what's up with all the shitty ass grading? Tbh my school doesn't have anything to put forth so why not just hand out free grades? I know this sounds fucking ridiculous but I'm just saying, if  teachers aint going to teach shit and all they do is solve problems on the boards, at least make our lives less miserable. + Our teacher gets like 6 out of 10 questions wrong when he's solving em and he looks back at his notes and quietly fixes them and after fixing them he acts as if nothing happened and says \"Easy peasy\". At this point, I don't really know if I'm the bitch. Maybe I'm just taking things too seriously. Maybe nowadays teachers are SUPPOSED to not teach shit anymore. Just give out test questions that we didn't learn in class and blame us for not having studied it outside of school. Fuck that's my rant and if someone read it from the beginning to the end, I appreciate ya",

And the other day I found out that one of my friends (17) is pregnant. \n\nAfter overcoming the initial shock I put away ALL school and college-related work to focus 100% of my attention on her and making sure she's okay. We've been able to lay out a plan for her to legally get an abortion without her needing her parents' consent, and we're thankful we don't live in Texas. \n\nI've really had to take a step back this past week to realize what's truly important in life. Life is so much bigger and can be a lot scarier than the college app process. I encourage you all to take a break and check in with a friend you may have lost touch with recently.",

However, Columbia has always been my dream school. I'm questioning whether I should ED there or not. ED often sucks for international students, though. My in-school competition isn't great either: a fencing champion and international olympiad medalist will be applying SCEA to Princeton, and a girl who got into the Columbia fly-in program will be ED-ing there. My ECs are stronger than hers and weaker than his, but I'm not by any chance confident about either of my possibilities.\n\nWhat do you guys think I should do? I'm polishing drafts to supplementals of both schools.",
