If you weren\u2019t from the country and it wasn\u2019t a developing country they might not like it but like both of those are true and also you\u2019re basically from there lol. Don\u2019t worry bro, I know how stressful those applications are and you got this!",

      "text": "I mean \"third-world country\" is generally considered offensive and no longer politically correct, but not to the degree that it would count you out, especially as a first-generation student speaking on a country you have experience with. The real question is what you wrote your essay about and the **context** of the word. Whoever is reading your essay also matters. Overall, it's not worth stressing over this since there's nothing you can do, but definitely change it for the upcoming application",
