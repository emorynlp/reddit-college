  "text": "This is a throw-away account and I am also keeping it vague to keep with community rules. \n\nFirst off, I am extraordinarily inspired by this vibrant community dedicated to succeeding in college and beyond. As a college professor who might end up facing you across the classroom in your first college course next year, I am really impressed already. You are all amazing and I am 100% certain that each one of you will thrive at whatever university is lucky enough to get you. Make sure to relax a little bit throughout this process though, I promise each and every one of you will get through this, regardless of where you end up. For context, I went from a small state school for UG to an Ivy for my postdoctoral training. Where you start is a lot less important than what you do when you get there.  \n\nI'm in my first semester as an assistant professor in STEM at a \"selective private college.\" I have been asked to help coordinate an open house for potential students for my college. Fundamentally, I want to provide these potential students with the useful information/experiences they need to guide their application decisions. To help guide the development of this program, I decided to do some of my own research on the modern college application process.\n\nI have realized that the college search/application process is completely different than when I went through it (late 2000s) and I'm genuinely fascinated by the differences. Social media was in its infancy (facebook only), colleges were not super internet savvy (so limited youtube presence and bare bones websites), and the primary informational method was to get dozens of college mailers everyday from admissions departments. Those fliers were how I learned about colleges and open houses. I can only assume it is different now. Believe it or not, the admissions process can be opaque on the professor side as well. We do open houses and tours, but outside of that, our incoming undergrad classes just kind of show up. It is very different on the doctoral student side though.\n\nWhile attempting to get informed on the undergraduate process now, I came across this subreddit, read some of the posts, and realized that you all are the savviest folks on the planet when it comes to the college search / application process. The amount you have thought and planned around your applications is frankly astounding. \n\nI'd love to flip the script and go back to being a student so I can learn from all of you:\n\n1. What is it like to search for and apply to colleges right now? Feel free to vent if needed, lol. \n2. What caused you, during your search/application process, to attend an open house?\n3. What can I do at this open house to provide tangible, actionable information to potential students in order to help them make a decision whether or not to apply? (I am not interested in doing a \"hard sell\" for the school. I will actually need to teach these students. I'd hate to have a bunch of pissed off students in my classes for the next four years.)\n4. Where do students typically get information on colleges? Are guidance counselors still a thing? Is it all social media? Do you still get mail? \n5. What makes you consider applying to a college? Is it all about the rankings? Do individual professors factor into your decisions to apply/attend a specific school? I have seen a ton of the \"T\" ranking lists on here and then complaints about lack of swag on tours.  \n6. Is there anything different about STEM degree programs vs other disciplines when it comes to the decision making process?\n7. What can faculty do to engage wonderful students like all of you during the process and get you interested in attending our specific universities? If you spent this much time and effort do research to get into college, I can only imagine how good of an undergraduate research assistant you would be in a lab. Seriously, you all are amazing. \n8. Generally, how professors can make the college admissions process easier/more interesting/better overall?\n9. Anything else you think a new prof should think about?\n\nI apologize for the wall of text, feel free to answer any, all, or none of my questions. Lurking on this subreddit the past few days has really opened my eyes to how much I don't know about how this generation of potential students interact with universities during the application process. \n\nBest of luck with your applications, take a deep breath, you are all going to do great. \n\nTLDR: I'm a new prof. The folks on this subreddit are going to amazingly in college. You all know a lot more about the college search/application process than I do. Please answer a few of my questions about the process. Or don't. You aren't in my college class.",

      "text": "IMO, the most useful information you could provide would be some statistics your employer either doesn't have or isn't willing to divulge.\n\nNamely, empower applicants to answer these two questions:\n\n1. How likely is an applicant \"like me\" to be admitted? and\n2. How much do applicants \"like me\" who subsequently enroll usually pay?  (25th/50th/75th percentile)\n\nI'd want \"like me\" defined in terms of residency status (in-state/out-of-state/international), normalized wGPA, test scores and intended major.  For the \"how much do they pay\" question, include FAFSA EFC.  If the school is need-aware for admissions, then include EFC in the \"how likely am I to be admitted\" analysis as well.  Have a second set of tables for students who don't submit test scores.  Exclude athletes, legacies, children of faculty, etc. when building the tables.",

              "text": "Good luck.  :)  I'm suspect it won't be available.  At least, not at the level of detail I'd want.  My complaint with \"the system\" is how difficult it is to assess one's odds of admission and/or expected cost given all the relevant variables.  Financial aid, competitive merit scholarships, differences in the applicant pools to different majors, etc.  Also \"best case\" cost (as opposed to \"expected\") given some schools have large, competitive non-need-based scholarships.\n\nMy goal would be for each school to provide a web page where interested applicants can plug in their characteristics and get back an acceptance odds estimate and 25th/50th/75th percentile cost estimate \\*after\\* all financial and/or merit aid is assessed.\n\nSuppose  I'm a Michigan resident with an EFC of $80k/year, a 1400 SAT and a 4.4 normalized wGPA who wants to major in History.  What are my odds of getting into Michigan given I'm in-state?   What about Harvard?  What about UNC-Chapel Hill, given I'm out-of-state?  What can I expect to pay at at each of these places?",

      "text": "I am the parent of a senior and I also work at a university. I am on both sides of this equation, participating in admissions/prospective student events as a staff member, as well as coaching my own kid through this process. I also have marketing experience, and that is where I see a lot of room for improvement in university outreach and engagement.\n\nOne thing I think is sorely lacking is the humanization of departments. Sure, anyone can hit the university website and read about major requirements, faculty lists, etc. What I really want to see, and what I think would help drive prospective student interest, is vibrant, interactive, UPDATED department website, blog, and social media. Yes, of course you'll continue to issue PRs and articles about research and new technological developments, but also humanize yourselves. Talk about your areas of interest. Make funny tiktok videos of your profs and GA/postdocs in the labs. Host brown baggers or open lunches with a rotating cast of faculty. Don't even make them lunch-n-learns because sometimes those are boring. Just throw out some free food and invite kids to hang. Really get to know your students, and allow them to really get to know you. Make your department accessible. Have a department discord, meme each other, have some good natured fun. Reach out interdepartmentally and co-host a STEM Olympics where faculty and students from departments compete in stuff like titrations, egg drops, etc. Have a Hogwarts house style STEM department thing where you all earn house points during the year and had a big party at the end. Have mini departmental job meet-and-greets where you bring in 3-5 quality employers in the region for an afternoon to have some personal 1:1 time with students. These are just some things off the top of my head, but if you put a real coordinated effort into marketing and public relations, you would have kids beating down your door to become your students. People need community, they like belonging, and they like fun. The academic stuff you do is already super interesting and cool, but the way it's presented to the public and to potential students is boring and stale. Show students that you take care of your people, both colleagues and students, and show them how much you value them by giving them quality events and experiences beyond the typical classroom and research academic experiences, and keep it all documented and interactive on social media. Be the whole package. There are already so many amazing colleges out there. Set yourself apart.\n\nTLDR; up your marketing game. Rearrange your departmental budget to hire a communications graduate student or someone who's savvy enough to make this happen for you.",
