  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m trying to brainstorm extracurriculars, and I know that colleges generally like your activities to have a direction and show passion. My passion is baking so id love to do extracurriculars related to it but need some ideas! I\u2019m gonna start a food blog with my own recipes and food photography and join the baking club at my school. I can\u2019t think of anything else. If any of you have suggestions for other things I could do it\u2019s be so appreciated! Thank you fellow bakers- :)",
