  "text": "To preface, this is just my experience. I am not speaking for everyone. This is not to say that many people do not enjoy their experiences at prestigious institutions. I, however, did not. This post will primarily focus on the negative aspects of my experience. I\u2019m not trying to trash my school, but rather I\u2019m writing this to provide you with more information so that you can better make an informed decision.\n\nI am about to enter my final semester at Cornell. I took a leave of absence during the majority of the pandemic, so I\u2019ve had the privilege of being able to experience both the pre- and post-COVID college experience. In high school, I was just like many of you: ambitious, high-achieving, sociable, and overworked. Early in high school, I set my sights on the Ivy League. There was something strangely appealing about the shining lights that blinded my view when someone spoke about Harvard. It is only now, looking back, that I realize my reasons for wanting to attend a prestigious university were not pure, but rather borne out of insecurity and tying my self-worth to my achievements. \n\nSo when I received a few admissions to the Ivy League, I was ecstatic. Life would finally turn from good to great. All the hard work had paid off, or so I thought. During the period where I contemplated which school to attend, I ignored any warning signs that should have dissuaded me from matriculating. Now, a large part of me feels like one of those \u201clottery horror stories\u201d where they state that they wish they would have torn up the ticket.  \n\nWhen I first got to campus, I was elated to be there. I immediately tried to talk to everyone I could. I was very sociable in high school, so it should certainly be easy for me to make friends here. After all, I was finally surrounded by like-minded people. And that, precisely, is wherein lay the problem. I quickly realized that few people were interested in me, but rather were largely concerned only with themselves. It wasn\u2019t out of malicious intent, but rather the desire for self-success. It continued like this for awhile\u2014me always being the one to initiate conversation. This was soon coupled by an academic stress that was unrivaled to any I had experienced before. There were so many clubs I wanted to join, and such little free time. \n\nI began to fall into substance abuse, which only compounded any existing mental health struggles. I reached out to the mental health services which the university espoused. I was quickly disappointed to see that a school with an endowment worth billions had a mental health service that was seriously lacking. Therapy appointments only lasted 25 minutes, if you were willing to wait the two weeks to get one, that is. The psychiatry waitlist was even worse. \u201cTwo months,\u201d I was told. Running out of medication, I transferred some into the on campus pharmacy. By doing so, I forfeited any remaining refills. I vividly remember meeting with one of the physicians who loudly sighed and attempted to shame me when I opened up about the mental health struggles I was having. Of course, he was my primary care doctor at the clinic, one which Cornell would not let me change. This would come to be the norm, rather than an isolated experience. \n\nIt quickly became apparent that I couldn\u2019t take my concerns to the administration, as student concerns were immediately dismissed. Instead, when formal petitions circulated with the support of the majority of the student body, all we received was a calculated, disingenuous response about how the university would look into the situation and urged us to take advantage of the \u201ctremendous\u201d mental health services available. \n\nI turned to my professors to ameliorate many of my grievances. Some were wonderful, others were not. On the one hand, it was amazing to have the opportunity to learn from Nobel laureates. On the other, my education took a backseat when many of them appeared to be interested only in their own research. \n\nAcademically, from what I have seen with my friends from other, \u201cless prestigious,\u201d institutions, there was little difference in the content we were learning, but rather an unfairly applied grading system that fueled competition and pitted student against student. In sophomore year, I vividly remember having my Calculus 2 formula sheet stolen an hour before the test. \n\nFinancially, it was also a shock. I am very fortunate to have parents that are pretty well-off, however the finances of some of my peers still surprised me. It wasn\u2019t the money that bothered me, but the arrogance that came with it. Students driving branded Lamborghinis was not uncommon; one day I counted 6 G-Wagons. Within days of being at Cornell, I had a guy ask me if my parents would buy me a new BMW for college \u201cif I asked them for one.\u201d He was shocked when I said that they wouldn\u2019t. Months later, I was asked by another student to pay for the alcohol because he \u201conly had $60,000 left in his account.\u201d Campus was no better. I would have random fees appear on my billing account, was charged $5 at a time for barely useable laundry machines, and still cannot figure out why the dining hall charges nearly 20 dollars per meal. \n \nThe university claims to support a diversity of thought, except it does anything but. No, I am not talking about allowing racist, sexist, or homophobic dialogue, but any mildly controversial topic is immediately shut down if one doesn\u2019t adhere to the university\u2019s status quo. For reference, I am extremely central in my beliefs.\n\nFrat parties? Not fun. At least, not here. Cheap beer, being literally body-to-body with drunk strangers, and rampant misogyny. \n\nI guess this is the end. I am appreciate Cornell for being the place that has spurred a time of tremendous, personal growth, but I\u2019m ready to close this chapter of my life. Good luck to all of you in admissions, and please know that a denial does not reflect your self-worth, nor is it a testament to how your college experience will be. Take it from me.",

And they're two of the smartest, chillest people I know. Since Cornell is on the larger side among its peer schools, I'm sure there's a variety of experiences there.",

      "text": "Hey.. I am so sorry you didn't have a good experience. As a highly social person,I can understand your point. When your company is highly driven by self success it always feels like you are out of place because life is not 24/7 grind/study. It's okay and human to lay back/rest and foster personal connections\n\nI also feel like I will be out of place in uni,me being an international student but let's hope for the best hahaha. Good luck op, for grad school. Hope you will find your community there :D",

      "text": "I needed to hear this because I\u2019m a freshman in highschool and I\u2019ve been dreaming about going to Cornell since 7th grade. Im on this sub Reddit way to much that it\u2019s starting to be unhealthy and I think I\u2019ve watched every single \u201chow I got into Cornell\u201d video on YouTube. Im also a legacy which makes it even more stressful from my parents, and honestly I\u2019m doing so many activities I hate so much and I\u2019m taking bc calc which is just so much work all to fit this mold that Ivy Leagues like. My mindset is if I get into Cornell my life is just smooth sailing from then until I\u2019m retired but I\u2019ve come to realize college is what you make of it and some colleges aren\u2019t as good not academically but in terms of enjoyment and how comfortable it is. I really hope you succeed in life too, hopefully I won\u2019t have to have your hardships, but I\u2019m glad you got through this hell hole and appreciate you speaking out.",

          "text": "Thanks for the comment! I can definitely understand the pressure of feeling like you need to get into a certain school, and I imagine that would be especially difficult being a legacy. However, my experience here hasn\u2019t been completely negative. There are certainly many memories that I will always cherish, I just think the negative aspects of the school aren\u2019t talked about enough. I also had the mindset that everything would be great once I made it passed the admissions hurdle. I kind of set myself up for disappointment by believing that. Best of luck to you, and if you would like to know more about Cornell\u2014positive or negative\u2014don\u2019t hesitate to message me!",
