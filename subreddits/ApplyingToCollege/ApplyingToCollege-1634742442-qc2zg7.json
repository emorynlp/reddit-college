  "text": "So I am a second year who is considering transferring from my current college to a few other options. My high school gpa wasn\u2019t great, but so far in college my gpa has been relatively high. The college I currently go to also has a good rep and is known for being a good school, it\u2019s just not a great fit for me personally. I was wondering, if I have a gpa that is .1-.2 below the average to my target schools, but this gpa comes from a good college, so is this weighted more in the application compared to someone getting a good gpa out of high school? What I mean by this is if I have a 3.6-3.7 in college, does this look better in an application compared to students coming out of high school with the same gpa, or are the viewed equally?",
