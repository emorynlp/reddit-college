Why not apply for college if that is what you want.  Some colleges like Drexel are \"coop\" schools where you can work and travel maybe and then take some classes.  GO FOR IT and good luck.  DON\"T get dejected and if you can't get it together for this fall, try to do something you really want to do or get a job and apply for spring admission or admission next fall!  Also, many schools, if not most, are not requiring the SAT.  You can still apply regular admission to most schools till at least January 1 and many of them have admission deadlines after that.  Why",
