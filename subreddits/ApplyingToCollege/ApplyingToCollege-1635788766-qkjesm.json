      "text": "Let's look for reasons not to like some of these:\n\nNYU: really expensive, decent for STEM but probably not worth all that money just for STEM at NYU\n\nUMD: they accept their entire class EA, pretty much, so unless you can apply literally today, this isn't really worth it. But their only supplemental stuff is 5 complete-the-sentence prompts, so you can just do this today easily.\n\nUIUC: again, without priority admission, there's a very low chance for CS/Engineering majors to get in. These essays are a bit more time consuming and UMD, so drop UIUC.\n\nUCs: if you're not from CA, maybe drop these. They give almost zero financial aid to OOS, so you'd be paying a ton of money to go to one of these.\n\nOutside of that, it's hard. You didn't tell us what you're looking for in a school. Do you want to live in/near a city? A college town? In the middle of nowhere? A big school? A small school? A party school? We have no information, so it's kind of hard to give more than this.",

Also, this is a party school.\n\nIf you don't want party schools, drop Vandy, BU, and Penn.\n\nAre there any other preferences you have? Maybe small school vs big school?",
