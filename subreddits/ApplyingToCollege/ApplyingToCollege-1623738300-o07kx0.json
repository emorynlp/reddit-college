If you have a 3.57 GPA and a 1500 SAT, you're trolling asking where you should be going to on Quora. On another hand, the people with experience there usually respond to serious, private questions and messages. Maybe that's just my experience.",

Saw a underage girl ask if she was wrong for coming out against a family member for abusing her because it made everyone in her family upset with her. \nSome person responded with some story about how it's not ok to ruin peoples lives with lies about abuse.\nI called them gross for invalidating a kid without knowing anything about the situation. \nQuora said I was violating their policy. I appealed and said if you think that person is not gross then delete my account yourselves I'm done with you.",
