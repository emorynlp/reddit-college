  "text": "Hi A2C! In Common App, I have my highest ACT composite score listed as a 30 (since that was a highest I got on a single test), but all of the colleges I'm applying to take superscores (which for me, is a 32).\n\nI was planning on sending my superscores through the ACT website, so my question is: Would the colleges I'm applying to pay more attention to the 30 that I listed on common app, or the 32 I sent in via the website?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: If it means anything, I entered my all-time high scores where it asked about your highest in each ACT subject individually, even though the scores were from different tests. So... maybe that solves the discrepancy...?",
