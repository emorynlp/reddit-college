  "text": "I\u2019ve been practicing my hacking and manipulation abilities since 8th grade. I would say I spend at least 15 hours a week, and of course, the entirety of the year. I was wondering If it could fit as \u201cWork (Paid)\u201d? Since I\u2019ve made close to 45,000 USD due to my advanced skills. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering if it\u2019s a good idea to write about it in my essay? Maybe AO\u2019s would feel pressured to accept me. I mean, none of them would like to get doxed, right?\n\nI\u2019ll be more than grateful if anybody leaves a recommendation or a comment. Please don\u2019t leave negative comments. I have your IP.",

I also know that your address is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_\\_ \\_. I'd love to come meet you in person, but I'd prefer to come meet you as an incoming freshman to \\_\\_\\_ university/college. Either way I plan on meeting you, but I think we'd both prefer it if it was as a student, so plz consider accepting me. \n\nOh, I almost forgot, congratulations on the announcement! Your wife looks radiating, especially while holding your newborn son. Samuel, isn't it? Blue eyes and born 8 pounds 5 ounces? I hope he has a long, happy life.",
