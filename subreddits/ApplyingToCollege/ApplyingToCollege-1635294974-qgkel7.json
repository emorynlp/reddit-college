  "text": "\nI'm deciding on schools to apply right now and I really like Cornell. I'm wondering if I should apply ED, but the only uncertainty I have is if it was worth the money over a school like U of M (in-state tuition). I was wondering what Cornell could offer that could justify it's price and I thought this was the best sub to find out.",
