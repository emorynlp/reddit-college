  "text": "For context I\u2019m a senior and applying ED Brown. I\u2019ve played 3 years of varsity soccer. But I\u2019m honestly totally burnt out of the sport. The season is about to start and I really don\u2019t want to play, genuinely the ONLY reason I would is to put 4 years instead of 3 on my college app. Do I suck it up and suffer through it, or can I not play this year? \ud83d\ude29",
