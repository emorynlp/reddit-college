I\u2019m taking a dual enrollment course at community college right now; if I get a C as my final grade in the class, could I possibly be rescinded from UC or CSU schools when I send my transcripts once I get accepted?\nThe class I\u2019m taking isn\u2019t required for me to fulfill my high school graduation credits, just a random class I\u2019m taking",
