  "text": "I'm curious, what are your safety schools? \n\nI'm not looking to go to a T20, but most of the colleges I want to go to have a 15-25% acceptance rate, and, while I'd like to think of myself as a good student and a good fit for those schools, there's no guarantee for anything. (Mostly been looking at smaller liberal arts colleges.) While there's always my state school, I'm not keen on going there. So, A2C, what do your safeties look like?",

      "text": "A true safety will be a school with an acceptance rate well over 50% that is certain to be affordable.\n\nAcceptances from schools with early/rolling admission also become safeties once that acceptance is in hand, as long as it's affordable. If a student has no acceptances in hand that are affordable before January deadlines, it would be important to identify true safeties (with acceptance rates well over 50%) and add them to the list. Check deadlines - some might even have late deadlines, so that you could wait to see your other results before submitting the true safety app.",
