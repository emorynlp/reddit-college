  "title:": "Forwent my parents' opinions and just applied ED to my dream school!!",
  "text": "Went to private school all my life, screwed up my first two years of high school grade-wise (nothing too bad, all As/Bs, but my school is so competitive that that's around bottom 10-15%), was still encouraged to apply to Cornell. Wrote the supplements over and over, lamented, etc. Knew I wouldn't be happy there, especially not bindingly, so I changed my ED school four days before the deadline!!\n\nI've always dreamed about Northeastern (favorite city, dream double major already set up, best size, favorite d1 sport, amazing student life, i know the professor personally, and they love my HS), and I applied!! We have never had an ED from my school, but the EA stats show kids with lower GPAs (still bottom 10-15%!) getting in, so my counselors are thrilled and optimistic!!\n\nCan't wait for December!!!!",
