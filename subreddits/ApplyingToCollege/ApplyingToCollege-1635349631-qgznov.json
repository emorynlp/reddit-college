  "text": "So I just finished my UChicago Supplement (the extended essay) for ED1 due in 5 FREAKING DAYS! and it comes as 1100 words... Now I know the website says there is no stRicT wORd liMiTS, but i mean like really? really? will they rEAlLy read beyond 650? \n\nSo for my peace of mind (and perhaps yours too, if you are applying as well) how bout my UC Hicago ED1 folks share how long their extended essay is?\n\nThanks!!!!",

      "text": "Unless every single word is gripping and crucial to the integrity of the essay, cut it down. They might read beyond 650 (or at least skim beyond 650), but you\u2019re at nearly double that. I\u2019d go for roughly <800 at the most.",
