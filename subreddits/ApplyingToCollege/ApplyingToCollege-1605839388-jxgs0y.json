  "text": "Hi everyone, I hope all of you are doing well!\n\nWith u/maximus284284 and u/collegeappcc's amazing and wonderful posts recently [(maximus284284)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jmnnl3/thoughts_from_someone_who_was_rejected_from_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[(collegeappcc)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jmw7yu/congratsgl_co_2021_now_comes_the_hard_part_which/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and many other amazing past A2C members coming back to this subreddit to share their experiences, I wanted to make a post quickly to leave behind some tips outside the application sphere.\n\nI'm a current college freshman, and I thought I should share this because I know that some students applying to college probably currently have some questions that I had back when applying.  I do want to apologize in advance about how incredibly, incredibly long this is, but I hope this helps someone, brings some comfort, and that it lets you know that you aren't alone because I know that feeling of forlornness is tough.  This is a story I have considered sharing on this subreddit many times, but I wasn't sure if I should proceed with it.  However, I think it's time that I do given everything going on lately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start from the beginning and sum it up, I ended up getting an extremely rare chronic skin illness (less than around 3000 diagnosed) in my freshman year of high school and didn't discover a proper diagnosis of what it was until the summer before my sophomore year.\n\nThe truth is, I wish I could tell everyone that I dealt with my illness extremely well and that I overcame it like a champ, but if I'm being honest, I didn't handle it well at all.  At first, I tried to deny that I had it.  When symptoms started arising the fall of freshman year, I pretended it wasn't a problem.  When I finally met a dermatologist, and it was apparent he was giving information we probably shouldn't follow, I continued to trust him anyway despite my parents' skepticism solely with the intentions of ignoring this illness was affecting me.\n\nWhen things started to get really bad to the point where it hurt for me to live, I woke up from bed daily full of blood, and I had to wear more than one shirt wherever I went because the blood would drench the shirt I was wearing initially.  A lot of my feelings started to become worse when I started to fall out with multiple classmates of mine, especially when two of my close friends during a sleepover wrote on my face while I was asleep, took pictures of me, even made me chew on pencils in the night, and tried to share these pictures with my other friends.  To top it all off, it hurt a lot when people touched any areas I had scars, and so when others at school would touch me or slap me on the shoulder or on the back, I would jump suddenly and scream out at pain, which always hurt the person who touched me.  I always would feel guilty about it because I knew I reacted terribly and meanly to a classmate of mine.  I still feel guilt about it to this day.  I continued to swim as well even though it was painful for me to swim as the scabs would sting.  I started to wonder if all of this was happening to me because deep down, I was a bad person, and I deserved it.\n\nWhen it was apparent that it wasn't getting better, my parents secretly took me to receive urgent treatment.  Thankfully, the treatment helped the symptoms start to go away late summer before sophomore year and helped me survive, but the pain of the treatment never seemed to fully go away.  Later when things got hostile with my initial dermatologist, my family and I switched to a new one, and we slowly found recovery and even receiving a diagnosis.  However, my illness left behind permanent scars all over my neck, back, and chest.  I was reminded of the painful treatment and my disease everywhere I went, especially when I looked in the mirror or swam.  Since I am a guy, and I had to swim shirtless for swim team, I would find that I was also reminded of it by other swimmers or whenever I looked down at myself.  It ended up causing a lot of problems for me, and I felt awful when people told me I was ugly or harassed me over the fact that I had physical scars.  I particularly remember a time I asked out my crush after swim practice and two guys from an opposing swim team walking past me started mocking the way I spoke and remarked that I was too ugly to ever be with someone as amazing as her.\n\nBut the more time passed on, it hit me: this illness truly devastated me mainly because I let it end up defining who I was, and when my illness stopped me from doing things I wanted to do, I lamented that I couldn't do anything and believed it was the reason I couldn't do anything.  I blamed myself for it all, telling myself that I must have it because I am a bad person.  That was when I realized that I was living time backwards rather than living time forwards, and if I was always stuck traveling time backwards, I would never have a chance to travel time forwards.  It was like a book, no ability to write the next chapter if I kept trying to edit a chapter already written.\n\nThe only way I could move time forwards was to stop pretending that any of this didn't affect me and to acknowledge that this illness and the effects that came from it.  It was to accept that this was going to be a part of my physical identity and my life, and that maybe I wouldn't be the same person I was before the illness but also that maybe I wouldn't want to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here are some words I want to underscore in case you need to hear it from someone other than yourself:\n\n* It's okay to have scars.\n* It's okay if you don't feel perfect.\n* It's okay if there's a million things you haven't done.\n* It's okay to wish things turned out differently.\n* You may not feel okay right now, but it does not mean you will never feel okay again.\n* It's okay to accept this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComing from someone who applied last year, I realize how difficult it can be to wait for the decisions to release and how energy-draining it can be, especially since you all have dedicated so much time to waiting for the decisions to release.  I also know that in the event of rejection in the winter from your EA/ED applications (or even a deferral), it can really hurt because it can feel very personal.  I totally get where you all are coming from.  When I was rejected from Brown University Early Decision, my dream school since freshman year of high school, I was really saddened by this.  Similarly, I felt sad when I later was unable to attend Wesleyan University, one of my top choice schools because it was too expensive for me to attend.  In fact, if I'm being really honest with you, I still today am sometimes sad I was rejected from Brown and wonder what could have been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut just so you know, you are a part of this giant, amazing universe, the cinematic and literary universe of Life, and you're a character in the process of becoming.  You're the main character of your story, and you will go on to be a cameo, a mentor, a best friend, and such in other people's stories.    These scars may be permanent, but the effects of these are not.  These scars may have happened and what has happened may have happened, but the choices you make the future have not.  You may not feel okay right now, but it does not mean you will never feel okay again.  Maybe these feelings will come back one day, but it means they can just as easily go away again one day.  Like a protagonist, you will go through character development, finding yourself in a new life every single day, dying as the 17 year old, 345-day old self one night and waking up as the 17 year old, 346-day old self the next morning, wearing thousands of different faces, thousands of different minds, and thousands of opportunities.\n\nSo in the infinite amount of years to come, there will never be another A2C with the same people and the same stories, just like how there will never be another you, and if any university that rejects you cannot realize how wonderful you are, then that is their mistake and not yours, because when they claim that they are conducting all sorts of \"research\" to discover more about our world, lives, and identities, and what they fail to realize is that they've actually been searching for you all along for you are the anomaly, statistical miracle, and wonder universities have wanted in their \"research\" or inquiries, the one missing piece that creates the community they could be.  So, I hope you know that the wonder you exhibit lives on, following you every which way you go, because what makes us all similar is how unique each of us are, and every time someone meets you, they are about to meet someone with so much grit, so much wonder, and so much to offer to this world.  And I know that it might sound cheesy, but I mean that earnestly.  I mean, how can I not mean it so honestly when it's so true that you are awesomeness?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!  I truly hope you all get into your top choice schools.  You got this, and go some of your awesomeness off.  However, in the deep unfortunate scenario that your desired dream does not result, I hope all of you all play remarkable protagonists in the stories you all tell, and that the only person who can act in that role and give a compelling performance is you and only you!\n\nAnd to my fellow friends suffering chronic illness, I hope you know that your story is valuable and that your feelings are valid.  \n\nThis is a quote from one of my favorite musical artists, Sleeping at Last, but I wanted to share it with you all because I think it's something you all should hear:\n\n>If only you knew  \n>  \n>The sunlight shines a little brighter  \n>  \n>The weight of the world's a little lighter  \n>  \n>The stars lean in a little closer  \n>  \n>All because of you  \n>  \n>I want to see  \n>  \n>You lift your chin a little higher  \n>  \n>Open your eyes a little wider  \n>  \n>Speak your mind a little louder  \n>  \n>'Cause you are royalty  \n>  \n>This is your kingdom  \n>  \n>This is your crown  \n>  \n>This is your story  \n>  \n>This is your moment  \n>  \n>Don't look down  \n>  \n>You're ready, born ready  \n>  \n>And all you gotta do  \n>  \n>Is put one foot in front of you  \n>  \n>Our ceiling is your floor  \n>  \n>And all you gotta do  \n>  \n>Is put one foot in front of you  \n>  \n>If only you knew\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day!",

A lot of people have commenter saying how it's an amazing post and it truly is but I want to add on to what you have to say.\n\nI remember one day my mom got a WhatsApp video which looked a lot like one of those chainmail annoying kind of things. It sorta was but it had much more depth to it. It was about this ancient bowl making technique (can't remember which country it was from) where when a bowl breaks, you fix it by getting all the pieces together and filling up the gaps with sand/liquid/some type of glue to hold it together. Almost everytime the new bowl ended up being much prettier and mesmerizing than the original one. I think the same wisdom applies here. \n\nYour scars make you strong. They make who you are. The scars don't make you an outcast. They are part of who you are and who you are is a beautiful person. Embracing them can be very difficult but in almost every scenario, you end up being grateful for going through them. I still have some scars of my past which I haven't dealt with yet and they occasionally haunt me. But the  ones I have embraced have shaped my thinking and my personality. Try to see the bigger picture and find a silver lining",

Just two weeks ago I had surgery to remove a brain tumor and I\u2019m struggling with accepting the affects of the tumor and it\u2019s removal. We have very different conditions but your words really struck me. Though I can empathise with some of it. I naturally form keloids and my nerves like to become hypersensitive where any sensation, even just wind, is really painful so I really understand how frustrating such a situation can be. It\u2019s really hard to like your body and it can feel like it betrayed you. \n\nI\u2019m so incredibly sorry that you internalised your scars and illness. That\u2019s a really painful mentality that\u2019s incredibly hard to escape. I\u2019m so proud of you that you were able to overcome it and realise that it wasn\u2019t a punishment or karma and that you don\u2019t deserve any disorder and that it doesn\u2019t define you. \n\nIt\u2019s especially hard when others don\u2019t always respond well towards people who are \u2018different\u2019. I\u2019m not in the exact same boat but it\u2019s similar enough. Been called a monster, abomination, etc.. I *know* how much that messes with you and I\u2019m just elated that you haven\u2019t let them stop you. It really gives me hope. \n\nIdk I\u2019m just emotional and rambling but I hear you. Thank you for sharing it was inspirational and made me feel less alone. And that someone like me can make it.",

Good luck with your junior year and everything else coming into your future sincerely.  I hope you know that when you say things like this, you are never rambling to me.

I can't relate to your specific situation but I dealt with a lot of personal hardship and injuries throughout my time in high school and it all feels weird that its coming to an end.

I can tell after this year I'm not totally sure what I want to do with this gift of life I have been given and I know I don't feel ready to be cast off into the sea of higher education and adulthood. This past year everything seems so disconnected and honestly I feel like I'm just riding the wave until it's over, but it's things like this that allow me to see that light at the end of the tunnel.",

In all seriousness though, thank you for continuing to uplift and empower the people around you, not just in this subreddit but in all the communities you're in.

Please don't let your past undermine your present happiness. The people who hurt you before are missing out and are probably just jealous of how you still manage to keep a smile on your face despite all the obstacles you've faced. You deserve to be happy, and I'm sure everyone in this subreddit and people who know you can attest to this! \n\nAlso, we all have scars, inside and out. Whether it be broken bones or broken hearts, the manifestation of our scars are testaments of our inner strength \u2013 testaments that we really, truly lived. To you and everyone who may be reading this (albeit a bit late), your scars should be simply be reminders of times when life tried to break you but failed. They are markings of times when your character was shaped and developed. I'd say wear them with pride.\n\nAll the best.",
