If you google coalition app deadline time, you find:\n\n>When a college specifies an application closing date, this means the application closes at 11:59pm  Pacific Time on that date. Applications can only be submitted until 11:59pm Pacific Time on the day of the deadline.\n\n[https://www.mycoalition.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004845933-Time-zone-for-application-deadlines](https://www.mycoalition.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004845933-Time-zone-for-application-deadlines)\n\n(As a general matter, regardless of the time zone issue, a deadline is not the day before the deadline.)",
