  "text": "I've been so focused on essays that I completely forgot about the transcripts thing, is it me who has to request them through Parchment or is that something my counselor does? Do colleges even request them right now or is that later on with mid-year and second semester grades? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm the first one in my family doing this and I am very much confused D:",
