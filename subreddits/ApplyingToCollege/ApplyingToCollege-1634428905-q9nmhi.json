      "text": "They will ask normal stuff, but you still gotta be prepared. \"If you could go to any time stamp in history, when and why?\" This question gets asked a LOT. Try to think of a unique answer to this. Try to think up of some really unique or maybe different thing about you which never comes up, cuz they usually ask \"Is there anything which didn't come and and you want to tell us about?\". Will most probably ask about the greatest challenge you faced and your greates triumph. Rest will be normal easy Ques. Also, DON'T ASK ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD HAVE JUST LOOKED UP ON THEIR WEBSITE. Look up unique programs offered by them, ask about them. Ask about their experiences about something you're interested in if they're an alumni or a current student. Try to ask follow up questions from their answers. And do a little research about your interviewer before it starts. And don't be nervous, you'll be totally fine. Interviews rarely have that big an effect on any application.",

      "text": "My biggest tip is that if you ask questions at the end (which you should definitely do), respond to their answers with a reflective/intrigued answer. \n\nBy this I mean that if you were to ask **\"What's something you tried for the first time at \\_\\_\\_ University?\"**\n\nAnd they were to respond with a lengthy response about something they are really passionate about, don't answer them with **\"Cool thanks!\"**\n\nInstead, try to engage with them and say something like **\"Wow, that's so interesting! I love the sound of that, I really want to try lots of new things in college and \\_\\_\\_ sounds perfect!\"**\n\nInterviewers are SUPER passionate about their school, so it's good to match their enthusiasm and excitement, even if their answer to your question isn't that interesting.",

      "text": "I promise that we're all pretty nice! There's a lot of misconceptions about AOs (we're not approachable, intimidating, gatekeepers of higher education, etc), but many of us got into the field because we love talking to students and are genuinely nice people. So don't be too nervous, don't forget to ask questions (my biggest pet peeve is when students ask zero questions), and let your personality show as much as you can.",
