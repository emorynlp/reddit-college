  "text": "Their website states that they do not consider test scores when admitting people but u have the option to submit it. Then they only view test score of rejected applicants and may accept them if it\u2019s a strong score. In test optional people who submit have an advantage while in completely test blind people who worked hard and got good score are at a disadvantage as their efforts would get ruined. I wish all colleges do the same thing as udub. It helps ppl who have both good or bad sat scores",

      "text": "I suspect the net effect of this system is roughly the same as what exists at other test-optional schools.\n\nIf they admit 90 students test-blind then pick another 10 from the set of rejected applications (on the basis of test scores), then those 90 students had to clear a higher bar to get accepted than if all 100 spots had been filled w/o looking at test scores.\n\nSimilarly, if they were test-required, then some number of high-scores students would be admitted to who are currently being filtered out by the system them have in place.",
